He is not interested in commuting, and would like to live in the meatpacking district. The company he works for is not known for paying well, but paying a livable wage. For example the average nationwide is $62,000/yr. This lateral move would be a step in the right direction for him because he would like to move up the ranks in the workplace one day however, he would also need to make a livable wage in New York. Basically, the move to NYC would mean he wouldn’t have to wait to become a district manager longer. Another concern that my friend has is asking for that livable wage, considering that it might be close to what his new boss would make and that would create an uncomfortable dynamic in the workplace. What advice could you offer?"

I've worked about 2 weeks so far, and I absolutely hate it. 

I've never worked with kids before and always thought I never had an interest in them, but I decided I should try this out because I love the school system the care facility works with and I knew the director/lead educator of the facility. So far, out of the 8 shifts I've had (all about 3-5 hours, part-time work), I've cried after every single shift. I know starting a new job can be overwhelming and emotional sometimes, but I don't think I should be feeling this way. 

To be completely frank, the kids are really difficult. My coworker said they are the worst behaved group she's worked with and she's been in childcare for 5+ years. 

I get some education out of this job which I'm currently working on, so I know I will finish that. But I'm already planning that after I'm done the course I need to be a level 1 ECE (early childhood educator), I will be leaving before summer camps start up. 

I just need some advice on what I should do in terms of planning for the next 2 months (that's how long it'll take to finish this course) and what I should say to my employer. I've never left/quit a job before (my last job was eliminated by covid and before that I wasn't rehired for a summer job). 

Any and all advice is welcome. Please help, I'm young (24f) and need guidance."

The office manager seemed like she liked me a lot and she complimented me on certain things. The interview lasted around 30 minutes maybe a bit longer and she had me speak to the regional manager as well. Afterwards she had me shadow another employee to see how the work is and she explained to me everything with the software used. We got along really well. The manager told me she’d call me today but never did which is making me nervous about the job. I also texted the phone screening interviewer thanking her for her time and she said she heard great things about me from the manager. Did I get the job or not I’m loosing my mind haha.  It’s a great job with great hours and pay as well as a short commute.
2,2023-03-31,Best strategy for negotiating job offer?,u/Character-Archer2616,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1286a2n/best_strategy_for_negotiating_job_offer/,jobs,"Hey r/jobs, I'm working in a contract-to-hire role, so I am preparing to negotiate for when I am brought on as an employee. I am looking for the most strategic way to negotiate the following three things:

1: Higher pay. My employer has communicated that I will receive my desired salary when I start full time.

2: Part-time WFH. My boss is very much about everyone being in the office, but 8 hours a day is highly draining for me, more so than most as an autistic person. I like going to the office and would prefer hybrid to 100% remote but 8h in-person is not sustainable for me. I would strongly prefer to avoid disclosure or the ADA accommodations route because in reality that puts a target on my back.

3: Higher base salary instead of a year-end bonus. I believe most people at my company accept the bonus, and I know someone in my department who was also in contract-to-hire was offered a contract with a bonus opposed to the higher salary she initially asked for. Although it is a generous bonus, I know a higher salary is the better option.

It feels like a lot to ask for at once, so I want to prioritize and come up with the best-possible strategy for getting all three. What works, what doesn't, what are employers most or least amenable to, what are good arguments and counter arguments? Thank you."

I interviewed for an administrative management position at a very prominent IVY league institution and the interview process was extremely odd. 

Applied mid January and began interviewing mid February. Was asked in the initial interview if I would consider interviewing for the same title in a different department alongside interviewing for the original position I applied for. I interviewed for both and position 2 ( the one I didn't initially apply for) stated they were highly interested and wanted to move forward with me as a candidate so I obliged and provided my references. References were required to complete skill survey and I was notified that my supervisor would be contacted after I received a contingent offer. Skill survey was completed mid March and my manager was contacted a week and a half after without a contingent offer being sent my way. My supervisor said it went well and 2 weeks later (today) I was notified they moved forward with a different candidate. Maybe I need a place to vent but what in the heck happened here ? There's 5 positions with this same title in this school that have been posted since Feb 1st."

Nearly every 6 months to 1 year I get laid off. I do my research on the companies, the job, and the economy and it doesn't seem to matter. Instead, I have been literally taking the first job handed to me just to make money which I then save a gigantic load of before I inevitably get laid off again. This has saved me from having big financial burdens when this does happen.

But the stress and depression of having to constantly look for another position is weighing on me heavily. I think it may be time to rethink my life a bit. I took a bit of a sabbatical and will return from my travels soon. I am not sure how to go about looking for another position now.

I have already swapped careers once when I was 23, but now I am thinking about doing it again. This time though, I have many more years under my belt and still need to make a good enough salary to live. How do I go about a career change in which I will be changing what I do, but not necessarily changing my salary too much?

I am also thinking about possibly looking abroad for work and freelancing/consulting as well. I am currently single with no kids. My parents hate the idea of me leaving my state but I am willing to do what I must to be happy. Any advice is appreciated.

Edit: Previous jobs are all in the marketing realm. I specifically work in Martech for multiple types of industries. My companies come from technology, entertainment, agency, and telecommunications.

I've been on a job search since October last year. It was slow at first; I was fte but realized my job was on a dead path with the possibility of being fired. I had a couple of things that I wanted - similar pay to where I was, remote work, and a simple application process.

I stuck to my guns and made the best of my work situation. As time went on, I got more desperate and started to look at my ""requirements."" I had done all I could do, even applying for jobs at my old company where I still have lots of friends and was a high performer. I exhausted my networking capabilities. I'm still baffled - I was told by multiple hiring managers, that I talked to directly via LinkedIn, as we had worked together in the past and it was a good relationship, that they instructed talent acquisition to reach out to me for an interview. I never got a single call for over 12 applications where I was an ideal candidate with references from the company. I even emailed HR to confirm I was eligible for rehire and they said I was. 

I got fired two weeks ago after being put on a PIP that had no way to be measured/achieved. I filled out unemployment for the first time in my life. I know what I'm worth but I need a job, so decisions were coming up quickly about what I was open for. I was very close to just applying for all jobs in my field, regardless of remote, accepting major pay cuts, etc. I felt so defeated. What was the point in networking? What was the point in leaving companies on good terms? What was the point of kissing AND busting ass after being put on a bullshit PIP at a job I considered a sinking ship? Maybe I'm not as good as I think. Maybe I need to reset my expectations.  But then, I got an offer!

Anyways, in the end what ended up landing me a job were reputable recruiters with account managers working with companies. They got me interviews and I did the rest. Yesterday, I received an offer for the company I most wanted - in fact, a company I've wanted to work with for years but never got an interview when applying directly. When informing other recruiters out of courtesy, I was told by one that I was the top candidate and I would likely have an offer by today. I gave them time today just in case, but they didn't get it to me in time. I formally accepted the first offer and I start in a week! Fully remote, with a good company, a pay bump, and I didn't really have an application process.

So I guess what I'm saying is, keep plugging along guys. It takes a while. But as long as you are positive, realistic, and enthusiastic, something will pan out."

I also wonder if they'd contact me themselves if they were interested, since they have my previous application on file, but I don't know if that's a thing companies (actually schools in this case) do. On the other hand I'm also thinking maybe I didn't get rejected because my interview or qualifications were bad, they probably had a better candidate but that doesn't mean I wouldn't be a good fit, so it could make sense to apply again. I've also gained a lot of experience specifically relevant for this position during this current school year since the interview so that might make a difference. What should I do?"

There's no way people can be this fulfilled when the jobs were;

Ex.
""Firefighter"" %7-%37 of firefighters qualify to be diagnosed with PTSD and 58% of firefighters report binge drinking episodes
""Physician"" 300-400 doctors commit suicide each year which is double the general population 
""Nurse"" 1 in 18 nurses experience suicidal ideation in their first year of work
""Teacher"" 50% burnout in 5 years, and check out the r/Teachers subreddit for more insight to how happy they are (I left the profession after 1.5 years)

Some jobs with high satisfaction rate, such as speech pathologist, physical therapist, and most QA, software, and InfoSys jobs were listed, but they are either incredibly high paying or incredibly left-brained so it makes sense certain people would find happiness in analytical or remote work.

Where can we find actual job satisfaction data that reflects how people in the profession really feel about working in that field long-term? It seems like every person I talk to reports toxicity, workplace abuses, and burnout in their field. I just want to find happiness. Why are all jobs customer service or mental health nightmares?"

I am a high school senior who is looking to commit to university.

I was accepted to UC Berkeley for their industrial engineering program, and was also accepted to the University of Minnesota for their computer science program.

Berkeley's engineering school is extremely selective, and is very well regarded and prestigious in the industry. However, I do not know much about the scope of industrial engineering and job prospects in the future, especially with the rise of AI and automation.

CS seems like a better degree at the current date and seems to have higher paying opportunities with more resistance to AI and automation, and UMN has a solid program for CS.

However, UC Berkeley is extremely prestigious and well-regarded for their engineering and STEM degrees.

I do not know what to do in this case. UC Berkeley is the second best engineering school in the country. However, I will be studying industrial engineering there, while even though U Minnesota is not as well regarded as UC Berkeley, they are offering me a computer science degree.

Both schools cost me the exact same since financial aid evens out the cost of both schools, so cost is not a matter of concern here.

I am fine doing either degree, since both degrees are great, and any engineering degree in general has great opportunities for graduates. However, computer science seems to have higher-paying jobs than industrial engineering, and is more specialized and resistant to AI and automation than industrial engineering.

Which school should I commit to: UC Berkeley for industrial engineering or U Minnesota for computer science?"

I've struggled with a lot of aspects of it. It's a start up, so I've been expected to do a lot of things outside of what I expected of my job role, and take on a lot more responsibility than I'm used to.

After a very rocky last few months, I was told late last week that I'm being moved from my current role. My new role is similar, but with a lot less responsibility.

I have very mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, this new role is probably better suited to my skillset. On the other, I feel utterly humiliated and incredibly upset that I've essentially failed to cope, after months of training and help given to me, to keep up.

There's about 20 people in my team and they've all managed to keep up (we all do the same role just for different parts of the company). It's just me that's struggled. Or at least struggled to the point that I've been forcefully ousted.

To make matters worse, my replacement is someone in my team, not a new hire. I only found out it was her on Friday, and I'm expected to handover to her on Monday. I'm not upset with her, I know this wasn't her fault and she's probably been just as blindsided by this development as I was, but I don't know how I'm going to face her next week. I can already envision myself being short with her and possibly even passive aggressive. I know that's not fair to her but I'm so in my feelings right now I'm not sure how to deal with it. 

I'm incredibly temped to quit on Monday. I won't, because the job market is terrible and I have bills to pay. But I just can't deal with how embarrassing it's going to be when the official announcement is made. They'll sugar coat it as I'm being moved into an ""exciting new role she's sure to thrive in"" but everyone will know it's because I failed.

I guess the other big reason is that I'm pushing 30. I'm not some clueless 18 year old, I should be able to do what's expected of me in a job. And my replacement is 22. It doesn't feel great. 

I'm trying to get all my feelings out now at the weekend but it's tough. I guess I'm asking how I can make sure I stay professional about all this? How do I now work with someone who is effectively taking my job? We're not close or anything, but I like her but now I feel betrayed by her, which is stupid because this wasn't her decision. I'm just all over the place right now."

i recently had my performance review and lack thereof basically my boss screwed me over. since being under her boss, she has been very helpful and supportive but this whole review cycle it is making me feel undervalued. in my evaluation she ranked me as meet expectations and then when we got on the call she said I’m sorry I should have rated you exceed expectations which I agreed with her and said I was confused as to why she gave me that rating. As I clearly hit all of my goals and did more than just hit them but went above and beyond on them. after just going through that and then her mentioning that with the rate I’m going I could be at the next level next year it makes me feel like it could be fluff to make me stay at the company when I will be graduating with my MBA this spring so I could go find somewhere to work elsewhere.
fast forward to asking for a raise she gave me my merit increase and I wasn’t even able to ask for a number bc she said next year is when I could get a significant raise and promotion. I totally get that so I asked her to give me a better understanding of salary growth at my company as it’ll help me feel better supported at the company and she said typically employees receive a 3% annual merit increase which now I’m like I get that but I haven’t gotten any compensation review since being at the company for a year and a half and I’ve accomplished a lot. after she gave me that insight of the amount employees typically receive, is it worth just sending over the amount I’m seeking or I’d like a compensation review after further consideration of what we discussed, etc? I’m not trying to create issues between the relationship of my boss and I but like it can’t help me feel as though she isn’t advocating for me?"

My role was previously up for redundancy at my current role, which lead me to look for work elsewhere. I was offered a job role elsewhere, which had more responsibilities that I did not feel were reflected in the wage, but I also learnt I was no longer at risk for redundancy, so I turned it down rather than discuss it further. 

They told me to let them know if I’d changed my mind and it’s been a few weeks and I’ve seen they’ve just posted a new advertisement for the same role. How would I go about contacting them to discuss how I’d be interested, but for more money than initially offered? In the interview they asked me my current wage and I told them so I feel like they’ve low-balled me because of this. I would only want to offer the extra 1000 or 2 to accept, which would take me to 25K.

I'm a well established person in my smaller city and industry. I have experience on several national boards and a couple local boards. 


The only other similar industry company in my small city has an open position that is (honestly) a step down for me. However, I'm very interested in joining the organization, so I applied. I'd like to note that I am friends with several of the board members involved in the organization. 


I went through the phone interview. Three weeks after that they scheduled a zoom call interview. I prepped like mad for it - I even went through a training on the software they use. 


It's been two weeks, and I've heard nothing except the president of the board texting to say she 'owes me a phone call.' (They said they wanted to hire asap and I would hear from them by the end of that week - lest you think I'm being impatient). 


I've already pretty much accepted I didn't get the job. But how frustrating is it that I'm not even contacted about it?! I put in all this work. It just seems so rude. 


Is this normal? Am I expecting too much? I've been at the job search for a long while and I'm getting frustrated."

AI art is making artists absolete and making art a Hobby instead of something you can profit off of. It's only gonna get worse from here on out. Now AI is making itself into the music industry by replicating peoples voices. Not only is this bad but I really don't see a good in this type of AI. This voice replicating AI could destroy one's career just by making them say something they've never really said. The music corporations are actually combating the issue but who's to say they won't use the technology themselves? Then for my dream job which is coding and working with computers. The AI itself may not replace professional workers in the computer industry but it'll definitely replace people like me who will eventually be junior developers. It's sickening. This AI may not replace people in the next 5yrs but definitely reduce and render alot of people unemployed in the next 10. Not only has this caused me fear but it's destroying alot of people's mental health. Its crazy how some people who were unfortunate to live in this time have went to art schooling or practicing music for so long just for ai to come along and basically render their time spent useless. AI is getting out of hand and the more we depend on it the more it replaces us. We ourselves are scared to be replaced yet we are replacing ourselves. I know we won't be able to get rid of this kind of AI and it'll only keep growing but it's honestly scary how many industry's will be worked on by AI as this trend keeps growing."

I make less than a living wage for my state. They have been pretty dismissive of me and act as if they don’t value my position (they’ve been late with my pay, forget to add me to important meetings, have paid me half of my check and forgot to pay the rest). I figured if they don’t value this position I should find someplace else that does so I decided to put in my resignation letter. 

I gave it directly to my supervisor who was disappointed and said they could try and talk to the partners to get me a better role but he respected my position. Next was the “boss” who also tried to convince me I could stay with them and that he “was just about to discuss with everyone that I needed a permanent position with a higher wage”. Overall he was confused, despite knowing how they have messed up with me in the past, but accepted my decision and gave me well wishes. The last “manager” who handles payroll came into my office and closed the door, he walked up to me and said “what the fuck was that?” I didn’t know what to say, we don’t have a work relationship, I barely talk to this guy. He tried to tell me the others don’t have the experience he has and what I told them doesn’t add up. Also that I am not making an intelligent decision because I should have negotiated for more pay instead of resigning. I don’t want to work for this company anymore at all, why would I care about that? Anyways at one point he claims I don’t have enough experience to know if a job is right for me which all I said to that is “I beg to differ,” and before I could finish what I was saying he starts to grit his teeth and he balls up his fist. His entire face was turning red. I tried to explain to him it’s not personal and he cuts me off to say he knows it not personal…could have fooled me. At the end of the conversation I guess he could tell I was nervous and he asks “was I too aggressive?” I told him yes and he replies with “good” before walking out. This was my first time submitting a resignation and I feel like this is something I’ll never do again. I’m not going back to this job, they can forget about the notice I gave them. But I’m so shaken up from that I am a little hesitant to jump back into the job market after this experience. I just had to get this off my chest and I could use a word of encouragement or two as well :(

I recently started a new position a couple of months ago. The organization I work with is similar to the one I worked at a few years ago. Because the organizations do the same work, the leadership from each organization knows each other and may attend 1-2 of the same meetings throughout the year.

Still, I am unsure if it’s appropriate to ask my previous supervisor (who has already given me an excellent reference for this job I just started) to continue being a reference for job opportunities. 

What should I do? Can I ask them for another reference when the time comes?

In addition, I typically only apply to roles that list the salary range as I don’t feel like going through the application process only to learn that my salary is far beyond what they’re looking to pay. 

I came across a job that sounded interesting, would be a lateral move title and duties-wise, and had a top range being 28% more than I make now. I decided not to be too stingy and when I applied I “only” asked for a salary that would be a 14% pay increase. One thing to note is that between the time I applied and got an interview, I got my yearly raise of a measly 3.9%. Now the job I’m applying to would only be a 10% raise….

Regardless, I took the interview (which was very long btw) and did fairly well in my opinion. However, it was radio silence from the recruiter for two weeks, I read between the lines…I likely wasn’t chosen for the role. No worries, I’m perfectly fine with where I’m at now and it wouldn’t have been that large of a raise regardless. Well, the recruiter finally reaches out and has a short message: “Are you firm in your salary ask or would you be open to negation?” Ok, got it, another veiled message, I wasn’t the first choice but maybe they’d be interested in me if I was cheaper. While I probably would not leave my current job for less than a 10% raise, I was curious what they were thinking and at the least, I could potentially take an offer back to my current job to ask for a better raise. I emailed the recruiter back saying I’d be open to hearing what they have in mind. …. Radio silence for another week, no response whatsoever…. Then the recruiter emails me again, literally a week after last, to ask if I would be interested in interviewing for a lower-level role in the same position and if am I still firm in my salary ask. 

At first, my thinking was that there was no way I’d take a title hit AND not even a pay raise over 10%. But then I started to think about it…maybe I should respond just to see what range that role is and where they think I fit in it. Because…potentially less work for a small pay bump…that doesn’t sound too bad right? Or I guess I could also go through the whole rigamarole again to possibly still bring an offer letter to my job now for a small pay bump? 

What do you all think? Thanks!"

I assumed it was termed as such since I’m starting in the middle of the year.   There was no mention of hourly rates or what not.  I verified that the annualized salary was the same as base pay.  But I asked the recruiter about how PTO accrues and they mentioned a 37.5 hour work week.   So I’m a bit confused now

I had assumed I would take the annualized salary amount and divide by 26 (bi-weekly pays) and that would be my paycheck amount prior to taxes, deductions, etc.    is it fair to assume that is the case?  I think the 37.5 hours is throwing me off, but even if it was hourly I would assume it would still equate to the annualized salary… ie a slightly higher hourly wage for 37.5 hours than what would have been for 40 hours."

The job is mine as long as I pass a background check and drug test. One of the other requirements is to get 3 references from current managers. I decided to go ahead and do the right thing and tell some of my managers today about my new job and ask for a reference check. This way they won't be blindsided when the company calls to verify employment. 2 were happy and the other has a shitty attitude. I got inform at least 2 more ugh. Their reference is essential to me getting this job unfortunately.
1,2023-04-01,Negotiating advice for a job at a new company,u/Gehwartzen,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/128vdjn/negotiating_advice_for_a_job_at_a_new_company/,jobs,"I recently went though the second round of interviews. Spoke with the recruiter and he indicated it was an enthusiastic ""yes"" from all the people I interviewed with (6). Not unexpected as the job ad may as well have been written with my exact work history and credentials in mind; I checked all the boxes they were looking for. My local market is such that the applicant pool I likely rather small. It's a Fortune 200 company.

So Ive got a 30 min meeting with HR set for Monday and needed some advice on how to approach salary benefits.

As I told my recruiter im generally happy where I am but like to put out my feelers for interesting positions. From the get go he told me HR had told him 105-110K while the hiring manager had told him around 120K. To which I responded that thats within the range of what I'm making now just to not waste each others time.

I currently make 113K/year. I would be happy with 120K/year but of course would love more.

401K and most other benefits are comparable. 

A big one for me is that I have 4 weeks of vacation which I don't want to loose. Last job they didn't make any bones about matching the vacation time (3 weeks then, but have since gotten an extra week). The normal 2 weeks would be a non-starter for me. I would consider an offer with 3 weeks but would really l;iek to retain all 4.

The other slight ""issue"" is that at my current company bonuses get payed out at the end of June and this would be around 9K. SO was thinking about asking for a little something to make that blow easier if they want me in the position earlier (likely).

Position is mid to senior - level in a technical field (not-software)

Thoughts on how to approach things?"

The new job would mean more responsibility (it’s a higher level role), commuting 30/40 mins, similar work pattern (3 ish days in office) but likely to be more restrictive on which days and more expectation to be in for certain meetings. However, it’s a 15k pay rise and 9 more holiday days (+ 4/5 days between Christmas and NY given off whilst current role expects me to put in leave for this, so effectively another 4/5 days leave available).

6,2023-04-01,"Career Dilemma, need advice",u/Amazing-Progress3031,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1295r6e/career_dilemma_need_advice/,jobs,"Please brace yourself for a long post.

I'm in a huge dilemma right now regarding my career. I got laid off recently from a tech company. I was an interim engineering manager at this company for almost 2 years. I had not done any IC(Individual Contributor) work in the past 2 years and my promotion was due. Unfortunately, getting laid off was there in my destiny. I chose the path of engineering management because that's what I love doing. I enjoy people/project management more than coding. My official title was still Senior Software Engineer. I prepared an Engineering Manager(EM) resume listing all my wins as an EM but I mentioned the title as Interim EM.

I have applied with this resume to many companies. Unfortunately, I haven't got much response beyond a few recruiter calls. I believe the reason is that there are much more experienced EM's in the job market right now. Their resume shows much more experience/achievements than mine.

I feel like I might have to go back to being an IC/senior engineer and start on a manager transition from scratch. The problem is that I haven't coded for 2 years and it would be really difficult to get into that mindset of studying and preparing for technical interviews again. It feels like I will be taking a step back and have to work hard towards my promotion again in a new company. This puts me back by at least 2-3 years.

Second option for me is to be very patient and wait for the right EM opportunity that might come my way in the future. I should be rigid that I won't go for any other role. But there is no guarantee that such an opportunity will arise in the future and I will get it given only 2 years of leadership experience.

Third option is to pursue a passion of mine. I am fairly good at basic woodworking, custom wall paneling, shiplap, wainscoting, enhancing interior design etc. I have helped few of my friends in these projects at their house. I was thinking of doing this professionally. This is something I really enjoy doing. I think in the long run, I'll be able to earn a lot more money compared to an engineering job. On the flip side, quitting engineering and setting up a business is always risky.

Thinking about all these options takes my whole day and I am posting now to seek advice from knowledgeable folks here."

Many of them were promoted around the 4 or 5 month mark so it is very very common to be promoted quickly. I’m at month 5 of working here and applied for the promotion. We do have a lot of moving around in our company such as our leadership (coaches) are always being swapped around a lot, I was told by 5 different “coaches” (previous supervisors) that I would be a great fit for it and that my stats and ranking are perfect. I’ve ranked top 3 out of a 300+ department every single month, no absences or tardiness, I even help the current mentors (promotion spot). I’ve had my current coach for a month or so now and she has not been helpful when it comes to me inquiring about the promotion/job opening. I applied and didn’t even get an interview. I emailed HR and the leader in charge of the promotions and training the employees that are promoted. I genuinely wanted to know what I could work on to be considered for the next promotion. I was told they go by stats AND supervisor feedback but that they will be looking into this for me. I have one on ones with my coach every week so I’m wondering if I should ask her? Or any advice really…
Every single week she always tells me I’m doing great and to keep hitting my goal but surely there’s something I need to work on since I didn’t get the promotion?"

I could tell something was off though, the hiring director in the panel made minimal eye contact with me and asked me no questions, basically only the CFO and VP of HR interviewed me. 

Post interview—-HR reaches out for not 3 but 5 references. OK fine….excessive but no problem. I provided 5 SOLID ones which all got back within 36hrs of contact.

After the date passed which they told me a decision would be made, I call the VP of HR and she says “oh sorry, your experience is impressive but the hiring director went with another candidate. She should have contacted you, sorry”.

I have been doing the job of several people because I couldn't just sit by and watch work not being done but then me picking up the slack became an expectation. I make *barely* 2k a month and am being paid 11$ an hour less than the median for my title position. 

I have watched good, long term employees ask for a 1$ raise and get forced out and mocked for literal years because, ""if you're in it for the money, you're not a good fit"" or for otherwise not recognizing the ""valuable experience"" that they are getting. The owners will even drive by their new jobs after they leave and mock the ""downgrade"" in meetings that have literally nothing to do with past employees or even their positions. Employees that left two years ago are still in the mouths of the owners and management today. 

I gave my two week notice six months ago and was literally begged not to leave by the owners - one even cried. I stayed because I am really weak honesty. Realistically, that's how I landed myself in this situation. I've started ""quiet quitting"" and just doing the bare minimum but it goes against everything in me to not do my best and fill the gaps in my day with more work. I had a really good wrestling coach in high school and it's hard to shake the work ethic he instilled in me. Instead of abandoning my work ethic, I want to leave and give my all to a different company who will at least give me the bare minimum. I just don't know how to face a grown man crying, begging me not to leave because he truly believes that his company will fail without me. He's told me as much. 

Plus, I genuinely believe that they see me as family. I know for a fact that at least one of the owners parents and children know my name, the name of my child, my hobbies, and I'm sure other strange details about me. 

I don't know what to do. I know that I deserve and could easily attain better but I don't know how to sever this tie."

About 4.5 years ago (fall 2018) I got a misdemeanor DUI charge. Yes, I know, very stupid and irresponsible of me. Horrid judgement and I'm grateful I got only got a standard DUI charge because it could have been so much worse. Learned my lesson the hard way. I did everything the court required me to do after it (pay fines/DUI classes/community service/etc) and got my license fully reinstated in 2019. I moved on from it but it's still on my record.

I've held the same job the last 6 years and I'm trying to branch out to a different industry, so I haven't applied for any jobs since my DUI. So I am not sure how to address this in a job interview.

When I applied online and sent my resume, there were absolutely zero questions on their application about previous criminal charges.

In the job description however, it says there will be a background check. I'm definitely nervous about this. Should I disclose it in my in-person interview next week? How do I even bring it up?

I also read you maybe shouldn't even bring it up unless they specifically ask about criminal background... is that true? That seems sketchy...

Because a little more than half of all HR Managers/Recruiters/Bosses know if they want to hire someone within the first 5 Minutes of the first interview.

For most positions a 30-40 Minute interview is enough to find out if the the potential new employee has the skill and personality to fit in.

Two interviews are perfectly sufficent for 95%+ of all jobs - even if you have multiple candidates. Three are already overkill - I would say these are only resonable for the highest positions with a lot of responsibility and skill required.

But if they still cant tell you if they want to hire you after the 3d or even 4th interview - then the people doing the hiring process/interviews are just bad and incompetent."

Because of this the majority of people who I work with end up working lots of overtime. 

I’m 18, I suffer from long term depression which I take medication for and go to therapy to alleviate, physically my depression drains my energy and has made my immune system terrible, meaning I end up calling in sick around once a month for one reason or another (vomiting, severe nausea, and severe abdominal cramping are the most frequent) I know it’s terrible and way too much and I should just go in anyway but I do make myself go in as much as I physically can and usually do any shift changes or overtime my manager asks of me. 

Because we’re understaffed I feel this terrible guilt for hours at a time if not days when I get sick or am unable to cover a shift or change my shift to be longer. I can feel my manager getting increasingly annoyed with how often I’m unwell, and he’s unaware of the fact I’ve got depression overall (because I said the equality act 2010 didn’t apply to me on my application, because why on earth would I be open about that to an employer knowing it cripples the chances of even getting an interview.) 

Recently in the last few months I’ve found myself being plagued by worse than usual anxiety over this issue in my job in particular. I find myself spending an excessive amount of time feeling nauseous with guilt for not being well. 

Genuinely how the hell do I relieve this guilty feeling because I know rationally my job being so badly understaffed isn’t my fault. Any advice would be much appreciated.

An ATS is NOT a robot rejecting resumes!!! 📣📣

So many people have it all wrong

Let me tell you how a RECRUITER uses their ATS:

-To track candidates in the selection process (hence the Applicant TRACKING system)

-Schedule interviews 

-Communicate with candidates

-Keep/compile candidate documents and notes

-Send me candidate contact information

-Tracking pipelines (referral, job board, company website, etc.)


That's it.

It does NOT spit up and spew out your resume

Can it reject your application?

Yes

There's a difference between an application and a resume

If you don't meet the LEGAL requirements

An ATS can and will reject your application

But if you meet the legal requirements

Then me, a person, not a robot, will review your resume

""How did my resume get rejected in the middle of the night?""

-Well, chances are, a recruiter (me) was in there in real time and reviewed it

-You didn't meet the legal requirements and your application was rejected

If you meet the legal requirements

I am required, by law, to look at your resume

Or else companies and recruiters run into some big problems


There is some truth to having an ""ATS Compliant Resume""

Want to know what that is?

Just making your information easier to find and read

That's all it is

Don't be fooled by everything you hear about an ATS"

2,2023-04-02,Waste of Time,u/Terrible-Radish-1247,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/129npam/waste_of_time/,jobs," Recently I applied to a job and was contacted about setting up a virtual screening the very next day. The screeing was set up literally the night before for 9:30 am. I had to get up super early to prepare, get my clothes ironed and ready etc. I thought the role was more on the administrative side based on the description. Apparently I was wrong. The recruiter let me know that the role has a lot more technical aspects. I get them wanting someone with more technical experience. It made me wonder did  this person not even read my resume. How did I even get selected for a screening? I didn't lie on my resume so I literally did not add any key words that would get my resume selected. According to the recruiter, I was one of the first to apply. Even so, wouldn't that have made it easier to sort through applicants they wanted to move along in the hiring process. 

 The recruiter then gave me some job searching tips and told me to just keep applying. I will admit I was pretty annoyed by getting told to just keep applying. There are so many roles I have applied for where my resume has what they are looking for, and I hear absolutely nothing back. What is even more annoying is that I had previously done temp work with this company. Since leaving, I have done 2 interviews with them for full time roles. The first one I made it to the hiring manager interview and got ghosted. The second time I again got to the hiring manager. I waited 9 days and followed up. Someone had accepted the role a day before my follow up. I know I would have gotten ghosted if I hadn't followed up. The same recruiter who handled my most recent screening, handled this interview process as well.There was also a time where I applied for a role and again the very same recruiter sent me 2 rejection letters hours apart for the same role.

 At the end of the interview she asked if I had any questions. I was pretty annoyed and tired so I just thanked her for the feedback. I wanted to ask her why should I bother to keep applying when my applications either get ignored or I get ghosted after interviewing. I didn't want to ruin my chances on the slim hope a role comes up that I'd be good for and she's handling it. It just sucks trying to get your foot in the door. I was only able to work at this company for 6 months as the role was per diem with low pay and a long ,but paid for commute. I wanted to stay with the role longer and get to do more resume building things. When they stopped paying for the commute, I literally could not afford getting to work anymore. I just want to get my career started. I had to go back to retail and keep feeling like I'll be stuck doing it forever."

My commute more than doubled from 12 minutes one way to 35 minutes.  I took it because I was under the impression my first raise would be between 3-5 dollars but it was only 50 cents, with a stellar review, which shocked me. The cap at new job is supposed to be 28 but it’ll take 15 years to hit that if it’s 50 cents a year.

The new job is a lot more physical (I like the work) and early mornings, which I don’t like.

My old job is open and it’s 2nd shift and a lot closer but right now pays around 19 compared to 21 so I’m debating on going back to my old job with a lotta free time and 2nd shift or sticking with the new job another year in hopes of higher raise next year…

11,2023-04-02,Company won’t honor original hiring promise of working remote,u/Accomplished_Luck540,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/129sec4/company_wont_honor_original_hiring_promise_of/,jobs,"I work at a small tech startup with <50 people. I was originally hired to work west coast hours from 12-8 and told that I’d start those hours in 6 months from my hiring date and would then be working remote. Until then, I’ve been working regular 9-5 in office with the rest of my team to ramp up.

I learned from my manager about 3 weeks ago that I would be switched to west coast hours 4 months earlier than expected, as they had used it to sweeten the pot and land a deal with a west coast client. I was told I’d be expected to drive into the office everyday from 12-4 and then leave to work the rest of my shift from home.

Remembering the original hiring promise, I went to my VP about starting hybrid earlier. She had absolutely no issues with it and said she’d be a hypocrite not to let me since another coworker who lives about the same distance works completely remote and was able to do so after only 4 months of being there. She said she wasn’t going to be a hypocrite and tell me no, but needed to clear it with my manager first. With her words ringing in my ears, I signed a lease for an apartment an hour and a half away (yes, this was dumb). I spoke with my manager next, who seemed hesitant, because she said the policy around hybrid was clear - 6 months in office first, no exceptions. She said she’d need to speak with my VP. When I told her I already had, she seemed a little taken aback and said that it would be totally fine with her then, and she’d discuss it with the VP in their one on one. 

However, my manager clearly lied to my face as now I’ve learned that they want to bring it up to the CEO and feel that it would be a violation of company policy to let me work from home a few days a week when everyone else had to wait 6 months to earn that privilege. Keep in mind, I wasn’t even asking to be remote, but just asking them to compromise and let me start hybrid. They argued that setting aside my west coast hours, I was just like everyone else and others commuted the same distance or farther. 

I’m extremely upset and don’t know what to do. I obviously have no bargaining power after only 2 months of working there and feel that it’s extremely nonsensical to make me drive several hours to come in for only a few hours and then go back home. I’d be driving during my shift when no one else is available, which means a backlog of calls and tickets I’d have to get back to. I’ve already noticed that when I leave the office at 4, my team has left multiple tickets and missed calls for me to get back to while they were there, despite the fact that they should be working until 5. 

 My offer letter is just a generic and doesn’t even mention west coasts hours so I have no leverage there either. Is there any way to get them to compromise on this after forcing me into this role sooner than expected?"

Have finally figured out my career path as a data analyst. I’ve been at my current job (tech company) for about a year. But I am concerned about the financial well being of the company like many tech companies and have noticed within my first few months, the culture has been borderline toxic. I want to stick it out for 2 years, but I’m afraid my job history could prevent me from interviewing for any decent opportunities. Here is some context just in case

2019 - Company 1 - 7 months, switched jobs due to not wanting to be put in a sales role (they tried to place me there as it was getting leaner)

2020 - Company 2 - marketing agency - 1 year. Agency life burnt me out. Wanted to go in house 

2021 - Company 3 - first tech company. First legitimate analyst role as well. 1.5 years. Really liked it, but company wouldn’t pay me more after taking more responsibilities from manager after he left. Rent went up drastically. Needed higher salary

2022 - current company. Tech as well. Job is remote, pay is definitely much better than company 3, tech stack has made it easier to upskill, but the management is horrible and I am pretty sure there will be layoffs (they seem to do it every year). I can sort of tolerate the job given the circumstances, but between the management and lack of direction, I am beginning to realize this company may not have been what I had hoped it had been.

I also understand that I need to improve my ability to judge companies during the interview process. I want to hit the 18 month mark, but I am also wary it could damage my chances if I start looking around then. Should I stick it out and try to get to 2 years, or would it be worth exploring opportunities sooner than later?"

I didn't realise the work culture would be so shocking drastic. I've been at my new job for two months now and I can't stand it.

It's very ""clicke"" and I've noticed how often they all talk behind each others backs or relay information straight to the boss.

The things that are said I wouldn't have dared to say at my last job. Are smaller companies generally quite toxic to work for?

One of the guys handed in his notice this week and out of all of them I'd say he was the most normal. When I was chatting to my boss he said to me ""don't worry, for the next two weeks he will be getting the s*** jobs""

I can no longer take it and despite on and off applying for any jobs in my area just about (part time) I’m unable to even get a reply back, I’m usually just ghosted after the “we’ve revived your application :)” email.

I have nearly 2 years experience in the industries I apply for yet I still just can’t seem to get anything, even when getting an interview I’ll there for a long while, talked to well and on a very human level, yet still get nothing back. In fairness both companies I was interviewed for made a joke about doing an obscene number of interviews (one 35, one 58!!) there’s no way I can get anywhere from here. 

The online job system is failing me and I just want to know if I may be able to experience more luck with just walking in physically, maybe that will make me more noticeable and determined? 

I’m quite desperate to be elsewhere, I’ve had many friends and family review my CV and it all looks fine to them- just the sheer volume of people applying for these jobs makes it impossible to be seen as a person rather than a number :("

My personal circumstances have changed over the past several years, and what I want out of life has shifted dramatically.  For the sake of my mental health, I need to do something different.

I would be more than happy in a 9-to-5 with primarily administrative responsibilities.  Unfortunately, on paper I'm overqualified for these types of roles.  I can understand employers' reservations about hiring someone like me, and I'm struggling with how to convey that tactfully.  Here are the main things I want to express:

* This would not be a ""tide-me-over"" job until I find something else;  this is what I want to be doing long-term.  I'm not going to bail on you to go back to my previous line of work.
* I'm not after your job.  I have no intentions of undermining your authority.  If you hire me, I would be a cooperative and respectful team member.
* I am willing to accept the salary you offer.

In my applications, I highlight my transferable skills (including soft skills) and de-emphasize technical details that aren't relevant to the position I'm applying for.  I tailor my resumes/cover letters, express enthusiasm for the position, and utilize my network when available.  So far, I haven't gotten any responses.

Hiring managers, is there anything a candidate like me could do to make you consider an interview?  I'd appreciate any advice."

I have so many questions and my mind is going in every direction. On one hand, I'm super confident because ""hey, they're flying me out"". However, I'm like ""it could mean nothing"".

* Can I change in a gas station into my interview clothes so I don't wear my nice clothes on the plane? I don't want anything to get on it. (I know it's a dumb question)
* Is it actually a good thing that they're flying me out?
* What is the best way to say ""I may not know things about corporate, but I really am a fast learner""?

Any recourse?",u/EpicPartyGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12a432y/maryland_employment_law_was_promised_a_promotion/,jobs,"Hello all! Not sure if this is the best place for employment law advice, but here goes.

Almost 2 years ago I was hired to be an engineer at a place near me. I was hired with the intention of shadowing the manager and being prepared for stepping into his shoes when he retired in about two - three years. The manager was on board with this, was part of the hiring process, and would eventually become my biggest advocate in the company.

About a year after I was hired, the company was bought out by a Colorado company. Knowing how things could go, (and due to the wage freeze in light of 10% inflation), I quietly put my resume out there. After 4 months, a dozen interviews at different places, some branching out of my job to demonstrate leadership and what I have learned so far to prove my worth with the new employers, I got a job offer at a very large company in my industry. While the position did not have any advancement potential within the next 5 years, what it did have was a 20% pay raise and a much larger education budget for certifications and such. This is compared to the 50% raise that came with the higher position, and I'd be in charge of the department budget.

I approached my manager, and we sat down with the HR manager. The three of us discussed the future of my position there, and we agreed that the prior arrangement held, that I would be stepping into the Manager position when the current manager retired. With this in mind, I turned down the position at the larger company. 

Fast forward six months, and my manager puts in his retirement papers, effective the next Friday. I talk to the current Ops Manager, who keeps postponing meeting with me. Thursday, he calls me in and there's the new HR Manager, the VP from Colorado, and the security guy, and I'm terminated effective immediately.

Now, I know Maryland is an at-will state, but couldn't the argument be made of a verbal contract? There's at least six people I could call to back up the claim, plus a hard $ figure of money I've lost out on for turning down the job based on apparently blatant lies. 

It's weak, I know, and I haven't heard from any lawyers I've reached out to, but I've been focusing too much on jobs hunting to really pursue this. Any suggestions?"

Last 3 jobs I've been rejected all because of a lack of experience. It's so frustrating idk what to do how the fuck am I supposed to find experience if nobody will hire me. Interning is more or less out of the question as I've graduated and worked full time as an engineer. The only shit I got going is a shit tier contract role for 30k less than my old job. I don't want to take it both because the experience is nothing I care about and pretty irrelevant to what I actually want to do. Will it even help me for future applications? I dread being pigeon holed into doing shit I hate until I endure the torture of grad school till I dig myself out. Additionally, how is interviewing for new positions instantly after being onboarded going to look because I don't want me being beholden to their schedule to hold me back from future success.

1,2023-04-03,Am I on the right career path or would you recommend I do something else?,u/KnightFury12480,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12a9qn3/am_i_on_the_right_career_path_or_would_you/,jobs,"So, I am studying for my bachelors in Computer Science in a top 100 global university in US. I moved here from a third world country and I have quite a lot of debt despite my scholarships. I am a freshman right now and call me materialistic or greedy, but the only goal in my life is to increase my net worth as much as possible while having work-life balance to pursue my hobbies. MY true passion is actually bodybuilding, weightlifting, and kinesiology. I am a very active person and love to be outdoors. Now, as you might know these fields in general not even good for repaying my student loans back let alone earn enough money to live comfortably as an immigrant. Hell, I would even be kicked out of the US if I don't get a high-profile job. With a heavy heart, I realized that to give my family a good life, I will have to let go of my passion as my main source of money and do it as a hobby. I despise sitting in a cubicle working in front of a screen but yeah any high-level position is not really physical in corporate settings so I think I just don't have a choice in my life. 

So, I decided to fuck it , I will sacrifice everything to have a job that pays me well and leaves me time to pursue my passions. So, I am majoring in Computer Science and it is hard but I figure I have no other choices. I take longer to do projects compared to my classmates and it is hard for me to consistently keep coding and coding but I hope this would improve if this is my only choice. I also find it hard to connect with other CS majors since they have different hobbies such as gaming, animes etc than me .Sometimes, I think of switching to a business major such as marketing or finance but again the compensation is less I believe. I just wanted to ask professionals here if tech industry has good work life balance to pursue my hobbies on the side, If I am forced to get a high profile high paying job is tech really the best choice and if what I am doing is right.

Thank you for reading this. This has been bugging me a lot. I hope I can get some advice."

I'm thinking about applying to a local bookstore that I'm a regular at. I don't hold any particularly close relationships with any of the employees, nothing more than just friendly small talk, most of them recognize me or know my face, the manager for sure does though. It's part time and the store and employees are all pretty relaxed and lowkey so it's pretty low stakes but I'm asking for advice because I'm just feeling a little awkward about it. Like is it a good thing they know me? A bad thing? Is a bad idea to work at a place I'm a regular at? Will I end up getting embroiled in intense bookstore drama that will sour my relationship with all the people I know there and I will never want to set foot in there every again? I just want to be aware of any caveats."

I have 20 years of experience in retail and customer service and until recently I could scrape by on at least part time. I can't do this anymore. I have a growing kid to support I need a better more stable job. I have repeatedly been lied to by retail managers when all I ask for is stability, honestly even a consistent schedule of low hours so I could work out a second part time job, that would help. But nope, they never do. Problem is this is ALL I've done for work consistently. I've had short term temp jobs and worked in other industries over time. I simply cannot scrape by at all if no where is willing to give anyone enough hours to survive on. How does me working 37hrs cost more than 4 people splitting those 37 hours?! I'm just really over it; with my experience and skill level there's 0 reason for me to be living like this at 33 with a child.

0,2023-04-03,"""Entry level"", what does this mean?",u/Nr1864,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12acl26/entry_level_what_does_this_mean/,jobs,"Tldr: Entry level does not mean starter level. Entry level is just the natural progression point where people from a position beneath it can enter or advance into. 


Every job has a career path. In order to advance through this path, you have to climb the corporate ladder. Each stair on the ladder is a position. The natural flow of these positions, for my career path, are:  technician>>>analyst>>>specialist>>>developer>>>administrator>>>manager>>>director. 

When a job is listed as ""entry level"", all it means is that it is the entry point for those that are from a step below to advance into. Hence the name. Even leadership positions start off as entry level jobs. Think of an Engineer 1/2/3/4. Engineer 1 would be the entry level position. 

For an example using my career path, the entry level administrator position would require 10+ years of experience from all the positions beneath it. Of course, these can be substituted with similar held jobs.

Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult to find a starting position fresh out of college. All grads are applying to those same positions en masse. If you've taken an internship throughout school that is related to an entry level position you are applying for, then you will have a much easier time getting in. My school almost forces everyone to get internships for this very reason. 

As an example, this is why an analyst position can have hundreds of applicants a day. Especially if remote! These are not the bottom step of the ladder, and people with internship experience are the ones who take these up.



So, what can you do to help making finding a job easier? 

1) If you are still in school, get an internship!!! Most universities have it to where you can have an internship that counts for credits towards your major! Mine was 9 credits/hours! These will have the greatest impact on getting a good starter job. 


2) If you didn't have an internship, you will have to start at the bottom of the ladder and work your way up. You'll be paid less off the bat, but you will find a job much faster and your growth will also be quicker.  


3) Be proactive on your applications, especially if you are still in school! There is no such thing as too early. 


4) If applying for an entry level position that is on the 2nd step of the ladder, you will have a much easier time getting it during the middle of the semester! These are the positions that get a flood of applications as soon as the semester ends. 


5) Try to create a portfolio to show examples of what you can do. Class projects are amazing for these. Plus, it looks good on a resume. If you have taken coding classes, make a github to show some examples of your code! 


6) Make sure your resume looks amazing. If you don't have any professional experience, list out your related classes instead! You can quickly, easily, and cheaply have someone create/edit a resume for you. A popular website is Fiverr. 



I know it can be difficult and even hopeless at times trying to find a job. But, keep your chin up and know there are plenty of opportunities out there! Hopefully this will help guide some people."

One of my bosses seem to have a little attitude that's why hesitate really asking them for help on something and just go to my general manager.

Despite holding a VP level position at my current employer, I knew that I had reached the salary ceiling and there were no opportunities for further advancement due to my direct reporting to the CEO. I was offered a C&I position at the new institution, which was a step down in title, but offered potential for upward mobility and exposure to various departments.

I had a scheduled appointment with HR to discuss salary and another interview, but to my surprise, I received an email stating that I was no longer being considered for the position. This sudden change left me feeling confused and uncertain about the situation, so I reached out to the HR representative for clarification. Although he confirmed our scheduled call to discuss salary, he did not address the email. This left me feeling uneasy and unsure about my future prospects."

I work at a therapeutic boarding school. I do it because these kids are in the same boat I was in at their age with anxiety and trauma. I love the job but I guess I feel under appreciated… I work nights 10 hr shifts and these last 2 weeks I worked 120 hrs. I worked 6 nights in a row, got off Friday morning, had one night off, and worked Saturday night and I am working until Thursday morning this week. 

I always come in when they need me to because there are only 3 of us. I was talking to my supervisor and he asked me if I was interested in being assistant supervisor and I said yes most definitely. I curiously asked if they had offered it to the girl who had been there longer than me first as I didn’t want her to get upset she was overlooked. He said she was thinking about taking another job so he came to me. Well I said yes and then she decided to stay and they gave it to her. She’s regularly late and I’m always on time. 

My work does these campus wide shoutout emails to staff and even after I covered her and my supervisors shift and have covered many shifts so we aren’t short I have never been recognized for pulling extra weight so they don’t have too. We get along great so no issues there but I feel like upper management doesn’t recognize all the work I do. Just 

yesterday they sent my coworker who got assistant supervisor a shout out complimenting all the hard work she does and thanking her for decorating for the kid’s birthday party we had but I did that. She was in another part of the house all night.

I guess I’m just feeling off. Like I’m still not doing good enough."

I was emotionally abused by a manager and the HR/owners did nothing to support me. Overall the upper management/owners are terrible and are making bad business decisions. However, my current role is a mix of awesome (2 WFH days/week, 35 days PTO, flexible schedule) and eye-twitch-inducing (the employees I manage make me want to pully my hair out - one just needs to be fired but the company never does that). 

I accepted a job at another company that seems like it's going to be OK. There are some parts that are worse (no WFH, only 15 days PTO, less schedule flexibility) and some parts that seem like they could be better (slightly better pay, boss seems really cool, better health insurance). 

This is my last week at my current job and I'm going through some serious second guessing. I'm just so worried I'm going to regret leaving a job that I can tolerate but don't love. I'm also terrified of losing a month's worth of PTO. I like to go on a lot of vacations and I'm not sure what it's going to feel like not being able to take time off.

Does anyone have any advice?!"

Excuse any grammar issues you might see. I’m typing on my mobile advice and I’m reaching out because I’d like some advice. 

For the past two weeks I’ve been interviewing with this small marketing agency and I finally made it to the final round. Last week, the meeting time was set over Zoom, but the CEO never arrived. I waited in the room for an hour and he never showed. Didn’t send a follow up email that day, no apology, nothing. I reached out the following day and his assistant told me she’d follow up with him to sort it out. Okay, I thought. I sent a follow up email last Friday and she just told me she’s awaiting an response. 

Am I wasting my time? I really need this job because I’m looking to advance my career in Digital Marketing, but all I can think about is how unprofessional that is. If I never showed up he wouldn’t have given it a second thought. I would’ve just lost the opportunity. What do I do? Should I wait for the receptionist to reach out to me and schedule a new meeting or just count this as a lost and move on?"

I’ve been struggling to enjoy my current job for, literally, months!!! It was like there’s a bad vibe or negative thing every week. I’ve cried so much over this job. Two weeks ago, I decided that sticking it out for a full year wasn’t worth the impact on my mental health, and applied to another job that looked interesting. I have the final interview in a week.

Anyone else ever feel this way? Advice?

I've also been working as a data science consultant since late last Summer. I'm looking for remote DS and other data-driven positions and have been applying since January (I've probably submitted 100+ applications), but more aggressively since March.

I've mostly been using LinkedIn and other job boards, but have also been applying directly to company websites. I've also met with a several recruiters. I'm writing individualized cover letters for the positions I'm applying to and reaching out to the job posters when I can. Yet, I am really struggling to get interview offers or any kind of response at all.

I've have had 3 interviews that reached the ""technical"" stage. In one, I was asked a series of statistics ""mind-benders"" and admittedly I totally bombed it. The interviewer never reached back out to me. So, I know I know I need to brush up on stats... But in the other two technical interviews, I was asked questions about my own work. I thought those went fairly well, but I haven't heard back from either. One of them totally ghosted me months ago (after a series of three interviews and me reaching back out!). I haven't heard back in about a week and a half for the other, so I'm not feeling very hopeful about that either.

I think I'm very qualified and can bring a lot to the table in the positions I'm applying to -- most I'm applying to are junior or entry-level positions. Clearly, I must be doing something wrong.

I've been networking like crazy, but I'm just wondering if you all Reddit might have some advice for me. In addition, I would REALLY appreciate if there is anyone that would send me a DM and take a look at my resume or my GitHub."

I recently applied for a Supply Chain Analyst position on Glassdoor using my current resume, which primarily focuses on my experience in the e-commerce and retail domains. To my surprise, the HR contacted me and asked me to send my resume for further review.

 I'm looking for advice on how to tailor my resume to better fit the Supply Chain Analyst role. Specifically, I'd appreciate any tips on:

* Highlighting transferable skills and experiences from e-commerce/retail to supply chain management
* Emphasizing my data analysis skills in the context of supply chain management
* Incorporating relevant supply chain keywords and phrases throughout my resume

Have two other offers that need to have an answer by Wednesday (Sorry this is sound messy so please just read the whole thing).

Last Wednesday I had a second interview for a position that was in my number one company (Company A). Today, I just asked the hiring manager if there were any updates because I have one or two other offers from other companies since the week before. However, the hiring manager for Company A said that the position that I applied and interviewed for is currently on hold. 

As a result, they offered me another position to apply for. Luckily, the hiring manager just copied and pasted my application so I do not have to do the application process. The problem is at this point, idk if I should consider the other offers and then go back to this one if offered or should I decline the other offers and wait. Should I emphasize the hiring manager about my timeline again? I feel really bad about rushing Company A and holding off Company B and Company C."

I’ve been offered a job that in NYC as an administrative/executive assistant at a newer company (2.5 years old) that is in the distribution/trading industry. 

The base pay is $67K with a 5% bonus EOY and the opportunity to make commission on top of that. The downside of this opportunity is there’s no healthcare, dental, or vision insurance off the bat - I’d have to wait 6 months to get it. If I were to take it, I’d have to pay around ~$500/mo out of pocket for insurance for 6 months. 

I also am feeling hesitant towards taking this job but am trying to figure out if paying $500/mo out of pocket for 6 months is worth it in any capacity because this job pays $7K more than my current job and seems to have good opportunity for growth. 

For reference, I currently get paid $60K with a bit of commission as a sales assistant at a company that provides me health, dental, and vision insurance as well as a 401K. I’ve struggled to feel seen and like I can grow at my current job but it is pretty stable and I am comfortable with the dynamic of things there. My family isn’t getting good vibes from this new job opportunity and do not think I should take it. Plus I just moved and my rent increased so that’s also in the back of my mind."

I might step on some toes here, but stay with me. Here are the mistakes:

1. Your resume is generic. 
If you can remove your name from the top and your resume reads like all the others in the pile, you'll miss the opportunity. You HAVE to catch them from the very first section and it must have your secret sauce written all over it. Tell them what YOU have that others might not. You are unique. You bring value to the table. Don't let your resume read like a list of job descriptions and overused skills.

2. Your resume is over/underwhelming.
A long and crowded resume with tons of info under every single job you've had since 1995 will immediately overwhelm the viewer and have them skim for maybe 3 seconds and move on. Resumes can't look like novels. On the flip side, if you have very little information because you rushed through it and just kind of threw out a few 5 word bullet points and called it a day, they will move on because they can't see what they are looking for in the minimal info you've given them. The solution? Give real estate to the relevant job history/accomplishments and minimize/eliminate what is irrelevant to where you are applying.

3. Your resume looks bad.
We are human beings. We are drawn to things that look attractive and clean. You can't grab attention with a poor format. Even if you haven't made the above two mistakes, you can be overlooked because it looks messy or unprofessional. Choose a nice secondary font for your header and section headers that makes them stand out and provides the viewer with a good flow as they scan through the page."

I hope you are all doing good.

I am an **iranian** woman living in **Italy**. I graduated from university of Bologna in tourism economics and management. However, 2 years ago I found out that I m more passionate about IT sector so I decided to switch to developing websites (front-end).

I followed a 2-month course of Java and I autonomously learned React. Moreover, I worked 2 months as a junior full-stack developer in a **consulting** **firm**.  
I am currently looking for a job as a junior front-end in Italy or **remote-working** in Europe (**mainly netherlands , germany , belgium, Luxembourg or other countries in european union**). However, all the job offers that I encountered needed experience (as least one year experience).

I will be very thankful if anyone of you provides me with some suggestions to the the following questions :

* How can I find a job in Italy or **remote-working** in Europe (**mainly netherlands , germany , belgium, Luxembourg or other countries in european union**) ?
* Are there any **websites** where I can apply ?
* How easy/difficult will it be to find a job in these countries for a permanent resident in Italy.

i was 16 when i applied at Panera in November of 2022. i won’t get too dicey with the dates since i don’t remember them myself. on my first day, it was more of a process of getting me familiar with my first job. i had to sit on an iPad for about an hour watching corporate videos and answering questions about what i learned. think of it as OSHA but a bread company.

WHY I’M HERE:
following this, i would only work 3 days before never being contacted again, no schedule (which normally they would text me), no notice of termination or lay-off, just straight nothing. although i probably should have, i did not attempt contact them after this because of their horrible management, which i divulge in a comment below.
i didn’t really care until i realized how problematic this was. how would i write this on my résumé? is this even legal? why hasn’t this happened to anyone else? the most important question being my taxes (which i’m not very familiar with). 
they directly deposited my paycheck through cashapp. the issue then hit me when cashapp kept sending me notifications about filing my taxes. i don’t know if this is a normal thing on cashapp or if it’s specifically for people who are employed. 
when i opened the app this morning i saw text under the “free tax filing” tab that said “file by 4/8” which had me kind of freaking out, which brings me here. 

MORE INFO: i applied online as a part-time crew member which would include working the drive-thru, dining area, dishwashing, and line-cook. this panera is located in South Carolina, USA."

1,2023-04-03,Need Advice Navigating Regrets about Switching Jobs,u/4eyedfreakazoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ax490/need_advice_navigating_regrets_about_switching/,jobs,"I submitted my letter of resignation last week, and I’m trying to trudge through some doubts and regrets about the decision. I’m not exactly looking for a “you made the right/wrong decision,"" but any advice about leaving one’s comfort zone would be greatly appreciated. 

I’ve been with this small company for three years, and this is the first time in my 12-year career that I decided to accept a new position for a reason other than absolute burnout. 

The people are great (for the most part) at my current job. I have downtime because I was able to automate some of the processes. The pay isn’t great, but I’m not expected to work overtime. I only go to the office once or twice a week and WFH the rest of the time. There is reasonable job security. 

However, one employee who has been with the company for 20 years has frequent temper tantrums. I dread going into the office. Talking to him (“This is just the way I am”) and going to management/HR doesn’t help because he doubles down. Two people have recently left after escalating without seeing a result. He can be nice and helpful sometimes, so I often wonder if I’m exaggerating how exhausting he is in my head. My job involves a lot of interaction with him, and he seems to be getting worse with his emotional regulation as we take on more clients.

My current role was supposed to be technical/analytical, but it ended up being 50% customer service. The new role is a nice blend of the responsibilities of two previous jobs that I really liked until I was asked to work 70+ hours a week due to reorgs or turnover. My current manager is hands-off and doesn’t know how to do my job. I had to train myself and document my own processes. I really liked the management philosophy/style of the three managers I spoke with at the new company. They are interested in improving processes and sharing the workload with the employees instead of sitting in meetings all day. There will be some overtime to meet two monthly deadlines, but the whole team takes comp time when the deadlines are met.  Most of all, I will be getting paid 20% more than what I get now. My partner has health issues, so I’m trying to save money to help out when needed. 

I think it would be an engaging challenge. I miss working with complexity and detail.  However, I am aware that I could be one change in management or one reorg away from another nightmare. And that scares me."

I am getting ready to graduate with a bachelors degree, so I am being reached out to by a lot of recruiters. There is no reason for them to know my background without looking into me. Most of them are for human services type positions. So two questions:

1. When the job posting says something to the effect of, ""Must pass background check,""  "" must be able to pass background checks,"" or ""background check required,"" does this mean that the background checks must come up clean, or that the background check will be taken and it should match what you told them would show up?
2. I see many job postings that say they are an Equal Opportunity Employer. I know this means that they aren't breaking discrimination laws and discriminating based on things such as age, race, sexuality, etc. It **very** rarely states that they encourage people with a background to apply, and I think that's called ""fair chance.""                                                                                                          - Although turning someone down due to a record is not illegal, it appears the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission advocates considering those with a criminal background if they are equally qualified with someone without them, and giving the person an opportunity to explain. So I am curious as to other employers and applicants experiences with/opinions on the nuance of this. 

I am most in need of an answer for the first question, because there is a job that includes this I want to apply to. But for future searching, I was curious about the second question.

Whether you only have experience with one of my questions or both, I would greatly appreciate feedback and thanks ahead."

Recently accepted a position with the state that had their salary listed as $2,796.56-$4,142.84 (I'm presuming I'm starting out at the lower end of that range, but am not sure if there will be room to negotiate). I'm under the impression this listed salary is pre-tax deductions, and if that is the case, after doing the math, I'd actually be making LESS than the $19.25/hr I make now.

Here's the catch of it all. For starters, this new job would entail an almost 50 mile round trip commute, five days a week. With gasoline costs being as high as they are, I'm almost tempted to rescind my offer of acceptance because along with the loss in pay I'm taking (after doing the math it checks out to about $16.13/hr), this just will not be feasible for me. However, unlike my current job, I'd be guaranteed weekends off and 40 hours a week with opportunities for overtime all year (I only get overtime hours during Christmastime at my current occupation).

I absolutely hate my retail/wagecuck job I'm trapped in at the moment to the point where I want to leave it for this opportunity with the state, but part of the reason I even interviewed for this job in the first place was because I was assuming I'd be making more money. Now that this is questionable, should I take back my offer of acceptance? Should I go ahead with it? Or should I try and negotiate to a higher salary range under the reason that I am taking an almost $3.00 pay cut per hour to start work here?

Hope to hear some informative feedback."

Obviously not the same thing at all as UX but some similar general principles.

I am struggling how to word what I did in my marketing designer job to be as relevant to UX (or atleast UI) as possible. Any tips?

What I did was basic marketing designer stuff, creating content for all socials, posting them, measuring the outcomes etc.

I actually really got lucky because my last job was at a small company and my boss told me I could redesign the website for them and I did. So no UX but a pure UI change that's it. How would I add that to my resume?"

My contract stipulates pay is only discussed on an annual basis and I've only been at my current role for 8 months. Should I bring this offer up to my employer and say while I love working here, is there anyway they can provide a pay rise?

Edit: Just found out my colleague has resigned today which is excellent timing, so the company is now going to be heavily dependent on me.

The rest of my department (including me) don't know how to perform these tasks. My coworker is resigning soon, and that has me worried because I realize the implications of this person leaving.

As a side note, I'm the only employee that knows because my coworker told me in confidence. 

The reason I'm posting is because I'm wondering if those of you reading have advice regarding work scenarios like this? I don't know if I should be worried or have the attitude of ""not my problem""?

I am concerned but I'm also viewing this as a management problem. IMO, management should be making sure ALL of us know how to perform the necessary tasks, and not have just ONE person with critical knowledge.

What do you think?"

The job listing requires that I have 2 years experience working in manufacturing or a similar setting. I have work experience from 20 years ago that qualifies. I listed only the years I worked on my resume and not the exact length of time. That got me past the interview and to the job offer.  The problem is, I fudged the dates a little bit. I don't have the 2 years experience. Again, the experience I do have is from a long, long, time ago in jobs that were more summer/minimum wage type jobs. I didn't even initially list them on my resume because I have more recent and substantial work experience. But the hiring manager is serious about those 2 years of experience....

My question is....how likely is it that the real dates come up in a background check? I highly doubt there is anyone to verify my employment in one of the jobs and I did not stay a year in the other job as I listed on my resume. I don't want to be caught in a lie but the 2 year requirement seems like an arbitrary box they just have to check."

The job is making me miserable. New manager is a narcissist and he's doing all kinds of things to mess with our money (downsizing our sections, playing favoritism, etc.) Nothing has really happened to me yet, but it's coming. The new floor chart cuts my money in half (fewer tables = less money) and he says he doesn't care about how much his servers make. He only cares about how the restaurant runs. So, I went from making 3 to 4 hundred a shift, to 200, which is still decent enough to sustain my lifestyle. Summer is coming, and I work on the beach, so it's a nice environment, and business will stay strong. I also have regulars.   


But the stress is killing me. This job takes away from my time with family, but I do it so that we can have a better lifestyle, but I dread going into work with the drama, favoritism, and the threats that he will make the floor chart even smaller or his random outbursts.

So I’ve dusted off my resume and been on the hunt. 
-I’ve got about 3 years under my belt of the niche work I do involving arts&education financial gift work as an assistant. 
-I’ve been applying to jobs that allow me to move up and use my own discretion and specialized experience more. 

-I found an opportunity at one of my top companies, one of the few I’d leave my current role for, it’s a perfect step up the ladder into that managerial sphere. 

Only problem: they suggested to me that I’d be a good fit for the assistant role that reports to the managerial opportunity I applied for.

-It’s essentially what I do now, a step above entry level, but not quite mid-level, as you can imagine I have a slice of humble pie when I read their response. 

It’s wonderful they still seem to be interested in me on their team but…

-How do I/should I professionally swerve the conversation with the head of the team and hiring manager back to the original managerial role I applied for? 

+Has anyone had this happen to them before? 

Unfortunately, this company can be known for underpaying their staff, and I can’t shake the small doubt in the back of my mind they’d have me do the work of the managerial role and the assistant for the assistant pay alone. Please feel free to tell me if I’m being overly confident and/or skeptical. The job hunt can drive one mad. 

TLDR: I meet not some, but all the requirements of the managerial role I applied for, but interviewer suggested I apply for the assistant role that reports to this exact opportunity."

4) have any of you worked with a legit company that uses google forms or something similar for the hiring process? It seems highly unprofessional at best.

When I talk to “other employees” after applying, they thank me for my interest and say HR will contact me if I’m considered for the role. I met a projects manager at a career fair and we had an amazing conversation and later when I emailed him he said, “I will send your CV to HR and hopefully they can help you.” I know the company has at least somewhat suitable roles for me, so I was slightly bothered by his response. 

Whenever I (personally) know someone hiring, they seem to love it when a good candidate comes their way. Referring me to HR and wishing me good luck sounds like I’m not good enough for whatever roles there are (while in person he made it sound like I was very useful). Does “HR will take care of you” mean I’m not what they’re looking for or am I just being sensitive?

I am an **iranian** woman living in **Italy**. I graduated from university of Bologna in tourism economics and management. However, 2 years ago I found out that I m more passionate about IT sector so I decided to switch to developing websites (front-end).

I followed a 2-month course of Java and I autonomously learned React. Moreover, I worked 2 months as a junior full-stack developer in a **consulting** **firm**.  
I am currently looking for a job as a junior front-end in Italy or **smart-working** in Europe (**mainly netherlands , germany , belgium, Luxembourg or other countries in european union**). However, all the job offers that I encountered needed experience (as least one year experience).

I will be very thankful if anyone of you provides me with some suggestions to the the following questions :

* How can I find a job in Italy or **smart-working** in Europe (**mainly netherlands , germany , belgium, Luxembourg or other countries in european union**) ?
* Are there any **websites** where I can apply ?
* How easy/difficult will it be to find a job in these countries for a permanent resident in Italy.

PS : I recall that I don't have experience so I am open to all junior and internship positions.

Thank you all in advance."

I have been stewing with this for a couple of months now and I cannot seem to ""get over it.""

I was hired for my currently role several months ago in a city that I have never lived in. Within my 2 weeks, the same role opened up in my hometown. Out of courtesy, I asked my team if I can apply for the new local role. They said go for it. So I did.

3 months later, we finally schedule the interview. At the outset, the hiring manager (white lady) out right says "" you are being judged differently"". I did not know that meant but nodded so we can carry on with the interview.

During the most crucial question, ""tell me about yourself"", the hiring manger cuts me off, tells me to, in affect, hurry up and moves on the next question. Not letting me finish my answer. At this point I am shook and really do not know what is happening. The rest of the interview, I make the mental realization that I probably am not getting the job.

2 weeks later, I meet the team and hiring manager for the first time at a team retreat. Of course, I want to use this opportunity to get to know the team, ask questions, and introduce myself. When I meet the hiring manager, she/he gave me the cold shoulder and our conversations did not move past ""hi"", ""bye"" and ""how are you?"" I thought this was odd and the opposite of friendly.

Ironically, she/he led a talk about DEI later that day, meanwhile I am the only person of color on the team. Felt very hypocritical.

A little while later, the job is offered to a former intern (white dude/dudette) who is less qualified that I am.  I am confused and can't help but put it together in my head that she/he sabotaged my interview and ultimately I never stood a chance.

Later that day, she/he sends me an email at 3am with ""no subject"" line asking if I want feedback on the interview. I initially said yes but then later declined after she/he took a whole week to reply.

The next instance I see her. She/he is warm, friendly and event tried to hug me. Polar opposite from before.

To this day, I still do not know what she/he meant by ""you are being judged differently"" and cannot help but feel I was nepoed. I don't know how to feel but I have never encountered this situation before.

I don't want to be judged differently. I want to be judged based on merit.

Am I going crazy/ being petty?"

- I know the position will come with a lot of expected overtime (start up with a family growth mindset). I have worked for a company like this before and the amount of time I invested in company growth was insane, and caused me all sorts of stress related health problems.
- I have received a verbal offer from another company which I think will be better for my career in the long run and would put me in a very good position in 2 years time (I know I should wait for a written contract, but it's a global company and I don't see them rescinding the offer). 
- The biggest issue though is the job requires professional fluency in a second language, and I have come to the realisation I'm not there yet. In preparation for the interview I have to prepare a case study, and upon looking at all the documentation (entirely written in the target language) I have realised that I won't be able to reach the level of fluency required before high season. I know I won't feel comfortable being in charge of contracts and expensive invoices in this language as I feel there would be too much margin for error. I have been upfront about my current level, and told them I am committed to learning as much as I can between now and the proposed start date. But unfortunately I now recognise that, although I would ace the position in my mother tongue, I don't feel I would perform to my full potential given the language barrier. 

That being said, I would rather come back to them in a year or two with better language skills and absolutely smash it out the park. Is there anyway to decline without burning bridges with them? I would really love to work with them when the business is a bit more stable and I feel confident in the language. Is it right to mention my lack of language skills when I decline or should I use another excuse that doesn't reflect so poorly? 

Tldr: Realised while preparing for second interview that I lack the language skills and don't think I'll be fluent enough to deal with the high stake responsibilities. How to decline graciously while keeping the door open for when I am more fluent?"

I really don't think I'd be a good fit for a role such as a deckhand and I'm not sure that I have the skillset at all to actually be a marine engineer and upkeep engines, etc. My work history is in a mostly strictly desk role, though I've been lucky enough to get some hands-on technical experience, but nothing like what the expectations of an actual marine engineer or deckhand regularly does. 

Are there any offshore jobs I'd be a good fit for? Ideally, I'd like to work with clean/green energy, or in another research or science role. I believe there may be some field engineering offshore jobs in aerospace, but not totally sure about that. Ideally, I'd like a job with a large degree of hands-on work and a lot of time offshore or in very exotic locations (Kwajalein, Wake Island, etc). Pay isn't a huge factor, so there is that!

Does anyone know what's out there? Thanks!"

I am working for a company that provide technical event services. Small company. We recently did some work for a client who I was aware had a shady reputation. Watched a documentary post the job to get some more context. Turns out they defraud vulnerable young people for thousands (opening accounts in their names and clearing out the overdraft, taking out loans etc.) 

I am high up in the company, have plenty of people working under me and make good money (which I need to support my family). This is completely at odds with my morals though, and the idea of my pay cheque being made of money from these people has got me disillusioned to the point that I don’t think I can work for my employers (knowing they had seen the documentary previously mentioned prior to accepting the job). The money we took came from strange business accounts that line up with what I’ve found out about the scams that have been run. 

I guess my question is whether any of you have found yourselves in similar situations, and whether you would consider this an issue large enough to leave a good position over. The company owners have been unavailable for a few days but I am obviously going to talk to them about the situation once they’re back."
2,2023-04-04,Seeking advice (internship),u/BongoCatfromPluto,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12bhewr/seeking_advice_internship/,jobs,"Hello everyone reading this post,


I started recently my internship in a big company (multinational), and it has been hard getting to this milestone using only my own skills in a world based on personal connections, I'm doing this to be able to get a  second degree I am studying for, and to get some professional experience in my minor (I already have a doctorate). Point of telling you this, is to set the record straight about how much sacrifices, money, and time I am investing to get things right, and to achieve my dreams, in... Not-so-easy conditions. 

Anyway, turns out things aren't as pink as they should've been, I think my manager is harassing me, they did the following to me:

* Not allowing me to go by my own to the HQ, unless they decide that they don't want to work remotely (there's no such condition for other interns). 
* They told me that I am not allowed to contact anyone in the company, nor to send anything to anybody, nor to interact with anyone, even for my own education purposes, unless I run it by them (the obvious answer is no), and even if I do it's a no. I once contacted the global IT team because I needed to fix an issue (I wrote a very standard and polite email, no biggie, I promise, with them in cc), and they immediately sent me an email to tell me to stop contacting people (I explained the issue multiple times to them, they didn't resolve it, nor did they understand it). 
* After I talked to a co-worker, a while ago, in order to have information on a job, I caught them observing me, weirdly, as in: ""stay put in your place, and stop interacting with people"". 
* They told me that I couldn't have my usual desk in the open-space, because they received instructions from the top-management that interns had to stay away in these sort-of booths? Asked a friend who's an intern in HR if this were true, and they denied it. 

I honestly feel like their little slave/personal assistant. They are not providing me with the required work conditions, I feel awful after dealing with them, should I go to HR and complain? I am afraid of causing problems, but I do not think that I can go through with this internship. 


I've already done multiple internships, and little freelance jobs that got me by, here and there, and I've never been treated this way, I always had great feedback for the jobs I have been assigned. 


Please note that I've already done an internship in the same company, last year, in another department, and I maintain a great relationship with my old co-workers who were open and always boosted me to accomplish more. 


Help, I am confused and a bit scared, and it might be late for me to look elsewhere... I refused multiple other opportunities to be doing my internship here. And I honestly feel deeply touched in my integrity, and disrespected as it is... 

What should I do? Knowing that this company is big on inclusion, and they should be treating us better, even as ""interns"", because we're tomorrow's ambassadors.



Thank you for taking the time to read me, I look forward to reading your answers."

long story short my probationary period ended last week and my boss called me in to tell me he thinks i'm not happy at the job and that he can tell even though i haven't said anything. he also asked me point blank if i really wanted to stay and work here. i told him i wasn't looking at other jobs because i didn't really know what to say to that? he said i've changed since i first arrived - i used to be chipper everyday and now i don't say hi to him / my coworkers in the mornings so i must be sad to be there. for the record my desk isn't even in line of sight of the front door so i don't even see him come in anyway? it's weird because i didn't think socialization in the office was part of this job's expectations.


i'm posting here because i wanted to ask, this isn't a normal thing right? he's called me into his office twice about this. it feels like he's been trying to pry into how i feel about the job when i literally haven't said a word about being uncomfortable or not happy to be there and not only am i confused but i feel like he wants to push me out. he said i don't communicate and it's hard for him to help me if i don't say anything. (???) and what i've said a few times to him now is that if i had any issues i'd bring them up...


i know this is reddit and it's impossible to get an objective view of these types of things but if anyone has any thoughts about this please let me know. maybe i have rbf or something but this is super stressful honestly because now i don't feel comfy talking to him for any reason. it really feels like he wants me to quit since he can't fire me for any good reason"

As per the title I have been looking for work for some time after suspending my studies at uni and have mostly been applying through various job posting sites, being rejected from most positions.

I should have asked but I wasn’t informed where my CV had been forwarded from as I had applied to other job listings but no specific talent agency’s to me knowledge and it seemed very out of the blue. 

I then researched the company that contacted me seeing a host of extremely positive and extremely negative reviews with not much in between. The negative reviews claimed the company was extremely hard to climb the ranks in and underpaid even being labelled as a pyramid scheme marketing job. 

Is it worth me pursuing this? I’ve had a similar experience to this at a previous company and I’m afraid I will be making the same mistake again, my interview is on Friday so it could be cleared up after that."

I have an interview next week for a position closer to where we are (5min commute), with slightly better pay at 21.50/hr. We aren’t sure if we are going to get the internships, but would it be wrong of me to take a position and leave 3-4 months after? Would it be bad to leave my new position? Please help. :("

I graduated from college in December of 2021 from an upper level University with a BA in Criminal Justice, and a BS in Psychology. During my time there I was the President of an organization with over 70 members, apart of 2 honors societies, and worked a summer internship at a cybersecurity company directly under the CEO. 

I applied to over 450 positions across a 4 month period when I graduated from which I was only offered 1 job which was being a teller at a bank. After about a year of working at this bank I have been refused a promotion to a fraud investigation position due to the fact that they “need help at the branch level and cannot afford to lose me”.

I have now been applying to fraud investigation jobs at other banks and various other companies to which I receive emails that they will be pursuing applicants that are more qualified. I have shown my resume to multiple recruiters who have all told me that my resume is perfect. I do not understand what is happening. I’m overqualified for nearly all of these positions yet I have not been able to rise above a high school level job. What should I be doing differently? I’m really just starting to lose hope."

Recently I was throwing applications out to different places in an effort to land a more “normal” job. Monday-Friday. Weekends off, holidays off etc.

Well. I got one. Now I am terrified.  This job is in the beverage distribution industry selling beer and liquor to bars, grocery stores, and restaurants (my current one actually being one of them).  

I am going to be taking a bit of a pay cut 83k -> 65k. But I am going to be working a lot less, with a lot less stress.  Generally going to be starting at 7:30 and being done by around 1-2. 

Has anyone else made a similar move like this? How did it work out? Am I crazy for leaving my current role in an effort to have a more normal work/life?

I'm leaning towards Job B, but I'm trying to see if there's anything I'm overlooking in my decision.

**Job A (Government job)**

* Team seemed bored and tired in the interview (interviews are boring so I don't blame them).
* Pay is really low (it's an entry level government job).
* On probation when I first start, but I still get benefits.
* They indicated lower stress and OT compared to my last job.
* Benefits are good.
* Work is fully in office.
* Location is pretty far.
* This job will probably be automated within ten years but there might be opportunities for me to move to other positions.

**Job B (Private company)**

* Team was nice and down to earth in the interview even though they're really busy.
* Pays more by at least $10,000 (it's a private company). They're still working on the exact amount.
* Essentially start out on probation (temp to hire). No benefits unless I convert to permanent.
* Location is much closer, hybrid and flexible schedule options
* They indicated lower stress compared to my last job.
* Benefits are good for permanent employees.
* There is more growth in this job. There is automation risk but not as high as Job A.
* This company is fairly new but they emphasized that people don't work crazy hours.
* Slightly paranoid that they would use me for a large project and dump me after it's done. They didn't indicate that but I've read about it happening on here.

Thanks!"

I applied for a role at a boutique clothing company last week that I meet all of the listed qualifications for (and then some). The culture/vibe of the company and interests of the owner match my own interests completely, and I have great experience with other companies that are similar to this one.

They are working with an **outside** recruiter to hire for this position. Last Wednesday, the recruiter reached out and said he would like to set up a call to talk more. I gave him my availability.

I didn't hear back from him until I followed up this morning reminding him of my enthusiasm and interest in setting up our call he asked for.

He writes back ""Thanks for reaching back out. At this time we will be moving forward with other candidates who are a better fit as our client is looking for someone with more high end fashion and retail experience. Appreciate your time and wish you the best in your job search.""

I feel that if I spoke with the employer directly, she would be interested in a call and would at least see that my skills and experience could be a good match, whereas the recruiter is brushing me off and doesn't really have a good idea of the type of work I've done that fits with this company.

I should also mention the owner of the company messaged me on LinkedIn last week to make sure I had sent in my resume — I don't believe she sent this message to all who applied as there are over 40 candidates.

So my question is, since I'm really interested in this position and feel I have a chance if I speak with the owner: **Should I bypass the recruiter and email/contact the owner of the business?**

I just have a strong feeling that the recruiter doesn't really understand my skills/experience.

Let me know, and thanks again!"

A recruiter reached out to me from a tech consulting firm I briefly worked at 3 years ago. It's an 18 month contract gig  at Microsoft - normally I would say no right away to contract work but it would nearly double my salary and supposedly comes with benefits and PTO unlike typical contract work *since this is a W2 position through the agency. 

I'm just concerned about the contract period, it's a typical Microsoft stint of 18 on 6 off meaning I will not have FTE opportunity right away, but the recruiter said  that theres a possibility of eithe FTE or another contract with the agency. While that's somewhat reassuring, im always worried thats going to fall through and within a year of this contract im back scrambling for another job.

Can anyone shed some light on their experience working as a contractor in tech? Is  it worth it for the experience and money or should I just stick it out where im at now until I find an FTE job?"

Just to preface, I am currently seeking a new job but the market is slow so I need help in the meantime.

I work as a designer at a science institution (sorry don't want to be super specific). My job is very niche and I went to grad school for it. I got hired here around the same time my department hired their new chair/boss. He is nice but I have found him to be EXTREMELY difficult to work with. He is constantly busy and 30+ minutes late to every meeting. He is what you might call a ""dreamer/visionary/perfectionist"" type. Everything ""could be better"" and he cares a lot about what other people think of our department. As  someone who works with him a lot, these qualities make my job extremely difficult. 

We will work on a graphic together and it will take MONTHS past when it should have been done because he is extremely nit picky and also extremely busy. Meetings about these things suck bc we'll end up talking about text size or colors (minor things) the whole time instead of layouts, goals, or planning. Everything I make isn't exactly what he likes. I can't stand it. Every project drags on and on and never end up looking how I think would be good. And I am a good designer, I am sure of it. Every other project with ANYONE else always goes very smoothly.

What makes it worse is I've tried to push back a bit, telling my supervisor my woes as well as other leadership. But the culture around here is ""just let him do his thing. He's the head. You have to chase him around sometimes to get ahold of him, you need to just do what he says, what he says goes"". They see him as this great person who has ""quirks"" you just learn to deal with. I don't respect him at all. I dread everything I have to do for this man.

This guy i talked too, got laid off because he's slow some old guy caught sitting down and scanning, i feel really peeeak.

Recently learned to scan them all first, then sort them which is way for efficient, today i took some Adhd Amphetamine(not a habit) so i could sort more parcels, today i scanned  and sorted a fuck ton atleast over a thousand easy, scanned them after.

All the big bosses see the paper work(i think), so i claimed some other peoples bins for the amount of sorted parcels not scanned, because they let me lol not gunna do that again tho, which was some paperwork about which member sorted and scanned each route.

but i hope they will see, this team is very fast and efficient workers, and keep me i just hope the budget/target is met and i'm paranoid about that, because this is a new extra team.

Manager assistant talked about ""weeding out the weak and slow"" i overthink alot, i rly want this job."

European companies are still 15-20 years behind and not using the tools that I specialize in, my role is similar to Software Developers (in terms of the current job market), but instead of the company needing 5-10 people, companies usually need 2 people max. Salaries start from $130K+.

I have great success with trying to land interviews, I have a lot of experience and I constantly get to the 3rd-4th interview without any issues, however the moment I get this question: ""Are you authorized to work in the US?"", the entire process fails, since I can not work in the US legally and my plan is to just get a contract with the same terms, same pay, same hours, same timezone, same requirements, but not being employed (since I legally can't), but rather as a contractor. 

In every shape or form, it should be better for the company to have me as a contractor instead of an employee, it's much easier for them, but still, I've never gotten a yes and every single company required me to be employed instead of just a contractor.

1,2023-04-04,"Feeling like crap after getting rejected, also after such a long stint of unemployment",u/PinaColadaBleach,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12bsa2p/feeling_like_crap_after_getting_rejected_also/,jobs,"Repost, because I felt the last title was too vague. *(Sorry.)*  


I sent a follow-up email yesterday after receiving the rejection email through Indeed. That one really hurt because the job was everything I was looking for, and I had all the qualifications (and then some) that they asked for.

&#x200B;

They had the decency to tell me No instead of leaving me on ""Read"" and ignoring my future calls, so that was a big factor in why I followed up. (I also wanted that feedback on myself sooooo bad lol.) The interview had went beautifully. We were laughing, joking, smiling, having a genuinely deep(ish) conversation--it was flowing quite comfortably and naturally! (And I *really* don't like treating coworkers as friends...)

&#x200B;

That being said, I'm trying to get advice on how I can improve, but I can't really do that (with my current knowledge) with the feedback they gave me. She said I was a very strong candidate, but someone with more experience applied. I mean, I get it. More experience can be a good thing because less micromanaging, but it's not like I'm a teenager with less than a year of work. I've been doing this kind of thing for *8 years*, which is literally my entire employment career. I'm not saying I'm super impressive, but at least give me the chance to prove myself!

&#x200B;

Anyways, I've had previous roles where I excelled in this exact style of work, hence why I wanted it so bad. I have been unemployed for over a year now after getting laid off from my previous company, so this job hunting thing is seriously wearing me down...

&#x200B;

I mean, there are a few reasons why you would want someone with more experience, but I can think of another reason why you wouldn't at my level. First off, it's an entry-level worker bee job. You don't want to be paying someone with over 8 years of experience $15/hr. That's chump change, (and I wouldn't take it if I weren't in a comfortable situation right now), for that much experience. Not to mention, that wouldn't even cover the bills. Maybe not even my rent. (Maybe the other person lives in a backwater town, idk, but I doubt they'd have the internet to do so...)

&#x200B;

Since I'm in a more comfortable position, I'm glad someone else has the opportunity to put food on the table for their family. I'm venting a lot, so sorry if this comes off as a rage post of sorts, but I'm just really defeated right now. I want to get back out there and be an *even stronger* candidate in my applications, but how can I get more experience if no one will hire me (because I don't have experience because no one will hire me because I don't have experience because...)?

&#x200B;

I kinda really want to know what I did wrong, but maybe I did nothing wrong. You win some, you lose some, and maybe I'm just a loser this time around... :/"

I didn't need a resume when I got this job all those years ago. I don't know how I would even outline all the various jobs I've had at this place over the years. How do you even make a resume for that?

I'm also scared that my skills or experience won't transfer because its been tailored to this job.

I don't want to continue business analysis as I just find the job boring and unfulfilling. I have no idea what to do. I realize this may be some sort of identity or mid life crisis thing.

What are the pros and cons of continuing with the interview process with Company B even after I accept the job from my current company?

I am a 20 (2002) year old man who graduated high school in 2020 and spent 3 semesters studying in a creative business management/graphic design combination degree from late 2020 to the end of 2021.

My last year of high school and time at university was all spent entirely online due to the pandemic and I seriously suffered from it. Unable to find the passion to continue my degree with the stress of the time I took academic leave and began working full time in a few different roles. This culminated in 2 years worth of sales, admin, supervisory and retail experience alongside a healthy exploration of different work opportunities. 

I am writing this post because as I struggle to put myself back on the horse to go through University again, I’m wondering what my options would be if I didn’t go and looked for full time employment instead. I’m someone who thrives in a stimulating and structured environment and find I benefit greatly from being able to see proof of progress and achievement in a workspace setting.

I also forgot to ask when they would be in touch with me to follow this interview... And I already sent a thank you email after the interview, so I don't want to spam them. Should I wait a week or two?

Also the company said it's a job that I would need to move to a different country, but on their website it's written that they have a team globally working remotely, so I asked about it... And they asked me my preference and I'm scared I just messed up at this point, by saying it would be nice to start working  at home and moving abroad after a couple of weeks just to get started... I said it's my preference and I didn't mind moving for this job... I just don't want to be disqualified because of that, because it's kind of one of my dream company.

Can I add some precision in my future follow-up email?

I work at a very large company. There has been a job posted for a little over a month now that I have been interested in applying to (different managers/directors). I work pretty closely with the hiring manager and have projects here and there with them. 

I reached out to them to see if they could meet briefly to discuss the position and have them answer a couple of questions I had before I applied. 

We met, they answered my questions, we laughed, talked about how we both started at the same company years ago and are now where we are. 

They said to me at the end “I think this would be a great opportunity for you. I think you would really like this position. Your experience correlates very well with the position. Please apply to the position.” Followed by an email stating they are happy I reached out. 

Well. I applied to the position and have heard absolutely nothing from HR. I emailed the manager I met with previously and showed my continued interest and asked if the position was filled. 

They basically just responded and said “thank you for reaching out. I have confirmed that your application was received.” 

Soooo does anyone think I may not even hear from HR?? Does anyone know the internal hiring process?"

Market is VERY tough these days, I keep seeing layoffs happening left and right. It is completely normal to see 200+ applications on a job post within 1 hour of being posted.

I have sent about 80+ applications to jobs in that best match my skills and passion. 80+ might not seem that much in 4 months compared to others out there. However, I have completely dedicated a lot of time to each application making tweaks and updates to my resume and cover letters.

Surprisingly enough, this job was not posted anywhere on the internet. I was contacted by a recruiter and went through the whole pipeline process.

I can honestly say that my patience and sanity was running out of time. I feel happy and incredibly lucky to have landed a job that looks very aligned to what I was looking for.

For all those out there still unemployed I have this to say: 

-Don’t listen to those throwing out cliches quotes about not giving up, lazy motivational quotes will create a false sense of hope.
- It’s OK to take daily/weekly breaks. Your mental strength is top priority
- Make yourself noticeable. Update your LinkedIn and other sites (SEO yourself man)
- When being interviewed: LESS IS MORE. Don’t be stupid and overshare.
- Learn how to be a concise and effective storyteller 
- BE YOUR FUCKING SELF.

Adios 

Happy Passover."

I then asked if I could just do a 30 day resignation instead and he said that I can choose to ""walk out on him"" if I wanted to but it would be a decision that will ""screw me over in the future."" 

Last week I ended up in the hospital and I am finding it increasingly difficult to work this job. I don't want to leave on bad terms because my boss very verbally abusive and I'm worried about the threats he made to harm my career when I'm just trying to take care of my health and my family's health.

I recently agreed to take a new job, after passing recruitment process. My biggest, if not only, motivation for change was salary, which will be bigger by one third in new place. So i informed my current employer about my resignation to start my notice period.

However my manager has been asking me about my reasons to leave, and they were also to get back to me with the counter offer. Yesterday, instead of being offered the raise on their end, they asked me about my desired salary 'to make me stay in current company'.

How should i approach this? I don't want to give any answer and let myself be dragged back to the company. I already sent resignation letter and i want to finish this whole process (also i would fear being sidelined and humiliated after taking their counter offer). Unfortunately i already disclosed that salary was the only major factor in my decision to leave the company. What should i do in this case? I tried to google it but couldn't find any similar cases.

Thank you in advance for the replies.

I'm occassionaly able to pass take-home assignments and the screening stage. But when it comes to the in-person stage, nobody wants to take me on. There will always be a normal candidate who can talk properly. They will always choose that candidate. Why would they hire me when they anticipate all sorts of problems I'll have because of my predicament? Even if its a remote job, they will anticipate problems with communication.

I've even told companies who offer a high hourly rate, that I'll do the job at minimum wage and in double the time (I've submitted assignments in less than 50% of the time they've given me). They still reject me after the in-person interview. If they can't even accept that attractive offer, the odds of me getting a job are 0.

What do I do? Does this mean I am never going to have a job in my entire life? I've even been rejected at blue collar jobs because of this. How does someone like me survive then!?!?!?"

I have been in for a tour of the school - which felt more like an interview itself. 
I then completed a formal interview on one day. Was invited back to observe and support for another half a day, and then was required in for a whole day to teach, observe and support. 

I thought that would be it, but I received another email asking me to go in to the school again for another day to gauge my interaction with the students.

They're not huge corporations, so I doubt screening software is used, and they're not seeing hundreds of applications from my experience working in independent schools.

I saw an ideal posting that had been up for a bit over a month, somehow missed it. I applied as quickly as I could and normally, I'd wait a week or two before following up. I want to get my name in front of a hiring manager ASAP as they may already be setting up interviews/interviewing. Would it be too soon to reach out 3 business days (5 calendar days) after applying or should I stay the course and follow up after a week? I can't tell if my anxiety is trying to rationalize reaching out earlier or if that might actually be beneficial. I applied on a Friday, which I know is not ideal, so I wouldn't want to follow up on a Friday as well. I know every school is different, but I know some schools will collect resumes for 3-4 weeks then set up interviews, so it would be nice to know whether I missed the boat or not.

I also can't pin down who my direct report or hiring manager would be as there are 2 people with positions/titles that COULD be my direct report. There is no consistency across titles of independent schools. Most advice I see is for jobs that see hundreds of applicants, and the applicants themselves send out hundreds of resumes. I might apply to 5 jobs this hiring season, max, and independent schools are a little more interconnected, for what that info's worth.

TLDR; I'm tempted to follow up earlier than a week because of how long the job has been posted. Similar jobs I've applied to have a 3 week priority application period, and this has been open over a month."

Very small amount of experienced professionals in the industry at the moment but I believe it is going to expand very soon.

I have been working for my current employer for the past \~3 years and I love it for the most part, not many complaints other than being hired on at a lower salary that I would have liked since I was told I was young (22 at the time). My current employer has been the industry leader in this sector for the past 30 years, but is now behind competitively due to slow product development according to market needs.

I was reached out to by a recruiter at a younger company everyone in this sector knows very well, they are making the most advanced products on the market across many different industries. They asked me to interview (I did), went through 3 rounds, then they said they'd like to extend an offer, this process was over 1.5 weeks, very quick. After each interview I was told I'd hear back in a week, but instead I was called the same day to schedule the next interview each time.

The stipulation is that I am required to move to Los Angeles so I can be close to their office and go in m-f 7am-4pm.. That's fine for the right price, but this role requires 50% travel across the US and I mainly would serve as an account coordinator. The cost of living in los angeles is so much higher than my current situation, like 300%. I'd be able to do my entire job remotely and travel from here in Northern California.

During the negotiation phase, I brought up the fact that I'd take a lower salary to work remotely, instead they countered by offering me 15k more than the previous offer to move to LA. Still not enough to justify moving. I re-countered explaining my reasoning on why I'd need an additional 20k on top of the 15k to justify a move to LA and how my experience warrants that as well. The salary I'm requesting is justified in my mind, asking me to leave an extremely prominent company in many industries, asking me to move to LA AND commit to travel 50% of the time AND be in the office 7-4 m-f with no flex schedule when I'm not travelling. And the new potential employer is a tech company based in China, so my level of risk is higher as political climates tighten. Their 401k contrib is also 1/4 of my current employers.

 I sent the last counter email on Thursday night, it is now Tuesday afternoon and I have yet to hear back. I also tried calling the recruiter today and my call INSTANTLY went to voicemail. Is it typical for a recruiter to ghost like this after being so enthusiastic to bring me on board?

It would be probably the best possible entrance into sales, I could get. I already lean naturally into sales, in my daily life, but ultimately haven't really worked in it. I also have at least one really good example that I use.

But this interview is the team being *really* nice, and giving me a second chance, when I got too lost to make it to the previous one.

So I'm trying to really wow them, as much as I can. I was told to bring copies of my resume, which I'll be printing out tomorrow. But I'm wondering about bringing a list of highlighted selling points about me, and providing it to them either with the resume, or at the end of the interview.

Would this be seen as presumptive/ insulting/ negative in some way- like implying they couldn't do their own job? Or would it seen as good sales acumen/ a plus/ being prepared?"

Urgent!,u/terrierthrowawaybu,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12c5u7e/should_my_friend_resign_or_be_fired_from_her_job/,jobs,"My friend is in a horrific corporate job with a horrible manager. She worked there as an intern on another team and had a wonderful experience and was a top performer. For her full-time role, they relocated her to an office that has nearly a 50% turnover rate so far in the last few months. She is miserable and her manager has stepped out of line on multiple occasions, and is withholding crucial information on my friend’s performance review about why she didn’t complete tasks on time.

My friend got a meeting put on her calendar recently for 9am with her manager and HR. She anticipates being fired. The tricky part is that she loves the company and wants to work for them in the future at a difference office, similar to her internship. If she is fired (which they will claim is for performance) she’ll have little to no chance of being rehired and will have to explain herself in new job interviews. She has a paper trail and has documentation of her manager acting inappropriately. My friend’s internship managers and colleagues boasted about her, though, but if she is fired it will go in her employee file.

If she resigns, she can spare her reputation with the company. The problem is she won’t get severance pay or health insurance coverage — she’ll have to pay for COBRA if she resigns. She’s stuck in her lease for a few more months but has other means of income, albeit not nearly as much. 

I recommended that she resign to spare her image because her manager is truly out to get her. I’m starting to question if the severance pay is worth it while she finds something new.

What do you recommend? Advice please! We don’t have much time to decide."

I’m working in the IT department in a small local company and I’m coming up on my two year anniversary. I work under one manager and have two coworkers. 
I have a different position, technically, but my position frequently bleeds into theirs and I am fully able to complete all the same duties.
Following our January audit, they let our two technicians go and they were recently replaced. 
I made a joke to the newer technicians today about my pay and they just looked at me, stunned.
Turns out they are making, at minimum, three dollars more than me an hour as TEMPS (because our company does a three month temp-to-hire for new hires).
This is concerning for several reasons. I frequently feel like I’m working in a sausage party and other female coworkers in other departments have suggested to me that they feel uncomfortable approaching my manager because of how he responds to them. 
At this point, I have seniority (having been at the company even longer than our manager), am cross trained, and have two degrees (even though they are not in IT concentrations).
It’s starting to feel like I’m under appreciated for the work I do because I frequently have to split my time between different duties. Am I overreacting assuming I should be being paid more even though my job title is different?"

I have been a classroom teacher for the last 10+ years working for the same school district and part- time/ seasonally have done curriculum development work for that same school district. I claimed the seasonal work as instructional design experience/job title on my resume and was honest that it was part time/ seasonal . My concern is that when it comes time to verify employment,  several  things may not match exactly.  1) this "" position"" was basically volunteer work for at least 7 of the years ( that's how it is in education).  I only have a par/ time sheet/ proof I was  actually paid for this work for the last 3 years.  2) No one I've done this work with still works for the district.  3)I'm not even sure the seasonal work has an actual job title as my main teacher role supercedes it, 4) for employment verification,  how crucial is it that this all matches? 

I will have my  masters degree in Instructional Design that can be easily verified via official transcripts and I have indeed been employed by the district for the dates listed.  I guess I'm just worried that hr will only be able to confirm me being a teacher and not an Instructional designer. I swear I didn't inflate my job title,  I really do this work in addition to being a teacher,  but I'm afraid that's how it will come off. I have a fingerprint clearance card and no criminal record."

As normal, some coworkers are wonderful to work with, others I will work with, but not by ""choice"". Before starting, I told the company I had some experience in the industry, but not much.

Anyway, there is one coworker at this internship that makes me nauseous to work with. I would rather have appendecitis/ get assaulted by a dog than work with this coworker. This coworker is short tempered and even the supervisor said that this coworker is known to be mean to interns. The coworker got mad because I asked clarification questions, and got mad because I was taking to long to set up the equipment. I worked with this coworker for 4 days in a row, and it almost made me want to quit the internship. Since this is a field job, its not like I can try to avoid this coworker, since I need the ride back. The coworker's grandpa is the owner of the company, so this coworker is not going anywhere.

Is it rude for me to ask the supervisor to not work with this coworker during the internship? I am giving up on this coworker to early? If i ask, will I be sinking this internship?"

I'm in a design field.

The work was chill yet extremely monotonous, and I hated in general how far everything was from each other (I'm from the northeast) as I didn't have a car. I got extremely lonely and depressed, eventually eating barely 1 meal a day until my partner showed up. I also had my apartment broken into the first week I moved in and lost $5k in electronics and 2 years worth of work.

I got a return internship offer for this summer, this time for a team that I know will be more interesting and a little bit more related to what I want to do. But I had such a bad experience last summer that I'm scared to continue. I would ideally intern and eventually live+work in NYC (where the work is a lot more inline with what I want to do), and I'm afraid taking this offer will pigeonhole me into staying with this company after graduating because it's the safe move.

What I really want to do is work in NYC, but the options I have there pay much less and are more risky (though there are a lot of them). But all my friends and family will be there, and a big problem for me last summer was isolation and loneliness.

What should I do? This has been stressing me out tons as they gave me less than a week to respond to the offer and I've been having breakdowns remembering my last summer in the Bay. But it's totally possible that I'm remembering it to be worse than it is."

3,2023-04-05,Feeling lost with job situation,u/Substantial_Guide444,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12cbi7r/feeling_lost_with_job_situation/,jobs,"Rewind 8 months ago - I was told in a meeting that my work ethic was great and things were looking good for a promotion, that I would be commencing training and running shifts in a few months. 

A few things happened - assistant manager left work unexpectedly, other people were pushing to run shifts and sort of left me in the dark - my confidence took a bash and I stopped pushing and focused on my daily work. 

I finally worked up the courage months later to push for the promotion again, then someone else rejoined the business and took a management position over me. 

After all of these months waiting for things to happen I was criticised for 'coasting' at work when I definitely lost motivation due to the position and extra roles being filled in by everyone else. 

Fast forward to now -i finally pushed again and I was told we would have a scheduled meeting in a week to discuss moving up within the company. 
In the interim I get a job offer at another company, go to an interview, I failed to get the higher up position due to lack of experience (that I would have had in my current role if they actioned their promises) but the new employer created a duty manager position for me, with a salary increase of 15k annually, but was told I had 24 hours to accept. 

I failed to mention the interview to my current boss. I approached my other manager with concern about what my new salary would be with my current workplace needing to know before I made the decision to jump ship...my other boss called me saying she was shocked somewhere is willing to hire me without an interview, and I lied about it saying I didn't do an interview. 

I felt so bad for lying that I came clean and said I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to hurt anyone in the business (small business we are like family) or hurt my chances of promotion or being taken seriously.

Today we had that scheduled meeting and my current employers have said the following ""we now can't offer you the position due to lack of trust"" ""you are going back to your sneaky ways"" ""how can we relax at night knowing your in charge when you lie"" ""you will need to work here and earn back our trust""

They didn't even have a contract or an employment offer for me today as I expected, no counter offer. I asked for a timeline of how long I would need to work for in order to 'build trust' and there is no timeline. They then proceeded to tell me what their plans were for promotion including trips away all expenses paid for training, which I now am not eligible for.

I am feeling extremely attacked and invaluable to this company now and have chosen to pursue this new role. 

Has anyone ever experienced this? I understand it's wrong to lie and I should have been upfront as these people are like my friends. But on the other side I can see some people agreeing with keeping things like job searching private. 


Thankyou. Please be respectful as I am currently feeling very low."
1,2023-04-05,Question related to interview,u/InternationalEdge8,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12cbsp7/question_related_to_interview/,jobs," 

I recently had interview with one of client from classboxes. So, I had applied via Indeed and had received interview from one of their client. If you don't know than classboxes is consultancy company. I didn't knew much about classboxes and only looked at glassdoor reviews. The position was for entry level position.

Here are things that made me angry and I want your opinion of what should I have done.

In the interview, I was started asking questions related to Springboots and RestAPI Annotations. I had already clarified them before interview that I do not know much about Springboot and I only used in during class project but they said they will provide me every training.

So, in that Interviewer started asking me basic questions which I answered correctly. After that, he started asking me questions that not anyone having little experience will know. He started asking me how to integrate program using Hibernate framework, describe every annotations that Springboot use and when you use annotations, how do you inject dependencies, list me names of dependencies, etc. At certain point, I got fear and the interviewer madly shouted at me that you don't know anything and you didn't even prepared for interview. When he asked me questions related to Rest annotations at the end, I was correct to my answer but the interviewer started saying that no you are wrong. This is wrong answer. correct answer is this. And he literally kept shouting at me. At the end, when i was asked question that does Springboot uses java7. I said yes. than that interviewer told me this shows you do not know anything about Springboot and everyone will laugh at you. It uses java8. I was so shattered with the confidence that I didn't knew if I was right or wrong.

After interview ended, i looked up to some of the questions but I was indeed right. I am feeling to reach out to this interviewer. Do you know what should I do? Because I have applied at other companies as well but I never saw this type of reactions from any of interviewers. In fact, I have 2 job offers line up and I only interviewed because this application was submitted very long back.

I also work full time as a software engineer for a large tech company. I started as an intern and asked to stay, and they said yes. They let me work while enrolled as a student, but I was informed that they will be laying off employees and my continued employment is dependent on receiving my diploma in June. I have exactly one year of experience as a software engineer, and also worked as a data scientist for one year in 2019.

I recently learned that due to some small issues, I will NOT be graduating this June. So clearly I need to look for a different job. I am unsure what to do honestly, because who would want to hire someone who is in the middle of his degree? My bachelors degree was physics.

Should I include my future MS degree on my resume. How should I phrase this? Should I apply to ""New Grad"" positions. I'm at wits end."

“I hope all is well! Thank you for completing our request for references and I am confirming that we have received them. As you may know, we have multiple openings for the [position of interest 1A]. We would like you to submit your application for another posting: [position of interest 1B]. Please note that this role is identical to the [ position of interest 1A] that you previously applied for. 
We look forward to further considering your candidacy for this role, and please let me know once you have submitted your application. Do not hesitate to reach out with any questions regarding the search process. ”

…is this a soft rejection or a hint at a potential offer? Eg. this is the typical, ‘we’re going with another candidate for this position but we encourage you to reapply’, or for whatever reason thing or glitches on their end are being worked out and they need me to resubmit the application so we can all move forward? I don’t know what to think, especially after reading it multiple times to the point where I can see the tone going both directions. Or given that there is another candidate but they want to further consider me for another opening, am I back at square 1 in the application process? 

I ended up resubmitting my application materials about seven hours after receiving the message. I know certainty is a rarity in the job application/hiring process, but the open ended ambiguity and suspense is killing me since it’d obviously be awesome to have the job.

I'm interviewing for an accounting position. It's somewhat entry level. They say they want their candidates to have ""proficient"" knowledge in Excel in the job description, however I was told by a recruiter it's not totally necessary and they'll train the right person from scratch in all aspects of the job as long as they're coachable.

This was echoed in my phone interview last week. The HR lady acknowledged I don't have any experience in the field when she phone interviewed me. She had my resume in front of her. She said it's okay, we'll train the right person as long as they have a good attitude, blah blah blah.

I don't have any experience in Excel as my current field isn't office type stuff. I took an Excel course a long time ago, but since I don't use it in my day-to-day life, all that knowledge left me.

Well, HR sent me a link of an Excel Assessment Test to complete at home before my interview. I just took it and pretty much bombed it. I got a 60% and got a ""moderate knowledge"" ranking. It was timed and the questions flew by so fast. And there were questions within the questions. I basically couldn't keep up and didn't even finish it before it timed out. Sigh.

My in-person interview is tomorrow. How should I address this subject. Am I basically screwed? I basically don't even want to go to the interview now. What's the point? I couldn't even pass their preliminary excel test.

What do you guys think? Is it hopeless or is there still a chance I could be hired?

Edit to add: I did attempt to freshen up my Excel knowledge over the last two days but since I was cramming so much info in in such a short time, I don't think it did much good :/"

Unfortunately with the lack of documentation, and tasks that simply cannot be done without the approval or assistance of a manager, I have to spend a lot of time shooting out questions for assistance or answers to a lot or other coworkers. Response time can vary, but most of the time it's really long, especially from my manager.

I am also in a customer facing position over the phone and it can be embarrassing to leave customers on the phone for as long as 30-40 minutes, sometimes eventually telling them that I will have to call back with more information. It can take an entire day to get a response back from some people, sometimes getting information that didn't even help me, and sometimes having to message people multiple times (my questions have gone completely unread/forgotten before).

Is this normal at all? I really only try to ask questions about institutional knowledge in my position, and for tasks I genuinely cannot complete without a manager's sign off. I pride myself in replying back to messages pretty quickly and with as much information as I can provide, and so far my experience is that the working world doesn't seem to value these traits."

After me and a colleague of mine had been summoned for a training, my boss didn't agree with my colleague coming to the course as well, but still said ""that's fine"" except then after 10 minutes ""force"" my colleague, by telephone, not to participate in the course in question.

The same evening I sent a whatsapp message to my boss saying: ""Doctor, however, I was disappointed that you changed your mind about Nick's course...I thought there weren't any problems, anyway, that's okay, it will be for another time"" ..

immediately after my manager replies: ""john, you are taking a bad turn: O'Riordan, you are meddling in matters that are not yours. John, do not cross the lines. ""

I then reply saying: ""Oriordan without an apostrophe... and I didn't understand what the non-mine matters would be I would also like to understand what the bad path I have taken would be, so suddenly when you praised me until yesterday , and also the speech I'm butting in and what lines do I risk not crossing, but it's like a threat I don't know""

and he says: "" john, don't use disrespectful words. Then, if you want to be less respectful with me, I have no problems: we'll see what to do! And with that we are done. Good night. ""

after this exchange of sentences on whatsapp, he blocked me on whatsapp, and does not respond to my company emails. Since then I have taken advantage of some family leave that I had not yet taken until now.. Is it normal for a manager to respond like this? I had just written that I was sad that my colleague could no longer come to the course with me, after he had said it could be done.

moreover, he also seems to be arrogant saying that if I'm going to disrespect him, he's ready for what to do!

I'll have to go back to work in a few days, and I honestly expect him to ignore it, as he's already done with others in these situations, but having to deal with such an executive well worries me , above all because it is not a private company, but a public and state one"

However, even if I babysat 5 days a week without any time off I would still fall below the poverty line. Therefore, during my free time I would be applying to entry level sales jobs without much experience.

I just had a job interview the other day. The interview went very well and I'm cautiously optimistic I will receive an offer. However, at the end of the interview they stated that their HR department takes forever to approve decisions and it could be several weeks to several months before they can even confirm whether they want to move forward. I also know they will probably need to check references and take other onboarding measures after I hear back from them. This makes the timing difficult since my wife is pregnant and we are expecting the baby to come in early July.

I really need this job as it pays significantly more than my current job, is a closer commute, and would have me working on projects I'm excited about. Which means I need to play this right.

In addition, a friend who works at the same place but in a much different department told me that I SHOULD mention the baby since this particular organization would a) think I'm a ""responsible family man"" and b) likes having people work there for long terms and people with children are more likely to do so.

I'm thinking of sending them a follow-up email with typical follow-up points ""thank you for the interview, do you need more information or references, etc."" but wanted to get some more opinions on whether I should include info about the pregnancy or wait a little longer. The interview was just 3 days ago too.

EDIT: The consensus opinion seems to withhold the information until either I receive an offer or start the job which makes sense to me. My only concern is what to do if the proposed start date is the same time as the expected birth. I know everyone's situation is going to be different but if there is any general advice on informing a new employer of an upcoming birth or starting a new job at the same time you are becoming a 1st time parent, it would be greatly appreciated. I know I'm also getting ahead of myself here as there is no offer yet but please entertain my hypothetical situation.

FINAL UPDATE: The overwhelming consensus is wait until I at least get an offer to mention this. Other helpful advice included trying to negotiate my start date to allow for time to spend with the baby. Others also pointed out that FMLA most likely won't be available so soon after being hired but in this case, it will be worth it since the pay, location, and work itself is a massive improvement over my current job and will allow me to better provide for my family in the long run.

After 3 years of exp, I'm unsure what direction/industry I should pursue",u/freedumb45,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12cojba/im_techoriented_with_cad_drafting_3d_modeling_and/,jobs,"Hello all! I was told I should consider posting here for some career advice.

So, a little background: I have a BFA in woodworking, but after a couple years doing essentially hands-on fabrication labor, I decided to transition out of that field and into a tech job at a desk. I prefer the deskwork/computer work pace over hands-on labor, and since the pandemic have concluded that I want to remote work. I currently do ind. contractor work doing CAD drafting, 3D modeling and rendering. When I search for jobs however, my ""weakspot"" is my lack of formal education doing this kind of work as well as not having experience with the whole gamut of toolsets used in these industries (my working experience doing this work is limited to using Autodesk ACAD and Inventor, and Lumion for rendering, I don't have experience yet using more industry standard programs, but I know that I have the skills, just with different programs.)

So i've been sorta pigeonholed for the past couple years and when I look for other work I get easily demotivated when I see lots of jobs doing the same kind of work but requiring experience with other programs (or formal edu). Indeed/ZipRecruiter and other job listing websites feel like a bit of a crapshoot sometimes. I have been told to ""look for the companies you want to work for, and just apply there"". However I don't know what those are or where to look for them. I have strong confidence in my skillsets and my ability to quickly learn new programs if needed. But I just don't know how to leverage that fact into getting a better job for a company I actually want to work for. Right now the industry I'm in is manufacturing. I'd like to be in a more artistic/creative industry where my BFA and understanding of design fundamentals could be better utilized.

My favorite thing to do in my current job is 3D model and rendering. I realize that Blender is a program that does both of these things and have done some youtube tutorials so I have a basic understanding of how to use the program, but would love to learn more. It's just hard making time to self-educate and I struggle often with motivation. I know on-the-job experience using the program would expedite my learning. I often think about how if I could just convince an employer to take a chance on me, that I'd be a valuable asset. I'd even take an unpaid internship at this point if it were the right company.

Anyways I'm starting to just ramble now. Hoping for some advice from people with similar experiences or doing this kind of work, anything would be helpful.

Thanks!"

Long story short I do indirect sales by offering  companies our financing, basically they offer our financing to their customers. 

The thing is there are multiple lenders like mine that give much stronger compensation to the companies for using them. Basically we're not buying deals because the rate sheet we offer to the companies are just sub-par. 

I get paid 70k a year plus commission and we have about 7 sales managers like myself doing about 2-20 deals a month. (which is horrible)
My issue now is I'm so completely demoralized from creating this partnerships and then having them fail bc of our shitty programs that I just don't do it anymore. 

My manager doesn't check in on me and the VPs or the company basically said on the last call ""were not going to penalize you for not doing deals"" pretty much saying you don't have to work. 

It's been 5 months like this and I'm so fu king bored and depressed. I feel like I have 0 purpose.. But I'm making good money not doing anything. 

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? I don't know what to do bc I don't want to give this up and yet I'm just kind of lost."

What do you do when you don't want a job because you know JOB, but you want a job because you want spending money? I have anxiety and the only jobs I really qualify for are customer service jobs, those are the only jobs that pop up on my Indeed and I don't know where else to look for jobs because I'm afraid to have a customer service job again because I've been screamed at many times in the past and have been sent home for crying when a customer screams at me many times. 

What am I supposed to do? What kind of jobs should I look for? And then this whole search for a job is stressful and shooting at my self-esteem. Most jobs don't get back to me and jobs that do will smile in my face at interviews act as if they love me and then ghost me. I don't know what to do. 

I thought about doing gigs or odd jobs online, but I have no skills for those things I believe and I also think they will take some time before I generate any income from those.

Recently the company I work for has started making sales reps charge a setup fee for every customer regardless of if they stay in the store or ask us for help setting up or troubleshooting a device.

This was originally sold to reps as a “customer driven” choice 

So if they ask we charge it and do what is needed to assist.

Now after being reprimanded “multiple times” for not charging a customer who didn’t need any help at all, I’ve been told it’s a mandatory charge for everyone that walks through the door.


I have morals and I have a standard for what I see as fair, and this doesn’t seem right to me in the slightest, it’s even become a sales metric in which the company can judge our performance on it now.

Does this seem right to anyone?"

The company made it no secret that they were bleeding money and I just happened to be one of the people that got let go.  My question are:

* How important are job history titles? If I take an easy to gain position, say factory worker, will it look like a bad record? Obviously, having no income is not great financially.  I have no doubt that I could get a mediocre job.  I'm reliable, I learn tasks quickly, and could pass a drug test.  But I also know that going from job to job can also look bad on your history. That brings me to my 2nd question  

* How do you approach a potential mediocre job that you don't plan on staying at for long?  It feels disingenuous to feign your interest to get hired only to turn in your 2 week notice once a good job is offered. That's especially true if they take the time to train you up.

It’s just so controlling. I’m telling you months in advance i will not be there, and i will not be there. Figure it out.

Edit “Unpaid Time Off” AKA Anytime you’re not there, is not something you should need to earn. A very clever play on words that keeps you there when they want you there no matter when.

My issue is, I currently make around 100k  but hate my job. I ideally want to make 80k but I think 75k is the lowest I go.
The position I interviewed just interviewed for had an approved salary rang of 70-80k. They made me confirm that I was interested in the salary before getting an interview. Should I what is the approved salary range before applying?"

The pandemic has had lasting effects as I transitioned to a new team during the pandemic and our department is still 90% remote which I feel has really stunted my professional growth. Also throw in some of the usual corporate america work issues we all have to go through. I work for larger older company so there is job stability there but I think I just need a change, I seem to ways be taking 2 steps forward and 1 step back.

82,2023-04-05,$150 fee for training…not reimbursed,u/pisey54,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12csnfc/150_fee_for_trainingnot_reimbursed/,jobs,"I’ve been applying to many “front desk agent” jobs that say they are paying $20-25/hr but they hit you with the “you have to pay for $150 training and costs will not be covered.” Ummm this sounds shady as hell. If the job requires it but doesn’t help you pay for it and doesn’t explain why they cannot cover the costs for you then why should people want to work for them. Can somebody maybe in HR explain this to me?

I was already bamboozled once by a job recruiter like this who first said that I needed to pay $150 for OSHA 30 training. But once I went in for the interview they told me it was $300. I wonder how many people have fallen for this thinking this is normal. I haven’t gotten anything out of paying the $300 mind you but I’m taking it on the chin because I admit I was naive. So a few weeks later, after getting so many calls where they all insist I need to pay $150 for CPR training I’m sure it’s a scam.

EDIT: thank you for the responses everyone. I understand it’s a scam. Yes I admit I was naive but I know I’m not the only one who’s gone through this and felt pressured or was unsure. Everyone learns lessons differently and not everyone has someone to teach them these things about the workforce. I appreciate those who have been helpful and shared insights with me."

Hi everyone,

I'm currently a freshman in college with a mechanical engineering internship, and I also had a mechanical internship before this one. However, my passion actually lies in electrical and computer engineering. Unfortunately, the high school I graduated from only had a machining program, which propelled me into the world of mechanical engineering and manufacturing and gave me a solid background in both.

Recently, I have been looking for an internship opportunity to break out of my mechanical background into the electrical/computer engineering industry, and have received an offer from a company in electrical engineering that seems honestly really solid. The only caveat is the pay is $15/hr, while my current internship is $16/hr, going up to $17/hr soon.   I live in South Florida, for reference. I'm aware the knowledge I can gain is invaluable in comparison to money, but I was just wondering if that seems pretty low in general for the field. I believe taking the pay cut for the experience already would be worth it, but I just seek advice from the more seasoned career professionals on this subreddit, so I am sorry in advance if this question comes across as a no brainer. 

 I would greatly appreciate any insights and experiences you all may have. Thank you in advance!"

So for some context I am working in a corporate and the salaries are reviewed on yearly basis with some rare exceptions mid year. My current boss just changed position within the company and I have a new one, but today I had my last meeting with my current boss which was a salary review.

I am among the top performing employees in my team and my performance review was also great. Yet my salary review was disappointing (not even half of yearly inflation while the currency here is also depreciating).

I voiced my disappointment and tried to negotiate with my my old boss and she was nice but she told me that it is not negotiable although she understands my concerns.

Right now she sent me an official email with the numbers and included the new boss in the copy.

Is it appropriate/good idea to politely send her  a reply with my disappointment in the salary review, while also giving arguments why I am disappointed? I would like to do it so at least they are really aware of it (and especially so my new boss now that I am trying to aim higher)

Thanks for any advise."

While I was telling details to HR, the girl says: ""I'm surprised because no one ever reported that kind of attitude from that person"".

There were tasks he had given me that day but I didn’t fully finished them, there’s only this much I can do in working hours. I’m currently working on a dairy farm (it’s just him and I) and it’s a lot of work to be done yet I’m invested in the job (I’ve found myself to enjoy it even) and I don’t slack, I’m regularly on time and am willing to work one weekend out of two.
So, I’ve briefly overheard my boss speaking in a low voice to his girlfriend mentioning something in the lines of I didn’t understand a specific time to do a task and that I only set up a bit of an electric fence (I could basically sense frustration/anger of the « little » I did and was surprised he could speak of me like this).
Now, I’m someone who’s willing to work overtime, even unpaid if need be, in a physically challenging and sometimes dangerous work and found myself shocked to hear such a reaction from him (I’ve had similar reactions which are for me unjustified). 
I’ve been here over a year, but suddenly thought of maybe even selling my motorcycle which I got very recently and head back to my home country because I’m not sure I want to continue to endure undue criticism while I clearly make an effort (even if he made some compliments recently). 

I appreciate you reading me and would gladly hear what your thoughts or experience may be on this.. 
May you all be well !

I am so scared to report him because everyone likes him. :( 

I wrote down all the Incidents with dates and times. I finally broke down and cried and told my boss everything. 

She says she will call her boss, and figure out what to do. She says I wish I came forward sooner, but I was so scared of him.

It's made work miserably toxic.,u/LrdFyrestone,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12cv41a/im_tired_of_my_coworker_complaining_all_day_its/,jobs,"I (28M) work in a chemical plant as an operator. The job isn't bad. It's relatively easy and the shift-work that comes along with it is just part of the job.   


However, I have a coworker who's been working for probably 10yrs where I am complaining about EVERYTHING and he loves to take it out on me. I've gotten to the point I try and roll it off my shoulders but it's turning into ""You don't acknowledge me so I am going to be an absolute asshole to you for no reason."" I haven't been at my job even a year and this guy makes it a living hell. He's in his 40/50's and has this attitude of ""I'm better than all of you and I never make mistakes."" And then if someone does make a mistake he comes back through emails berating the team of five of us saying ""Someone is being unprofessional. This is unsafe. You need to fix this. I'm not fixing it because it's not my problem.""   


And whenever he and I interact, he always has some smartaleck remark to make about work or me. I cleaned my area before shift change the other day and a highlighter fell on the floor by accident, as I'm walking out the door, ""HEY! I'm not your F\*\*\*ing maid. You need to cleanup. I'm not hear to clean all day."" Excuse me, I cleaned up my area and it probably fell when I got up or you walked by?  My response, ""Sorry. Have a good day. Bye."" Another instance, I had to leave town for a week due to a family emergency and told my coworkers I wouldn't be around to help out. I get a phone call on my day off ""What the hell is going with you? Are you helping out or not?"" I told all my coworkers before I left and left a logbook stating so. I communicated. I called work and spoke to my coworker about his rude voicemail. He again started to cuss at me and when he asked me ""Why aren't you here?"" I told him I had a family emergency and his response was ""I don't care. I didn't ask. Are you coming to help or not?"" It made my family emergency 10X worse because of that phone call. 

There have been multiple altercations and yet this coworker tries to say in Behavior Based Performance ""I'm a team player. I like to help my coworkers out."" No, he likes to gripe, berate, and curse at people. He and I have the same job title. He's only got a few more years experience than I do. I have spoken to my union about it and spoken to my boss. The response from both has been to keep notes and if it continues, speak-up again. I've gotten to a point where I don't even want to have any interaction with this person. I can't even do shift-change because I know regardless of what I say or do, I'm going to be ignored, cussed at, or berated. I feel threatened.   


Sadly, I can't really leave my current job for a new position because I'm tied into a contract for the next two years. After almost a year in my current position, I have a list of about 10 or 20 different occasions where this coworker and I have had altercations. And these have been within the timeframe I have been at my job and 10 of those have been since speaking to my boss. I'm not a fighter. I'm not going to go get myself fired over someone else's toxic attitude but I shouldn't have to deal with this. And I know I'm not the only person he's treated this way, he treats all of my coworkers but one person like this. He talks crap about bosses behind their backs. I know of two different coworkers who have left because of his nonsense attitude.   


I wouldn't say I am at my breaking point but I don't know how to handle it anymore? I try to be nice. I try to tell him ""Stay safe"" when I leave or he leaves going home but all I get is this rudeness. How can I be expected to work an already stressful job when he treats me this way?"

I signed offer and gained clarity. What now?",u/ATLBGC,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12cwnet/recruiter_told_me_job_was_hybrid_with_12_days/,jobs,"Hi!

A recruiter reached out to me about a possible 1-2 day on-site hybrid role. 2 days made me somewhat iffy but I decided to go through with it and hear more details about it. 


At my interview the two hiring managers asked “Would you be comfortable with 3 days on site”. I said the  “1-2 days was kind of pushing it for me but 3 days would be a stretch” They then let me know that their company policy is at 3 but their group currently is at 1 day a week. Okay perfect now I’m definitely on board about the job I can commit to one day like their group. 

I got my offer letter and signed it it didn’t have a mention of the days on-site or WFH. No big deal I thought I signed and I decided to ask recruiter what is my 1 day a week going to be in office so I can start planning 
She let me know that it’s Tuesday and the other 1 day if needed would be flexible. I don’t know what the terms of if needed means nor do I want it to be a possibility. Last I heard from the manager was 1 day What do I say? Do I mention the discussion of the hiring manager saying they are on 1 day? Ask her to put it in the already signed offer letter ? Please help!"

The hiring manager reached out recently to give an overview of how onboarding works and to tell me a recruiter would be following up so I'm hopeful I'm getting an offer but the anxiety is agonizing.

At least if it doesn't come through the experience has given me a lot of confidence in interviewing! If anyone reading this is concerned about not being an expert in a given field, critical thinking goes a long way for companies that give a shit, if you can break down a problem you don't have the answer to that's in many ways better than just having the right answer right away since it shows you're actually assessing the problem at hand.

Every single of the 3 jobs I started had cliques of women who followed each other around and never appear to care to speak to the new employees. I have to always put myself out there to learn about the job and ask how things are done but no one ever seems interested in speaking more than a few words to new employees. How are we expected to learn?

Even simple acknowledgment when walking into a room, it’s like people don’t know how to speak and be polite, which is scary because most of my coworkers are therapists and it makes me wonder what kind of qualities they have that got them to literally take a job that requires open communication and empathy. 

Are people like this in every job? Or is it just me not attracting people. I’m very friendly and get along with everyone, never had drama with coworkers ever."

Senior Manager in consulting headed to industry.,u/MooseGoose82,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12cxm50/how_should_i_list_recent_jobs_when_i_have_job/,jobs,"TL;DR I'm a consulting Sr. Manager with several big names on my resume (Deloitte and Accenture), but also a recent history of job hopping. I'm job hunting, but this will be the second job in a row I leave after <1 year. I've been leaving this job off my LinkedIn/resumes but now it's a one year gap. Do I need to just put it on? Or keep leaving it off and basically fill that time with something else on Linkedin/resumezy to avoid looking like a job runner? Or another solution?

More Info... I've basically realized over my last few jobs that consulting is not for me. I knew this might happen when I hit Senior Manager - I just do not want to run this rat race of delivery by day sales by night. I'm willing to take the pay hit.

My recent history is... Accenture from 2019 - 2021, left for a boutique from late 2021 through spring 2022, unemployed spring to August 2022, then with current firm from August 2022 through now.  Current firm is nothing to brag about.

So do I put the current firm on LinkedIn/resumes and look like a job hopper? Or maybe just inflate some volunteer work I have done since April of last year and make it look like I took a year off and focused on that? Something else?"

My department is looking to add a few “level 2” employees and, since it is my new responsibility to oversee and manage the department budget, I am tasked with managing and proposing new hires and their total compensation package.

In a meeting recently I had with finance, the level 2 pay is 10k more than my current salary. I’m a level 3 and also in a highly skilled role. Currently I make just under 100k, in fact I’m actually making the EXACT median amount for my grade and position. All new hires as of ‘23 and on our internal job postings clearly lay out the salary range.

Is there a way, say at the end of my yearly cycle and performance review to make a case for a raise? For context, I’m the only “data analyst” in my department and overall all departments are hiring for my exact position but with a 18k bump from 2022, based on historical figures I can see.
I have had all “excellent” reviews for all my goals, only one of 5 was “met expectations” the rest were “excellent”.

What’s the best way to broach this subject knowing I’m on the budget, and that we CAN raise my salary based on our excellent budgeting process and practices?
I report to the Director who’s a level 6. And I do have 2 other managers whom I report to that give me side projects. The director is new as of ‘23, for more context."

I agreed if they were willing to accommodate me still maintaining certain obligations I had outside of work which they said they would. Until it wasn't working for them and expected me there 40+ hours a week and I was on my ""last notice"". 

I explained I would not abandon my family and personal obligations for a job, especially one that signals my unemployment as soon as its completed. Also I worked in overdrive to make up for the times I would be late or leave early. In reference, the rest of my crew with working 40 hours would collectively maybe match about 60% of my productivity in less. I am responsible for all the layout of the entire job, the technical parts, and installation of the finish products. While the rest of my crew with years of experience above me dead mindless tasks to keep me moving. I constantly have met all their ridiculous timelines with time to spare, only getting ""behind"" when it was lack of material or a task being completed by another trade.

2-Is a contractor job usually time-limited?

3-If things do not work out, would the employer be able to terminate the contract at any point without any given notice and immediately stop paying me, or is the employer obliged to pay me until the end of the contract?

1,2023-04-05,Potential Job Scam?,u/mcdom89,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12d3vk6/potential_job_scam/,jobs,"I applied to a Digital Marketing job listing that was located fairly close to me. It is a paid, part-time position that, from the listing, hampers in on learning marketing skills. Hell, it even has “Free Training” hyphened after the position title. 

I applied a few hours ago on ZipRecruiter and around an hour later, my application is viewed. I get a message back asking me to meet a representative today or tomorrow between a certain time frame. This meeting would take place in the “internet room” of a restaurant I have never been to before or even heard of until now. 

Also since he messaged me, the job listing has been closed. 

I then proceed to do a little more research into the company. Upon googling their business, I found their website. Before entering the website, I get a warning from my browser that this website may be intending to steal my information. I bypass the warning to find that they have a legit looking website, though they have another address located about half an hour from me. Searching the address on street view, there was nothing indicating the digital marketing business was there. There is also a google listing for the business located 2 hours from me in a nearby city with the same thing. On streetview it has no indications of the business being there.

Other than that, this business has little to no online presence whatsoever. Their website does not give any names, nor could I find anyone who worked there on LinkedIn. They also had no social media presence on Facebook or Instagram. 

Is asking someone to meet them the following day hours after replying a legit move? Let alone in the internet room of a restaurant? It just all seems suspicious to me. Especially after looking up the business, if it even is one. 


To me it feels very shady. What do you think?


TLDR; Digital marketing job listing I applied for today asks me to speak with them tomorrow in a sketchy looking restaurant. I find out they have little to no online presence and website delivers suspicious activity warning upon entering. Business also claims to have offices in 3 differing locations."

I’ve received two offers in the past two days for companies that I think could be great places to work and told both that I would review and respond soon.

However, I went through 4 interviews with a larger company that I thought went really well, and haven’t heard back (they said week/week and a half and it’s been just over that).

Is there a way I can follow up with them and say I have other offers but am still very interested if I’m still a candidate for that position? I don’t want to waste two offers but I kind of had my heart set on this job for whatever reason, and I haven’t gotten a rejection so I’m not sure where I stand.

How would I go about phrasing that follow up email?"

I have the opportunity to apply for dual citizenship in Italy if I pay a lawyer, but I would need a job in the meantime since my cash reserves are running low.  


Does anyone have any suggestions on jobs that might accept me? I have been looking to get hired in Software Support or IT Support but I feel like I'm beating a dead horse and I'm open to trying new things.  


I need a job I can do internationally and bring in a bit of cash so I can establish residency and I'm having trouble thinking outside the box. I'm currently living in the entryway of my friend's house where he keeps all his shoes and like I said earlier I'm beginning to go a bit insane.

So I am 22 going to be 23 this year. I’ve been trying to save up money and be prepared to move out. I didn’t intend to move out anytime soon but a company reached out to me for a interview and it’s in a completely different state. 

I currently live with my parents. And with where I live even making 20-25$/hr I’ve barely been able to save much. But I do have a somewhat ok enough saved up for a down payment on a cheap house. I pay for nearly everything like car insurance and rent and my parents do want me to be independent. 

So now interviews went well had 3 separate interviews and all has been well so far. And now I am preparing just in case things do go well. This would be a 70k salary and should be enough to afford a cheap house or at the very least rent. But I very much prefer to buy to get equity and save. 

What are things I could look into what should I mention if they do give an offer and I did mention this throughout the entire process that I do live in a different state. They said they offer relocation and I don’t know if they offer anything else. 

Thank you for any tips and information that you can provide. I appreciate it"

2,2023-04-05,My job reduced everyone’s salary by 10% and added new requirements to receive bonuses..,u/Cheap-Safe,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12d53gf/my_job_reduced_everyones_salary_by_10_and_added/,jobs,"Hii. My job reduced everyone’s salary by 10% and added new requirements to receive bonuses. This started in January, and we are supposed to receive bonuses every month. 

Since January, I have not received any bonuses because there is a new rule that says we have to have perfect attendance basically. So if I’m sick and have to be out for a day, I lose my whole bonus. They also significantly reduced the bonus amounts per sale. Is this a normal thing with companies? 

I, and many of my coworkers, joined this company because they promoted their previous bonus structure to us, not informing us that the rules will change just a few months later. Every day that I work for this company, I make them at least $10,000 with my sales. I’m pretty new to the workforce, so I’m not sure if this is a common thing with jobs. It just feels so unfair. I’m still working with this company but on a new job search atm, because I’m just not making enough money here. 


More info but maybe not so important… after they made the changes I mentioned, they trained me for a new department to make me a universal agent. So I am now working MULTIPLE departments. I’m a great agent and work really hard. I help a lot of people with the work I do. I get a lot of praise by higher ups for how I work, but it’s like they just pay me in extra work. If I finish all of my projects, they send me another agents projects to complete because they’re falling behind. I don’t mind helping, but my work ethic is definitely being taken advantage of. I feel like I was lied to with this whole pay and bonus thing because they clearly knew they were making those changes when they hired us. I just don’t know how to feel about this job anymore. Any help/advice is appreciated. Not sure where to go from here."

Long story short, I’ve landed a new role and I’m exactly 2 months into it. It’s not what I expected it to be like. I’m just not enjoying the environment, the culture and the overall work at all. 

My onboarding process has been very rushed, some of the expectations put upon me have been rushed as well and the direction of manager is very contradictory (e.g. telling me to take time to learn processes, but rushing me to complete tasks that I don’t really understand or know how to do)

I would like to ask for some advice on whether resigning this early into my new job will take a toll on future prospects or whether I should just tough it out. I’m not too sure. 

Ive set up some time to talk through some of the issues with my manager, but would also appreciate some insight from others.

Thanks!"

I've done a tiny bit of digging, looking for posts with advice and such. So far what I've seen is just ""apply online and then go in person and give them your application!"" Is that, absolutely necessary? Can I not hope to land the job just by applying online? Also, how do you know when it's appropriate to go and bother the manager?

My first shift went extremely well: it was a busy night and I was able to make classic cocktails without being told how to do them all while being very friendly with customers. Owner was quite happy.

For context: the owner has recently transitioned his deli into a bar due to lack of custouners and was desperate for young employees.

Third shift: I come in to hear several people are not making the shift, so it’s just me at front of house in this restraunt for about 30 people. Uh oh.

Made some silly mistakes all which are super ameteur: not understanding a certain type of bottle opener, slightly unorganisibg the workspace to what the owner liked and accidentally throwing out a receipt I understood was finished with. On top of all of that, the owner decided tonight would be a great night to bring in new brands of beer, which of course he just expected me to understand.

I was getting fairly flustered and the owner was talking to customers “how can we ever make this place a bar with kids like this”. Not the nicest thing to say but I had made some mistakes so whatever…

Then I make a negronj (premixed! Who tf has premixed negronis?) which was in a barrel with a poorly inserted tap. After I used it, I was very careful to make sure it was closed as it was quite sensitive.

Anyway after running around serving custoumers, he comes to me and just says. You’re done. Turns out the tap had leaked and that negroni was all over the counter. He shows me and storms off into the kitchen, talking about he was so disappointed. I tried to apologise but coworkers just said to go. The last I hear of him is him ranting to custoumers. 

First time getting fired, honestly not. Feeling as bad as I would’ve thought."

When I was hired I already knew the software and I was given a project 1 month in. In these 8 months I worked on fair bit of projects, developed a number of trainings, trained three interns in using the software from 0 experience, currently trying to validate a new software, and I am also writing crap for the company's social media.

I am a junior design engineer. I finished university not even one year ago. It honestly feels like I shouldn't have this much crap piled on me so soon. I have colleagues on the same position as me who arrived before me and still do trainings.

Is it normal to pile so much bullshit on a new hire?? I am insanely tired already, especially seeing how in a lot of cases my opinion is next to irrelevant. In the designs I do, my proven opinion is disregarded. In my social media posts my experience as a freelance content writer is disregarded by my manager who barely talks in English while also taking the credit for my content, even if he's the one who wants those written in the first place.


I started to feel incredibly resentful every time I wake up and go to work. I started to be incredibly angry each time my manager or a project engineer calls me to do some other bullshit I 100% do not agree with.

Is this a common thing and am I just a crybaby for the sake of being one, or is this actually not normal?"

And yet, job sites aren't very great about that - not giving you very specific controls over locations you'd be ok with, multiple cities, certain states, not others, this city area OR remote (at the same time)... etc."

I interviewed with one place (A) a couple days ago and received an offer today, but they said they need an answer by the end of the week (tomorrow). However, on the same day I had my interview, I was called by someone from the other university (B) and scheduled an interview for next week. I definitely like school B more than school A, as well as the position. When I was interviewing with school A, I was also told that it's a temporary position for now, and if I go over x hours they have to discuss whether to keep me on or not. If they decide they still want me, I might have to go through the application process all over again.

My options are:
1. Play it safe and accept offer from school A. If school B offers me the job, rescind my acceptance to school A and burn bridges.

or

2. Maximize the risk on my end and decline the offer from school A.

Are there any other options I'm aware of? What do I do?"

He was offering me a position for maitenance at a new Amazon facility that is about to open up near me. The position is at 32/hr and of course that blew me away because I have done only entry level maitenance before. I asked if there were any certifications I needed for obvious reasons. He said yes, and thats where I mentioned that I dont have any certifications or anything to show I am qualified for this position outside of my previous work history. Well he offered a maitenance position below that one at 27/hr!

He had mentioned in this position I would be trained and taught how to work with conveyor belts and any other general work at the facility. I accepted the offer, and was given a link to take a test. If I pass the test then I would be hired. I took the test and passed with a 47/60 (C+).

Got back with the recruiter the next day and was told this was a high score that would get me promoted quickly if I do well enough at work (I guess a C+ is a good score?). Ill be joining a teams meeting and will be starting later this month.

This sounds too good to be true. I dont think its a scam or anything, but I have no college education and suffer with adhd (Learning can be very hard for me). I have worked some pretty laborious jobs before, but didnt think those skills were as valuable as something like this. The past 3 years I have worked around a $17-$19 wage. To go from that to $27 feels... weird. I feel like Im going to walk in and be out of place and seen as an idiot.

Ive tried SO hard to learn new skills so I can get somewhere in life and not be a loser. It has been impossible for me. To get this opportunity feels wrong. Im going to take it of course and work as hard as I can, but I feel like a fish out if water. Has anyone experienced this before? Am I overthinking this?"

I started looking for new jobs and I just spoke with a recruiter who has a position with much, much higher pay and there is a full team of UX designers.

It could be 3-6 months or it could be two years, I don’t know. The benefits might not be as good compared to my current job.

I have a holiday coming up in a few hours and my boss told me that we have off but I can come in if I so desired to. None of my bosses would be around, it would be just me (or so I believe) 

The company I work for is small, only 3 people in a warehouse 2 of those people are in at all times and the main boss only comes for a few hours and leaves for the rest of the day, the other 2 people would be another one of my bosses who acts as manager for the day to day operations (who won’t be coming in) and me, just a warehouse assistant

Work is slow and I know there will be little to nothing to do but I’m a bit anxious as if I should actually come in or not

I asked if I would get in trouble if I didn’t show up and they said no but both my bosses said the same thing to “come in” if I wanted to 


I honestly cannot tell if they’re messing with me or not and I don’t know what to do

I don’t want to be a bad employee but I’m also not wanting to waste my day off where I could be doing something more productive

1,2023-04-06,Should I take this internal promotion (Counter offer),u/LittleFireman19,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12drcsx/should_i_take_this_internal_promotion_counter/,jobs,"Background: I've worked in hospitality industry (front office in a hotel) for about 6 years. Currently a supervisor for night shift, and am trying to make a change and applied for a day shift supervisory role and got a job offer from hotel B, hence i've resigned from my current company and they give me a counter offer.

The counter offer is to promote me into a mangerial position even i'm inexperienced in resume (but it's not that hard considering my current hotel is a small one and doesn't actually have a lot of customers), raise my salary higher than what hotel B can offer by a very small amount. Usually when it comes to career path in Front office, people tend to be a supervisor for about 3 years before becoming a manager, i only have 1.5 year of experience.

I'm absolutely torn by this. 

Hotel B is a luxury hotel, have higher pay grades so even if i remain as a supervisor my salary is much higher than before, has expensive rooms and have full amenities like restaurants and bars. The con is that i dont get a promotion to become a manager, i will remain a supervisor but once i have another year or two in hotel B, i have much more options to become a manager in other hotels.

Hotel A is a small hotel, i know the hotel inside out, but it doesnt really let me step up my game considering how small it actually is. It also only has rooms, with nothing else, not even a breakfast package. The only pro is that i can shortcut my way into becoming a manager, but honestly i wont have much options to be a manager else where after this as i can only apply to another small hotel.

Half of my colleagues do not show supports as well for this promotion after a brief discussion with them, which also concerns me. They simply think my boss is promoting me based on a desparate staff retention tactic, not actually because he knows my capabilities."

The hiring process was pretty comprehensive and I already answered every potential technical questions I can think of (and was already told my skill set was more than enough for the job).

During my unemployment, I did freelance work that I very much enjoyed, but that didn't pay the bills consistently in that sometimes I could make rent, sometimes not. My parents have been helping me out by paying the difference between my expenses and the money I make from the freelance position since I lost my job, so I'm ok financially, at least until the end of the year. The freelance work could turn into something that could consistently support me, but it might not. However, I don't want to keep relying on my parents for financial support, it's very important for me to be financially independent. I very much enjoy the freelancing work as I want to go into academia and economic research, and the projects that I have been working on have been interesting and relevant to what I want to do long term, which is get a PhD in economics and be a professor.

The associate position is mainly data gathering and number crunching, with a significant amount of logistics and administrative work which I have no experience with (the admin part not the number crunching). I am in line with the mission of the nonprofit, and think what they do is very interesting. The kind of work that I'll be doing in the role isn't really related to what I want to be doing long term nor is it very interesting, but it's steady income and since I will be applying to PhD programs this fall, all I need is a job for a year and a half to hold me until I start grad school.

However, it's not like I really need the money per se, since my parents will continue to help me out, but as mentioned previously being financially independent is very very important to me. If I made enough money from my freelance work to pay all my bills, I wouldn't consider taking the job at all, but that's not the case."

I have a British passport/ am a citizen so it’s not sponsorship that is the issue, but I have had a few interviews where they have asked me when I plan on moving over and my response has always been a long the lines of “as soon as I get job” followed by the fact that ZAR is extremely weak and I wouldn’t be able to afford to live in London pay rent etc without having a job to pay for it. I won’t say it necessarily as explicit as that, but it’s the reality. I don’t have an extra like 50k ZAR a month to just move over and wait. I have enough to move over and secure rent knowing that I have a job and will be able to cover the bills after that, but I can’t afford to just throw like 200k ZAR (that I don’t have) to move over and then not get a job.

I asked the girl what the next steps were and she said the original interviewer should reach out to me on Monday (the beginning of this week).

Sent a thank you email as I normally do. Positive response. Then last week (later than expected on timeline to schedule second) I texted them to check in. Another positive response and would “hear soon”.

Kind of completely losing my sanity at even when things go perfect, there’s nothing on the other side. The job posting is gone, I believe they were hiring multiple people. Just doesn’t make sense and it’s so disheartening

I accepted an office job for an animal dermatology group and thought it would be a great opportunity for me to grow and learn new things even if I would not be working directly with the animals. 

Today is my 3rd day and I have done nothing for the past 2 hours… my supervisor who hired me and is supposed to be training me is not here and I am very limited in the things I know how to do now, and I don’t even know what needs to be done. She said she was finishing up a phone call but hasn’t given me any more instructions and I’m not sure who else to ask since it’s a very small department within the clinic. 

I feel incredibly anxious and worried just waiting here. Am I thinking to much into this? Should I just accept that this job may be slower paced than a busy clinic? I guess I worry that it’s not the opportunity I thought it was or that it will be “boring”. I don’t know where I see myself long term but feel like I should stick it out and see?

2,2023-04-06,Should I Disclose That I Used Chat GPT for my Cover Letter?,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12dwjgl/should_i_disclose_that_i_used_chat_gpt_for_my/,jobs,"Background: I'm 25 and applying to entry level jobs in my field. I have a bachelors of arts in Environmental studies from a college. I hope to get hired for an environmental communications jobs.

Upon Googling: I saw an article say that you can use Chat GPT for cover letters and that it actually looks good if your applying to tech jobs. But they did say you should disclose that you wrote your cover letter with Chat GPT.

Reasoning for using Chat GPT: I tend to have a pretty hard time narrowing things down to write in a cover letter. I also get really bad perfectionistic paralysis (I tend to get paralyzed worrying about how what I write needs to be perfect). So, I thought it would be helpful to have Chat GPT write a base of a cover letter that I can fill in and change with examples and words that are more specific to the job I'm applying to. Also, it is working smarter not harder and obviously I wouldn't use chat GPT on the work Ii would do for the job either- I actually like writing.

Pros for disclosing: I would be demonstrating to my future employer that I am willing to be honest and transparent.

Cons: It might signify that the work I would do for the organization could be plagiarized from Chat GPT even though I wouldn't do that.

Reasons for not disclosing: I honestly highly doubt most HRs would send their cover letters through a plagiarism algorithm- correct me if I'm wrong. It's also just the cover letter and I plan to change it anyways. It's not uncommon for people to plagiarize themselves when applying for multiple jobs because you can basically use the same format of the letter over and over. Overall, it could be changed enough that if it is put through algorithm it could not come up as coming from Chat GPT.

So what do you think: Should I disclose?"

So I got off the phone with a hiring manager this morning. I was shocked to even get an interview with this company for how popular they are when it comes to this certain industry. The job is working as an entry level operations assistant in the subs outside of USA Chicago.

It's been a terrible 11 months now since graduating (so many applications, interviews, and being ghosted so much). This is after I finished graduate school last May and trying to find a full time job back in this industry. I have a masters degree now and tons of experience.

It's in the line of work I exactly want to do (being surrounded by my enjoyment)

The interview went great and I was offered the job on the spot (via phone call). I was shocked this morning (first time this has ever happened- no multiple round interviews/time wasted)

It's a smaller company, and they offered me $40,000 with full benefits/other work perks. I have **Never Negotiated before**, but I know that salary is tough to live on moving across country ( I want to eat as well)

From reading online from various sites the average salary for this entry level operations job says 45.5-57,000 especially living in this state.

I told them I would call back on Monday with an update.  The hiring manager had no problem with that which is nice.

What should I do? Thanks for reading :) Have a great day

&#x200B;

***Update:*** I appreciate everyones advice and feedback. Really means a lot. Unfortunately, after checking in with the hiring manager late last week, after I tied to negotiate he mentioned the company did want to stay in their range of salary offered for the position and couldn't offer any more money. So, I didnt take their offer. I thought most companies would have some kind of range especially when they know their offer is on the lowest end.. Oh well.. On to the next!

Thanks!"

13,2023-04-06,"I feel like I'm being underpaid and undervalued by my owners, but I like my job.",u/ItsNotChu,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12dy2ax/i_feel_like_im_being_underpaid_and_undervalued_by/,jobs,"I have a been working at a franchise store of a retail chain for about a year and a half. i would like to share my experience and get some advice on what i should do.

Pt 1. Underpaid with no commission.

Without getting too much into the specifics, The job itself requires an extensive 3 month long training, teaching in-depth knowledge of the product, sales, medical injuries, and anatomy. the kind of skill set that you think would be compensated for pretty fairly, but it was only about a dollar over minimum wage with no commission, with the cost of living in my area being astronomically high. Instead of commission, we are given the opportunity of a quarterly raise and bonus based off of certain sales performance ratios. which sounds okay, but the ratios themselves are basically rigged. your ratios go up if a customer buys a certain combination of multiple products together, you miss one and your ratios go down. so if a customer comes in just looking to grab one thing, your ratios will go down. If you sell 10 of the most expensive item in the store to the customer, your ratio will also go down because it wasn’t that certain combination of items. So the ratios are not entirely based on your performance but more so what the customer is looking to buy. imagine you worked at a grocery store, and a customer came in to just pick up some milk, unless you get that customer to also buy a pack of condoms and a birthday cake, your ratios will drop. This would be easier if it was a sleazy car salesman type job, but they pride us on not being like that. One of the reasons they tell us why we don’t make commission is because then we would care more about the sale than actually helping the customer. The ratios goals are also set very high, with close to none of the employees achieving them each quarter. 

Pt 2. Full time, no chance at overtime.

My state only requires you to work 32 hours a week to get full time benefits. Even so, when i was promoted to lead (which was only a 50¢ raise) and switched to full time 2 months after i started, i expect to be working 40 hours a week. when in reality i was only scheduled for about 33 hours a week. when i started, the store was also horribly understaffed. so i was confused as to why I wasn’t getting more hours. When i asked to work 40 hours, i was denied. my manger explained it like this, the owners want the schedule flexibility while keeping people out of overtime. so if for some reason i had to cover someone’s shift or if a customer came in a minute before we close, in which we are expected to stay 30mins to an hour late and help them, i was still under 40 hours a week and they wouldn’t have to pay me overtime. When i asked why they want us to stay out of overtime, they said because that’s how they can afford to give us those BS quarterly raises and bonuses previously mentioned. Since then, i have argued my way up to have about 36-38hrs a week, which is better but still not really full time.

Pt 3. Owners, Sales stats

The Owners, are very cheap as you can tell. They are also highly celebrated with the success of the stores they own, even winning some awards.  As a lead, i have access to the sales statistics, where i can see the exact numbers of all the total sales and profits made by each salesperson. In one month, my sales alone made the company more than i make yearly in profit. If i made only 10% commission on my sales i would be making almost 3x the amount i am now. 2x if you minus my hourly pay. of course you run a highly successful business when your employees make you a ton of money and you don’t pay them fairly. not to mention the mandatory monthly zoom call meetings (on my day off) where we get to sit and listen to the owner boast about how well the company is doing.

Pt 4. Social Media

Not long after i started, i took over managing the social media accounts for my store because i had a background in social media and video/photo production (also just a 50¢ raise). I took it over because i saw that the social media accounts for the stores were all god awful. super low quality posts and little to no engagement. Since i took it over, i have increased our social media engagement by over 100%. posting high quality photos and making fun reels and videos. I put a lot of work into it because it’s something that i’m passionate about. My work with the social media pages has gotten me recognized by the corporate company and also many of the high end brands we sell, with them reaching out and wanting to collaborate with me directly. it even inspired some of the other stores in the area to make better content. What started as a side part of my job has become more of the main part of my job. taking up more of my time, even me working on it at home, outside of my work hours. yes, i did it to myself, but the work load was becoming a lot heavier for an already underpaid position. so i talked to my manager about maybe getting a raise or at least being compensated for the hours i put in outside of work. which i figured was a fair request considering that any social media manager position at any other company would be about $50k minimum yearly for the same work I'm doing, which is nothing close to what i make. but alas, i was denied, turns out the owners only care about the ratios. i slowly found out that the owners don’t really value social media as a strong asset to their company and they were completely fine with the crappy low quality posts from before. if i asked to be compensated for my hard work they would say “you don’t have to do all of that”. which in some aspects is true, but I’m literally helping your company grow, a little compensation or even recognition of my hard work would nice. i could just stop doing the work but it’s one of the main parts of my job that i actually enjoy.

Pt 5. The Silver Lining 

Now you might wonder why i put up with all of this. well other than everything i previously mentioned, i really enjoy my job. The owners work at a store that is about 4 hours away so they are never around. I like my coworkers and my manager, we are all really close. it is probably the least toxic, low stress work environment i’ve ever been a part of. I’ve had to deal with a lot of really really toxic work environments in the past and working at this store has been a blessing for my mental health. also working with social media and content creation is a real passion of mine and it allows me to do that for a living. having a creative output at my job is something i’ve never had before and it is amazing. I started my own video production company last year with a friend, and they have accommodated me and given me the time off i need to work on it. this job pays just barely enough for me to pay my bills and still gives me the freedom to work on my company while it’s still getting started. i’ve talked to my manager about leaving and they have actually helped me a ton with job seeking, updating my resume, and writing me recommendations. but, i think a part of me is afraid to leave. I am a lot happier here than i have been at any other job i’ve had.

so, i’m in kind of in a pickle.

what would you do if you were in my position? stick it out until i can quit and work at my own company? leave and find another job that will potentially hinder my mental health and be less accommodating with me needing time to build my company? fight the owners and try to get better pay? Most of the employees are younger school kids and don't really care enough, and the other older employees wont speak up about it. i’m at a loss.

TL;DR: i’m grossly underpaid for the work that i do, but i like my job."

I’m willing to wager that you’ve been asked this cliche of an interview question before. While the answer sure isn’t going to be “probably at another company that pays more”, common answers to this questions usually highlight career advancement and personal growth aspirations.

We’re so busy focusing on what’s happening right now, can we seriously bother to consider what life would be like that far down the road?

**Why?**

There are many practical benefits to creating a 5 year plan, such as confidence, clarity, and a sense of purpose - but most of all this allows you to prioritize your time on valuable experience.

If your goal is to apply for an executive sales position, it’s probably not a valuable use of your time to take on coding projects, right?

Reverse the question and ask, are you currently where you saw yourself 5 years ago?

Here are 5 reasons to build a career plan

**Title**

Without knowing which title your targeting, how can you know if you fulfill the job requirements?

Although you aren’t ready to apply for this position right now, it’s important to understand what's expected of someone in this role. In 5 years time, you want to apply for this position and fulfill at least 60% of the listed requirements. What are you missing and how can you work towards that?

**Role Model**

Sure, you might have someone that you look up to and aspire to be more like, but can you tell me what their career path was? How did they get to where they are today?

Get on LinkedIn and find 5 professionals with that specific title. Look through their career journey to find out what they focused their time on. Did they hold the role that you have now? Where did they go from there? Send them a message and ask for advice!

**Focus**

Now that you clearly understand your career path, you can more effectively decide how to best utilize your time. Is there a project at work that you can get involved with that will help develop skills you’re missing? Is there another job you can apply for that will provide you with those opportunities? Is there a class you can take to fill that void?

**Avoid Stagnation**

Not getting career development opportunities with your current employer? Because of your career planning, you know what’s realistic in terms of career directory. Once you fulfill the requirements of the next step, start applying for opportunities that fit your career plan. No more empty promises.

**Career Story**

Remember that whenever you’re ready to take that next step in your career, you have to explain your decisions up until now. How did you use your time and how has that prepared you for this opportunity. Each story should have a clear connection to now.

Prove to the business that you planned ahead!

&#x200B;

Keep in mind that a career plan is a moving document. You can make updates as you flow through your career journey.

&#x200B;

Now when you’re asked this interview question, you can confidentially answer:

In my career plan, I’ve set a goal to further develop XYZ skills so that I fulfill the requirements of a Senior position. A major reason why I’m excited for this position is the opportunity to gets hands on experience in these key areas.

Anyone else have other reasons or advice when creating a career plan? I'd love to hear them!"

Just a simple question. started a new job(4 months ago) that I love with a company that a love after working at basically a sweatshop for mortgages. Fully remote if I want it to be, very little mircomanganing and easy job.


The thing is though, I'm bored out of my mind. Maybe it's that I'm used to the old job, but I want more to do and want to advance my career. How should I and if I should I talk to my boss about adding more to my plate or even options to help advance my career."

Is it putting in job titles and whatever company comes up, applying regardless. Or do you care more about the company first? For example- a dream company. Great perks,  pay is good. Great company reviews. But they don't have the role you want. So this would be a bridge role. Meaning get your foot in the door, then apply internally once your role becomes available. So again should focus be on job title but it's not your dream company or focus on dream company because once you're foot  is in the door it makes things easier."
0,2023-04-06,Why do Interviews Reward Lying? Honesty isn't always the Best Policy.,u/BennyOcean,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12dzwmu/why_do_interviews_reward_lying_honesty_isnt/,jobs,"Unless you're literally some kind of god-king, you can't tell only the truth and get hired.

Imagine you're asked ""what is your greatest weakness?"" and you respond ""alcoholism"" or ""sometimes I procrastinate so long that I end up just not doing things at all. It probably wasn't that important. Someone else can take care of it. They're probably better at it than me anyway.""

The resume is normally filled with exaggerations and outright lies. When you're a kid they say ""cheaters never prosper"". The reality is that **the world rewards lying and cheating** **right up until the point where you get caught**. So the 'meta' as far as strategy goes is learning how much you can confabulate, lie and cheat without anyone noticing. As long as you can do that, cheaters do indeed prosper.

And it doesn't have to be like this. In fact there are reasons to believe that the current system of job interviews is [actually useless](https://web.archive.org/web/20170409003456/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/opinion/sunday/the-utter-uselessness-of-job-interviews.html) [and doesn't](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/job-interviews-have-become-predictable-and-ineffective) [even help](https://www.thecut.com/2017/04/job-interviews-are-way-less-helpful-than-everyone-thinks.html) [employers find](https://www.ere.net/why-interviews-are-a-waste-of-time/) [the ideal candidates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2018/02/12/job-interviews-dont-work-how-to-rethink-your-interview-process/?sh=1ed807aa32e8) [for their](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2015/05/21/why-job-interviews-are-like-flipping-a-coin/?sh=698171f705db) [open positions](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/science-81-percent-of-people-lie-in-job-interviews-heres-what-top-companies-are-.html). 

Am I upset about job interviews because I suck at them? Yes, mostly that. But also they just don't work. They reward memorization of lines like ""my greatest weakness is that I work so hard and demand so much of myself that I can struggle to find a work-life balance."" Barf. We all know it's bullshit. The interviewers do. Everyone does. It's a case of ""They're lying... we know they're lying... they know we know they're lying""... and yet no one seems to care.

And what does it lead to? Behaviors you encourage you get more of. You're starting off your relationship based on a two-way deception with both sides pretending and pretending not to notice that the other party is pretending and pretending not to notice that we both know we're pretending but for whatever reason we're ok with that.

I don't have a solution but this system is no good. If you punish people for being honest when they're seeking a job then how do you expect them to be honest once they're working for you? If you reward talented deceivers with employment then you end up employing talented deceivers. Do you actually want that type of person working for you? Apparently for most companies the answer is yes."

A friend went through 5 rounds of interviews with a company (Co A) and finished up over 2 weeks ago. The day after the interviews concluded the recruiter called to let them know they should have a decision by the next week. As the end of the next week approached my friend reached out to the recruiter for an update and they punted and said it would be sometime this week. On Tuesday my friend got contacted by another job (Co B) for a potential offer call today. They reached back out to the first company to let them know they had a potential offer coming but as Co A were the first choice wanted to know if there would be an offer by then. The recruiter responded that yes, they would have a decision by that time. This afternoon the recruiter reached out to let them know that a decision hadn't been made because they were unable to reach the hiring manager. Then, when pushed about when a decision would be made said they were still interviewing other candidates and it could be a week or more before they have a decision. My friend really wanted this job but now it seems like the whole thing is falling apart and the story just keeps changing.

A month into the job, management completely changes, and I get handed a bunch of new responsibilities that were not featured in the job description and completely out of my league of knowledge. I didn’t want to fight back and tell them that this was out of my league, so I spent several extra hours a day trying to learn these new skills. My production slipped drastically, and I’ve been routinely chastised by my new boss for my failure to become the team’s web developer by trade.

Due to that fact, I've had the privilege of being able to take 1.5 years off, and now only needing to look for part-time employment. Prior to the accident I was in upper management (financial controller), but have zero interest in going back into that sector, as its a field that is very easy to take home. I'm trying to figure out the best way to go at this in terms of where to spend my time looking. At present I'm using Craigslist, as Indeed seems to want to only let me look at specific fields. I'm hoping to browse everything part-time and start applying to stuff that seems interesting. So, my first question is what platform(s) will work best, keeping that in mind? I'm in a large Canadian city. Second, I'd say I have a very strong resume, but it's all geared towards managemement/leadership. I'm unsure as to how to bring it to more entry-level work. My strategy so far has been to send out emails/messages being completely honest, with the idea that I'll be able to explain over the phone. Finally, can anyone provide anecdotes as to entry-level fields they found interesting?

I'd greatly appreciate any ideas as far as to what type of careers or companies to look into based on my experience/persona.

Initial key points/features of me:

* Late 20s Male
* 5+ years in Technical Sales Engineer (current career, East coast)
* Extroverted - great public speaking and presentation skills
* Good morals
* Bachelor's in Engineering
* Business/sales experience
* Leadership / Project management experience

Starting points for what I'm looking for in my next job:

* \>$100K salary
* Hybrid or Remote
* Not opposed to moving
* Would love a company/job that respects work/life balance

I suppose this would be a good start. Figured it couldn't hurt to ask the community. Hoping for some insight, suggestions or advice from anyone. Thank you in advance!"

Comes to the present. I a few weeks ago, I texted my employer that I’d be back in a few weeks and was asking when would be a good time to start when I get back. No answer. After that, I texted the general manager asking the same thing. No answer. Finally I texted an old coworker. They responded saying they still worked there and they speak to them for me. I was a bit relieved hoping I get a response from either of them soon. After a few days, nothing, so I texted my coworker if there were any updates and they stopped responded to me too. 
I don’t know what happened, or I had done anything to be treated like this. I don’t think I was a bad employee, I take pride in doing well in work and I’ve never been told otherwise by coworker or my manager.

I can always get another job, but this one payed so well and I genuinely really loved working there. So I feel a bit mistreated.

1,2023-04-06,should i lower my expectations?,u/prettybbychim,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12e8945/should_i_lower_my_expectations/,jobs,"basically i am 21 years old and i am chronically ill physically and mentally. i’m working on getting SSDI and i don’t know if i’ll even get approved or when i’ll receive it if i do get approved. only high school education. 

i want to get a job to support myself as much as i can. i currently do pet care but it’s not reliable income-wise. 

is it possible to find somewhere with 4-hour shifts? that would be the best on my body and mind. physically, i would really be pushing it with a regular 8-hour shift and mentally, it’s just not possible right now at least. 

can i request accommodation even if i’m not disabled by law? like sitting in a chair while behind the counter? i’m not sure what other kinds of accommodations are possible in a workplace…

TLDR: are shorter shifts (4-hour-ish) even possible? if i’m not receiving disability benefits or am not recognized as disabled by the government, can i even ask for accommodations? what kind of accommodations might be available for chronic pain, PTSD, severe anxiety, etc?"
1,2023-04-06,Temp-to-Permanent Hire Offer vs. Contract Comparison,u/anakinarin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12e8gsd/temptopermanent_hire_offer_vs_contract_comparison/,jobs,"I have been working as a W2 contractor for a year now through a staffing agency. The company that I am working with has offered me an opportunity to renew my contract again for another year or to be hired as a full time employee. 

I am currently making $80/hr with medical/dental benefits and 401k offered by the staffing agency with accruing paid sick time and without paid vacation and holidays. 

The full time offer by the company I am working with for the full time position includes salary in the range of 95k-115k per year + health/dental benefits + 5-10% yearly bonus + 10k in RSU + paid sick, vacation, and holidays.

This is a fully remote position and will stay as is regardless of my decision.

After learning about the details of the full-time offer, I am strongly considering continuing my service as a contractor since I am significantly earning more per hour and eligible for OT work I do usually during release weekends and afterhours. Also, the health/dental benefits I have with my staffing agency is really affordable and sufficient for my current needs and in the foreseeable future as I am fairly young and do not have family and kids. As far as 401k goes, company full time offers higher matching rate but my overall 401k benefit overtime is higher as contract due to higher base salary.

I am missing out on RSU, bonus and paid vacation/holiday but I feel like those are not reliable source of consistent income compared to a higher base hourly rate.

Perceived stability is great as a full time and desirable but I don't prioritize that right now and am okay with jumping ship for the right opportunity as I have accumulated a reliable financial cushion from aggressively saving if I am out of a job for months or a handful of years.

2,2023-04-07,"Looking for advice (24M) More or less at square 1, lost, and have wasted a lot of time.",u/Mandrake413,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12e9duv/looking_for_advice_24m_more_or_less_at_square_1/,jobs,"I'll try not to ramble, but I'm in quite a situation and really have no idea what the best idea is as I go forward. I'll be 24 in June, and I live in Toledo, Ohio.

Like many others, I was compelled to matriculate immediately after high school, and without a rock-solid idea of what I wanted to do. I felt myself torn between the medical field for its predictability and relatively high pay, or generally angling for work in foreign policy/national defense, topics which fascinate me. With nothing but encouragement from my family, I packed a Political Science degree with writing capstones and topical classes on national and international policy and current events; tried to take a Washington Center internship as my final semester in Spring 2021 (graduated with a 3.93). This was at the height of COVID, and the experience was downgraded to remote work. While I did have the opportunity to lead a small peer team on a project, my work largely consisted of interest area research and the filming of a few short videos detailing it. I had decent extracurriculars and was involved in the student government and a political party's club board; did some canvassing for a few local political figures during election seasons. 

Since June 2021, I've been working as a (now certified) pharmacy technician, although I did briefly secure gainful employment as a field organizer for an Ohio political party, their demands suddenly changed and soon outstripped my ability to travel and it was essentially a ""gig-job"" with no real stability, to say nothing of my complete dislike and lack of skill at the work. The middle and latter half of 2022 were wracked by family tragedies and difficult financial situations, which when taken together with unsuccessful applications/interviews with places like Epic Systems (A Political Project Management) and Medpace (Entry-level Contracting), have put me into a profound sense of defeatism and lack of any real progress in finding any form of gainful employment. I suppose I'm looking for any advice from anyone who has found themselves in a similar situation, and how they got out of it/into an originally unexpected line of work. My current thoughts are:

\-The obvious immediate answer is to go to school for a Master's degree. The Ford school is right up the road in Ann Arbor, but I have no idea how I'd finance it. The one thing I did right in undergraduate was get a ""full ride"", and while it might be good for networking and specializing research, I fear I'd wind up in the same position I am in now in a few years.

\-Keep trying to shuffle off into Office Space somehow, like I was trying to do with Medpace. Cubicle, a clip-on tie, and 50K forever.

\-Attempt certifications for supply chain work (my international relations/policy studies would mesh well there) or something like marketing or Salesforce (a friend of mine was talking to me about going through HubSpot for the former late last year, and I've foolishly let it drift away).

\-I have a contact who is a DEA agent, who is doing me a favor and trying to put me in touch with someone in DEA intelligence, which sounds like a more stimulating/in-line field for me. 

\-Keep trying for a position with Epic and/or try to learn IT, software, cybersecurity, etc.

TL;DR: Now-useless degree, menial job, seeking a way out. No debt beyond a car payment.

&#x200B;

Happy Easter, everyone."

I received a decent job offer and accepted it without much negotiation (in writing). Now that I've heavily contemplated the situation (I know, I should've done that before accepting 😔), I'm starting to doubt whether it's a good idea to leave my current employer at this time for an okay job offer in terms of pay (~25% more than what I'm being paid).

I would definitly make the move if the offer was 10% higher; but what they offered doesn't really motivate me to do so especially since I like it where I am.

Is it wise to renegotiate?

Thanks"

First off all why cant you have a passion AND wanting a good payment or at least know how much you actually get?

The Main Problem is the second you ask for the payment you get the feeling of them that you are the a-hole here because they would give you the feeling that you are just there for the money,because you dared to ask that.

Its just a rude thing to write because of course thats true,that you should do the job because you actually want it,but also passion dont pay your bills and  there is a life outside the job and yeah.

Do you know what i mean and why i hate it hard when they write stuff like this? because you are locked and you cant dare to ask the payment question because it would look you bad but on the other side they could give me the lowest of the lowest payment and obviously that would also not be nice"

1,2023-04-07,"Workplace is falling apart, I have a plan but still feel a sense of dread every day",u/hildebrot,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12eh4ao/workplace_is_falling_apart_i_have_a_plan_but/,jobs,"It all started at the beginning of last year when the impact of covid finally hit our industry and we fell hard on our faces. Not enough work meant no overtime, cancelled shifts, reorganization of work.

Some people quit, some asked for more money. In the second half of last year those who asked for more money started quitting. More started complaining, this time about their superiors and the type of work too (which has changed significantly for many of them over the last year). In January we all got a token 5% raise. Every month somebody quits. New people are getting hired but they usually don't last because the old ones are unpleasant to them or because they expected a different type of work.

All of this is affecting me mentally so much that I made an appointment with a psychologist after like 4 years and I will schedule a meeting at a career advice center. I wanted this job to last, I need stability in my life. Job hopping would destroy me mentally. But it seems inevitable to change jobs this year if I want to keep my sanity. It seems that my bosses' plan is to let people go, they make very little effort to keep people there. And they have *me* as the guy who never complains and never asks for anything. They probably count on me staying there and training any new people even if all of the original ones leave. Except that plan wouldn't work even if I agreed - I rely on my colleagues. I can't keep it all in my head myself. I lack the expertise, the only reason I have this job is because I was willing to do it with all the negatives (phone always on, unplanned overtime, etc). I had no problem with that. However I can't do that *and* know how to train everybody.

My expectation for this year is that by the end of it, if I stay, there won't be any of the original people left, people who made it possible in the first place. There will be new people hired who don't have the years of experience and the quality of work will decrease. There will be pressure on me to help them but my years of experience are not in those specific positions. And I think that all it will take will be just one slight criticism towards me from one of my bosses' bosses and that will be what finally gives me the courage to quit and step in to the dangerous unknown.

My bosses have never criticized me. Ever. I think it's because they know that they would have a hard time finding a replacement that will be as willing and will accept the same pay. And I was ok with that until the workplace started falling apart. They say they can't increase wages of specific people, that only banket raises are possible. But that is wrong. There are people who should be paid more than others simple for being better workers, not just working more.

I don't think our branch will be closed but it will never get to the highs of 2021. Everybody was working hard, 3 shifts, but the pay was great and the work was fun. The quality of work was awesome. Unfortunately, none of the higher ups are willing to be leaders. They just sit in their offices or on home office and shrug. They deflect any criticism and hope for the best. This is such a waste. This could have been such an amazing workplace. But you can't make it happen when your superiors can't be reasoned with. All the people who cared are leaving. Because they were unappreciated. Their work taken for granted or even criticized for trying too hard. Trying to change the old ways.

So my plan is to refuse any more responsibilities they try to throw my way and work on my mental state to allow myself the option of changing jobs. Who knows, maybe the main manager who's the main person who could change the course will finally quit (his burnout was very evident), but I don't see that happening in a company that hasn't changed much in the last 25 years.

I even got to the point where I'm sick of the people complaining, not the incompetent superiors. Sometimes I feel like if only they would finally shut up everything would be fine."

Was still on the list for the last job, they did reference checks and here's where the first red flag is. The references said the calls felt inappropriate (though the questions were easy) in some ways:

* They called 3 of my references, but 2 calls were done by the recruiter and one was done by the hiring manager (seems weird to split it up this way?)
* They seemed confused about my involvement in diversity/equity work (which one of my references mentioned)
* They followed up to ask me even more questions after already going through 4 rounds of interviews

Then, yesterday, the offer came in but they only wanted to know my start date. They haven't even told me anything about the benefits. Do these feel like huge red flags (i.e. bad culture)? Also curious to know if anyone has successfully negotiated better benefits for themselves! Thanks."

2,2023-04-07,Quitting job with nothing lined up to focus on upskilling for a career change,u/ZPbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12errir/quitting_job_with_nothing_lined_up_to_focus_on/,jobs,"I currently work in a back breaking warehouse/retail role and have years of experience doing this along with retail management. My workplace has become extremely toxic with incompetent management who set unrealistic expectations and are constantly cursing people out for not meeting these expectations. They also selectively enforce rules and who has to follow certain rules and are big into micromanaging. I dread going to work every day, sometimes I can't sleep at night because I'm so anxious about going in the next day which hinders my performance with the lack of sleep which gets me in trouble and it just becomes a cycle. This is not at all what I want to do for a career (which is also a big part of my daily dread, that I'm wasting my time) although the experience looks decent on a resume for some of the jobs I'd want to transition into with transferrable soft skills and a few hard skills.

I currently do not have a job lined up although I have a few interviews pending. I have 18 months worth of my bills in my savings and I would like to quit this terrible job now and focus on getting certifications toward fields I would like to work in. Assuming my interviews don't work out, I would continue to apply to jobs while upskilling full time. I was thinking that if I had several months of an employment gap I would have a good excuse with the certifications listed on my resume along with the dates I received them being within that gap and explaining to prospective employers that I quit my current role in order to study full time to make a career change. I figured if I became unlucky I could easily get another retail job with my resume, do doordash or other gig work, or get into temp roles with the agency near my house.

I know it isn't ideal to leave a job without another lined up but I feel I would have a perfectly sound reason as to why I did if I had to explain a gap and I'm currently in a good position to weather it for a while with no income coming in. I have no health issues or take any medications so lack of health insurance isn't an issue.

Is there something I'm missing?"
1,2023-04-07,Employer denying an accommodation,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12erxfh/employer_denying_an_accommodation/,jobs,"I am one of the most reliable employees where I am and I always show up early especially if needed for extra hours. I did 80-120 hours a week last year every single day having days off only once in a while. I sacrificed a lot like my relationship, my time (2-3 hour commute), and literally my life (taking the train in NYC). So this lady came in recently to what I’ve heard is take my supervisors position that I originally was being trained for by my supervisor last year before she even arrived. 

After apparently too much overtime was being done (because people always call out and their is a need for people in general where I work)( not my issue hire better employees) she made a new schedule to completely cut a shift out and reduced the ability for overtime to 0. So anyway I decided to get another job because I’m trying to at least live comfortable and have a family eventually and a house (I make a little more than average household incomes but it’s really not enough to work at one place and have a comfortable life). I requested a shift change which she first said I’d have to use all my personal time and take 2 weeks off because it was only a week before I needed to start the change. I told my supervisor like a month prior and I guess this lady never found out. Huge spit in the face and I knew this was unethical and uncalculated. 

I called my union and the lady was found to be in violation of policy. So now she let me change without issues the next week. Apparently my supervisor told me that she was mad that me and my coworkers that have called the union on her. The union has been called quite a few times and she hasn’t even been working for the institution for a year. Meanwhile I’ve heard through the grapevine she was fired from another institution for harassing her employees. Anyway, the main thing is now I need to come in at 5 instead of 4 because I can’t be on time for 4. I was NEVER late before switching my shift. I sent an email that was optimistic and outline potential benefits of the shift change. I even had my director on a call and he said he’d be interested in something like it. 

Now only a year ago we had this really bad employee who was there for years and he always called out, late, took 2 hour lunches and just overall destroyed the departments moral.  They literally gave him an accommodation to come in an hour later than the rest of us because he was always late and leave an hour later as well. Now they’re saying they can’t make the adjustment for me and that changes are coming to our job responsibilities and that apparently if they give it to me they have to do it for others etc. 

I’m really disturbed honestly because I sacrificed so much for them and they’re treating me and the rest of my coworkers like we haven’t done anything for the department. Even through covid we got no pay raise or recognition for all the bs we went through when all the other institutions were getting all kinds of benefits.  (I work in a pretty sensitive field where you have to be able to have the stomach for it). What should I do? I have a Union but apparently our union rep is on this ladies side now too. It’s just become a nightmare and me and my coworkers are feeling targeted by this lady and everyday there’s a new stress about what’s going to happen next. I’m feeling lost, super super stressed, and just overall deflated.

I appreciate everyone’s advice!"

19,2023-04-07,"My boss told me I was getting laid off in a week. Not related to performance, but what the company needs. I have the skill and desire to step up, to be what they need, but uncertain if I should fight for my job.",u/the_original_peasant,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12exg4x/my_boss_told_me_i_was_getting_laid_off_in_a_week/,jobs,"  

I work (9 months) at a startup (\~20 people) where my boss and I are the only state-side employees in the department. When I was hired, the company was also looking for two roles. Midrange, and senior in the field of work. I filled the midrange position. 

About 4 months after I was hired. The company stopped looking for someone to fill the senior position. In part they couldn't find the individual they wanted, and the fact that I exceeded expectations was able to deliver ahead of time. All was good until a little over a month ago when I agreed to take over for a project.

When I took over, the project was about 70% completed, but realistically only about 30-40% was completed properly. Over the past 6 weeks all my time has been consumed by the project I took over. Which meant my boss had to help cover some of the workload. The department (my boss ad I) were completely overwhelmed.. 

\---

Mid-March the time-consuming project is finally completed, but over the past two weeks I started getting some unusual vibes. The work I used to do was now taken care of by other individuals. And my boss told the other departments to funnel all the work towards them. Now that I had a lot of time to do more. There was suddenly *a lot* less.

Wednesday I finally found the courage to ask my boss 'is there a problem'; about 6 hours later we have a meeting. Where I was told, I'm being let go. The reason being that my boss needed that senior position, and my role was becoming less vital. 

*Some context about my relationship with my boss*. We have literally zero (unintentional) communication between the two of us. No meetings, no messages about workloads, nothing, and I mean nothing. The last meeting I had with them was in November 2022. Work was delegated by our project manager. So, there was little need for us to communicate outside of basic questions. And as far as I was concerned, I was filling the position I was hired for well enough for them not to need to hire a senior in the position.

I know the lack of communication between my boss, and I was absolutely a deciding factor. And I know I needed to convey that to them... Which I did a day after they this heavy news. 

I explained to my boss if at minimum we had some sort of weekly meeting for at minimum 10mins. We probably wouldn’t be in this situation. They seemed extremely receptive to what I was telling them. 

My boss explained to me that our CEO didn’t have the time this week to connect with me this week. That they would be reaching out to me to set up a meeting next week. Nothing’s come through yet, and I feel a sense of overwhelming anxiety. 

On one hand, my boss is aware, that I’m aware, I’m getting laid off, but I still have work being delegated to me. And on the other, my team I work with is entirely unaware that I’m about to no longer be their POC. 

I like my job, the people I work with, the clients I work with, and I respect my peers and my boss. While the job is entirely remote, I've formed some close business relationships. 

I have this feeling, that if I can formulate the proper argument, I might convince my boss and our CEO that laying me off isn't in the best interest of the company. 

I’ve already started looking for other positions, but it bums me out because I feel like I'm still employed.

I want to better the company, and that means I need to demonstrate my ability to do so. Should I try and compile a genuine argument?

Or is them telling me I'm getting laid off, the point of no return, even if they wanted to reconsider?

**tldr**: boss told me I'm being laid off, due to my role no longer being necessary. I'm convinced they're unaware of my ability or will to step up. Is it worth fighting for my job? \[my boss and the CEO are more or less partners in the company I'm employed by\]"

Do i inform the second company i interviewed with the first? Would it be strange? I'd like to be as transparent as possible, but i don't want the first company to tell the second company i wasn't selected for a position for some reason or another.

All interviews were positive and i personally thought i landed the job, but they went with an internal candidate instead.

What do you guys think i should do in this situation if the second company wants to move forward with me."

It’s just so annoying and we work the same shift but I like the hours so I don’t want to switch.

This morning I asked the manager to turn up the temperature cause it was freezing (btw this room has to be within a certain range for the products and it was 1degree away from being out of range) . She overheard and told him “no don’t it’s fine” and then we argued a little . But then an hour later more people came in and complained and got it raised. She is not in any position to decide that when the majority is saying otherwise 

had enough and emailed my boss about this morning and some of the other stuff that’s been going on and that this girl drives me crazy and how I’d like to talk about it in person... **But boss said she’d discuss it with us separately on the days we don’t work together (talk to me on Tuesday and her on Monday)**… And she said it’s probably all miscommunication…nah that bitch is always complaining to me specifically(I don’t even make small talk with her, I’m in another part of the room minding my own business and she approaches me to complain or tell me what to do) I don’t understand that like why not talk to me right now my boss and I were both at work why wait ?"

Recently applied to a job, the interview process has been moving fast ,heard back a day later to schedule a phone interview after I applied. Though it was a good sign and the phone interview was short and simple it was mainly with the HR recruiter and very basic but it seemed to go good ,was even complimented on the research I did on the company. At the end was told I’d have to take two assessment test before the video interview would be scheduled. The assessment’s were weird, the first one seemed to be a personality type, it  didn’t have a time limit just a list of various adjectives to describe my idea of a good employee and adjective to describe me. The second one felt like an IQ test answering 50 various questions in a 12 minute time limit .What bothers me if that I don’t get to see my results and they are not obligated to tell me my results. I haven’t heard back from the company to schedule the video interview though it has only been a day since I turned in my last assessment so I’m not worried over the lack of response. The assessment test just has me frazzled cause I don’t know how heavy it weighs on the decision, and I don’t want to be dropped from the running before I even have an actual interview with the head of department. It’s also doesn’t help that while I’ve been in the interview process the job posting was removed but now it has been reposted so that just adds on to my worry."

That simply isn't true. And it affects peoples pay at present  in this  business climate where companies are hesitant to hire. So you wind up being a contractor business with no benefits - but you don't get paid like a business.   The fact is if you are a US citizen you have the right to operate a business without ""being incorporated.""  

In some cases, hiring companies pay you less compensation if you are not a business.  So US citizens are forced to take less in these cases and it isn't right."

My other jobs I told them I no longer wanted to work there. But is there a more formal way to do so? 

Like do I go up to the manager and say “I’d like to put in my two weeks” 

Or do I write it and hand it to them. Or both? Or wtf do I do lmao. Can I do it in an email?"
2,2023-04-07,Question about my mental disorders. Should I mention them?,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12f4uvn/question_about_my_mental_disorders_should_i/,jobs,"With this question I have two options, don’t tell them or do tell them I have for mental disorders.

The first option means: no accommodations,  increased risk of being fired and if I am found out being immediately fired because in my state, employers don’t have to disclose why they fire you.

To make matters worse, I have heard there are sites that employers use to check employees so that they see their search history at previous jobs. I don’t know if that actually exists, but if it does, that means if I lie about my disorder, and if I get caught, they don’t make me even more unhireable than I already am because of my disorders. 

 My second option is: less pay than everyone else, I will never get promoted and it increases the chance of me be fired.


So at jobs I either have to pick, never get in promoted and being paid like garbage, or risk being fired and having more difficulty finding work.


Which one do I pick?"

I have Comptia trio, Microsoft Azure, CCNA, Linux LPIC certs. My first degree was in kinesiology and I switched to IT. I was going to go back for a masters, but if I went to the state uni it would take minimum 2 years. The tuition assistance also only covers up to 5000 a year or so.

The other option is looking for private sector roles, and going to WGU instead which is 4000 a semester. 

I had one role that I was interviewing that was 65 to 80k. It's located where my parents lived. So, I could go back and live with them. Right now rent is 1500 where I'm staying, and it could even go up considering how things are with the economy. So, I'm debating how realistic it is to even stay at this role.

Work life balance is another consideration. Some told me to stay at the university because less pay is worth the ease of mind. The other job would have on call work and I'd have to drive to locations. But I would get overtime payl. Whereas, with the university I'm stuck to 8 to 5 everyday. Also, even thought the work life balance is good now at the university, they want us to manage more systems, so it may get worse in a month or so. But, even then it may not be as bad as the private sector.

1. With that said should I stay at the university role and go to school? The stress could be a lot higher with working full time and taking classes. Whereas, I feel WGU may be more manageable. 

2. Or should I take the other private sector role where my parents live and go back to saving more money? 

3. Or look for another role in another city entirely?"
10,2023-04-07,MOST BAFFLING INTERVIEW EVER!?,u/Wooden-Storage368,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12f74x6/most_baffling_interview_ever/,jobs,"HP wasted my time.

I currently work as an account executive with a company that I’ve been at for a few years, I make $65,000 a year doing complex sales in the construction industry.

I submitted an application for an account manager position at HP. I made sure to put my minimum salary range at $75,000 per year when asked which is a 15% increase (average increase when hopping to another job).

I took time off work for the scheduled interview, cleaned myself up, perfected the audio and camera on my computer, cleaned the background and did several hours of research beforehand.

I enter the zoom chat on time and it starts.

The first thing I notice is that (interview lady) is audio only and sounds very monotone and unenthusiastic.

(Interview lady) begins by claiming that the position I applied for is too complex for someone coming from a separate industry and that she recommends I start at an entry level position (inside sales rep) and then immediately asks if I have any questions. I begin by asking the following questions…

Can you walk me through what a typical day look like for an account manager? Where will most of my time and energy be devoted to in this role?

(Her answer. I have never been in this position I am just the recruiter so no I cannot.)

Can you provide some examples of the software and products that I will be selling?

(Well, I hate to be obvious but we are HP and we will be selling HP products)

Can you give me a brief overview of what a TYPICAL sales cycle looks like from beginning to end?

(Her answer. This depends on every sale.)

Where do the majority of leads originate? For example, cold calling, clients calling in from marketing, etc.

(Her answer. I assume the leads come from research and established accounts)

What does the commission structure look like?

(Her answer. Base + commission is a 60/40 split and we would start you at $39,000)

I clearly am overqualified for this position why on earth was I contacted when I said my lowest salary expectation is $75,000. Is that not a preliminary question?!

What does a successful first 6 months look like to you in this role?

(Her answer. Well these are very complex sales and I really would think that an inside sales rep position would be a great starting position for you.)

My understanding is that HP had 58,000 employees last year, this year we’re at 51,000 and projecting to lay off an additional four to six thousand by 2025. Assuming that I am performing above expectations is there any reason that I would need to be worried about my job safety in this regard?

(Her answer after clearly getting offended. Well I can’t answer that.There’s a lot of moving wheels and I’m sure you are aware that HP’s projected layoff numbers are much better than a lot of other tech companies actual layoff numbers.)

Thank you HP!

I promise I have not embellished any part of this interaction. I’ve had more professional interviews in high school applying for a fast food position.
I gracefully ended the interview and told her that I hope she fills the position but unfortunately I am no longer interested for reasons X,Y and Z."

I essentially have to decide now which job I am going to be gunning for when I graduate soon. One is in a STEM field where the starting salary is ~$105,000 in a low cost of living area, but I am not particularly interested in this field, and the skills are likely not very transferable. I am also concerned that the job is very regional, and so when my gf goes to medical school in around a year or two, I may have to leave this field all together. The other job is more business oriented, would pay probably ~$75,000, and would be in a high cost of living area. I think this job is more in line with my interests, I could likely get a similar job at a different company if I needed to relocate, and the exit opportunities are better than the first job as well. I am currently leaning towards the second option because I think I’d enjoy it more and could have better chances of building a career from that job. What are your thoughts?"

It was a little off putting at first when I got hired and there were no previous employees except for supervisors but I sacrificed the comfort of living at home because A. I wanted to prove to myself I can be independent and B. I wanted to be able to snowboard more often. Seems the turnover rate here is extremely high. 

Well, the season is about to end and tbh I don’t think I can do another year here. I plan on staying till the end of august to save money before I move back home. Then I want to continue some schooling to get a decent job. 

I feel bad because maybe about a month ago, I told one of the higher ups I wanted to stay long term. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized this is not really ideal. 

I don’t like being so far away from my family, especially my nieces. Yeah I get to snowboard a lot but it’s so hard to get by here. I know people can make it work, but I feel like my mental health has gotten worse. Food is expensive af here. I’m not making many friends and the ones I do have are seasonal and leaving soon anyways. Cost of living is insane unless I luck out on finding roommates, but things could change at any moment as I see the local Facebook housing page, I see people talking about how their landlord randomly kicked them out or raised rent and they have to leave soon. 

But regardless, I’ve been a great worker. I’ve never called in ever, and the only time I’ve asked for time off, I asked just to get my days off moved so I could visit family back home.

How do I bring this up to my supervisors? I’d feel bad waiting just 2 weeks before telling them. Maybe give them a month notice instead of a 2 week? I’m worried they’ll get pissed and won’t let me use them as a reference."

I'll be as detailed as possible but I will not be giving names of people or companies.

I, 18(M) just landed a score of a job, I smashed in interview and I was sent an offer to which I accepted. All that was left was to pass the background check. (I don't have a criminal record so I wasn't worried at all about it). Part of the job requires me to be driving company vehicles so a motor vehicle check was part of the background check. I got an email back from the background check company regarding an issue with my license stating I had a restriction on my license, quote ""Restriction: Operation of vehicle by person under 18 years of age"", which is sec 545.424. I originally got this on my drivers license because I got it two days before my birthday so I was still 17 at that time, but on the back of my license it full on states ""545.424 applies until 11/09/2022"" (11/09/22 is when I turned 18) so this restriction on my license no longer applies but the background check reported that I have that restriction.

I did send them an email per their instructions on how to resolve this, in that email I attached documents highlighting the part of my license that says ""545.424 applies until 11/09/2022"" and now I'm just waiting to hear back from them

I'm not going to question why even though I gave my DOB and SSN they still found the restriction even though my license says ""545.424 applies until 11/09/2022"". I'm just curious if anyone has any further steps on how I should proceed with this, any extra steps I should do, or just if anyone else has had a similar experience and how you went about it.

I worked in a bank where an MD, female was brought in after the prior MD who I worked for directly was unceremoniously fired. 

This new MD, let's refer to her as Ms. Merkel, came in and started ill treating the old faithfuls of the old MD. She literally said on a call toe the line or find something else. Hired at ED levels people from her former company without as much as a two round interview. I'd get a résumé and be asked to bring a person in two weeks without even an open position. 

She fired staff on probation who were hired by the prior MD. Then brought in about 10% of her former colleagues at middle management. 

She started looking for any error from the guys of the old MD and created a case to fire them. 

Her tone on team calls and town halls was super aggressive and the cherry on the cake was her referring to a certain community as gold diggers.

I had my managers support when I put down my papers and she asked me what option she was to select for my reason of exit - I told her put down ""culture"". 

The HR, which didn't hold exit interviews apart from an online form, had three meetings with me. I gave them the evidence that I'd accumulated over a year. 

But after that it was crickets. My manager shifted to another team in the same firm but also filed a formal complaint. 

Nothing happened for about a year and a half. 

Found out this week that in a surprise upheaval, her entire 180+ team. Has been aligned to someone else. And this means she's on the chopping block. 

Life's come full circle for her. Her predecessor was put in the same position by her. And now she's worse off than him."

But it still seems like it's not enough for a job. I mean, I get it, ""experience"" and being able to show that you can ""produce results"" is what it seems the people who are looking to hire are looking for, but I am speaking from my POV right now.

I have a computer science degree, which while I enjoy the subject matter of, if I want to get a job in IT it looks like I'm going to have to get some certs instead if I want to *maybe* have a chance at getting into those roles since my resume is just coding projects right now. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Otherwise, if I want to *maybe* get a chance at a job in software, I'm going to need to spend some more time working on some more projects, maybe using tools and languages that employers are actually looking for and/or study up on leetcode (for some reason) or something.

Currently my resume is just:

* my degree
* a bunch of coding projects I did as class assignments
* some managerial experience that's not specific to IT or programming

The logical side of me also knows that there are probably a million (maybe literally) other people out there like me and there are only a small fraction of that number of positions available, so this is maybe more of a vent about how tired I am. I am tired.

Edit:

~~Y'know, I'm not even necessarily asking to get paid. I'll take an unpaid internship at this point but I think that's illegal and the paid ones are basically like applying to a job and so we're back to the slog of grinding to get the chance at an opportunity to get some crumbs of ""experience"".~~

Edit 2:

Apparently there's no good reason to do unpaid work (unless it's maybe for a charity or something) so scratch that."

1,2023-04-08,"Leaving after 5 months, how honest should I be in my exit interview?",u/AllIWantisSOPs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fic01/leaving_after_5_months_how_honest_should_i_be_in/,jobs,"On Monday, I resigned from my full-time job of five months.

I decided to leave my communications role with an organization of four employees because the position's responsibilities changed and the CEO refused to have any structure for projects. Many of the tasks I completed--emails, website updates, working with vendors--were done seat-of-pants style.

My breaking point was losing sleep over the lack of organization, consistency and clear direction for my assignment. I woke up angry and frustrated several times in the past few weeks.

Some of the issues were:

1. A co-worker with neurological differences who missed a lot of details in her work. This slowed down my work and caused problems for creating social media and newsletter content.
2. My role evolving to include writing about a very controversial topic that I don't want on my resume. This subject wasn't discussed with me during my interview and has the potential to put me in the line of fire for vitriol from my audience. It could also hinder future job prospects.
3. Another co-worker responded in a sarcastic way when I asked for a tutorial and/or written instructions on using the CRM. The CEO and I received one lesson each that involved pulling a premade list. Neither of us knows how to sort or create a new list, which causes issues when the fundraiser is unavailable.
4. I encountered four issues with getting paid: completed new hire direct deposit paperwork three times, first paycheck was a week late, soon found out it was also $450 short, and most recently a double deposit was made that I was instructed by the company to clear up. Honestly, how many times must I call the money manager and go through this? Also, why is my job to fix their error?
5. The CEO deciding to have three- and four-month delays in getting training on programs. For example, on January 3 the organization moved from Google to SharePoint but didn't receive a training on it until April 5. This decision has caused a lot of issues for the colleague with learning difficulties and slowed the process of uploading, updating and organizing files for everyone.

I have an exit interview with a board member scheduled for Monday morning. My question is this: How honest should I be? I actually really like the CEO as a person and want her to succeed. However, I don't believe the organization should hire another communications staffer until some internal issues with assignments, documentation and financials are resolved.

Please share your thoughts.

Thanks!"

We're supposed to send our time sheets to their HR department (and I've been doing this). Their HR department doesn't get back to me in weeks. I don't know any higher-up person. There's an admin person present in all of my classes, who is responsible for sending me the meeting links etc. I did try asking them about this too but they sent me the entire timesheet procedure and said ""Make sure you're doing this"" (I am). I don't what to do at this point. It's so frustrating. I don't want to quit this job. Even though it's a few hours, I'm still making some cash (or I thought I would). I'm a fresh engineering graduate (still job searching), and I was hoping I could use this job as a reference for my next job and add it to my resume. Pls, advise. (Also, I live in Canada).

Update: I sent them an email the same day talking about how frustrated I am and if this isn't resolved immediately, I'm going to stop work and inform the relevant authorities.

They still haven't replied and they have an excuse because of the long weekend going on in Canada. However, I did see they made an announcement on Slack saying there are no classes until l Monday (bc of the long weekend).  I'll post any future updates here.

UPDATE: It took a few weeks but I'VE BEEN FULLY PAID. Looking for a new job now though since I no longer work there. Thanks for the advice everyone :') "

Two months ago I took a job that has been so far very promising and satisfying to work. Creative projects, various tasks involving art & design etc. However, the more time passes the more I see how much I undersold myself and that is starting to bug me a lot.

The thing is, the employer actually asked me how much I'd be comfortable to earn monthly and out of fear to lose this opportunity I asked a sum that's okay...

With the time advancing and having done a lot of valuable work for the company, I'm realizing that I should have asked exactly 33,33% more than what I'm currently making. This is based on an overly late  research cause I'm apparently an idiot.

So I find myself on a crossroad wondering whether to ask for re-negotiation and if I do, when? I was thinking to do it after I turn 6 months in the company but...I'm open for your wisdom."
158,2023-04-08,Is my vision of the workplace flawed?,u/findingnew2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fmmrk/is_my_vision_of_the_workplace_flawed/,jobs,"My \[32 engineer\] attitude at work has always been :

* I work like hell to get everything done whatever the cost for me (even if I have to not sleep, not see my friends, work on the weekends etc...). I never say no.
* I have a reasonable attitude : I don't make demands unless they are absolutely necessary
* I always help people even if I don't have to

I behave like that because I believe it'll grant me the following results :

* I will be rewarded (raises, training that will be useful for my professional future, promotions)
* I will be liked by people. In turn, they'll be nice to me
* Since I'm behaving in a reasonable manner people will be reasonable too with me. For instance, my boss won't put additional workload on my shoulders even though I'm struggling

The results so far has been the following :

* I haven't been rewarded at all (no raises, no training, no promotions, not even a thank you - which costs nothing)
* Rather than appreciating my help people take it for granted and act mean. My boss screams at me and insults me.
* No one is reasonable with me, especially not my boss who forces more workload on my shoulders even asking me to do things that are (almost) useless

Then I see people who do less work than me not being bothered by my boss. They are being treated better, they are able to get a fulfilling personal life. They get raises, bonuses.. and my boss doesn't assign them unrealistic workloads.

I thought I should get rewarded for the sacrifices I make but instead I'm being punished for them.

I feel like my view of how the workplace functions doesn't set me up for success but rather for failure. Is there any resource (books for example) I could consult which explains how the workplace works and how to succeed? (how to be rewarded and still have a personal life for example)"

My skill level is set higher than the other agents, so this means calls are routed to my line whenever I’m available. Other agents with a lower skill than mine can have up to an hour (sometimes more) of free time before they receive a call. I get paid the same as the other agents. At the end of the day, I check the system to see how many calls we’ve all handled in the day. The numbers usually show that I’ve had 15-25 calls vs other agents who have only had 3-6 calls. I’ve brought this up to management and they’ve blamed the skilling on the “system”… they say that they can’t change my skill level. Which is fine. The obvious way of fixing this issue is paying me more, right? Well they’re saying they can’t give me a raise because I haven’t been with the company for a year yet. I started this job in September 2022. I feel that they should make some kind of exception to this 1yr rule since they have my skill level high. If I can’t get a raise until 1yr at the job, maybe they shouldn’t raise my skill level until 1yr. Just trying to figure out how to handle this and balance things because it bothers me that I’m busy taking calls all day while my coworkers are getting hours of free time and still getting paid the same. Doesn’t seem right to me. Is it worth it to wait it out until September this year to negotiate a raise, or should I just look for another job?


If some numbers are needed… the “high skillers” are me and 4 other agents. There are usually 45 agents working in one shift. So the high skilled agents are busy taking calls all day and the rest of the 40 agents are just waiting until all 5 of the high skilled agents are on the line with clients. That’s the only time the lower skilled agents will get a call routed to their lines, when the 5 higher skilled agents are all busy. Drives me crazy just thinking about it. Wish I had gone into this job not showing how good I am cause it just feels like a punishment now. I thought maybe they would make me a trainer or something since I’ve had to train a few agents but no, they just give me more work than everyone else. They should put high skilled agents on a separate team that gets paid more or something idk. What should I do?

Edit: Thanks for all the comments! Maybe important to the situation… Anytime a coworker is absent or falling behind, my managers send their work to me. I’m fine with helping out. Issue is just that they want me to do it all during my own time. They don’t allow me to get overtime even though they told us we’d all be able to get as much overtime as we wanted when they hired us. And if I do work over my shift, they would tell me to clock out early during my next shift or take a long lunch to even out the time to avoid paying me overtime. Feeling like I won’t be able to stick it out until September. Looking for new jobs already."

And I have an update!

After reading all of your feedback, I decided to email the CEO, my supervisor, and the one HR guy (so there is a record of this conversation) about how payroll guy approached me. I was respectful but didn’t hold back telling them exactly what he said to me and how he made me feel. I told them clearly that I would be rescinding my notice period because of how I was treated. No response. Only about 30 minutes after I checked my work email just to see if they responded and I got an error notification that the password had been changed recently. Also they kicked me from the group chats and every other account, I didn’t care because I have all of the conversations I need, but it’s just funny how quickly they did that without even checking to see how I was or anything after hearing how he treated me. 

Anyways this past Friday was payday, and as I expected, I didn’t get paid. I waited the whole day as sometimes they were late paying me…still nothing. They sent me the pay schedule previously which I still have and it was definitely supposed to be Friday. Now I am about to file a unpaid wages claim with my states’ labor board. I am not going to give them any notice or anything since they just decided not to pay me, there should be no excuse. I worked hard for them while also working a second job on the weekends and I am just disgusted they didn’t value me enough to even pay me for the work I did. 

Moving forward, I don’t think I’m comfortable going back to the traditional workforce so I am going out on a risk and trying to build a portfolio to freelance and start my own business."

1,2023-04-08,How long should one stay at a job?,u/Individual-Tear-7155,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fqz9h/how_long_should_one_stay_at_a_job/,jobs,"Just some advice please.

In 2022 I had terrible luck with jobs.  Had three jobs in that year all because I was let go in March 2022 due to being bait and switched; then the second job was awful, and I left after four months due to the toxic environment and bullying.

I am still with the third company I worked for beginning in September 2022.  However, I ended up switching departments in January 2023 due to needing more hours and pay.

The problem is the job I have now does not pay enough to cover living expenses.  I am supposed to get a raise in July 2023, but I know it won't be much.  I attempted applying for other positions and even interviewed for some job but was rejected.

My question is how the title lists:  how long should I stay with this company?  Do I count from September 2022 since I am with the same company or does the time start over from January 2023?  I thought I should stay at least until September 2023 or January 2024 to prove I am a stable employee."

I recently graduated (PhD) and, although I don't have any industry experience, my skills and experience from academia are solid and relevant for the positions I'm applying. I can make it to the final rounds of the interview process, and I often receive positive feedback. But when it comes to the offer/decision, I'm always rejected because they ""found another candidate with more experience.""

This has happened over and over again, precisely, 5 times. I go all the way through (long on-site interviews, presentations, Q&As, one-on-ones) to be rejected in the decision phase. I've asked for feedback so I can try to improve but there's nothing I can really do. 

If I apply for positions below my qualifications (entry level) to get some experience, they reject me because I'm overqualified. If I apply for positions compatible with my qualifications (also entry level) they reject me because I have no experience. I'm completely lost and, honestly, in despair.

Is anyone else in the same boat? I know for sure I have a good resume and I can sell myself very well, but what should I improve or look for?"

This is the first time in my life that I’ve had more than one job at once, and I’m having a hard time adjusting to the balance of availability. From week to week, I am constantly running into schedule conflicts and having to run back n’ forth to de-conflict competing schedules. I tried to regulate it to where one job is worked primarily during the morning - afternoon time, and the other job is worked primarily in the afternoon - evening time, but naturally, there’s always a day or two where there’s overlap or conflicting hours, and it’s bringing me more stress than I think it should be. One factor that I think contributes, is that both jobs are retail jobs and therefore have similar hours and require similar availability. At the same time though, I know I can’t be the first person in history to hold down 2 similar jobs simultaneously, so…

**People who have worked 2+ jobs before, what’s your method to “ensure” that you have little to no schedule conflicts?…Or is this just a regular part of the challenge of holding down more than one job, and I just need to get used to it?**

I’m sure this is much more simplistic than I’m making it, I just need to a little bit of guidance. Thanks for any!"

I've had an unusual work history, and I wanted to hear what Reddit thinks about it. My history of relevant employment looks like so:

* 2 month internship
* 9 months at first software job
* 1 year working towards my MS CS degree
* 1 year working as a contractor at the University where I earned my degree
* 6 months working at a high-profile, controversial startup
* 4 months working as a contractor at the University (I took an 8 month contract)

This week, I must decide whether to stay at the University and earn a Ph.D. or look for an ideally full-time job in September. What should I do? Do I have a chance at finding something, or will I look too much like a job hopper to get any interviews?"

0,2023-04-08,Tips to maximize my chances of getting hired for a dream job?,u/bayleaf93,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fxbny/tips_to_maximize_my_chances_of_getting_hired_for/,jobs,"Quick backstory: I work in the entertainment industry and interviewed for an assistant position back in September. It's working on the administrative side of a union, so great pay, benefits, working environment, etc. Really wanted the job. It came down to me and one other person. Employer went with the other person. 

Fast forward to this past Tuesday: I received an email from the employer saying things weren't working out with the new assistant and they wanted to know if I was still interested in the position. I told them I was. I confirmed with my contact over at the company that the quick turnaround really is due to poor performance on the part of the person who they ended up hiring and not because the executive is a nightmare or the workplace was toxic. By all accounts, they're a lovely person and the job is great and low stress, exactly what I'm looking for. Kind of a unicorn gig in my field.

Had a conversation yesterday with the exec and they said they already know me and really like me and think I'd be a great fit for the job, they just have to do their due diligence and meet with 2-3 other people early next week about the job, one of whom is a member of the union looking to make a career change and they like to give consideration to those types of applicants. 

After that, they say one of two things will happen: either it will once again come down to me and one other person and they'll ask if I want to come in for another interview, at which point I'm free to decline if I'd prefer not to go through the interview process again and they'd totally understand. OR I'll end up the top candidate and they'd ask me in for an ""interview"" (more of a formality) and I'd definitely walk out of that meeting with an offer. 

I desperately want this job as my current position/boss sucks (my pay and hours are getting cut by more that half, forcing me to get on partial unemployment, long story. Plus my boss is a real jerk). 

The factor of the union member who's applying makes me nervous, as I fear the politics of that situation may work against me. Especially considering the exec I'd be working for is up for re-election in a couple years.  Anyone have experience with unions/this type of situation? 

I've told the exec that I'm looking for something long term, a job I could settle into for at least the next 2-3 years, if not longer, and that I could start immediately, which they responded to *really* positively. 

Any tips to maximize my chances of getting hired? Anything helps, thanks!!!"
2,2023-04-08,Bamboozled and Feeling Stupid,u/Spiritflies,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fxlwv/bamboozled_and_feeling_stupid/,jobs,"Exactly what the title says. For some background:  


In January, I was in the market for a new job because I was laid off. I found a job posting that sounded like exactly what I was looking for! WOO HOO! As part of my due diligence, I always go on to the company website under their ""career page"" to make sure I'm applying to a real position. In the post, everything was laid out: the job description, who they are looking for, and salary range.   


Everything on the the post checked out (including salary). I move on to 3 rounds of interview over the course of 2 weeks with recruiter, hiring manager, and the team I would be working with. Keep in mind this is a  young Startup who has been doing fairly well. I jive with everyone and feel confident this is where I would like to work. I get a call from the recruiter who is ""excited to extend an offer"". I am ready to negotiate! Just when I ask her to give me all the details in writing so I can review, she says ""by the way.. this is CONTRACT-TO-HIRE position that will most likely result in you becoming FTE after 90 days. But before we continue, I need a verbal over the phone"". WTF! Why am I JUST learning this is contract! I was ready to negotiate based on salary. Told her I need a min to discuss and will call her back shortly.   


I have never in my life worked a contract job (or really ever considered it). I do a quick google research to see what this is all about (but apparently not enough research). Given that it wasn't a forever contract and there would be another review in 90 days to become a FTE, I call back and say Im onboard. Before I can get another word in, she says ""Great, we would like you to start at 21 an hour"". I wasn't fully onboard with that number (lower end of what I was hoping for). We haggle for a little bit more with the expectation of a full salary negotiation in 90 day.   


Well, here we are at 90 days and the recruiter who hired me has been fired, no one has any record of what was said during the phone call I had, and they are giving me the run around about meeting for my 90 day FTW status.  Obviously, I feel stupid for not knowing I would pay my own friggen self employment tax. Im not making enough to justify staying any longer. On top of all this, they pile so much work on me with very little training. I have a set schedule. They are asking me to build out employee handbooks etc. It feels like im being used to do as much as possible for no benefits and minimal pay.   


Has anyone else gone through a situation like this where it was a bait and switch? Is this kinda normal behavior for contract to hire positions?"

Or, do you have any automatic stereotypes that slip into your mind when you interview someone with a certain hair color? 

In about a year, I'll be starting the most important job hunt of my life, applying for some managerial/executive finance roles. I'm thinking of dying my hair ginger-red because I think it's a color that stands out without the attached negatives attached with blonde and jet-black hair. I'm fair-skinned with freckles so that the red hair would look natural. My concern with brown is that I would not stand out (hair color-wise). 

I'm aware that there are many more important factors that will play into this process; I'm just trying to touch all the bases.

79,2023-04-08,My position at my company was just terminated abruptly. What are next steps?,u/Erekshen,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fzssl/my_position_at_my_company_was_just_terminated/,jobs,"Hey all, 

So a little backstory: I never hoped to write a post like this, but last week my supervisor set a meeting that took place Thursday (2 days ago) which included myself, my supervisor, and my supervisor’s boss. I have received nothing but praise and good job notes from my boss for the past year or so. Once I received this meeting invite, I thought a possible promotion was in the works, as I just hit my 2 year mark at my company. Fast forward to Thursday, we decided to meet in office, as we are pretty much fully remote. My supervisor lives in another state and was out here for the week, so I just thought we were all getting together. I get to the office, work for about 25 minutes, and then we jump into our meeting early. My supervisor basically just tells me that upper management at our company met a few weeks ago to discuss various positions at the company and look at possibly updating roles. Long story short, they found that my role wasn’t deemed a “critical role” so it was officially terminated. 

I had no notice or heads up beforehand. It was just sprung on me. I was terminated immediately, turned in all my equipment, and benefits ceased as of yesterday, end of day. I just was stunned and just went home. I bounced back pretty quickly (considering I have diagnosed depression and anxiety). I’m just taking this weekend to reflect and get in a good headspace before I start the search next week. 

What I need: Just looking for advice about next steps and what I should do. Where are good places to send applications? Should I try a recruiting firm? Ideally i would of course like to land a job quickly in my space (marketing, project management roles if possible). But I’m thinking it’s probably better to just find any job at the moment, then just keep applying for my actual speciality until I land something, since my wife and child were on my benefits. 

Sorry for the long story, but I just wanted to give an example as to how you can get your life flipped upside down in an instant. Thanks everyone."

0,2023-04-08,I unintentionally sabotaged my ex coworker’s professional relationship by asking his former coworker if he was ever inappropriate towards her. Am I to blame?,u/lilytutttt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12g1i1f/i_unintentionally_sabotaged_my_ex_coworkers/,jobs,"I was 23 (27 now) when I joined the company, and it was really helpful to receive mentorship from an older coworker (50) in senior management. He was always friendly and helpful, but last year he started being inappropriate when I left the firm. The biggest WTF moment was when he texted me an artistic nude of a woman about 2 weeks after I left. There were a few times when he’d send me songs on YouTube with obviously romantic connotations. 

I brushed it all off for career reasons, but when he cancelled on dinner with me last minute because he said he was tired from having grabbed lunch with a former coworker from 10 years ago, I became extremely annoyed. 

I reached out to his former coworker (a lady in her early 40s) by googling her name, finding her number, and texting her - then I proceeded to ask her about him. She told me that he’d occasionally text her long messages, but he was always professional. She was shocked by what I said (2-10x text me if I don’t respond, text me sexually suggestive things, etc) and told me to just stop responding to him. She said that another lady had been invited to the lunch but she declined because she can’t stand the guy. 

It’s been 11 months since this incident and my ex coworker always suggests grabbing food at this very same restaurant that he went to with his former coworker. To the point where he’d go out of his way to meet me there (it’s an hour drive from his place, requires tolls, and is close to his last company). Turns out he quit his job at his last company right after this lady was laid off, and he’s regretted it ever since. He’s kept in touch with this lady for 10 years, and since I reached out to her, it sounds like she’s refused to meet him anymore (but didn’t tell him I’d talked to her). 

Tldr; what do you think of my sabotaging his professional relationship with his former coworker? Sounds like he had a crush on her or something. I didn’t heed her advice and kept talking to him because I was involved in an accident and he’s been helpful since..he’s not a bad guy but he is not professional. 
The thing is, I would’ve never reached out to anyone in my ex coworker’s professional network if he hadn’t made me feel like he was hitting on me. Also he’s married.

I also vaguely mentioned to my ex boss that he wasn’t “very professional” and she took it BADLY. I def burned bridges and am a little sad."

The company reached out to me, asked me a whole bunch of questions like experience, education, and provided job description through Indeed’s messages. The interview is set up for the next day, and I think wow that is so quick.

Fast forward to the day of the interview, I go to the email and login to the zoom meeting 10 minutes before just to get ready. The time comes and I’m still waiting, as it says the host is in a meeting. It’s 1:30, I’ve refreshed, called, messaged, emailed, and no response.

I leave after getting frustrated because why ask to interview me and then not interview me? I get an email which I’m not sure if it was meant for me or not. But the hiring person explains that this candidate profile has everything they were looking for, and I’m looking at it weird because I’ve never had a company do that. Usually they just do a small rejection and wish me well.

I got a crappy half ass explanation they were on an interview with her and decided to hire her because they say she has more experience than me as she has worked at this hospital, went to this school, seems like a potential good worker, etc. 

Not sure if that violates HIPAA since it’s a doctors office or violates some kind of privacy for the candidates. Explains I’m not what they’re looking for. I feel like they were rubbing it in to make me more insulted. But the thing is they knew everything about me and had my resume because they asked me so I’m confused. Very confusing experience.

Edit: Just a rant and not quite sure on what happened. Also to see any tips on how I should go about this. I’m looking for full time work so I can support my husband and daughter since we moved into a new place in January, so it’s upsetting when jobs do this."

Recently an employee that typically worked the overnight shift on the weekends had to be let go due “disciplinary action” and it looks like I, being the newest hire, am being expected to take on all of their shifts.

If the overnight crew wasn’t understaffed I’d be fine with this, however they’re expecting me to run the entire enchilada with only 2 people and handle the pos closure system (which forces all of our sales to be done by hand and cash only for a full hour). I’ve told them I can’t do every single overnight shift, max 2 nights a week, as even my coworkers are shocked they’re having me do both overnights and day shifts. 

Well, just this week I ended up having food poisoning and had to leave my last shift early. The next night I had off, and the next two nights I was scheduled for overnight.
40 minutes into my night off, the general manager calls me and says, “Oh, didn’t so-and-so tell you you’re working tonight?” 

“No! They didn’t, as today is my day off and it’s a good thing too because *vomit noises*”

Anywho, I would like advice on enforcing my boundaries for my schedule as well as job hunting tips. The only reason why I’m working here right now is they were the only place to Call me back within a week."

I’m a late 20s single woman. I have no kids just me. I left my previous position of 1 year to take another higher paying opportunity with a prestigious company. I’m several months in at the new company and I’m realizing the work environment is not a good fit for me. I’m constantly overloaded with work, put down for my small mistakes, and no matter how much I try, it doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to be enough! I had a meeting with my manager a couple days ago that left me so frustrated I looked to see if my old job was hiring and they are! They are hiring for the same position I had but in a different department this time. I would be taking a pay cut but I’m seriously considering going for it. I already reached out to my previous manager there and he said I would be a competitive applicant but to be prepared for a question about my short tenure there. 

My question is, would it be foolish to leave this higher paying stressful job for a lowering paying steady job that I know how to do already? 

Note- my old job doesn’t hire for this position often, as people tend to stay until retirement. It is a government position."

I will not get into details, but I do not care for the IT field. I worked as a legal administrative assistant part time at a small dying law firm during my last two years of college (the firm shut down in 2020 due to the attorneys retiring). Then I moved to the Bay Area to start this project based position setting up data centers, but then that company gave me a contract position doing data center work. I had trouble finding a full time job, so I ended up doing an internship where I operated a robot test radioactivity in phones, then I landed my current and first full time job ever, which is an assistant immigration paralegal job at a large immigration law firm in San Francisco. I love the legal field and it is something I love to do, but this job is toxic and the main thing is the awful commute to San Francisco from the East Bay every day and I am overworked, because me and this one other woman are the only smart and non-lazy people on my team.

I  dream of getting a remote job and moving back to the East Coast where I am from and living somewhere quieter. Everything seems to be saturated. I am desperate to get another job due to how toxic this job. I even looked for jobs locally and everything seems to be more saturate d than the remote jobs. I only had  few interviews back in early 2022 and the last interview I had was October 2022, so this is the worst job search I ever had. I have made so many edits to my resume and had [Rezi.ai](https://Rezi.ai) due some of the resume writing for me and I even paid to get my resume reviewed and got  some advice from my college's career development people. 

However, most of the original young people from the law firm I work at no longer work at the firm and most found jobs in non-toxic places and they are lucky since they live in ""the city"" itself where white collared jobs are plentiful and a commute is not an issue. I keep in touch with few of the former people I originally worked with and one of them told me I am just ""pushing the books"", since I come home from work every day mass applying to jobs (even tailoring my resume to individual legal job postings does not help) and he said I should look outside the legal field. I do not want to quit the job and do ""career suicide"" before my parents find out and plus I am buying a car in June. Any jobs outside the legal field where I can use my legal field experience? I even made a second resume for tailoring my resume to legal recruiting or legal hr job positions."

Lastly, I have some years of administrative experience working in city-level government and some case management experience, but this is for a Senior Administrative position and I will take any advice to help me stick out and perhaps fill in some administrative experience gaps that I may not have.

Didn't realise it until I was told a few days into the job. Not sure when to start the job search again lol

^That's the condensed version, added all the extra fluff because overexplaining is part of my neurotype lol


Feeling a bit defeated. After job searching since August of 2022, I finally got a job at a small local business as a machine operator. The work isn't terrible, annoying when the machines won't work well, but it's basically repetitive factory work, just on a smallish scale. Hours are the same, no need for a weekly schedule posted because everyone works the same 8hr shifts 5 days a week. Can listen to music or podcasts with 1 earbud, and generally I'm left alone except for quality checks or if there are technical difficulties. 

However, I found out a few days in that there is no AC, which I'm sure isn't uncommon in a factory setting, but I have a very poor heat tolerance after nearly having heat stroke a few years ago that sent me to the ER via ambulance. 

It's been a recurring problem every summer, and I'm on some medications that can also increase heat sensitivity. Right now it's still rainy and cool here, and probably will be for a little while, but I know I won't be able to tolerate being overheated at a station I can't step away from. Some of the jobs make it hard to find any breaks outside of the scheduled ones, including just to sip water, and one of the jobs require full lab coat, mask, and gloves to avoid contaminating the product. Already I’ve gotten overheated doing it, and the machine has to constantly be running to prevent the material from freezing up or causing quality loss. 

I've had suggestions from parents like cooling scarves or one of the personal neck fans(there are fans throughout the shop, but you can't have them at the job with these products to prevent contamination) Our summers are extra humid too, which makes the heat all the more suffocating. Besides my asthma being a jerk, I was fine in Arizona when I visited, though it wasn't hotter than 95f there when I went. 

I'm also planning on moving at the end of august, so I can't be between jobs for too long.

Honestly just considering applying for McDonald's or Walmart even when the time comes, as much as I like the people here, I know I won't be able to keep up in the heat. Whenever I've offhandedly expressed concerns to coworkers they just go ""yeah it sucks!"". 

It just kinda blows because the repetition and relaxed nature and the predictable schedule is nice. My biggest issue has been finding a job with a consistent schedule, since I'm autistic and I work best with a routine in my work&personal life. I feel like I can probably have more consistency with routine at a mcdonalds, just will be working with the public again in short, frequent periods which is an annoyance, but bearable since they don't stick around for too long lol.

I just turned 26, no college, no clue how or what I'd want to do with college, no one in my family has gone to college so I don't even know where to start, and I also can't juggle school and work at the same time without burning out(thanks to the autism and adhd). I don't consider something like mcdonalds to not be ""real work"", but the backhanded compliment of my parents congratulating me on finding a ""grown up job"" makes me feel gross. They want me to tough it out thru the summer but I rather not get sent to the ER again.

I don't know if it's something I should find a new job ASAP or wait for a couple more months while it's cool to build savings back up then get a job elsewhere and then put in my 2 weeks."

2,2023-04-09,Thought interview went amazing but no call? What happened?,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12gjcu8/thought_interview_went_amazing_but_no_call_what/,jobs,"So, I am an English teacher/curriculum developer with 9 years experience. I resigned from teaching in 2019 for a mental health break but during my time off from work, I got a Masters in Library Science degree, volunteered, and did some contract work. So definitely not idle during this time off.

I’m ready to get back into teaching so I’ve been applying to what’s available (there will be more openings toward the end of the school year). Applied to this charter school close to home that’s in the top 10% of my state’s schools, got an answer back in 2 days that they wanted to come in for an interview.

I’d also spent this time off making myself a teacher portfolio; has professional documents, certifications, classroom samples, curriculum design samples, classroom structural plans, etc, I have both a binder and website version. When I got to the interview, they kept me waiting for quite a while in the office but I just sat there. I was meeting the assistance principal, no HR. Once we got to the conference room, I offered her my portfolio and she said, “what made you feel the need to bring that in today?” Told her that it was highly recommended by colleagues and universities to create one and I wanted to have something that supports any answer I may give. She just set it to the side (although she slowly perused it later).

The interview was good, I think. She was really hard to read. She was cordial and polite but very neutral. She asked me some very basic questions like what grade levels do I want to teach, have I had experience teaching 9th grade, what do you know about our school, what is something you struggle with, etc. To the latter, I spoke to my difficulties with data collection and analysis but that I had a new plan I was hoping to implement and described it. All of this took maybe 10-15 minutes?

She then spent the last 30 minutes or so basically selling me the position. Talked about the school, what I could expect, what a day was like, how they a strict on discipline and never have fights, how she expects teachers to leave by 3:30, how they a careful about protecting planning time, how theres plenty of technology available, etc. I did ask her about 5 questions or so which she answered readily. But then she started asking about my kids and dangled the final carrot in my face which was if I got the job, my kids could attend. She told me she had other interviews to do that week but she’d let me know something by next week (the week that just ended).

We wrapped things up and she walked me out to the office. We shook hands, I said thank you and left. Later that day, I sent a thank you email and she repeated she’d get back to me next week.

Well, next week has come and gone. I am aware that her not calling me back could have absolutely nothing to do with me at all. But I’m really qualified for these industries and I’ve always gotten my past jobs on the first try so I’m genuinely confused as to why the interview went well only to hear nothing. Was it the teacher portfolio? She seemed put off by that. She wasn’t interested in taking the QR codes I had for the digital version so she could look at it after I left with the binder. But, a large number of people in the teaching subreddits agree portfolios can be really helpful.

My dad says email her Monday and ask what’s up. Husband agrees. But maybe I’m self-conscious about it. Ideas?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I did ask her if she had any feedback or concerns about my resume at the end and she said, no, I’m a solid candidate."

One was a local community farm I did programs with growing up and essentially just glided into a position as a general universal worker followed by becoming the greenhouse manager, and the other was a horse barn I had been riding at since I was a child. 
In both of these positions I was approached and asked to apply, and both were only part time. They were $15.50/h and $12.50/h respectively, so not sustainable for me as the cost of living here is $19/h full time

I am now looking at a greenhouse grower job at the regional supplier of supermarket flowers, having over 10 acres of greenhouse space, and the position is full time at $23 an hour. They ask for either a bachelors in horticulture or comparable experience, I have an associates in general science and two years as a small greenhouse manager.


I have never done a formal interview before, let alone with people I don’t already have a good working relationship with, and have no clue what I’m doing. I’m also going back to college part time in the fall, and it’s unclear if this is intended as just a seasonal position or longer term. 

Is it safe to ask them or would that send up red flags? 

Should I be open about what I’m doing in the fall, or leave it ambiguous?

And would it be appropriate to use my previous employer, the director of the local farm, as a reference since I am now partially his boss, being in the board of directors?

Any other advice would also be *extremely* appreciated"

We work on a lot of tight deadlines between April and September. My team in particular tends to get busy around this time of year. I'm the newest hire of the team, having worked for about three months, and Coworker A is still a junior staff member who's worked there for two years. There is also a Coworker B who has been on the job for about 30 years, but they work part-time and are facing retirement soon.

I got accepted to a funded MA and a summer program, and I plan to travel for that summer program after the first week of June. In the employee handbook, there are instructions to leave a 2-week notice. However, I have a supervisor who has complained a LOT in the last week about one of their higher-ups taking a vacation in mid-May when they notified us 6 weeks in advance. To some extent, I get why they're upset - we have a deadline that's been pushed back from the beginning of June to almost the beginning of May, leaving a huge crunch for my team specifically. Then again, notification of travel six weeks ahead of time seems perfectly acceptable?

I don't want to burn bridges and I don't want to leave my coworkers in a tough situation. I fear that if I leave in June, they won't have an experienced worker on the team by August, which is the busiest month on their fiscal year. I also want to make sure that they aren't thinking that I've been withholding all this grad school and summer program stuff from them, because I'm pretty sure there would be some unsavory talk about me behind closed doors if that happened. What are the steps that I should take to ensure that I maintain good relationships with my company, leave on a good note, and minimize the possibility of screwing my team over as they search for someone else to train? Should I necessarily tell them I'm going on to higher education?"

(Details in body.),u/pardon_the_mess,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12gle11/would_you_all_be_willing_to_comment_as_to_whether/,jobs,"Hello. I'd like to post something that happened over the past week and ask for your feedback (especially any hiring managers). I have been very nervous all weekend as to whether I blew a great opportunity. 

So I am a clinical social worker and psychotherapist. Last week, a recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn and I had a 30-minute phone interview with him for a job at a large mental health provider. The discussion went great and the job sounded amazing because a) the kind of population they are serving is exactly what I specialize in, b) it would double my salary at a time that I'm dealing with a lot of debts, and c) it's hybrid, and d) I would be allowed to pick where in NYC I would like my office to be. The recruiter told me he would love for me to move forward in the interview process and may even be able to get all the interviews done in the same week.

So this last Monday, I had a 30-minute phone interview with the firm's internal recruiter. That also went very well and she wanted to schedule me for a Zoom interview with their Marketing President the very next morning. That next interview went really great and she kept saying how much of a pleasure it was to talk with me. We were both literally having fun. 

So they set me up with the final Zoom interview this past Friday. This one was with the Medical Director, a doctor. And he basically had the final word on my hiring. Going with the same successful strategy as the other interviews, I worked to be engaging, smart, funny, and friendly. However, I think I tried a little too hard, since I kept interrupting him (I caught myself and apologized). I also got a little too excited because his clinical interests were exactly the same as mine, and I think I came off as overly eager to share my knowledge and work, though he did seem highly interested in my specific clinical interests and kept asking me questions about it. 

At the end, he asked me if I had any questions for him, and for some reason, I was caught off-guard by that. Trying to think quickly, I asked him about future opportunities to get promoted and move up in the firm. He said that there may be, but they're not thinking that far ahead yet. I also tried to ask him about his role at the firm and he kind of bluntly said, ""I'm the Clinical Director. Do you have any other questions?"" I said I had no other questions since I had spoken with a lot of people at the firm already and all my questions were answered by the others. He ended by saying I appear to be a ""solid clinician"" and they'll let me know their final decision soon.

I am afraid I blew the final interview by being too intense, interrupting him a few times, asking about future promotions (which may seem like I'm not interested in the job they're recruiting me for), and not having any real questions for him. What do you think? Did I screw up? And if so, is there any way to recover? I don't have his email address so I can't even send him a thank-you note. 

Sorry for the long post. Thank you for any and all feedback."

I have seen several posts about fake/scam job posting on LinkedIn and Reddit lately. So, I decided to share what to look out for in a fake job description.

 I would like to say that I fell for one of these about a month ago, but was able to stop in time before I divulged any important information.

Below is a basic infographic of what to look for in a fake job posting.

Additional information:

&#x200B;

* The job posting will disappear once they have collected enough resumes with contact information. They now have you name, phone number and location and possibly address.  
   * If they hook you and you provide your SSN and bank accounts, they have all they need for identity theft
* Within a day or two they will text you about a job they have open and ask if you’re interested in interviewing for it. It will **not** be for a company or position you applied to. Usually it is a Data Entry job that pays $30-$40 an hour on contract.
   * They will use the name of a person that works for the company and use a fake domain name that looks similar to the company website name.
   * If you ask for a job description, they will send one and include lots of information to hook you in.
* You’re interested so you reply to the text or send an email to the one provided in the text
* Next, they will inform you that the interview will take place using RingCentral or something similar.  
   * They ask you to set up an account and send a message to the contact name to verify you are ready for the interview time.
* Then you will receive instructions of how the interview will proceed which is usually by text/chat message. Huge **red flag** here, no phone screen, no video with interviewer, just text chat with them.
* Onboarding proceeds and you fill out documents for direct deposit, setting up your tax information, etc.
* Once they receive this information, they will probably cease communicating with you. They have all they need to sell your information on the dark web and/or open credit accounts in your name. 
   * The might also use your identity and job history to get a remote job in the United States with the pay going to their off-shore account or somewhere similar.

DO NOT trust the Easy Apply button. You should always go directly to the company website, without using any link provided in the job posting, and verify the job is posted there and apply that way. The easy way is not always the best way. 

If you have additional info to share please reply to this post.

19,2023-04-09,From being laid off to accepting an offer within 1 month - why LinkedIn Profiles are important,u/cjl1023,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12gpa7b/from_being_laid_off_to_accepting_an_offer_within/,jobs," Like many others this year, I was impacted by the rough economy and declining job market. While there is no denying looking for jobs in this climate is frustrating I wanted to share how I was able to land an offer within a month of being laid off and why LinkedIn can be used in a low effort way with potential for high reward.

Quick background, I am a recruiter who was laid off. Like many others, I was tweaking and applying to roles and while I was getting interviews through this it wasn't how I secured my offer. How did I? A recruiter reached out to me based on my LinkedIn. I never even applied for the role until the offer had already been accepted.

There are a few benefits of having the effective profile built out 1) it allows recruiters/managers to find your profile 2) once it is optimized it allows you to open yourself up to outreach with little effort from there on out 3) it is likely that if someone is reaching out to you about a role, you have more leverage as a candidate.

Here are the key things when building out your profile.

1. Brand your past experiences, work and education in ways that show you have the skills that match roles you are targeting. Use this in your position descriptions, job titles, the skills portions, bio, etc.
2. Make sure you are open to work and include the specific titles of roles listed as what you are targeting. This will help you improve your search result positioning.
3. Location is important. I recommend always including the country you are based in as one of the locations you are targeting, and then including specific cities/regions. Why? Well, if you have United States as a preferred location, and they are searching for a role ideally in Atlanta but open to other locations your profile will still show up, and if your background matches you'll likely get a reach out.
4. Keep your profile more high level to better show in search results, rather than hard specifics that can be saved for your resume. The goal of your profile is to have someone reach out to you about your experience. Having too much specific detail could potentially lead to incorrect assumptions and a decision that you may not be a match. Leave some ambiguity to spark curiosity from the person reading it.

Here is a real world example of how I would apply this. Say you want to secure a Customer Success role and want to structure your profile to advertise you are a fit for that. You need to understand how a recruiter would search in LinkedIn to find that profile. Let's say a recruiter is looking to fill a Customer Success role with some CRM experience with at least 5+ years of experience.

First, majority of recruiters would start with the title or close title. Think Customer Success, Customer Account Manager, or Account Manager. However, if you have any of those phrases listed as your title, job targets, skills, bio or in your experience you WILL show in the results. The more you have it, the better you show in results.

Second, they will likely then add technical skills like CRM, Customer Relationship Management, or a specific tool like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, etc. Again, you can have these called out in your skills section and experience to increase your searchability.

Third, they will likely filter out for experience needed. In LinkedIn Recruiter there is a years of experience filter. Don't let this stress you out. It can't be used in a way to search for 5 years of specific experience. So if you have work experience dating back to 2017 you will still be filtered in.

Last, the recruiter will be looking at some high level bullets of your experience to asses match. They will be starting at the more recent experience and working reverse chronologically. This is where high level bullets can benefit you even if you are not in the specific role today. You can add experience like ""responsible for managing portfolio of customers and customer success through onboarding, adoption, and retention"" and ""used Salesforce/CRM to track and ensure customer success"" and ""resolved customer issues to support and improve customer success"". The call outs will get attention and improve your results.

Besides getting found by recruiters or parties looking to hire, here is the best part you need to know as a candidate. If they are reaching out to you, they likely are having trouble filling the role or are proactively searching for talent. Why is this helpful? You have leverage. If there are less candidates in the mix, you will very likely have a better shot at negotiating a better offer. You get categorized as ""Passive talent"" meaning that they expressed interest in you. This topic is a whole different strong of recommendations, but likely puts you in a much better position to negotiate.

Hope this helps and I am happy to answer any additional questions. Good luck to everyone searching!"

I asked for a raise and was told no, but we could revisit my request at the end of Q1.

Q1 ended and I emailed my manager to follow up. Around the same time, the CEO emailed that he “made the hard decision” to not offer merit increases all year because our Q1 profits and projected Q2 profits were low. As such, my second request was rejected.

I found out that the people who came in after me are making $5k more a year than I am, and it doesn’t make a lot of sense because we’re being paid differently for the same experience, same job description, and same responsibilities. I met with my manager and he encouraged me to go above his head and talk with his boss directly.

I’m very nervous to email his boss. I don’t want to get in trouble for being pushy, but this is something I feel strongly about. At the VERY least, I feel I’ve earned a raise to match those who came in after me. 

Obviously I will be very professional in my email, but any other advice would be appreciated."

On Friday, I called unemployment. I was able to start a claim right away since I worked less than 35 hours last week, but my state is taking 6-8 weeks to process new unemployment applications. I do qualify due to the fact that I had left a steady full time job for this one. I did some applications when I got home on Thursday night after being let go, and already have an interview at another hospital on Tuesday. I am hoping that works out. At this point, I am planning to apply at local fast food places if I do not have something in the next 1-2 weeks. I cannot go 6-8 weeks with no income. I was already living paycheck to paycheck. In my area, I can actually make more in fast food than on unemployment anyway. Burger King is hiring full time for $16/hour."
63,2023-04-09,How can I decrease performance to avoid burnout without getting fired?,u/findingnew2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12gqp7o/how_can_i_decrease_performance_to_avoid_burnout/,jobs,"I have performed at peak level consistently for 2 years and thus defined this very high output as my normal baseline. My boss now expects me to perform at this level all the time.

The truth is I’ve been killing myself at work to perform at this high level in the hopes of getting rewarded. I wasn’t rewarded AT ALL and even more workload was assigned to me. At the moment the only way to do everything would be to work 15 hours days 7 times a week. And even then, my boss would just simply give me even more work so it’s pointless.

I give a lot to this company which gives me NOTHING in return so I’ve decided to give LESS. The issue is that if I perform less then I’ll be disappointing my boss which I fear will lead to getting fired down the line.

On the other hand the alternative is burnout.

I’m of course looking for another job but it can take months to find a new one, or even more than a year (I’m not in the USA).

My question is, until I find another job how do I operate in my current job ? My goal being to :

· Avoid doing a burnout

· Avoid unnecessary tensions at work (especially with my boss who has anger issues)

· Not get fired before I find a new job (which can take a looong time, last time it took me 2 years)"

Been here for 3 weeks now. Working 5-8’s 6am till 2pm no weekends. Pretty easy grind and I do enjoy it. Commute is 30min rural 

I have recently been offered a job at a new district around the same salary I was getting at my old district. 40k a year and 3 day weekends again along with 4 weeks of PTO a year. Commute is 50min rural from home. 

Only thing I am stuck on is the potential to make more money doing what I’m doing currently but to me it seems like a dead end job compared to teaching. I do plan on going back to teaching eventually either way. What would you guys do? I’m literally stuck between the 2."

I start my new job on Tuesday, I’m based in the UK so the 7th&10th are bank holidays. 

My manager got in touch with me on Tuesday to let me know about the first day and the start time and that she will send me over a zoom welcome meeting. 

I replied asking if the equipment will be sent to my home address or will I need to be in the office for the first day and it was confirmed it will be posted to my home address. I haven’t received anything so on Thursday I emailed my manager asking if there was an estimated time it would be delivered and my manager replied saying they will find out for me and I did not get a reply back before end of work day. 

I believe most couriers in the UK do not deliver on bank holidays so it’s very unlikely I will have it by 10am Tuesday (my start date&time). 

What should I do? Should I email on Monday anyways saying it hasn’t arrived yet? Do I just leave it until Tuesday when I start to say I haven’t received anything?

10,2023-04-09,The Dehumanization of the Job Market: My Frustrations with ATS Scans and Ignorant Recruiters,u/Tath92,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12gxdxn/the_dehumanization_of_the_job_market_my/,jobs,"The job market has become increasingly dehumanized, leaving job seekers feeling frustrated and undervalued. ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scans have become a ubiquitous part of the hiring process, often filtering out resumes before a human being even has a chance to see it. Recruiters and hiring managers have become so focused on filling a role that they often forget that there are real people behind those resumes, with hopes, dreams, and families.

As a job seeker, it's disheartening to spend hours crafting a resume and cover letter, only to be filtered out by an algorithm that may not even take into account the full scope of our qualifications and experiences. It's frustrating to see our job applications disappear into a black hole, never to receive any feedback or acknowledgement.

But it's not just the ATS scans that are the problem. Recruiters and hiring managers have also become disconnected from the human aspect of the hiring process. Many are so overwhelmed by the volume of applications they receive that they don't take the time to respond to candidates, let alone provide constructive feedback.

It's not uncommon for job seekers to send heartfelt inmails on LinkedIn, only to be ignored by an arrogant recruiter who may not even realize the impact of their dismissiveness. This kind of treatment can leave job seekers feeling like they don't matter, like they're just another faceless candidate in a sea of applications.

The dehumanization of the job market is not only frustrating for job seekers, but it also undermines the hiring process. By focusing solely on qualifications and experiences, employers miss out on the potential for a great candidate who may not check all the boxes on paper but has the potential to bring new perspectives and ideas to the role.

As job seekers, it's important to remember that we are more than just our resumes. We have unique experiences, skills, and passions that can bring value to an organization. It's up to us to keep pushing forward, despite the dehumanization of the job market. And it's up to recruiters and hiring managers to remember that there are people behind those resumes, and to treat candidates with the respect and dignity they deserve.

In conclusion, the job market has become increasingly dehumanized, leaving job seekers feeling undervalued and frustrated. While ATS scans and overwhelmed recruiters may seem like insurmountable obstacles, it's important to remember that we are more than just our resumes. By continuing to push forward and reminding recruiters and hiring managers of our humanity, we can work to create a more equitable and respectful hiring process."

A couple of weeks ago I had another meeting with her and she has again suggested that I needed to improve but if I don’t I will be put on a PIP. The job has really ground me down and I’m sure if I stay I will not survive. When it comes down to it I don’t like the work, morale in my department is low and it’s sometimes toxic, and we used outdated technology that draws out the work with no switch to newer tech on the horizon. Most importantly I know I’m not a good fit for the job and all of these things have put my mental health down the drain. 
I have daily anxiety that I’m going to do something wrong and it’s really consuming.

I’ve been trying to get another job and applying like crazy and I’ve had a few interviews but they would be a pay cut. Obviously any job is better than no job, but I’m really ready to pull the plug.

Hiring is definitely not the main part of his job, so I don't want to bug him if it would be inappropriate.

I originally went through all the stages of the hiring funnel successfully, but they let me know that things had changed and they weren't going to be hiring anyone after all. They made it clear that I was their top choice from the interviews, though.

I'd legit participated in some tutor classes in my early years at college. Not as a tutor though, but as a student. I had a good grasp on what the duties these tutors do, and how the environment in the classes usually are enough that I might be able to mimic myself in the tutor position.

Could use a little professional advice here to see what my Reddit cohort thinks. But first a little background.

I just started a new job with a university as a Digital Content Producer after having worked as a Communications Specialist in a school district for 7 years. I left because I felt as though there was nowhere for me to advance. 

I ended up applying for a similar job at a university that pays more but I’m beginning to regret my decision two weeks in. The new job has several hurdles when it comes to getting work approved. My previous workflow was a lot more one on one. Now I have project managers and managers for those project managers.

When I left, the district wanted to keep me but could not make a counter offer since the superintendent was on their way out. Now that I’ve left and they hired a new superintendent, they have listed a new job with a new title and new pay scale that matches where I am at now with the university.

Would it be in poor taste to try to get my old job back? Im not quite sure what to do here. Ive only been with the university for two weeks, and everyone has been great. I just feel that I miss my former workflow."

I spent the past 4 years of my life working in the legal cannabis industry in Colorado where I have excelled, thrived and made the most money I have in my career. Unfortunately those days are over and the industry is tanking due to oversaturation. I've done everything from being a lead budtender at some of Denver's best dispensaries I spent a year and a half doing cultivation and my last job I was in marketing for an extract company. I get how companies can lay you off do the lack of funds or having to downsize. But unfortunately this has happened to me one too many times in this industry. I was making great money in cultivation and marketing but however the money is just not there anymore . How does one transition out of the industry because I know it's still stigmatized but I took all of my positions with responsibility and acted professionally throughout all of them. I wasn't  just some Stoner trying to get high for free or cheap. I just want to get out of the industry and get into something more worthwhile and something that I can actually pay the bills again I've hired a professional to completely redo my resume and I'm not smoking weed anymore so I can pass drug tests. TLDR Have any of you guys worked in the legal cannabis industry and managed to get a job out side of it."

I'm a 28 year old single male living in a rural area. I'm looking to get out and move to the city. My company isn't that great to work for anyway. The raises the last couple years have been subpar compared to inflation. On top of this, I commute to the city every weekend, about 45 minutes one way, as I enjoy the nightlife and social opportunities. My town doesn't have what I'm wanting in that aspect.

I want to look for a new job and then hopefully move out somewhat soon after. We don't get our vacation time until May 1st. My thought was, use a bit of that, and leave some of it to use while I interview. I'm just struggling to remain patient. I'm starting to get restless and tired of the situation.

After 2 years of unemployment I found a well paying job that’s 100% remote. I work from home, usually in sweatpants and can see my children throughout the day. I’ve been there for 6 months and have settled in well.

The issue I’m having difficulty with is that I live in a very laid back island where full time isn’t 40 hours a week (usually a lot less…we still have siestas here!) and as my job is overseas, I work from 9-6 daily. By the time I’ve finished work it’s time for me to feed, bathe and put my kids to sleep. Weekends are spent doing laundry, food shopping and cleaning and before I know it, it’s Monday again, I haven’t taken my kids anywhere and I haven’t done anything!

I know it doesn’t sound like much to others, as other countries have it a lot worse, but I’m struggling to find a work-life balance. Can anyone offer me advice? I’m tired and bored of living like this! Is this normal? Am I being ungrateful? 

(For reference my previous job was full time and I taught four 3-hour classes a week, with 4 office hours, so 16 hours in total. Now I’m working 45 hours)."

Naturally, I have always sort of fled workplaces in search for a new one. This has made job hunting kind of easy in terms that I look at job postings and I think ""Oh yeah, I could do that ***submits resume***.""

Now, however, I am faced with a new situation and I'd like input.

I really like my job right now. It's challenging, it's pretty much 50/50 hands on and office, my boss is cool and flexible with home stuff, and I generally like and get along with the people I work with daily. The cons are: boys club, 40 minute commute, and I am not exactly on the career path I want (Product Quality Engineer - still under Operations somehow, would like to just be QE).

Anyway, the biggest driver is actually the commute. My SO and I want to add to our family. But I am currently driving 40min one way, about 1.5hrs daily, which is almost 8hrs by the end of the week. I get up at 6/630 and I come home 530-6. I used to really enjoy the commute, I've been doing this for almost 5 years. But it's starting to really wear on me now. 

There is a job local to my home that I was reached out to about sometime back. It's still up, and I still have the recruiters contact info and all that. It's close, and as long as I get the high end of the pay range (which I don't see why I wouldn't) it would be a lateral move financially, a step in the direction of the career I want, and I would be closer to home. 

But I can't bring myself to apply. It feels...wrong? I can't tell if I'm scared that it won't work out culturally or if I feel guilty...I'm so hesitant.

Have any of you left good jobs before? How did you do it? How did you feel?"

I started working a few months ago as HR Recruiting Specialist at a manufacturing company, my second experience in the role. 

Compared to my colleagues, due to inexperience, I find it very difficult to manage the recruitment of qualified personnel and I have quarreled several times with the manager.


Last week she informed me that I have been demoted to “Junior Recruiting Assistant”, and I will report to one of my former recruiter colleagues (who seemed to dream of having me as her assistant)


Should I stay or should I quit?

Edit: the salary doesn’t change, the manager (now second line supervisor) told me she cares about having me in her team if I improve performance and I learn ""to be more humble""."

1,2023-04-10,Does previously interning and working at a company make it easier to get a full time job at that same company?,u/EnvironmentalTap6314,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12hk1lz/does_previously_interning_and_working_at_a/,jobs," 

Ok so I recently asked for something similar but I can provide more details to avoid confusion.

Last year, I interned for a large company. I was a great worker. My manager liked me and showed me the amazing review they wrote for me. It specifically recommended me for other roles at this company.

After the summer internship ended, I was confident that interning will get me many interviews at this company. I stupidly only applied at this company. Now, I know that I was wrong.

I sent over 100 applications from October to March. I fit all qualifications. I was rejected for most and ghosted by the remaining. Many of the rejections were 1 day after I applied. Out of over 100, only 4 had an interview request.

But I remember applying to over 40 roles **before I got that internship** and I got 3 interviews.

Doesn't being a previous great worker help get automatic interviews and a higher chance of job offers? I saw people getting hired for these positions that never worked for this company. I am getting rejected by many departments, teams, recruiters, and organizations I never interacted.

What is going on? My resume is great. Isn't the economic situation better now? Am I that terrible compared to other applicants? I am ready for remote and in-person work. I have no idea why I cannot even get interviews for roles I fit at a company I already worked for. Sheesh."

And alas, no one bites after the interview. I have constantly been told mid interview process I’m “outgoing” a good conversationalist, etc. but when it comes down to it I’ve also been told they go for the person with more experience.

Well I finally started reapplying to entry level rolls in the legal field and made it to an interview last Thursday. I thought it went really well, not all of my interviews do of course but I had faith, they said they’d contact me, I sent a thank you email, but it’s crickets.

The reject letters have become more frequent these past few weeks. I'm doing the best I can to search for a job, but my parents feel otherwise. Regardless of the amount of work, they still speak negativity about me. All they do is complain about how hard their lives are, and how their lives would have been easier if they didn't have children. Obviously, the option would be to ""just move out"" to not have to deal with this nonsense, but I'm in the financial position to do that. Also, I don't have supportive network of friends that I can rely on. 

Now, I feel kind of lost. It's a very lonely feeling not having your family pick you up while your down. They thrive on mocking one another for their shortcomings. It's not safe to be vulnerable around them. One top of that, I'm running out of my own savings money. I didn't qualify for unemployment, even though I was laid off from my paid internship. This has caused me a great deal panic because I don't want to rely on my parents for grocery money, too. That will just give them another thing to complain about. 

Where should I look for assistance? I apologize if the post comes off as vent post, but I needed to give context as to what I'm dealing with while job searching. It's a lot harder to hunt for jobs when the people you live with treat you like your not good enough."

I am a graphic designer with over 9 years of experience and have been working for a tech start-up company for almost 1.5 years. Since joining the company they have fired two of my managers. They just hired (my third manager) a female about three weeks ago. This person has no managerial or marketing experience.

A little background structure about the company. I work for the parent company's marketing team and our team is small only 3 people including myself. There are also two subsidiary companies in our office. One of the subsidiary companies has a marketing team of about 9 people.

The first project with my new manager was to design a presentation. She was very unclear in her instructions about what she wanted, but I managed to deliver to the best of my ability and on time. She approved my final work in an email. The following week I am told by another colleague that I will be taken off my team and working for the other subsidiary team full-time for the entire month. I will be helping the other designer with their work. I was confused about this, so I set a meeting with my new manager to get clarification.

The meeting did not go well, right away she attacked my work saying that I was not capable of doing that level of work and that she outsourced the project to another company, She said my work was sloppy and looked like I slapped it together. I was offended, as an experienced designer who takes pride in their work. I give every project my best and have been praised by colleagues at my company for doing such amazing work.

I asked her in the meeting to show me an example of what she was looking for. After seeing her example, I told her that I was fully capable of designing that kind of graphic. She also said I did not deliver the presentation on time (which I did). She told me that she doesn't need my help only 10% of the time, and that's why she told the other team they can take me full-time for the month. I asked her which team I will be working for after the month. She was very offended I asked that question and told me to talk to HR. I told her there is a lot of design work that I could be doing on our team, but she did not care to listen.

The next day, I talked to the HR assistant and told her everything that happened. She told me to just wait it out and see what happens.

Also, this new manager is making changes to our website and branding. As the graphic designer for the parent company, I have been working with the company brand since the beginning.  I told HR in my meeting that I see her and other people changing the branding. I told HR the problem is there is no creative direction for the company.  I suggested the idea of promoting me to Art Director so I could lead the company branding in the right direction. I have past experience being an AD and I have been doing AD roles already for this company before this new manager was hired.

I am frustrated because I have worked hard for this company and I deserve a promotion, but I feel like I am starting from ground zero with this new manager. I feel like I am in limbo right now. This new manager has no idea of my capabilities or the work I have done in the past and has just tossed me aside. I think it looks bad that she took me off the project, a project that should have been kept within the team, and hired an external agency to do it. I feel like I need to fight and advocate for myself because this new manager treats me like I am useless to the company.

Any advice, tips, or insight on this complicated issue would be greatly helpful

Do I pursue talking to the HR Director (I have heard she is not helpful), but, it might be good to have on record what has been happening?

I was also thinking I could talk to the VP of Marketing (for the subsidiary team I am helping). To gain some more insight and perspective.

Sorry for the long rant.

Thank you very much!"

I have PTO that they've incentivized so if I stay until the bitter end (April 28), I'll get 85% of my PTO paid out, which I need so I pretty much have to suck it up.

Any ideas to make the best of a terrible situation? TIA."

I received an offer for a remote, hourly internship from a consulting firm. I ask if/when the role can convert to full-time salaried, to which they reply: “Not sure, market bad.” 

24 hrs later firm offers me a full-time salaried position - they just scored with a Chinese client and need me now. Catch is I have to relocate. 

LinkedIn tells me I have more language/in-country/educational experience than “senior” employees in the same role, but the salary offer is low 60's. No budging when I ask for more.

Written offer was supposed to be in-hand last week of March. Politely asking when I will get it get me this: “We’ll get it to you tomorrow/soon.” Currently in week 3 of this. 

How big of a red flag is all this? From feet dragging to salary? What are standard relocation rates for U.S. firms? I’m continuing to interview elsewhere, but worry about the cost and difficulty of relocating as the start date draws nearer and nearer, and I’m still without offer in hand."

Now I’m trying to reflect and see where I can improve.. the hiring manager (first interview) was adamant about the right candidate needing to be very quantitative (even though it’s not generally a super quantitative role). As well as mentioning that work life balance is tough, it’s not a 9-5, they work weekends on occasion, and it’s a demanding job. 

So the next few interviews with the broader team, I asked each of them about work life balance and about the HM’s focus on this role being quantitative. Do you think when they debriefed, the fact that I asked everyone about those two things made them think 1) I’m not excited about it being quantitative and 2) that I’m looking more for a 9-5? I generally just asked their experience and what they expected of this role, other than the HM’s needs for analytical skills."

Thing is i already had a first phone interview to test my english it went amazing, they sent me an online test to for the technologies required in the job and i went BAD, really BAD. Since it went so bad i expected them to not reach out to me anymore, but they did, i guess they haven't seen the results? And now they want me to do a technical interview with a person, i do not want this to happen cuz i already had a really bad experience with the test and i don't want to embarrass myself in front of another person...

for more context: The job i applied for is a Machine Learning in Python thing, when i applied i only read ""Python"" and applied. The thing is that i know Python but i'm not very fond of the machine learning libraries they use... I studied for some days and got to learn it but it has many scenarios that i don't think im capable of doing... and that's why i don't even want to take the interview..."

What I have going for me: I've been working the event staffer role in a different location, so management KNOWS that I know the program backwards and forwards and that I can reach sales numbers. The entire team I worked with is able to vouch for me as reliable/knowledgeable/professional/effective. I also have years of relevant experience.  
I haven't signed an offer letter yet. I'm planning on reaching out to the hiring manager to see if it's possible to push back the start date by two weekends. Another potential option would be if I changed my flight so I would only have to miss one weekend of work (I don't want to do this, but money wise, it'd be worth it if I had the job). I get that there's no way to guarantee the hiring manager will allow this unless I cancel my entire trip, and thereby bail on my best friend who I planned it with. I'm not sure how set-in-stone the start date is, but I want to do whatever I can to have this job.  
Is there anything you'd do differently if you were me? Any particular phrasing you would use? Should I see if it's possible to push the dates back first, or see if it's possible to just miss a week of travel so I only miss a weekend of work?

  
**tl;dr** I landed my dream job but as of right now am scheduled to be out of the country for 2 out of the 7 weekends' worth of work; what's the best way to negotiate a later start date?"

That being said, this is going to be a long one.

Back in 2018, I was hired by a company that was pretty much just starting up. The company does official repairs on Apple products and I was hired as a technician to help maintain the volume of repairs in control. Back then, there was only 1 technician working there and then there was the owner who was the person who called me and asked me to come in. I knew the owner from my previous job experience at another company that performed official Apple repairs. When I worked for this company, the owner would come in and bring devices in bulk for us to repair so they could resell them. That's how they remembered me and they found me on LinkedIn for the sole purpose of asking me to come in and help out at this new company they have started. The problem with this, initially, was the only other tech there was not informed of this or consulted. From what I learned, the other tech had been working there for a long time and, because there was no one to cover for them, they hadn't been able to take a vacation or some days off. It got to the point that the other tech forced their time off and vacation so the owner was probably forced in getting someone to cover for them. So I did.

It was hard to cover for someone when you do not know the nuances and procedures that needed to be followed in order to do things properly. The other tech was not there, and the owner had NO idea on how things were ran or what to do in specific situations, so my new coworker was forced to call me and just explain some things I needed to do to keep some form of order there. The days passed and my new coworker finally came back from their vacation, so things got better.

There is one key thing about this person though that I did not mention. I have worked with them before at the same job I met the owner! I worked with them for about a year because they were fired due to a sudden change in leadership at my previous job. They were fired due to being unable to attend a meeting with the new owner of that company. Yes... They were on vacation then too. Anyways.

As days passed at my new job, some issues with the location we were in began to boil up. The place that was rented for our business was shared with another company and the two owners butted heads with one another about some things. I was never clear on that, but it culminated in the owner of my company, now my boss, starting to scout out for a new place to be. During this process and the changes to come, I was asked not to come to work again and that they would be in contacted with me in a few weeks or a month to see whether I would return. The remaining tech helped a lot with the move and relocation of the business, new people were hired to help out and it eventually became a more proper repair shop. It took some time, but I was eventually called back to work there again.

It is now somewhere in 2019. The business is going fine. Obviously, the first tech at the company was the one in charge and taking care of the administrative side of things, working directly with my boss to manage the business. I was solely a tech and worked on fixing what needed to be fixed. A point came in which I mainly focused on fixing iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, Watches, etc) and the other two techs there (a third was hired) would do the computers. Of course, I would help out whenever the queue would get busy on the Mac side of things; though rarely came the time I would get help when my queue of iOS devices got high. Either way, that's how it was.

As time passed and we continued to work, I started to notice a change in the lead tech's behavior. They would space out more and go on break for a full hour, and even lock themselves in the bathroom to smoke marijuana (right inside of the business), and even began to yell more often and treat us all bad. The tech room would often reek of it, and that's just always a smell that I really disliked, but what could I do? An additional thing about my coworker's personality is that things had to be done their way and it was often pretty difficult to convince them otherwise. We had different ideas sometimes, and we often argued a lot about it. I started to speak with my boss directly more often and they agreed that how the lead tech was beginning to treat all of us was just not right and that they were aware of them being absent for such long periods of time. My boss was no longer very happy with how things were going with them, so new people were hired with the goal that the lead tech was going to be eventually fired. They also explained to me they never liked saying who was above anyone else, that we should not worry about job titles, that we work together as a team and that there is no one in charge. I, amongst my other coworkers, found this to be very odd, but we shrugged it off. This is more relevant further down the story.

The day they were fired was a chaotic one because it meant someone had to immediately assume all of the administrative responsibilities that they were in charge of. The person to do that was me, but I was never formally trained on how to do it and I was forced to rely solely on my previous experiences along with my intuition on how things worked. Not to mention, it was now early 2020 and we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, so special considerations and changes were needed to accommodate the changing work environment. Luckily, I had a pretty good understanding and knowledge on how the system we used for ticket, customer, and inventory tracking worked, so I was able to learn more from there. The new person that was hired during this transitional period is very important for later in the story, so keep in the mind! Anyways, I was swarmed with a list of new tasks and responsibilities, but I also got a pay raise, so I felt it was worth it at the time. I then started to work heavily on making sense of the system and logistically connect modules with each other to form procedures with the aim of reducing the time customers take during the initial check in. I built the company a PHP form so customer can directly enter their details into the system along with the ability for them to provide a signature to our terms & conditions without the need of the person at the front desk to do it for them manually. (Yes, we also had a receptionist by then). Other changes that helped us all out were made and all of them made things better one way or another.

More time passed, we continued to work and push the business forward. I was now working directly with my boss to handle the administrative side of the company. I was fully in charge of the system, making changes how I saw fit. I tried to explain to my boss why the changes needed to happen, but they never seemed to understand much on how everything worked, so they left it to me and my best judgement. It was during this time, after many meetings with them, that I started to see just how out of touch and unsynchronized with how our repair process worked. They didn't even know how to properly take care of a customer at the front, something that still holds true today! Albeit, not as bad as it was. Anyway. I began to pick up on these things and we started to argue about it; they would always do most of the talking and I would listen, but I would later reflect on what we talked and then I would give my opinion. A time came in which they decided to get someone else to take the helm on the administrative side of things because they were not seeing any ""progress"". I was still held highly and worked closely with whom they hired next to do said job.

To cut down a bit from the story, about 3 different people came in to do the admin side, all of which left because they saw quickly how it was to work with my boss. After the third person left, I had told them that this fourth person coming in would be the last time that I would invest in explaining how everything worked. After all, for each of those people, I had to sit one-on-one with them and basically onboard them on the processes and procedures that needed to be followed in order to keep our account in good standing and maintain our system with minimal errors. As you all may imagine, it is very tiring to have to do this process over and over again after you have your hopes up that this FINALLY may be the person to be able to properly work with my boss and maintained things how they needed to be maintained. But nope. They left as well.

I should have left right then and there, given my two weeks, and begun my search for a new job. You see, another major factor that had me rethinking things about this job was the very fact that, from the start, we all were paid with a 1099 (AKA Independent Contractors) and not with W2s. The duties and responsibilities we had at this job demanded for a W2, but since the company was fairly small and not well-established yet, we were always lenient on demanding this from our employer; however, we were always hopeful that the day would come this could be implemented. There was a very short period in which it was implemented, a whole two weeks! Then it was removed. It never was implemented again, but I stayed regardless now solely based on the fact that I considered my boss to still be a good, honest person who was just having a really tough time keeping things afloat and just doing what they could to help all of us out. (After all, they DID hire me when I was not working for years before, so I cannot be gracious enough to them about that). We still managed to work out through it, and my boss had brought someone from their own family to help out; that person lasted a month! And they left like everyone else.

It was around this time that the coworker mentioned from earlier (the one that was mostly hired to fire the one who smoked marijuana) was given the ""helm"" per say (even though my boss never liked to say it officially), so I began to butt heads with this coworker because they were under the impression that the situation at the workplace stemmed from my inability to be firm and take charge. Sure, I was not the most firm and demanding person, but how could I ever go against the wishes of my boss? The new coworker in charge began to speak more directly with my boss while I started to go back to being a technician and helping out with the queue. I was still consulted when they were going to make big changes, but no more than that. Even though I was fuming at the current changes that were being made, because I honestly thought I had done nothing wrong and people who were previously hired to do the admin job leaving because of my boss was a clear testament to that, I managed to collect myself and eventually work together with my coworker to both challenge our boss on their unproductive ideas. We started to work together, and instead of my coworker being fully in charge, we started to see it as we both were in charge. My coworker handled more of the workload distribution, and tech room management while I handled administrative tasks such as checking for errors in the system and fix discrepancies.

One thing I forgot to mention was that the system always had errors (as does any system in any company) but I kept those errors to a bare minimum, I'd say about 10% of it had errors that were not fixed; however, there was a time in which I was asked to no longer do that activity, so pretty much being forced to stop. When I did that, errors skyrocketed and it was just so bad that they had to put me back to do it.

To no one's surprise, my coworker eventually got really fed up with my boss. It got to the point that the few of us who worked there formed a WhatsApp group solely so we can talk amongst ourselves about how things were never going to improve and that this was all for nothing. We talked shit, you know, to vent our frustrations about the environment we worked in. Specially since about 70% of meetings we had with our boss, both 1-on-1 and as a team, would result in screaming and one of us walking out of the meeting angrily. It was just demoralizing and just plainly... sad. My boss also began to hire people without consulting us first, and expect us to train them so they can help out; something we did the first few times this happened, but we stopped nearing the end. My coworker eventually gave their two weeks' notice and my boss, well, they didn't react well. The notice was given to them on a Friday, and my coworker was fired that very Sunday. No notice, no extra time. Just plain gone along with an additional coworker. I later found out that the main motivation behind the firings was the sheer fact that they participated a lot in talking crap about my boss. I was just speechless and angrier than I have ever been.

The following Monday, I come in and I have a 1-on-1 meeting with my boss. We had sat together before and discussed some key changes that I needed for them to make in order to remain employed at their company. I had asked them to provide me with a proper W2, and another pay raise since it had been two years before my previous one. In the meeting we had that Monday, they pretty much told me that my pay raise was still ""under review"" and that a new person they had hired that very Monday was going to ""supervise"" me and that I had to work closely with them and my boss to move things along. I mentally checked out as I heard them talk and for the rest of the day, I focused my efforts in gathering all the files and documents I had for the company, make sure I didn't have extra copies of sensitive information such as payroll or client data (I kept track of all the things related to the company and did all of the hours for the employees). I copied it all to an external drive for my boss. The thing about that Monday, though, is that amidst this new drama that had come up, our boss had failed to pay us. Our pay always came on a Friday, bi-weekly, and they had not paid us when we were due that day... a recurring theme if I am to be honest. Our boss, more often that not, was always late on paying us when we were due; what I did on that Monday was told my boss that I urgently needed my full pay because I had payments coming up and I didn't have enough to cover them, so they agreed to take me to the bank directly themselves so I could deposit a check that had my full amount due written on it. (I do not drive.)

Once I made sure my payment was made in full and I copied all of the data relevant for my boss to continue their business, I quit. On the spot. I had called my mom earlier to come pick me up and wanted to wait for her to be outside so I didn't have to wait like an idiot after resigning like that. This is not the end of the story, though! You see, our company always had a ""week in reserve"" of pay for employees so the company could have some leverage to make sure employees do not take advantage of the company if they get fired or they decide to quit. (Things like taking assets of the company with them without permission), but they were always paid once my boss made sure that none of that was taking place. For my coworkers who were fired, they put their accounts and payments up to date in just a couple of days. With me, though, not so much. I had the misfortune of having experienced some recent damages to devices that were brought in for repair, two consecutive ones at that, and of course I assumed all responsibility for those damages and owned up to my mistakes when they happened. Not for it to be an excuse, but I was under a lot of pressure during that time due to all the things that were happening at the company and was not very careful with those repairs, but I digress. My bad. I took this into consideration before leaving though, and was well aware that the amount of the parts used to fix my mistakes would be deducted from my last week's pay, so I was fine with that.

What I was NOT fine with was that, almost half a year ago, there was another incident caused by me in which the volume flex cable of an iPhone XS was torn. A $6 part, mind you. The repair cost for this is, at the very most, $80, but my boss decided to handle it differently. They decided to purchase the device from the customer it belonged to for a whopping $250, which is the price the customer (a vendor, really) could sell the phone for. My boss thought it would be a good idea to pass down those $250 down to me and for my last week's pay to cover it when, again, they failed to listen to me that it could simply be repaired for much less. They just needed to take the phone to a different shop because that type of repair was not done at our store; and I told them I would cover the costs of that. In addition to all of this, they also decided that they would charge me an extra $50 for ordering duplicate tools that we already had at the store. Sure, it sucks extra tools were ordered when they are not immediately needed, but the fact stands the tools are there for company use. They are NOT broken or missing.

The day I quite was on March 6, 2023 and, so fairly recent. My boss now has some people there working for them and trying to hold everything together with that new person they hired on that fateful Monday to ""supervise"" me along with those two people they hired a few months back without consulting us (one of whom has no idea what to do, and constantly makes mistakes). The employee that works as a receptionist there is leaving soon as well.

But yeah, that's my story. My boss still owes me the money for my last week's pay and I am actively looking for a new, better job. Wish me luck, guys! Thank you for reading, I know this was a long post. Also, I would like to take a quick moment to say I have not actively participated in forums before (Including Reddit) so hopefully I didn't do anything wrong by writing this post. I just needed to put my thoughts in writing and for other people to understand my perspective on things.

***UPDATE 03/29/23:*** *I got in contact with my employer and they finally provided me with my final payment on the correct amount I was due. We also talked on the phone for a while and we ended things in good terms. I told them I appreciated them for thinking of me back in 2018 when they hired me and that I genuinely wish them the best of luck with their company. They also expressed the always saw and, and still see me, as a good person.*"

I am a little over one year in so far in my new role and new career track progression.

I work as a coordinator, but my responsibilities also include administrative duties typically overseen in EA roles (from what I’ve read and came across online). I’m aware there is overlap between coordinator and EA (or admin roles) responsibilities.

I report directly only to the head of my department, and interact (both for work and on behalf of my manager) with rest of the senior level management (C-suite). 

With roughly 25-30% of my responsibilities being geared towards directly managing and assisting my manager’s inter-departmental and external comms., meeting scheduling, travel plans, vendor relationships & follow ups, contract development and follow throughs, etc. I was wondering what else would be recommended/advised to learn (in general) if I wanted to move from being a coordinator to eventually becoming an EA?

I’ve read that EA’s are often specialized in major core components related to their company structure/industry/field and/or the Executive they are partnered with, and wanted to know if this information holds true and if it would be a good starting point for me in my research and efforts in career development?

I work a part time job at a retail store and i’ve worked there for over a year. it is my first and only job i’ve ever had so far. A few months ago i had to call out of work for a week due to a kidney stone. i was incapable of working and i couldn’t go to school either. My employer wouldn’t allow me to apply for intermittent FMLA until after i had gotten rid of the stone and all of the days i was gone were counted against me as absence’s. Today i am not feeling well and i’m supposed to go in tonight and i don’t know if i can. I asked my employer what would happen if i didn’t come in and they said it would cost my job. 
If i don’t come in and i get fired, how hard would this make my future and how badly would it affect my ability to get another job right now?"

12,2023-04-10,Thinking about declining a job offer because new employer contacts me on weekends and asked for unpaid work. Red flags?,u/Blue8191,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12i30ou/thinking_about_declining_a_job_offer_because_new/,jobs,"I am a designer. I was laid off over the summer & jobs in my field were very slim at the time. I ended up accepting a job but after a few months in, I wasn't happy. I decided to try stick it out to see if things would improve but it was getting stressful so I decided to start looking for another job for the past few months. 

I do my job hunting at home on my laptop at night after work. I applied to a job on indeed about 11:30pm & got a response from the employer at almost 12am. I thought that was strange that he was up that late but I answered back to his late night emails for the next few days. He'd like to interview me. What raised my eyebrow is that he never asked for my availability at all. Instead he told me the time he was available because he was in meetings. The interview was a video call after work hours. I did the interview anyway even though I'm leery of companies who interview late hours because that makes me think they have no work life balance. But I figured it worked great for me because I didn't have to waste lunch break or tell my current employer that I need time out of the office because I have a ""doctors appointment"".  Interview went great. Then he asked me to re-design a product & if he likes it, we'll talk about the next step in the hiring process. I did it over the weekend & emailed it my art. 

That Sunday, I see a missed call & a text ""can we chat"" I was in church & spending time with my family for the day so I didn't respond. It's the weekend & my free time. That Tuesday he calls me at 8pm while I'm doing laundry saying that he liked my work & wanted to schedule a meeting the following day since someone will be in the office to meet with me before the office closes for vacation. Another round of after business hour emails but again, I shrug it off.

I go in to meet with the person on my 30 minute lunch break.  Things seemed great until she asked for me to quickly design something else in their office. Brow raised again. I declined because I didn't have the time & had to head back to my current job. Plus I just did one test project for them. One wasn't good enough? But I let it slide & quickly did something at home anyway & sent it the following morning. 

It is Saturday & I don't check my professional email. I see another email from them in my notifications. Now the weekend is almost over, I'm done fixing dinner, its after 7pm & I get a call from guess who...They want to hire me. Yay.... I guess. Again, they didn't ask for my availability. They picked my start date 2 weeks from that Monday assuming I already have my resignation letter typed up & ready to go.

10 minutes later, he calls back asking for changes on the artwork that I did because he would like to use it & doesn't want to wait till my start date. Now my other eyebrow is raised. No talks of compensation for the art at all & its now after 8pm before the work week & my food is cold. 

I was excited about the possibility of a new job but I still don't feel right about it. Calling late hours & on weekends. After talking with some friends I've made at my previous jobs, they suggested I request a contract from them first before officially agreeing to anything. Something in writing that states my start date, salary,job description & pay for my time if they want to use the art before my start date. It's a smaller company & smaller companies seem to find loop holes to get over on people. Plus I didn't send my current employer a resignation letter yet. Funny enough, things at my current job have gotten a little better sense I spoken up about the issues I was having. The new job also asked that I start a within one week instead of two weeks. The longer this goes, the less excited I am about accepting the job offer. I'm thinking about asking for more time to think it over but I'm not so sure. Is it too many red flags? What should I do?"

So firstly, I hope this doesn't create a lot of backlash since I'm just looking for objective and reasonable opinions. I just want to not have politics (not so much corporate but conservative v liberal) be so integrated into my office culture as is with my current company.

So, that being said, I want to ask my title question... What are the least politicized industries that allow for remote work? I'm currently in Market Research and really wanted to get into Tech.. But would love some advice on how I can avoid either far right or far left culture entirely, and just work in a non-abrasive environment.

Any feedback is appreciated!

Also please don't chime in to bite my head off. I don't hate anyone and would ask you all to be respectful."

But, I’m just so hurt, and confused; because why would no one just ‘dial direct’ and talk to me, and instead go straight to my boss with an issue they have? I wasn’t written up or anything but I feel a little betrayed. My boss even said she was very surprised by the stuff they told her! I said, “You’re surprised??” I had NO IDEA! I was even asked (one of five out of hundreds) to join our values committee last month. I don’t get it! All I know is that I’m documenting every single thing and trusting no one again.

I was gonna be promoting at@t inside Sam’s clubs stores and getting people to sign up.   The commission pay sounded amazing and I could really see the potential with this opportunity.  I have a server background and that kinda sounded like what I was doing anyway so I thought I’d try it out.  I have no issues with talking to new people or starting the conversation I always find it intresting meeting new people.  Walking in wasn’t really prepared for such a high octane environment though, and whatever confidence I had went out the door as soon as I was greeted with loud music and chants and a big room with no desks filled with people standing around.  That’s because apparently every morning this company’s staff have a pow wow before entering the field.  At first I thought that was kinda cool, but these people do it for like 2-3 hours… a example would be ceo says “Jim made good on his numbers yesterday and he DIDNT TAKE NO FOR A ANSWER, that makes jim ELITE and we love it!” *staff proceeds to bark like dogs in unison* or similar to how a church leader might say “and all gods people said” and the congregation goes “amen.”  The ceo would do the same thing but with sales chants. 

The day goes on and with all the yelling and having to talk to my boss (the manager not the ceo) who’s basically the same age as I am, I feel like my anxiety is going through the roof.  
The ceo comes in and goes over information with the other new hire and I about possible promotion opportunities in the future, making pretty big promises, telling us we will in the next 6 months become managers of our own leading a small.  Honestly all I can think about at this point is how much I hate all of it.  I don’t wanna be a manager and be responsible for someone else.  I don’t wanna be forced to have fun with these people I just met and have to do a dumb chant for money.  And I’m starting to think my ceo and boss isn’t telling the truth.  I finish my workday, and email after that I don’t wanna do this job, and I don’t like the idea of being forced to have fun at a sales prep rally every weekday morning.  No thanks.   All my family thinks I made a mistake, but I personally believe I deserve more dignity at work than that.  Plus I already have a full time job.  Did I make a mistake?"

So my only job has been as an assembly line worker and I don’t know what to put for the description of it.

I'm working on finishing up my Bachelor's degree, I have a majority of my classes in line for the final core-specific classes I'll need to begin taking for my directed degree and so I wanted to ask for some opinions; which route should I go in for finishing up my Bachelor's degree? I kind of intentionally finished my classes the way I did so I could swap and decide if I would get an Entrepreneurship, Financial Planning, etc Bachelor's degree. I'm currently going to Arizona State University, so I'm trying to decide should finish my degree so that I have options within the job market for the degree I've chosen.

As for my future plans, I intended to (hopefully) finish up a Master's degree in either Accountancy, Management or something along those lines. I've maintained a 4.0 GPA up to this point thus far and intentionally networked, so I feel like I would have some decent options. I want to work in a mid-to-upper level position and build some experience and capital, and then work to start a business in a prospecting field at that point when I have some of the connections and funds to do so.

So what do you all think? What would be good options to consider in finishing my Bachelor's degree? I would like to leave it open so that I have if I needed it a job I could obtain out of my Bachelor's if I needed extra time to save funds for my Master's degree depending on how finances look and what scholarships and financial aid I can muster. Trying to go through this whole process as completely debt-free as possible."

I interviewed at a company where two positions were available, Analyst and Senior Analyst.

I was more than qualified for the Senior position however, I was offered the Analyst position. This had a good salary jump and much better conditions of work so I accepted. I mentioned I am aiming for the Senior position which they mentioned I can apply for in 6 months. 

Two months later, they hire a guy who I know, for the Senior Analyst role. I know for a matter of fact that he has less years of experience, and more importantly, he is less skilled for this role.

I was annoyed so I spoke to one of the hiring managers about this and why I was not offered the Senior role. Apparently it came down to a financial decision. The salary jump from my previous company to a Senior Analyst salary would’ve been too high. Hence I was given the Analyst role. They then go and hire someone less qualified than me for the Senior role. I feel like I got played and currently do not feel valued.

Worst part is the guy who they hired for the Senior role is constantly asking me how to do things. 

Am I right to feel this way and how should I handle this going forward. 

I clearly can be earning more and am contemplating looking for other opportunities. On the other hand this position is SO much better than my previous company.

right after i left i felt good but the feeling of anxiety started to creep up on me. what have i done i dont have a job now. nobody is hiring and im gonna be without a job for while. i have enough savings to sustain me for a long time but i have to act quickly to find something asap. all i found so far were jobs that pay even less and i can basically smell the BS in the interview process but eventually ill have to take one of these jobs if nothing else comes along."

I'm angry that, for the last three years, I've been more productive, more engaged and more satisfied with my job than ever before, willing to put in whatever hours were needed and consistently delivering excellent results, and apparently my company didn't care. 

I'm angry that this is being dictated by C-suite execs with huge, quiet offices, and good computer setups, and free snacks, who are imposing this partly because ""it's the way it's always been done"" and partly because it's not as fun being a lord when none of the peasants ever see you in your castle.

I'm angry this is being justified with the usual claims of promoting ""collaboration,"" ""company culture"" and ""innovation,"" even though there's absolutely no data to back them up, and the last three years have been the company's best performing ever.

I'm angry that, if I brought any of this up to my bosses, not only would it not change anything, but they would simply dismiss me as not being a ""team player.""

And most of all, I'm angry that I now have to start looking for another job."

Background:

Contacted via online site by a local recruting firm for a position in my field advertised as 'direct hire'.

Attended interview, and was successfully offered job a couple of days later.

Problem is the recruiter admists she dropped the ball and claims 'misunderstanding' and that the client wants a 6 month contract-to-hire. I do not want this.

I have refused that setup in over a year of job searches, I won't accept them, won't even attend interviews where that's the advertised arrangement.

I have been fully transparent on my requirements from start til now and this feels like a bait and switch.

I haven't signed anything for anyone, so no one legally represents me. Am I able to directly contact the client HR and apply, bypassing the recruiting firm without hassle?"
1,2023-04-11,Managers of reddit - my manager hired a team leader to take off the pressure but they are causing me more stress. Would you want to know?,u/pineappleprincess101,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ige60/managers_of_reddit_my_manager_hired_a_team_leader/,jobs,"My manager is fantastic. Onto it, caring, looks out for us. There’s a culture of us being a high performing team. High trust and really competent. 

My manager recently hired a team leader to take off some of the pressure on them. I’m a high performing employee, and my manager wanted to keep our 1:1s despite him not being my people leader anymore so he could know how I’m going with the transition. Him and I have an excellent relationship. 

The new team leader has been here for three and a bit months now, and it’s clear she is experiencing overwhelm which is normal and totally fine, but there are other behaviours that are making me feel very stressed, frustrated, and exposed.. 

They boil down to a lack of judgement in terms of the work, but also as a manager. 

Everyone can see I’m working hard and have too much on my plate, and she’s fine to tell me to stop working so much, but is doing nothing to lessen the load and calls me on my day off with basic questions she has the answer to. 

She said she sees herself as my sister, anytime she is given basic tasks in my work areas she asks me to do them instead of learning herself so she has the knowledge when she inevitably has to sign things out. Our 1:1s are her talking about her breakup. 

There’s just a lot of talk and no actual do, and I’m scared because it’s a total change in culture and I don’t know if I will be able to work for someone like this. 

Do I stay silent and just try to manage up? 

Do I say something to my manager?  What do I say?"
135,2023-04-11,6 Offers in 12 Months - My Approach to Job Applications (Entry-Level Corporate),u/whadayameanmate,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12igg5z/6_offers_in_12_months_my_approach_to_job/,jobs,"After reading through some of the recent dispiriting posts on this subreddit, I decided that I'd share my approach to job applications in hopes that it will assist someone out there with any arduous employment challenges that may lay ahead. As a disclaimer, I'm a 23yo bloke who just graduated from University with an Engineering degree with next to no professional experience. The offers that I have received have also all been entry-level positions that are reflective (for the most part) of my experience.

With 2 month-long internships under my belt, I managed to secure **6 separate job offers** from top-tier companies in **two different fields** (quarter-life crisis career switch) over the past 12 months with, for the most part, an approach that I honed and used throughout all of the separate hiring processes. 4 of these offers were from my previous field, and 2 from my current one.

To all active job seekers that stumble upon this post - I implore you to think about which elements of this approach may challenge your current strategies and/or what you can tangibly tweak in your approach **that is applicable to you** in my outline.

**Step 1: Application Tracking (and Accountability)**

Whether you're applying for 8 or 800 jobs, you need a tracker to keep on top of your applications. Job hunting is both a *volume* and *quality* game (**more on this later**), so logging key job posting information is critical to retaining visibility and managing the status of your submitted, currently-completing and prospective applications. ^(I really should get sponsored for the countless times I've plugged them), but I use Notion for this as it allows me to quickly customize filters and time-dependent notifications. I've received first-round/digital interviews for 93% of my applications to date - a stat that Notion allows me to track instantly.

Due dates, job posting priority (obviously, prioritize roles you're most interested in), application links, the status of your application and a notes field (to log extra details like employer information session dates) are examples of preliminary information you will want to log in your tracker.

Once the initial framework for your application tracker is complete, **share a view-only link** with your partner, your best mate, a trusted friend who is also applying for jobs, your dog, John from down the road who always asks how your father is doing - anyone who you know can keep you accountable. If you don't need the gentle nudge, skip this part and march on forward.

**Step 2: Build Your Personal Narrative + Relevant Examples**

Assuming that the roles you're applying for all lie within the same industry, building a personal narrative will allow you to call upon a fundamental story that details how you got to where you are today (i.e. in the position of seeking a new role in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ field). Think with an *industry* lens when formulating your personal narrative, do not consider specific companies at all here. My personal narrative consists of: my degree, what drove me to pursue that degree including upbringing, a brief rundown of relevant experience to date, what fundamentally excites/motivates me, and hence why this industry would allow me to thrive. Don't just think about it, but put it into words on a page or screen.

Next, have a look at the prior experience that you have (academically and/or professionally), and pinpoint at least 3 examples of situations in which you encountered each of the following (tailor these to your industry):

1. difficulties in a team;
2. showcased leadership;
3. exceeded expectations.

You will want examples that are as multifaceted as possible to be able to use them for a variety of interview questions.

Following the above will do two things for you.

1. Off-the-cuff edits you will be making to your CV and cover letters (see Step 4) will flow far more naturally, and you'll be able to churn out consistent material much quicker with a narrative to ground your applications on. There will be no ambiguity when it comes to writing about how you can positively contribute to a company/team.
2. Subconsciously, you are already gearing up for the interview process. Inevitable questions such as ""Why do you want to work for us?"" and ""Tell me about yourself"" are already answerable with the narrative and examples that you now know back to front.

These two outcomes are particularly pertinent during the peak interview seasons - I personally had to complete 6 interviews last month in a single week whilst managing FT work, which would've overloaded me with mental fatigue had I not noted down my narrative and examples to the point of them being second nature. Now, let's look at the groundwork required to navigate the widely-used Applicant Tracking Systems and complete CVs and cover letters at scale.

**Step 3: Keywords and Phrases**

By now, you would have encountered ChatGPT or some other freemium AI chatbot. We're going to be using these chatbots to sieve through job postings and extract keywords and phrases that we will need for our CVs and cover letters in Step 4. Here's what you're going to do.

**a.** Go to your AI chatbot of choice, and get the URL to the job posting in question. Type the following in as a prompt:  ""*I am applying for a job in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ field. The job ad is here:* [*insert URL here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*. I am writing a resume and a cover letter tailored to this job posting and require a list of keywords to use. Provide me a list of 15 to use.*"". Go back to your application tracker and create a new field/column next to the relevant job application and store the keyword list there.

**b.** Then, enter the following prompt: ""*Please list out the requirements of the role in dot point form."".* Repeat the same new field/column step as above.

**c.** Lastly, visit the website of the employer and get the URL. Return to the chatbot and enter the following prompt: ""*This is the company's website:* [*insert URL here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*. I need to understand a snapshot of what this company is about to tailor my cover letter in a way that shows I can contribute to the company. Please provide me with 10 sentences that highlight what and who this company is. Start with the company's values.*"". Repeat the same new field/column step as above.

Armed with these three new fields, we now turn to the CVs and cover letters themselves.

**Step 4: Build Your CV and Modular Cover Letter**

First and foremost, I'm not here to talk about the futility of cover letters in today's hiring process. You need them if you want to stand out (in my experience), so what we'll be focussing on is the adaptation of these two key documents to the specific job and company that each application is targeting.

CV:

* 1 page, newest (and only relevant) experience first, specific achievement outlines, extra-curricular achievements, and ensure references are on a separate document (state it is available upon request).
* Under your specific achievement outlines, pepper in the keywords that we extracted in Step 3a., ensuring that you tailor your examples to accommodate a natural, unforced tone.

Cover Letter:

* Here, we are going to write modular, with the following inclusions and structure:
   * Intro
      * Immediately commence with your degree and current position + current project if applicable, noting any prominent achievements to begin with. The aim of the intro is to catch the eye of the employer and to express your desire for the advertised role.
   * Paragraph 1
      * This paragraph will be tailored to expressing your personal interest in the company and role itself using the outputs of Step 3c (**in bold below**).
      * Sentence A: Outline the fact/understanding underpinning your interest in the firm/role. e.g. *As Germany's leading construction contractor for over 35 years, XYZ Corp boasts an* ***unparalleled portfolio*** *of projects that have progressed to define the* ***dynamic infrastructure landscape*** *at a national level, with its ability to deliver* ***consistent value*** *through its team of leading experts being second to none.*
      * Sentence B: Outline what this means for you. e.g. *As such, this role presents an opportunity for* ***unprecedented professional growth*** *through the* ***unique complexities*** *presented by the firms’ projects under the guidance of* ***industry-leading mentors***\*, which I am currently seeking in my professional career.\*
      * Sentence C: Outline why the firm's workplace is in alignment with your personal narrative.  e.g. *Furthermore, the* ***vibrant workplace*** *underpinning XYZ Corp's* ***people-focused*** *culture represents a unique environment for me to experience and contribute towards dynamic program rotations across the firm’s* ***preeminent suite of assets***\*.\*
   * Paragraph 2
      * This paragraph will be tailored towards relaying how your experience demonstrates alignment with the requirements divulged in Step 3b (**in bold below**).
      * Sentence A: Thesis statement for this paragraph, detailing why you fit the role. e.g. *With a strong foundational experience in* ***contract management*** *and* ***design delivery*** *in the* ***public infrastructure sector***\*, I believe that I am a suitable candidate for the \_\_\_\_\_\_ position.\*
      * Sentences B and C: Outline how you have demonstrated experience for a role requirement and additional room to grow. e.g. *Having fronted several projects in* ***enterprise risk management and sustainability*** *through my current role/academic endeavors at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I am seeking to further excel my* ***analytical abilities*** *in* ***understanding, resolving and communicating solutions*** *to strategic issues in* ***complex commercial settings*** *across a diverse array of clientele in Germany's infrastructure landscape.*
      * Sentence D: Link experience and room to grow to role offerings. e.g. *Coincidingly, I believe XYZ Corp's prowess in delivering* ***data-backed*** *projects through its diverse team of high-calibre engineers presents opportunities to garner unmatched exposure to the* ***project delivery strategies and practices*** *situated at the industry’s forefront.*
      * Sentence E: Close this paragraph out with how you will further the company's vision (from Step 3c). e.g. *More broadly, I believe that my demonstrated passion for* ***enacting positive and tangible business outcomes*** *is suitably aligned with XYZ Corp's vision to* ***bolster the future through industry-leading personalized training***\*.\*
   * Outro:
      * Detail your most prominent extra-curricular and educational achievements here, in addition to embellishing with Step 3a. and Step 3c.'s remaining outputs.
* Ensure your contact details are current and the correct contact is being addressed in the cover letter.

**Step 5: Submit**

And you're done! Whilst I would love to go over more interview preparation material, I acknowledge this has turned into quite a chunky post. The above information is a general breakdown of how I went about applying for my roles after being rejected non-stop in the year preceding my graduation year.

**TLDR**

1. Track your applications and share the live list with someone who will keep you accountable (if this helps you).
2. Write our your personal narrative and some key examples that you can flexibly use in interview scenarios.
3. AI chatbots to assist with listing out job requirements, company keywords and phrases for your CV and cover letter.
4. Writing your cover letter with modularity + CV with substitute keywords.
5. Submit. 

Hope it helps - feel free to drop a comment below if you have any questions and I'll do my best to address them.

Best of luck with your applications."

I'm in an internship which runs until June (they are flexible if I choose to leave towards the beginning or end of June) and I really enjoy it. The people I work with are great, I get decent pay, and nearly full time hours. My problem is that I started applying for jobs already, because it took nearly a year to get my internship in the first place (graduated this past May) and I was worried about being out of work this summer. 

I have 3 interviews scheduled for this week. I was honestly surprised I heard back from so many people. I suppose the experience helped, because I applied for over 500 positions before getting the internship. Any way, because it's only mid April, I'm worried that I'll be offered a job and they will want me to start right away, or within the next month. I don't want to just up and leave my internship after they've been so good with me, but I can't turn down a full time offer either. 

I've considered the possibility of negotiating some part time work between the two companies for a little while so that I don't have to fully leave the internship. The question of ""when are you available to start?"" hasn't come up yet with any of these companies. This is something I will have to mention at the interviews at some point, of course, but it's just something I'm concerned about. Of course I can't keep an internship over a full time job in my field, but is there a best way to approach this?"

- Write your own, original, specifically tailored cover letters.
- At the very least mention the company's name and how you can help their specific field.
- Apply to companies offering positions. Don't send out generic, unsolicited correspondence.
- If someone takes the time to offer feedback,  reply concisely with ""*Thank you! *"" even if you diagree. 
-------------------

An egregious example of what NOT to do....

I received an unsolicited email cover letter and resume yesterday at the ""ask a question"" email for the library I work at. 

The cover letter was very obviously created with ChatGPT or a similar bot. There was also no mention of how the person's skills could help a *library* when the contact form they sent to was on a Library website, and the email address was *library*@generic.domain.

I took the time to reply to this person with advice to tailor their cover letters to each company and NOT send unsolicited applications. 

In response I received a page long defense including 
- Admitting to using a bot.
- That bot writing is the future and ""shaming the use of bots means I'm ""not with it.""
- How my advice was not only incorrect but offensive. 
- That the person did not know they were emailing a library and not the HR department. Again, the email address includes *library.*

If I were a hiring manager this person would be added to a red flag list. This would make me not want to hire them, and possibly even mention them to fellow recruiters in my field."

How does this make any sense?

I work/ed for a small business where the only possible referee is the ceo/director/manager/boss himself. It was a team of only 4 people including me and we recently agreed mutually to have me leave the company after many clashes between the boss and I when it came to multiple issues within the business. 

In one scenario where everything was going good, why would I use my boss as a reference for him to receive a call from another workplace asking about me? For one, he'd try and retain me as he would be blindsided that i'm looking elsewhere and tell the other job multiple things that would scare them off and the other thing is he'd see that as me not being committed and likely let me go anyway??

It just makes no sense to me. In this case I have already left this job but businesses still want him as my reference. He would ruin any chance I have at getting these jobs based on us now having bad blood. Is there a way around this? I have had some luck using my most recent boss before this one and giving commentary as to why i'm not using my current one but I think this is hindering my chances at getting asked for interviews.

I plan on continuing working postpartum, but I’m still going to need a week or so to recover. Since it’s remote, I’m perfectly fine with returning quickly. I need the money to be honest. 

The company asks that we keep the same schedule for 90 days though. My birth will happen around 60 days. I’m not sure how to approach this during the interview, if I should bring my pregnancy up at all even (it’s an online interview). I’d hate to lose such an amazing opportunity just because of bad timing. 

Should I mention my pregnancy during the interview or wait until after I receive an offer to avoid that discrimination? 

If I should mention it during the interview, should I mention how far along I am and how I’ll have to leave for a week or so?

If they ask if I’ll have any trouble committing to 90 days what should I say then if I haven’t mentioned my pregnancy?

If they ask why I left my previous job, what should I tell them? Should I mention it was due to a health concern when it comes to standing for long periods of time, or would that look bad?

I recently started a new job a few months ago and while things have been going really smoothly, the last month has been particularly challenging. My manager recently lost someone close, and was off work for a while to deal with grief and bereavement. 

However, since then, things have taken a nosedive. Just today, I and others were accused of not showing enough ‘empathy’ to her, despite the fact that a few of us sent her emails when she announced her leave to tell her to rest well and to spend time with her family. I am honestly baffled as to what could’ve gone wrong. 

My manager presents themselves as a private and independent person and constantly reminds us of this fact, and given that new members have joined the company recently, we are all aware that we should respect their boundaries and give them space to heal. While we work in close proximity with her, we are often not privy to the details she shares in her personal life, and we do not want to meddle in her life and make things worse when it seems that anything could tick my manager off these days. As a result, things have been extremely toxic at my workplace. I personally didn’t find out the details until a senior colleague had told me. 

My manager then started to accuse a senior employee who’s been with the company the longest (who has also been the most loyal and diligent) of being messy and unfocused out of nowhere in front of me and mentioned we all lack empathy. They have also been making pointed comments towards me and being frankly quite unkind throughout the whole month, which is truly unlike them. None of us has dreamed of ever retaliating. I have been telling myself to be more patient, that this is simply grief and to really cultivate positivity but it’s hard when every single thing you do suddenly causes so much anger, spite and blame. My manager then accused me of not bringing up an important issue at work, when I did at a meeting where they were absent that day - and I sent my presentation slides. I obviously didn’t fight back, I just remained quiet as I know clarifying and speaking the truth would only stoke the flames further. 

In my view, everyone has been trying their best and working extremely hard. I don’t normally say this about the companies I work with but the team and people whom I work with have been nothing but extremely hard-working. We hold no malice and yes, we’re human, we do make errors here and there, but we apologise and we learn from them. Everyone here is quite demure and all minds their own business and does the best they can. 

On top of this, there has been an abundance of miscommunication, inconsistency and hypocrisy going on, which led me to being blamed about the same thing that my manager has done in the past. 

I could go on longer but I don’t want to risk giving too much detail. All of this has really affected me psychologically and desperately need advice on how to deal with this. 

PS. I don’t blame my manager: it’s clear they are going through a lot, I genuinely wish them the best. In response to this I have basically retreated back into my shell at work - I don’t interact, make any comments, and always always use screenshots to protect myself against wrongful accusations, I try not to banter to have friendly conversations with colleagues unlike before. I simply focus on my work. I honestly think my presence alone offends my manager. For the last few months I’ve been performing extremely well at work, but all of a sudden it seems I can’t do anything right."

The tech industry is going through lots of layoffs right now, so  thanks to supply and demand not being in my favor, I have to do a lot more interviews than usual. It’s worth it though, because I want to get away from my asshole coworker. Everyone is afraid of losing him, and lets him act like a massive douche.

My boss said my “performance is slipping” and I’m “taking too many days off” and “don’t seem to be in the office much”. I used to be a high performer, but obviously the job search is affecting me negatively. 

I’ve only taken one week of PTO 8 months ago, and maybe 3 days of PTO during the holidays.

Our company has “unlimited PTO”, which I think is BS. That means I can’t say things like “well I have X days of PTO left so I’m going to take them”

Not sure if anyone has any advice - I do try to schedule interviews so I only take half days, and schedule phone calls during lunch. I have asked for evening interviews if possible. Boss is breathing down my back and making sure I’m always in the office.

Vent about boss: if you wanted me to stay in the office, don’t take my coworkers side (who doesn’t even report to you) when he’s a huge asshole to me"

I feel like I should have done that but in terms of attaining high competency work, I have no interest or motivation. I did get a 4 year degree, however, I picked an easy major that would ensure I finish college despite being crap at academics. To top it off, college was free for me because my father worked there for a little over 10 years. If I dropped out, it would have been a waste and my parents would have been extremely angry with me. Its not that I am a loser NEET. In my whole adult life, I have have always worked. I make enough as a janitor to own my own place and have some degree of disposable income, but there still are limits to were $14.40 per hour will get you.

I don’t really want to do anything related to law I just went to school because my parents made me but recently I applied to a new company around the LA area. They are offering training for people that don’t have sales experience it’s a marketing job. I recently wanted to go back to school because of marketing, it’s something I like to do which is interact with customers and well I call myself a talkative person. I am actually interested in marketing and would like to do it for the rest of my life. The job is an hour away from where I live. So 1 hour to get to the job and 1 hour to get home. (2 hours in total.) Probably even a little more due to the LA traffic. 

Here’s the catch, I just started to learn how to drive my mom is currently teaching me we never had time as she just had a baby and I’ve been doing school and taking care of him while she gets back to work. Now that we have time she’s showing me how to drive. The thing is she’s the one that took me to the interview on Friday and that very same day I got the job they told me they wanted me in they see that I’m motivated and want to give me a chance. So today I has my job orientation around 1 and my parents were at work so I had to Uber it there. It was 50$

I am looking at apartments to rent near the area most of them are 2,500+ for a 1 bedroom & 1 bathroom. I also learned that you essentially have to make 3x the rent so basically I have to make 90,000 a year in order just to rent a 1 bedroom apartment which is insane I know I’m not making that amount of money as someone with no experience. (entry level) 

Now the question is should I keep this job? I love the work environment everyone is nice and they really believe in helping everyone. Now the thing is I would have to either Uber it here or have my mom take me until I learn how to drive. I feel bad that my parents have to basically drive 1 hour to pick me up and 1 hour just to go back home."

About 3 months in 20 layoffs hit. Our customers in their climate just can't budget for what they could before the pandemic and I see renewals and sales getting slaughtered. 2 month after another 20 people.

Now these are mostly sales roles which is not me but this last round just  last week was 40 people and my department was hit for the first time. It was a big one and April 1 is our new fiscal year.

They always say there won't be more but given what I see with customers, that's a lie. My boss really likes me, i get recognized for my work and customer testimonials ect but being a new guy, i feel not safe at all. 

Merit increases and bonuses are on hault for this year so no increase for anyone. 

I am wondering if since I am new and not a high salary yet, I am in better position vs someone 5 years in making double what I make?

I have a bit of a strange request. I am looking for a new job but feel my title does not match my qualifications/responsibilities.

My current title is Customer Experience Analyst. My responsibilites are as follows:

* Test UI/UX of our website and mobile app. Submit JIRA tickets to the dev team to resolve any issues I find
   * **Example:** During testing, I notice certain files cannot be uploaded. I notify the development team. I then keep departments updated on the progress of that ticket during scrums
* Manage projects relating to improving customer experience
   * This includes coordinating with many departments to improve systems that receive frequent complaints from customers (i.e. our quote system)
* Participate in and lead scrums regarding the website and mobile app development
* Create mockup images of what certain pages on the website/mobile app should look like and the functionality it should have (I do this with photoshop, not with a HTML/CSS editor). Once I mock up the page, I send it to the dev team for them to create the webpage
* Create monthly reports on how many users acknowledge, engage with, and complete actions based on our marketing/notification emails
   * **Example:** How many users created a new policy due to a marketing email we sent out
   * **Example:** How many users adjusted their existing account based on a notification email we sent out
* Make decisions on new features that need to be added to mobile app/website
* Review and respond to customer feedback regarding website and mobile app
* Analyzing recorded customer service calls to determine what can be improved

I am moving on because I am extremely overworked and underappreciated at the company. I am constantly told how valuable I am, and for the last 3 months my boss has told me they are going to promote me and give me a substantial raise. Upper management had a meeting today and agree d I need a promotion and raise but that they ""needed more time to determine the organizational structure"" and if they gave me a raise now it ""might be less than what they could give me later"". I just want to be compensated more fairly for my work.

Does anyone have any advice as to what job title I should look for? I have a year of experience with these responsibilities. Most customer experience manager jobs seem to require 5-8 years of experience. I currently make $60k and I am looking to move to $70k - $80k.

Thanks so much for all your help!"

I’m working within the public sector via an agency. They were looking to release temporary contracts for which I could apply (1 year).

I was looking for something more permanent and have been applying and have been successful in an interview process and have received a job offer. It is also in the public sector.

I informed job 1 of this (my current job) and they have offered to match the title upgrade, the salary match and the permanent contract. 

Job 2 (new job offer)
- better title
- better salary
- permanent
- work from home
- huge organisation
- structured projects and programmes
- lots of different projects to be involved in using agile, waterfall and hybrid approaches.

Job 1 (current job)
- matched better title
- matched better salary
- matched permanent contract
- work from home
- midsize organisation
- not a consistent structure to how they manage projects and programmes
- work on projects in one specific area

Job 1 has a really nice team and is super chilled out. The workload is minimal. 

However, with job 1 being a public sector organisation, they would have to release the job out for applications and go via the formal interview process. I’m just a little scared if I reject job offer from job 2 and the job 1 doesn’t go through either.. it will be really bad for me.


What should I do? What would you guys do? I’m so confused right now. 

Job 1 have matched the job 2 offer so based on the information I have provided.. what would you do in this scenario?"

I interviewed last summer for a position at the Veterans hospital for admin work. They called me again today for another interview since they posted 20 more openings.

I’ll be graduating next year with a degree in Computer Networking and Security (started as a programming major and hated it). Now I’m questioning if this degree will even get me anywhere. I’m in my early 30s and am trying to get an idea as to what direction to go in (and trying not to panic about the IT job market right now).

&#x200B;

I currently have an easy Data Entry job to get me through school. So far I really like the people I work with and the work itself is relatively easy. But my problem is that the pay is \~$40k/year (hourly) and moving up would require a more sales oriented position. It’s a small company and I doubt that they’ll ever have an IT position open up, so that leaves me to look elsewhere.

&#x200B;

I want to use this degree, even if it’s in a roundabout way. I also want to increase my salary so that I can one day get a house (while I live in a LCOL area, livable houses start at \~$200k which is unaffordable at my current pay).

&#x200B;

So that makes me wonder, what kind of IT job do you have that’s helps you reach your financial goals? And how did you get there?"

Financially, it’s not as good as my current position and it would require me to relocate across the country. They also mentioned during Covid they had to layoff half the company. However, this company works in a VERY niche field. So it’s not like this opportunity comes around all the time. 

I feel like I should be over the moon excited but the thought of moving away from my friends and life actually has me so sad. I love my life here, but this has also been my dream job for years.

So I asked him why did they hire me in the first place, to which he answered ""We SOMEHOW missed that requirement"". This wasn't just some rookie company either.

So I got laid off. What made me miserable was that they waited till the end of my term to tell me this. Other companies had already hired interns for Spring semester so I already had missed that opportunity.

Sooo I've been unemployed since the start of this year. Have filled 300+ applications for Internships, got three interviews which I didn't receive any offers from, others just send an automated message saying I'm a great candidate but not great enough to be hired.

I'm mentally broken and drained at this point. I was hoping to land a internship to pay for my college so I can finish my last semester but that has been put on hold. I have started to apply for IT Support jobs since I've about 2 years of experience so let's see if I can land one.

I have this thought that keeps coming up over and over, and I'm not sure if it's genius or extremely dumb.

I think about the game Cuphead. For those who don't know, Cuphead is a game famous for being very, very hard. It mostly consists of boss fights on a static stage, so when playing, there is not an obvious goal that becomes closer and closer. If you know absolutely nothing going in, it could be very difficult to figure out how you're doing and if your strategies are sound. This would be soul-crushingly frustrating, if not for one thing:

Every time you lose in Cuphead, a progress bar appears on-screen, showing how close you were to defeating the Boss. In my experience, I usually start at 10%. Brutal, but then I go again, and its 14%. I'm getting better. Each time I see very clearly how close I was to winning, and how that number is getting higher and higher. So I keep going, because I can see that I'm getting somewhere, that I am making a dent, and eventually, I will win.

The thing about job searching is it's basically all or nothing. You are rejected or you are hired. Maybe you get some interviews and can consider that a halfway point, but even that's unclear since you don't know how many people applied, how many people were interviewed, etc. So the job where the HR person turned you down within 6 seconds and the job where out of 100 people, you were in the top five they were considering, all come out the same: YOU LOSE.

It's awful because I cannot tell if the changes I make are good or not. Was this change to my resume a good one? Did my new cover letter strategy help or hurt? I don't know. There's no progress bar, and so it simply feels like the game is impossible, or I am incompetent.

Does anyone relate to this or have advice to deal with this? Is there some way to create a ""progress bar""? I'm taking anything I can get here."

For anyone who has used one, did it work well? Is it something that recruiters can immediately tell and care enough to factor into hiring decisions?"

I currently work as a medical illustrator at a hospital/science institution that employs about 5,000 people. My job is very niche and not many people do what I do. I work for a specific department there (one of 10 departments) who do academic research. I've been with this institution and this specific department for about 3 years.

Over time I have felt like my skills are not being used well, my boss is a perfectionist asshole and the culture in my department is bad. I've been wanting out for a while. I often am put on projects with another team (external to my department) that serves the whole institution and love it when I get to work with these specific people. They seem to appreciate my skills more and the type of work they do is more aligned with my goals.

I've been mulling over what it would be like to join their team. I dream about it sometimes as it would be a much better situation than the one I am currently at. I know multiple higher-ups on their side and talking to them wouldn't be difficult. But they don't have a specific position open or anything so it would be essentially me just asking if they'd want someone like me on their team.

Is this something I could potentially meet with them to discreetly talk about? I would need to do it without my current department getting wind. If it's even a good idea, how do I go about that conversation?"

They are considering investing in it and have offered me an internship position at $50 an hour. As a grad student currently earning $40 an hour and facing overdue medical fees for my child, this opportunity might improve my financial situation.

However, I am seeking advice on potential challenges and considerations while working with an angel investor and managing this new internship, especially since my professor has previously mentioned that an internship could extend my current PhD timeframe. My professor is somewhat understanding, and I informed them six months ago that I had been searching for jobs without much success. Now, I plan to approach them about this internship opportunity.

What are some key aspects I should consider when discussing the internship and its potential impact on my current work with my professor? Are there any potential pitfalls or challenges I should be aware of when navigating a situation like this?

Additionally, how can I ensure a successful and mutually beneficial partnership between myself, the investor, and my professor? Any suggestions for managing expectations and maintaining open lines of communication would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for sharing your insights and experiences. I'm looking forward to learning from your collective wisdom and using it to make the most of this opportunity while maintaining a healthy balance between my work and personal life."

My original plan was to go to physical therapy school. But, that would have been 80k and 3 years of schooling without working. With Kinesiology there were no jobs in the field except to be a personal trainer for 10 an hour part time. 

Ive thought of doing nursing. But I noticed nurses can be really petty with one another when I was in the fire dept. I'm also introverted, and most nurses seem to be really bubbly and extra. I think I'd face discrimination being a male or the team wouldn't interact with me. 

Also with the covid regulations that discouraged me from staying in health care as well. It seems like their just wanting providers to push referrals or meds on patients. That along with the student debt and not working seemed unrealistic. 

Plus with PT and nursing, it locks you to only those fields. What if you lose your license or fail the licensure test? Plus the business world doesn't seem to care at all about anything medical. I remember I went into interviews and people didn't know what kinesiology or physical therapy is. 

The interview process is a plus of why I was considering nursing though. Because I've heard you do just one group interview and that's it. Whereas, IT you do 3 to 4 rounds, sometimes you have to do a project. And you never know what software they will ask you about. And the requirements list 5 years experience for entry level jobs and this long list of stuff. Whereas, nursing just lists the license. Have any nurses in here found this to be true though? 

Im currently making 55k as a system admin for a university was considering staying in this role for the pension, but I'd have to be there 10 years to even be vested and 30 to get the full payout. 

I also was going to go for a masters in IT with the tuition assistance, but from what I've seen that's not really needed for IT. Plus it would take a minimum of 2.5 years to finish. 

There's not much opportunity for promotion in my role because it's mainly a bunch of boomers that have been there 20 plus years. Plus the departments are siloed off, and some haven't talked to me since I've been there. 

My manager doesn't seem too supportive either. They made it out like they'd cover certs. But, I was studying for an Azure cert one day and he said that certs are all theoretical. And that hes been in the same role for 20 years and doesnt have any certs 

Should I stay in my role, look for another IT role, or completely change careers to nursing?"

I need some advice! I've been in Customer Service Management   for the past 7 years or so. I've had an intense passion for technology   and have been a hobbyist of technology since I was the age of 6 years   old. Now, I have extensive experience working with technology even in   the professional realm but the problem is my title does not reflect   that.

My  jobs have been at  startups and bigger companies and most of the  startups and some of the  bigger companies have required me to build out  the entire call center  from the ground up. They knew that I had a lot of  technical experience  so they had me do all of the technical side of  things too, to save  money on hiring IT specialists/management. That  included securing all  of  the equipment needed to run a call center,  ensuring all of the  computers had the correct programs and were all  updated regularly and  were secure. I would also fix them whenever anyone  at the company was  having an issue but I primarily focused on the  people I managed. I  managed server security, software updates and all of  the hardware  maintenance needed. I was the person who researched and  secured the  best software needed for our daily operations as a company  and  maintained those software.

I've   had to admin for all of the applications that we used at those   companies which included the setup of the software, migrating all of the   data from previous software we used and making sure everything ran   smoothly and efficiently. The different software I've admin-ed for was   Salesforce, Zendesk, Netsuite, Infusionsoft, Five9, Ring Central,   Connect First, google workspace and GoDaddy domains.

I've   also have done QA website testing for a few of our startups and   conducted minor penetration testing and gave recommendations based on my   findings which were implemented immediately which saved our company   from an attack.

I haven't listened the entirety of what I've done in relation to IT but I've done a ridiculous amount of things.

Now,   I want to know how I can implement these things into my linkedin or   resume in a way that pops out to someone who's hiring for a IT related   role.

I'm  also working on a  Cybersecurity Bachelors at the moment and I expect  I'll be done  relatively soon. I know that it's important to have  experience in the  field of technology to even be considered for this  kind of role. That's  why I want to highlight it.

TL:DR:   I have a lot of technology experience, personal and on the job. My   title doesn't match those duties. How can I make those things pop to a   recruiter so I can at least get a entry or mid level job to start   sprucing up my resume.

Disclaimer: I don't have any certs. I will have a bunch in the next few months though.

Thanks <3"

 Apparently when people get the bill they have a place that asks for a tip for cashiers so most people do, not everyone but most. Cashiers keep all the tips they make or split it with other cashiers are also working the same shift.

1,2023-04-11,Do You Answer Interview Questions Honestly Or Based On What You THINK The Interviewer Wants To Hear?,u/SubzeroCola,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12j1dc8/do_you_answer_interview_questions_honestly_or/,jobs,"I had an interview a while back and they asked me what my biggest weakness was.

I was going to say "" team work "" because I'm more of a solo worker and my ideas generally don't gel with others. Happens all the time in group projects too, they ignore all my ideas. 

But then I remembered that being a team player was one of the biggest traits that most hiring managers look for. And not being a team player is often times an immediate rejection. So I instead mentioned another weakness. 

But it was pretty obvious to the interviewer that I was giving out carefully thought out answers based on what I think they wanted to hear.

So is this normal? I think its pretty dumb to tell any interviewer that you're not a team player (even if its the truth).

What do you do? Do you go with full honesty? Or do you answer based on what they want to hear?"

How does that work if something in my field comes up in the meantime? I don’t really have the luxury of waiting for the right position to come along. I need to have an income coming in. Unemployment is taking 6-8 weeks in my state, and I have a 16 year old to support with no help from his father. I have bills I need to pay, and being out of work is not something I can do. Losing my job last week really is the worst thing that could have happened! The other thing I worry about is what happens when the temp job ends. Yes, there is the potential to go permanent, but this is not something I want to do for the rest of my working life. I am also in an area where there is not a regular string of temp opportunities to go on until something permanent comes up. I did also have an interview at a hospital today, which is in my field.

2,2023-04-11,Writing cover letters,u/theholybookofenoch,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12j2wpm/writing_cover_letters/,jobs,"As someone who's been in the job market for a while, I've often wondered whether it's worth taking the time to write my own cover letter or if I should just let an AI language model like Chat GPT do it for me. On the one hand, writing a cover letter can be time-consuming and challenging, but on the other hand, will employers know the difference?

To answer this question, I decided to put Chat GPT to the test. I gave it a job posting and asked it to generate a cover letter for me. The result was impressive: the language was professional, the formatting was clean, and it included all the relevant information. However, I couldn't help but feel like something was missing. The cover letter lacked the personal touch and voice that I would have included if I wrote it myself.

So, what's the verdict? While Chat GPT can certainly generate a cover letter that is technically correct and contains all the necessary information, it may lack the personality and authenticity that a human touch can provide. Employers are looking for candidates who are a good fit for their company culture, and a generic cover letter generated by an AI language model may not convey that.

That being said, if you're pressed for time or struggling to write a cover letter, using an AI language model like Chat GPT can be a useful tool. Just make sure to review and personalize the letter to make it unique to you and your skills.

So, will employers know the difference? It's possible that they may not be able to tell if a cover letter was written by a human or generated by an AI language model. However, they will certainly be able to tell if a cover letter lacks the personal touch and authenticity that comes from a candidate who took the time to write it themselves.

What are your thoughts on using AI language models to generate cover letters? Let me know in the comments below!

PS:  This was written by Chat GPT.  Last question, do covers letters even make it to people or do most not get through the algorithm?"

So recently I had applied for a couple of jobs at a local resort. The first application I sent in was for a “concierge” position. The second job I applied for was a “salon tech” 
I got a call about a week later in regards to the “concierge” application. The operation manager instead offered me an interview for the salon tech job as she felt it was a better fit for my resume.  (I’m assuming she hadn’t yet seen my salon tech application) 

I’ve been really nervous and trying to prepare myself for the interview. This is my first big adult job and I need it more than food and water.  

The interview went well, i definitely think I should’ve hyped myself up more but I feel I would be a good fit. She gave me a tour and talked about some of their policies and the pay. When we were done, she told me she’d get back to me in about a week, and winked. 
WELL today is Tuesday, it’s only been 4 days, and I got an email that made my heart sink. 


The title is “application update” and it reads 
Thank you for your interest in joining our family at (redacted). After reviewing your experience and skills regarding the position (redacted), we have decided to consider other applicants for this position at this time.

Thank you for the time you've invested to apply with us, we appreciate your interest in (redacted) and wish you success in your future career search


After thinking about it this likely isn’t a rejection letter to my interview right?? I’ve never had a real big interview before so idk what a letter would look like. She also didn’t say if she would call or email me at the end of the week. Just “let me know”. 

Plus, this email didn’t come from from the interviewer, just, something called “Dayforce” which looks like is some AI machine that helps sort and approve potential candidates. Soo does that mean I’m still up for consideration??? I really want this job and it all feels so right and I just refused to believe that means I didn’t get it. I would know for sure right ??? 🥺"

Current

New
$40.87 hourly + time and a half for overtime(not sure how much that will happen)
15 minute commute
2.5% match on 401k
Larger company with 1500 employees

It’s honestly seeming pretty equal when crunching numbers given I spend about $300 more a month on gas than I would if I went to the new job. 
There are uncertainties about going to a new job, I’m pretty secure at the current. Also it being a larger company, it will be a lot less relaxed I’m sure.
I’m having trouble quantifying in dollars the amount of time I will have at home with my family if I accept the new job. I will be at home 30 more hours a month or 360 more hours a year."

I have anxiety/OCD and lately it has been acting up a bit. It has gotten to a point where in recent months I’ve been late a couple of times and woke up late for work and once missed a meeting. I’m a contract worker on a one year contract and I just completed my 6 month mark.

Anyways I’m back from a long weekend vacation and my boss on a call today with me told me she wants to have an in person discussion with me on a Friday. She set the meeting up for in the morning, an hour after we start work. When I asked what’s the meeting about, she told me it’s to discuss the recent issues I have had. I asked for more details and asked if I’m being reprimanded but she didn’t tell much. I did follow up with a message on Teams when I asked if anyone else would be joining and she said that the department head may be joining and she said “this is a discussion about expectations and a chance for you to discuss any challenges on your end as wel, if there are any.”

I’m a bit anxious, because I’m not sure if I’m going to get fired or just a warning. I had one incident in the past where I was let go with a pre planned meeting, but it was more like less than 24 hour notice meeting, not like days ahead. Also Friday is the pay lock date for the two weeks so I’m wondering if they want to relieve me since it will be easier for payment and stuff.

I am wondering should I bring up my medical condition ahead of the meeting or at the meeting? Also am I overthinking because of my anxiety or should I be worried?"

It's a startup and things are very disorganized and wild. It recently went  public and I was brought on as a team of senior level marketers to help bring the level of sophistication needed to appease investors to the company. I have a decade of experience doing what I do. Every boss I worked for has had nothing but great things to say. I've been promoted every company I've worked for at least once sometimes twice. I even had a previous company of mine asking if I can come back to work for them Just a month ago, which I turned down for this job and to not show a short tenure on my resume. 

For context, I have an MBA with an emphasis in organizational change and project management and I've spent the last decade specializing doing that in marketing and advertising specifically. Hence, why my company brought me on. I admit I was a little shy the first few months and not as outgoing as I usually am because there was a lot to learn and a lot of chaos happening for me to make sense of. It's my work style to observe, build relationships, and then initiate change. 

Well there's no better way to put it but things are just gotten progressively shittier with each month. No matter what I try and contribute it et shut down or ignored. I've spent 12 hours a day for multiple weeks of my life working morning tonight to put together recommendations, develop systems, presentations, etc. And they end up being complete waste. I presented three comprehensive solutions to my team and my boss in the span of 5 months and get zero feedback. I'm leading a major year-long project that I've designed and redesigned and scheduled and rescheduled three or four times over the last 5 months because my coworkers won't follow the schedule that I put out or they won't follow the guidelines or they just genuinely refuse to keep me in the loop. I've been telling my boss this for months and asking for help in professional ways and still nothing gets done about it.

Have you ever worked somewhere that hired you or your skill set and your expertise then turned around and treated you like you're an idiot while deferring to someone who has no clue what they're doing as the be all and all? That's possibly the most frustrating and confusing part. I nailed a presentation today of suggestions of how to transform this company and department for a fact and got positive feedback even from some of the most critical team members and my boss told me to focus on something different. It almost seem like she was telling me to back off because I was making this girl that's her favorite look not as good and she's trying to help her  ahead or something. I don't even know this makes sense but I get the heebiejeebies everyday at work because I have never felt so weird juju vibes."

1,2023-04-11,What should I do?,u/NatsukiRem,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12j7ahz/what_should_i_do/,jobs,"A little bit of background about me: I’m 22, live in Las Vegas, and I recently just graduated college majoring in Hospitality Management. I’ve been working F&B at a local restaurant close to where I live since it was so convenient with school, but now want to branch out.  I applied to a lot of different graduate programs, internships, and jobs, and I was lucky enough to get two offers. 

Here’s the issue:
I initially accepted a job at a very high end resort with a starter position. They’re very high class and even though it’s only been one week I very much enjoy the people I am working with and I believe that there is opportunity for growth available. 

However, right after I accepted that job and started, the other company reached out to me to inform me that I was accepted into their management program.   However, there is a big different between the quality of hotels. While the hotel I’m working at right now is 5 star, meaning that they’re bigger and offer a lot more amenities. For the management program, I would be working at a 3 star hotel, and I would have to relocate out of state . However, the company is also very big. They have a lot of other locations which I could apply and transfer to after the program. 

Do you guys think that the management training opportunity is worth taking? I’ve been going back and forth about what I want to do. While I do love where I work right now, I also feel like it would be a waste to not take the chance for the management program. At the same time, since the hotel I’d be transferring to is a downgrade to where I am now, I’m not sure if it’s worth it. Moreover, I would be leaving before my 90 day probation ends, which I feel like could leave a sour taste."

He’ll ask me what’s the most challenging thing, what hasn’t been what I expected, etc. My main problem is that I was told the job was remote with one or two days a month in the office. My first week there it was changed to at least once a week, sometimes twice. It’s a 5-ish hour round-trip commute. Without going into detail it is putting a very intense strain on my mental health and day-to-day quality of life. 

I feel like I could handle all the other “negatives” if it wasn’t for this commute but every negative feels so worse. I feel like nothing is worth the stress of having to plan my entire life around this commute (my planning starts days before). I’ve been applying for jobs and will leave as soon as I get another one (I’d rather be stressed out closer to home than stressed out almost 3 hours away). Until then I will ride it out but do you think I should let my boss know or keep up the facade for less drama until I find something else?"

Been working under them for about a year now and basically the way my work has been is this: they do all the hard thinking and hard question answering. They know A LOT of knowledge about the work that I don't know about, because I'm left out of those meetings and emails and so forth. Everyone else trusts them. But when it come to me, they severely limit my work such that I'm only allowed to work on extremely small tasks and they're quick to immediately give me solutions to the tasks. So, I'm basically just doing grunt work...while they do all the thinking...and now, they're on break and all the responsibilities they had got dumped onto me. I can't answer all the technical questions they are responsible for. I feel like I've been micromanaged into a small little cave, only know the very little i've been exposed to and been allowed to see, and all of a sudden, hell breaks loose when this person leaves.

Now, other people already don't think highly of me. My coworkers don't think i'm competent so i'm hardly ever given hard tasks or included into meetings.

I was recently given a huge task with little to no guidance and then this bombshell was dropped onto me. I have no one else I can go to, in order to ask questions. I'm set up to fail really hard. Maybe this is a ploy to get me fired.

I have a screening call with a recruiter for a position this week but I'm also talking to another agency for another position that I would honestly prefer if I get that one too.

If I get the first offer, I want to take it, but I also want to keep myself open to the other one. One concern is how I'll be able to schedule screenings and interviews with the other recruiter if I do end up taking the first position. It would look pretty bad/sketchy if I asked to take a day off after only starting the job, and it wouldn't look so great for me if I ask the 2nd recruiter to schedule around my existing work schedule since they would know I just took a job and am already thinking of jumping ship. I'm assuming it would be hard to schedule one regardless since their schedule and my work hours would probably roughly follow a similar 8-4 or 9-5 schedule.

I know I could end up not getting any of them but it's something I'm thinking about just in case. Should I just not take a ""mediocre"" first job so that I don't have to deal with that trouble? Or how do I navigate this if I do?"

I haven't signed anything yet I have time to back out if things go south for me

However I'm in AZ and the minimum wage is 13.85/hr so I'm pretty sure that I'm going to have to bring it up to them to adjust it so they don't get in legal trouble when hiring other employees as they are expanding their business right now and I know they are still hiring people.

 it does sketch me out and depending on how they take the news of needing this adjustment is going to answer when/if I need to back out of working there, and I'm trying to be nice since it's basically a mom and pop shop that just started up and I would at least like to warn them that it isn't gonna fly if they want to do that just in case it's non-malicious ignorance. 

I just want to know if their would be any work around legally for them to rightfully be paying me below minimum wage during a training period?

Deep down I know what the best option is for me but I feel like I need to just put it out there.

I received an offer for a new job at a company a good friend of mine works at. I currently work for a state agency doing a job I genuinely enjoy. Obviously there are pros and cons to both. 

For my current state job, i make about $44k. I just received an opportunity to move into a higher position where I would probably make around ~53k. I have the promise of a pension….but I’d have to stay for 30 years, which I don’t think would realistically happen. My health insurance is good and cheap, but we are planning to start a family within the year. My health insurance will then jump from $93 a month to $600 a month. Sort of wipes out that raise with the higher position. I enjoy my field work but I go out 2-3 times a week and have to drive 45 minutes to 1 hour each way. I enjoy being outside but it gets really tiring. Otherwise I work from home. Unfortunately my agency is one that, because of the nature of the work, is very highly disliked by the political party that runs my state. While they are in charge, which I do not see changing, my agency will continue to be in a chokehold for funding and resources. It is a pretty low stress, chill job and I am good at it. 

The new job pays $75k. Health insurance is a little bit more expensive, but still very affordable and on par with my current insurance. It’s completely work from home save for traveling 1-2 times a year. It’s with a contractor working for the federal government, which is the direction I’d like to eventually take my career in. They are very flexible with hours and work life balance. I can adjust my hours how I want - say I want Friday off. I can work 4 10s and no one will bat an eye. There’s no one peeking over my shoulder, they just want the work to get done. 

But I think the biggest kicker is that my husband travels for work a lot. Like 5-6 months out of the year he’s gone. And he does it because those jobs make a lot of money, and that helps fill the gap with my salary. I hate it tbh. It’s hard with him being gone now, and with wanting to start a family having him home is a priority. This new job will allow him to turn down a lot of these jobs and will have him home a lot more. That alone is huge 

I think I’m just so torn because this situation with my current job is very good. And it’s what I have wanted for the entire time I’ve worked there. I’ve also worked so many awful jobs that now that I’ve been working one I genuinely enjoy, it feels weird to just leave. But I genuinely don’t know when I would get an opportunity like the new job again. It’s pretty rare to make decent money in my field. Let alone one that lets me work from home like this. I had a 3 hour phone call with my friend who works at the new job and there weren’t any red flags. I definitely feel like I may be too sentimental about all of this"

I was out of the country at that time, but she just told me to call them when I'm back.

It was and still is my first job so at I had a hard time learning all the new responsibilities but eventually I got the hang of it. I have many co-workers but not all of them work everyday, the waitresses exchange days when they work. I developed a crush on one of the girls, and I was on a shift with her several times and then causally through conversation I asked her about her instagram and she told me her username. I couldn't add her right then and there because people suddenly came and I had to make the drinks. However after work when I got home I found her and added her. It was a private profile (and I was not sure from the profile pic that it was her) and so I waited. She didn't accept. A few days later, due to some misunderstanding with my boss, I got fired. Not knowing whether I requested the right person on instagram (because she was really friendly and chatty, so it was weird she did not accept me if it was her) I send her a message on viber telling her that I liked her as a person and offered to hang out sometime since we are from the same neighborhood and live close to each other. Basically I made the point that we can be friends. Now on viber, she left me on seen, so I am certain that I added the right person on instagram too. A week later I went to the workplace just to pick up my salary (upon agreement with my boss) and when I got there he offered me to go back if I wanted to. I know its not ideal but I really need money right now so I accepted and here I am. I thought that I would not see her again so I took my shot with noting to lose, but now I work with her again and its weird. I did not share shift with her (or her sister who also works here) yet, but tomorrow I will. I ran into them both recently however and they did not even say hi to me even though they spoke with the other people in the room. Now that I will have to spend a full 7 hours with her sister tomorrow I am freaking out on what to do and how to behave normally, when clearly they think of me as a creep. I did not intend to make that impression and I had noting but good intentions but well... How would you cope and what would you do?"

So yeah they dont understand they just Tell me they could pay me as much as my new company Will and they Will give everything i asked for but i dont want to stay here.

Everyone was really nice and friendly and I built a good rapport with Beth. 

I was super excited about the position, as it's an ideal location and offers a four day work week! During my last interview, they told me I would hear back for an offer or another interview within the week (I interviewed on a Tuesday). One week passed. Then a half week. I emailed Beth for a status update-- no response. After three days post-email, I decided on the official two week anniversary to call Beth for a status update. 

She was not happy. She said 'calling is simply not done. This is very unprofessional.' I was totally taken aback because we'd had really great conversations thus far and her tone was really strange. 

I didn't get the position (no shock there). Do you think it was because I called and asked? Was I in the wrong for calling? She never said explicitly not to, and was open to my email questions prior to the last interview. Just really want to know whether I was wrong! Thanks, community."

I wasn't (I was caught by surprise haha) so we agreed tomorrow at 10am. I asked the name of the company again and I still couldn't work it out and it sounded nothing like the ones I recalled applying for and after looking through my confirmation emails I couldn't find anything close.

Even if I completely misheard the name and it was one I applied for, would a company do this without sending an email first? It seem strange to call randomly and suggest an interview immediately on the phone.

For context I am 19F and have had around 5 jobs before and the interview process wasn't anything like this, but they were all independent businesses so maybe it's different with large companies."

I know networking is very important for getting jobs in the tech field. So, I want to go to university where I will be working and living in future. USA has the colleges, programs I am most interested in, but I don't think I will be able to adjust to both work culture and general life style there.

I am from a place where there is a lot of holidays and public vehicle, walking is normal and cars are luxury. Another plus point about USA is I have relatives there who are also in the tech field. Most of them seem to be doing pretty good financially but there are stuff like my uncle having to go to pick cousin up from school because of gun threats, extremely expensive health care, not being able to go the places without car, etc.

I, as a person who gets sick frequently, needs breaks, has a slight phobia of driving, prefers walking to any other mode of transportation am really worried about myself. Some cities that are known as walkable like SF and NY are too expensive.

Please give me some ideas and guidance on what should I do? Most of the people around me are either saying I am over thinking or saying I can move to Europe for work after studying in USA. I don't think it will be financially good idea as US degrees are mostly expensive and European companies don't pay as much. Plus there is also language barrier and potential racial discrimination which I might have to face more than compared to USA.

I don't want to go to Australia or NZ because it is a totally new place for me as no one from my family and relatives is there. I don't know much about Canada either."

So I recently saw a job opening that felt like the perfect fit, so I applied and sent a DM to the manager on LinkedIn. It worked and he connected me with the HR. Had an intro call with the HR, he said he hadn't met with anyone who had as much energy and excitement towards the role. The next day I had an interview with my future manager, I was really nervous and felt underprepared.   
But the HR sent me an email in a couple of hours and said the manager loved talking to me and they are now 3 more rounds of interview and if they all say yes, I'm in.   


I think this is where I blew it up. There was a little bit of a delay in scheduling interviews with Person 2 &3 because their schedules were unavailable. I understood that but the HR to soothe mentioned that he was excited about my candidacy. I did not address it but he mentioned it again in our next mail that he was working on dates and he ""didn't want you thinking we were no longer interested"". I replied with thank you and I'm excited about this role instead of addressing what he said. I just didn't know how to respond to that without seeming desperate or silly!   


Anyways the two interviews went okay, I texted the HR for an update. He replied back cordially and mentioned that they were interviewing other candidates and will get back to me on if I'm qualified for the next round by Wednesday.  By this time I felt like I blew it off with the HR even I though I he was all good vibes and replied back with ""Thank you for being very responsive and valuing my time whether we move forward from here or not. I really appreciate you completing this stage of the interview process in less than a week. Have a lot to learn from you about keeping things efficient and communication seamless!""   
Emailed him on wednesday, he mentioned that they are still interviewing candidates and they will get back to me on friday. ""We have a couple of other applicants who are a stage behind yourself and thus we would like to give them an equal opportunity to meet with the team before making our decision as to who we invite to the next stage.""  


Is it normal for this to happen? This is literally my dream job and I'm over analyzing every bit of it. What should I reply back to the HR? Should I apply to other jobs?"

After a period of sick leave she returned and....I felt sorry for her. She admitted that while she was better physically she needed to work on her mind more. The company was also going through a restructure and she had to apply for a new role in order to stay in a job. English isn't her first language so I helped her with her CV. Part of me regrets it because she treated me so badly before and she didn't deserve that help, but I find it hard to say no on the spot, so anyway that happened....I just hope now she doesn't make someone else miserable in her new role. 

Anyway I was on a short term contract which has now ended, but she sends me messages on Whatsapp often. I know she wants to stay in touch because in her mind she can learn from me how to be more chill I guess. Little does she know I was not feeling chill while she treated me like crap. 

Anyway, now I don't know how to tell her that I really don't want to stay in touch. She brings back bad memories and dread!"

I would lay in bed after work from 4 to 8PM, eat something to get the hunger to.go away, get ready for bed, and then do it all again the next day. I've been doing some research and telework can definitely be considered a reasonable accommodation as long as I can continue working at the same level of efficiency at home (which I obviously can). However, given that I'm so Entry level that I don't even qualify for a lot of the ""entry level"" jobs that are posted on job sites, I've been having trouble finding positions that are already remote. It seems that mostly senior level positions are allowed to be remote, but not entry level. I've been feeling a bit hopeless lately after applying to jobs week after week and not getting any hits, other than one I'm pretty sure is a scam. Not sure what to do now honestly."

I have around 5 years web design experience, mainly for real estate marketing. I also have dev experience, but mainly with static sites and email. 

The one thing  know is hurting me is I have very little UX experience, as most of my previous jobs have been focused on visual design only. But I haven't had success applying to visual/ui design jobs either so...  ¯\\\_(' -')\_/¯

In the past, even when I was just out of school it only took me a few months to get a job. But now it seems impossible. And the longer I go without, the harder it feels to get one.

Or is it possible something is wrong with my resume or portfolio?

I make decent money with a particular company but it essentially is in exchange for emotional and verbal abuse I think. Ive already walked out once and a year later he called me back, and I truly thought he had changed his behaviour but a couple months in I could see that was not the case. Its progressively gotten worse. Him texting his spouse saying mean things about me but accidently sending it to me. Talking about me to former employees (our office staff quits often. Doesnt last more than a year).

Ive had my moments too, I cant take it sometimes. As an example, a few years ago he was very, very angry that I did not attend an event (as I am ""business development'). My son was sick, but whatever. So this event comes around again in May. I email him 6 times asking if he would like to sponsor or have me attend, and he finally responds that he doesnt golf (its golf event) but if I do, go!! (the !! was him being a dick).

So, I am doing what he previously yelled at me for not doing and hes rude. 

He snapped at me for not making a folder for a new girl, stating I am also HR, but then hires someone behind my back...arent I ""HR""? Ive interviewed people with and after him many times. 

He told me Im abandoning my responsibilities because Im not emailing potential clients (leads), but then I draft an email to send and he tells me STOP, that he wants to draft a template. That was 7 weeks ago.

He does not reply to most of my emails and the one time I followed up, (he told me I needed to remind him often), he responds with ""Brandy, I am extremely busy and dont have time for your emails, as you know I have NO support in the office"". #1 Im remote, hired as remote but offered to come in if we could plan it (no response) #2 He told me to follow up with him and then gets mad.

He is essentially bullying me and harassing me I think. He is preventing me from fulfilling my work responsibilities. He hired me under specific terms (remote) and then a year later told me I need to come in, when I said that was not fair to change my entire role, he said, ""too bad. The companys needs changed. Am I not allowed to change my mind?""

He knows Im prescribed (a  very very low dose) of xanax for Anxiety (witnessed my S/O suicide) and the other day he told me I must be making errors on my work because of my pill addiction. WTF

And these ""errors"" are like, a typo. 

He is Jewish, older, extremely smart, tells me to do as he says not as he does (in response to how he treats people). 

Im meeting him today as he recently told me he  was giving me a PIP (WTH!!) I will not sign it, I am am aware he can end my employment anytime (CA) and Im aware refusal of signing this can lead to termination too.

How do I speak to him, pointing out the above, in a manner that is on level with his personality and intelligence.  

I want to line item instances like the above, to show him what he is causing. Like, we had a girl who quit. Everything she did in Office 365 he bitched about. So when she quit and filed unemployment, he responded that ""the employee failed to perform basic tasks and was unable to meet the companies needs. Employee was regularly late showing a lack of respect for the business"" (She was late 2x, she called, her kid in physically disabled). He embellishes using professional language when the facts are actually pretty simple.

\- No I cant get unemployment, I have a side job and the amount made prevents me from getting funds from the state if I quit THIS job or were let go. Yes I have all this recorded and Yes Ive spoken to an attorney and hes not dones anything illegal so I cant do anything. Its only he and I in the office. 2 people administratively."

also any advice on networking within the social media / content creation spaces?"

I'm diagnosed with Bilateral Ulnar Impaction Syndrome, meaning my ulna grew too long comparison to my radius, resulting in severe wrist pain. However, about a year ago I received steroid injections and started wearing braces all the time on my wrists, and so long as I continue to wear the braces my condition does not impact my daily life anymore, and the pain is low to none. I still have the condition, as it can only be fixed via surgery, but since it isn't significantly impacting my day to day life outside of necessitating that I wear these braces and use ergonomic computer peripherals, I'm not sure if I should say I have a disability or not."

2,2023-04-12,The company I work for enables one of my coworkers to be a horrible human being and I don’t know what to do about it,u/ponderhope,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12k037t/the_company_i_work_for_enables_one_of_my/,jobs,"I work as an order puller and one of the people I work with is a vile, horrible person to everyone (both fellow employees and customers) and the company does nothing about it and doesn’t give a fuck. She’s been with the company for 16 years and gets upset and frazzled over small things, is impatient, extremely immature especially for her age (she’s probably like in her 60’s at least), and when describing herself she says “I’m not the boss but I am bossy”. Both supervisors and managers have talked to her about her behavior but she continues to do it. I’ve told her to stop raising her voice at me multiple times, she apologizes, and then goes back to doing it again.

&#x200B;

* When I came into work with conjunctivitis one day (I was already taking prescribed antibiotics for it, wearing sunglasses to cover my eyes, and was frequently keeping my hands clean), I mentioned it to her when she asked me why I had sunglasses on cause she asked, and then when my supervisor wanted me to do a task that she was doing, all of a sudden she said out loud “Yeah but he has conjunctivitis”
* I said something or was having a conversation with the same customer as her and I guess she didn’t like that and then went over to another coworker to talk about me and the reason why I knew she was talking about me was cause she was pointing at me the entire time
* She’s yelled and gotten upset at me countless times for doing everything from taking a bit too long to get an order, being busy with something else, being unable to get an order for her because it was the end of my shift and I was going home, or asking for something

I’m on a LOA cause I asked her for a pair of scissors, she got upset and frazzled and didn’t give me one, so I got fed up and cut something with a box cutter instead where it then slipped and cut my finger, causing me to get six stitches. I didn’t know what to do so I got upset myself and smeared the blood on my face and they want me to take a LOA to let my finger heal and to talk to a therapist so I can go back to work. She behaves like this all the time. To practically everyone. And has behaved this way as long as I have known her (since 2021), and the company does nothing about it except enable this middle aged toddler to act this way when her behavior is totally unacceptable. 

You show someone respect for being nice to you, for doing something nice for you, for going out of their way to help you, for having qualities or characteristics that you admire, for having certain skills or knowledge or achievements that you aspire to have yourself. What respect do I owe anyone who treats me this way? Respect isn’t freely given like candy on Halloween. You don’t owe someone respect on default of them having a pulse. Respect is mutual. 

Sorry for ranting. I just don’t know what the hell to do with this person and I want to move to a different department (which I’ve told HR) but they haven’t done so yet. (when I get back from my LOA HR said that they’ll talk to me about that even though they can’t make any promises)."

Should I leave?",u/nadiag_nails,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12k0ycz/i_dont_hate_my_job_just_realizing_that_everyone/,jobs,"I have been working at this company for 2 years, and I have been working in the same field for 4 years prior. 

When I got hired I worked 6 full days a week with very low pay. (HKD15,000-17,000 others with similar work  experience should get HKD 25,000 +). Yes I was new to the company's way of working and their system. But after working for a year I improved a lot and kept working hard. I was getting really depressed not having any work life balance.  At my contract renewal asked to work for 5 days instead. Kept working for the low pay. 

6 months ago I had a back injury, and the doctor said I needed to take a month off. My bosses were rightfully upset understandably, but they asked if I could work from home. And I said respectfully no because I need to focus on my recovery. Under the law they have to pay for my sick leave because I have a medical certificate. 

Long story short I slowly integrated myself back to work. Still getting really low pay and having lots of medical bills and doctors appointment to cover. I found out they were paying new staff with zero experience in our field,  more money and I was really upset and disappointed. (Turns out she lied on her CV and she's been getting complaints from clients ) she's been reduced to part time with pay cut, she also got lots of complaints from other staff re ability to do her job.

When I spoke with my boss about it recently she kept bringing up my injury and the fact that I took time off and she thinks I'm unreliable. Also kept throwing my age saying that I was young and immature and not professional. Which felt like a slap in the face, because i worked so hard for them and I've been so loyal and committed. Even after so many people left and resigned. I felt under appreciated...I found out a colleague that I was friends with was basically using me to voice out things she was unhappy about. And that other colleagues would ""tattletale"" about things and talk shit about me to the bosses. I thought they were nice people but I guess I was too trusting and naive.

I truly enjoy my work but idk if it's normal for other working environments to be like this. Or I should find a place with better pay but I'm worried other jobs won't satisfy and challenge me like my current one. What do I do?"

My fear is that, if I disclose this during the interview process, I won't get hired, and as I said before I really need money haha.

Is this okay? Or is it better for me to be truthful upfront and risk it costing me the job? Should I even bother trying to make money in the next two months or should I just take the L?

I'm also worried because I have a different trip in May to the Bahamas for a week and it's like a week before my study abroad period (it's for my partner's sister's wedding, was paid for for me bc their family is wealthy, not saying this to brag or anything, just trying to cover my tracks in case anyone asks ""why do you claim you need money if you're going on all these trips, just save better"" or something).

He believes that if you are salaried you are expected to work whenever it is deemed necessary for the company. No matter what time of day it is and no matter what else you might have going on outside of work. I do not think that is how it works. If you are asked to do something and you agree then that’s on you but should you be expected to make yourself available at all times of the day just because you are salaried??

I was recommended for a job at a large company (250k+ employees) by an internal employee who knows the hiring manager. I had a great phone interview with the recruiter who gave me a pretty quick turnaround for the interview process. The salary is significantly more than I am making now and I meet all the qualifications. I was super excited. 

It’s now been 3 weeks and I haven’t heard anything from the recruiter despite my attempts to follow up with her. My app still shows as “in review” and the person I know who recommended me doesn’t feel comfortable following up with the hiring manager on my behalf. 

It’s a terrible feeling being in limbo and ignored.

Are they meant to be the same or are they meant to be different?

Speaking of uploading your C.V, why do these websites tell you to personalise your C.V to a job you're applying for but then suggest uploading a C.V to your profile? Is the C.V you're uploading to your profile just a generic C.V? Why would employers be interested in seeing that if they want you to tailor your C.V to their job? 

Why do you have to include your work history on your profile, if your WORK HISTORY IS ALREADY ON YOUR C.V AVAILABLE TO VIEW ON YOUR PROFILE? And why do some sites require your profile to have a cover letter if they cover letter is not specific or tailored to a specific job? Is it a cover letter for yourself? Why would employers want to see that if you're already making a cover letter specifically for the job application? 

This is miles beyond involved, and I just want to understand from someone who is proficient in this to explain it to me. Why would some online profiles request the *same information already present on your C.V over and over again?* 

Do they even want the same information over and over again, or does each 'slot' for information have a different purpose? What is the difference? Which way is up? What is going on?!?"

There was this position for a technology specialist in a very specific department at the University for which I was qualified for. I had work with this people in the past, and therefore I felt like I would be a great addition to the team. I have a background in teaching and I feel like this would’ve been an amazing opportunity to shift from teaching towards something more administrative. 

Well, this people strung me along for six whole months during a very intense interview process, only to tell me at the very end of this process that I was not selected. And I didn’t even find out through a person, but rather through a portal that the position had been canceled. Not even a “not selected” but rather the “position has been cancelled” 

When I saw that the position had been canceled I was expecting an email from the hiring manager, but that email didn’t come until a day later when they told me that I simply wasn’t a finalist. 

That was not that was not all because this rejection came in March and just now I see the exact same position with the exact same qualifications was just posted to the university job board. 

I honestly do not know what to do since I feel like this people have not been forthcoming with me and have not really acknowledged that this process was pretty hurtful and dehumanizing, so I was wondering if y’all had any idea about what I should do, applying again for this job or if I should completely leave it?

Full transparency, I am in the final steps for interviewing at a high school also in the area that I am very sure it’s gonna work out, but I was super excited about this other job, and I was wanting to do it for a very long time, and I got very very very disappointed when the decision was canceled without any explanation, so what should I do?"

I thought this would be a good opportunity to slightly push myself back into an office based role, as most jobs within my chosen field (not this job) are office based only. 

I had a few other interview requests but decided I already have 2 offers I'll just stop, influenced to do from my parents advice :| I got the contract and nothing said anything about working from home etc - common but other things in the contract raised a little red flag for me. 

I asked some clarifying questions via email only to find out, there's no WFH... maybe after training if you're good enough and if your ""team leader"" decides they will let you know any sort of day/s (aka maybe 1 day a week). It's not 9-5, the latest you will finish is 7:30pm :| you will work some Saturdays (pay doesn't reflect this). and the ultimate deal breaker for me which I absolutely hate is that your breaks and lunch are scheduled/timed. I understand the need for this in some roles BUT not this one. Also I am not a robot nor am I 14 years old, I can return to my desk in an orderly fashion and I am responsible enough to notice if we are super busy I could take my lunch later once it dies down.  FFS. 

Now I have this crumby job offer that is basically a desk job doing something I have no real interest in. Why do these people constantly lie about things and then expect you to go along with it willingly. Don't tell me it's one thing then switch it around. THANKFULLY I haven't signed the contract yet & have another but similar situation, it's not WFH but they have been upfront about everything.

So, I've been at my current internship since December 2022. I had a pretty rough and slow start and made some mistakes early on. But then I got better mid-January and everything was going pretty well up until March. However, since then, my supervisor moved onto another project and I haven't received any feedback on my work.

I tried to be proactive and find some work I can do, cause it seemed like I was on my own. One week, I exceeded my weekly goals and sent a report, but no one said anything, and the next week, I didn't do anything literally, and still, nothing at all.

I feel like I'm not learning anything in my current internship, and I need another one to validate my semester. I didn't tell my current employer yet, but I found another internship that wants me to start before my current one ends.

I'm looking for advice on how to quit my current internship without any conflicts. I don't want to burn any bridges, but I also want to make sure that I'm doing what's best for me and my education. Also, because of the new internship. I can only give a 3-day notice, which is not ideal. But you can’t have everything in life

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I work in marketing, and I feel I'm not being paid what I deserve and want some outside feedback.

The kicker? I'm only being paid $17 an hour. Hell, I know people working at fast food chains that make more than me.

As I said, this is my first ever real job and I don't have a college degree. I do work from home which I really love and I do really like (most of) the people I work with. I've been told by my friends that I should find a job that pays more, but I don't have much experience to work with and I feel I need to build up my resume a bit. This is prompting me to want to stay longer, especially with the way the US is now with this economy and job market. I feel as though it will be impossible to find a new job at all.

Should I stay with the company I work for? Does it seem like they're underpaying me for the work I put in? What do I do? Sorry if this seems scatterbrained, but it's because I am a bit scatterbrained!"

A little background on my situation: I've been living overseas for 13 years after securing a job there. During that time, I started a family with a local woman and now have three children. I'm now hoping to move back to the US for my children's education, and have been actively seeking a job there that requires my skill set for several months. Recently, I was contacted by a company, went through the interview process, and was offered a position.

However, there's a slight issue. When the company asked me about my salary expectations via email, I indicated that I was hoping to earn around $130K. This is the standard salary range for people in my field who are relocating to the US, and there are other companies I know of that offer this amount, although they tend to be in more expensive parts of the country like New York or Silicon Valley. However, the offer I received was only for $87K.

The job is located in an area that isn't as expensive as those mentioned above, with the average cost of a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house being around $2K per month in rent. But I'm concerned that this salary won't be enough to support a family of five, especially since my wife doesn't speak English and won't be contributing financially.

I'm seeking advice on whether I should accept the offer or negotiate for a higher salary. Any input would be greatly appreciated."

I'm thinking of applying to a local court clerk for a county circuit court in a county with 111,000 residents. We are on the interstate 5 but the county is by far primarily rural. 

I volunteered for my local Youth Court, extensively (1500-2000 hours) during high school, and I went on to a legal assistant position with Americorps in Walla Walla, WA (which is somewhat similar to my home county).

I'm wondering what to consider, whether this would be a good fit. Since graduation I've been traveling, and have worked several minimum wage jobs including food service for 5 or so years recently. But I've been considering that I should get a good 9-5 with the possibilities of starting a career.

Beyond farm labor which I know I can get and can perform, I'm looking at government jobs with theb intention of maybe using my former credentials to pursue a role with (what I think is) decent pay and set hours. But I'm not sure if this is it or not.

The salary ranges from about 4-6k. With my experience and skills, is 5k too much?

With Americorps and also through Youth Court, I became closely knowledgeable regarding trial and due process, as well as having an excellent mind for organization. I was also a tutor in undergrad and have been looking for a position that better utilizes my acquired professional skills regarding clientele and/or customers. So this sounds like it could work out.

What are some considerations to make beyond what I've already described? Think I might have a chance?

Thank you!"

I was quite happy with his style of management. The CTO was calm but was very strict with the deadlines and used to give very tight ones. So, not knowing this fact, I used to think my manager was assigning such tight deadlines to me but in reality it was the CTO. 

After a few months, I found out that the CTO had some grudges with my manager and asked him to leave the company on a cold Friday evening. This came as a shock to me as I had quite good relationship with my manager and there were a lot of ideas that we discussed together for the future projects. 

After a few weeks, a senior team member who worked closely with me was also asked to leave due to poor performance. This lowered the morale of the company and I used to cry because I was jam packed with deadlines and there was a lot of stress on me. I was scared of getting fired and due to that my mind used to go crazy. 

After two months, I got laid off even though I was putting in 14 hours every day, working even on weekends but still the CTO asked me to leave. This made me very furious and I am tempted to get my revenge on them. 

How will I do it? Delete all of their data and services deployed on AWS. I have the credentials with me because I saw this coming. This will crash the entire company and get it to ground zero because they are also trying to cut costs and so don't have many back ups. I can do it all by the press of a single button but I abstain myself from doing it because I am a good person.

Now when I have been hunting for jobs for the past 5 months, I tend to get angry and frustrated from time to time and think of doing it once and for all and I will be satisfied.

Pros:

I work with great specialist, my managers respect me and they are helpful. The pay is average between 50-60k a year with commission. I have a passion for SEO and other forms of digital marketing. They also have great perks and benefits. 

Cons:

They offer a week off for Christmas, when I got back 3 people had quit, their work was behind, and I have been catching up ever since. I work on average 40-45 hours yet still feel behind. Now we had someone else quit with 30 clients, which some of those are going to be put on me. Of course the clients are upset and I am trying my best to take care of new and old clients. 

Questions:

Is this normal at all Digital Marketing Agencies? 
Is the high turn over rate a red flag? 
What are some good ways of juggling and managing burn out?

I was known for being a “rockstar”, but during the pandemic I got burned out. I got a fraction of what I wanted and luckily didn’t have to take on the extra work. Win win right? Not really… since then (2 years ago) I have been feeling the chill from my big boss. I am not in the “cool kid club” anymore. I don’t get invited to exclusive upper management events like I used too. I do my job very well and still get good reviews, but I am disgusted by the high school games. I don’t want to be in their inner circle. I see them so clearly and I do all I can just to get through my days. 

I was invited to a big group get together for a fun event and I don’t want to participate. My spouse thinks by not going I am only going to exacerbate the problem. If I don’t go I have to have a really good reason or it will raise eyebrows. Am I hurting my family by not going? I just feel so fake going and I am opening myself up to be hurt or annoyed by these people.

For the last few months, I’ve worked at a company that hasn’t exactly been the most fair because of the area manager. The store I work at is franchised, so to my understanding we can use the company name and stuff, but we’re on our own when it comes to HR and stuff like that. To my knowledge, we have an area manager and a district manager above him, but I’m not sure if there’s anyone above them. 

The area manager is not the best dude. Constantly watching cameras at his 5 different stores, complaining or writing people up over the smallest stuff but what can you do. 

Now the scenario in question, there was a new hire who was a minor (this isn’t a specialized job so this part isn’t weird) who made some sort of mistake and got yelled at by the store manager. The minor decided to just leave it and walk away and as he had his back turned to the manager, the manager forcefully pushed him. Then he wrote him up I believe. 

The area manager got wind of this, visited the location and turns out he decided to keep the manager and fire the minor. 

Can anything be done? HR does exists for these kinds of things, but they’re so far removed from the franchised locations they usually just tell the area manager who then yells at us for calling HR and not him, and then proceeds to ignore any word from HR. 

This isn’t the first time the area manager protects a manager for harassment or some other violation. 

I apologize for how long this is. Any help is appreciated."

What should I do? Put up with it here or think of moving

I also don’t know whether the next school is a great fit for me. They’ll offer lots of promotion but the senior leader has a lady who was sacked from the last role and used to say in morning briefing “if you don’t like it I’ll find someone to replace you it’s that simple” so basically a bully. She got the role at this new school because she is mates with thr head. I don’t know whether if work in close capacity to her. But I think I’d end up losing my head in a place like that if we worked together. Thoughts?

Tldr: my cv looks like I’ve hopped from job to job and I’m not happy where I am and on interview day had a gut feeling it would be bad. Now I want ouy but I’m worried it looks bad. New school I’m looking at has a bully as a leader but I like the school. Help!"

1,2023-04-13,Tips for applying for jobs out of state,u/CrescendoMelody713,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12kq54b/tips_for_applying_for_jobs_out_of_state/,jobs,"So I'm desperate to move out of my hometown. Been here my entire life, college included. 

I really want to work in the entertainment industry. My main focus is costuming, but I've also worked as a stage manager, light board op, and backstage crew. I'm currently completing a fellowship at a local theatre, which is why I unfortunately couldn't apply for most summer stock work. It lasts until June while a good portion of summer stock work begins in May. (with that being said I am still keeping an eye out)

Realistically, I know that getting a job in the entertainment field is very difficult. I currently have 2 jobs (one as a seamstress, one working retail) that are for national chains. One thought I had is that if I find a place I want to move I could see if I can transfer to a store within the companies I work for. This way I would have income lined up while I actively look for other opportunities. With that being said, I've had people I work in theatre with recommend I just apply for jobs instead of only applying for internships.

If I'm being honest I mostly focused on internships because they normally offer housing, which would be one less things to worry about. However since I recently graduated the number of internships I can apply to is much smaller than if I were still in school.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any input I the best way to apply for jobs out of state if I intend on moving anywhere I get a decent offer. I assume a lot of times they may see my location and not even considering me. But I also don't want to be dishonest. Most of the jobs I've seen don't ask for a cover letter, but would it be a good idea to include one so I can specify that I'm willing to relocate?

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

1,2023-04-13,Switch job or stay?,u/Straight-Painter-894,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12kqim7/switch_job_or_stay/,jobs,"I have been in employment in this business for 9 years, I started in a much more junior role and now I am qualified, the company paid for one of my qualifications, I have worked the period required of me for this.

&#x200B;

I started to feel a bit fed up and flat in my current place and wondered if we were being paid competitively compared to other companies offering similar. I was contacted by a recruitment agency who said they had companies looking for people like me in a nearby area, so I responded and enquires.

&#x200B;

I have been offered an 'associate' role in a new company, its more money and  progression opportunities to reach the top of the business, more ways to 'climb the ladder'. My current employment was very surprised and said I could have that in my current job in time, they would match the pay. My current employment is a much smaller business, but they say they're intending to grow, I think me letting them know I wanted to go sparked them to try to make some changes to make the job more attractive.

&#x200B;

Do I take the new job opportunity or do I stay in the current business to help grow it? I guess I'm scared its not going to go anywhere with my current employment and I will be back at the start!"

I know a lot of people and some people in my family just applying to job, get an interview and finally get an offer. Very straightforward.

In my case I’m just getting ghosted and rejected for the past two years.

Last week I was so happy! Two interviews! I was so stressed out and because of that, things I say aren’t like what I’m thinking of…

Got rejected for the two positions. I just feel like I will get stuck at minimum wage for the rest of my life 😭

Why is there lucky people and why is there unlucky people?

Is there other unlucky ones out there?"

It's part of a council-funded apprenticeship and an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my creative writing and video editing expertise. Moreover, my manager is amicable and supportive. Nonetheless, owing to the company's size, we lack a permanent office and frequently have to work remotely and communicate via email and Zoom conferences. As I've spent most of my professional and personal life in a physical setting, adapting to this work style has been challenging.

I frequently visit the library and bring along my laptop, but I encounter issues with maintaining my focus. I believe that if I were to be at my home, I might either doze off or stream Netflix. I don't whether the transition from a retail job to a creative role is the issue. What can I do to address this matter? How have you all coped with working remotely?"

6,2023-04-13,Seeking Advice - Feeling overwhelmed and lost at my tech job,u/trekkingthrulife,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12kqpnv/seeking_advice_feeling_overwhelmed_and_lost_at_my/,jobs,"I could really use some advice or guidance right now. Through a unique opportunity, I was offered a position as an IT business analyst at a fortune 500 company after over a year of job searching. I came in at mid level with no technical background, but I came in with a background in psychology, marketing, communications, and SEO. I did really well on the interviews and was transparent about the background that I came from and that mostly communication skills and my adaptability to learn demonstrated by my resume were my strong point, but that I had no technical background on the level of this position. They took a chance on me and gave me this awesome opportunity that a lot of people could only dream of and I'm really grateful which is what makes me feel even more guilty saying that... I hate every second of it and I have zero interest in what I'm doing. I cry at least twice a week during work out of panic and stress, being constantly bombarded with emails, requests, and teams messages, I become frozen and overwhelmed. Every issue/everything I'm reading feels like a foreign language.

I'm about to hit my fourth month which means I'm still pretty new but it feels like every time I learn something I'm even more confused. There was no formal training and my coworkers/team are under the impression that I know a lot more than I do which makes expectations even higher. In the beginning my manager was very supportive and helpful and told me not to worry about it that I'll get it and learn it. One of my coworkers was assigned to guide me and help me with issues. In the beginning two months it was working out well but my manager and my coworker have a ton of responsibilities that I don't have yet so they're always swamped with their own work, which I don't blame them for. I feel as though a lot of the issues are so technical and very different with each scenario, and even as a single point of contact, with no technical background or experience I find that I spend most of my time just trying to comprehend what the issue is so that I can relay it to the right people (which is an issue in itself because I was not given any basic contact sheet for the different teams and departments I just had to keep asking my coworker who to reach out to). I really do want to understand it but every day I find myself frustrated and I feel like I don't know what I don't know. I go to sleep dreading the next day and then in the morning I dread waking up to start the workday because I know it's just gonna be crazy.

Typically I work around 10 hours a day, during which time is high paced, and am on call once a month where I have to be available for any major issues that come up around the clock. I'm getting paid really well and finally am able to start saving some money for my future and become financially stable, but I cannot enjoy the present right now because I just feel my mind and spirit is defeated and drained everyday. I just finish work, eat, maybe gym to keep myself sane and then sleep. I guess that's normal.

Anyways, I've been waiting for a solid opportunity like this for a while and everybody in my life was so happy for me and hopeful because of how my job search was going. There is a certain guilt that comes with venting because this can take me so many places and open doors for me. However, I can say without a doubt that I do not see myself long-term in tech unless maybe it has something to do with research or writing. My brain is not technically wired, it's more creatively, and the high stress high paced environment I can see is definitely suitable for some of my coworkers and they thrive off of it, while others have interest in the different programs and systems. And of course some people are obligated due to personal responsibilities and obligations. I requested a one on one with my manager to go over some questions but because of his workload, he's had to cancel twice already. I acknowledge the privilege that comes with writing a post like this but I cannot deny what I'm experiencing (I do have ADD and am an HSP). I'm wondering what advice someone may have who has been in the same position, because honestly anything would help right now."

I’m hoping I get it. They said they are looking to hire fairly quickly - the beginning of May. 

They asked how much notice I would have to give my current employer and I said the obvious two-weeks but now I’m wondering if I should follow-up and let them know I can do one week notice with my current company? 

I currently work in a small IT office with 5 people and it’s been pretty miserable since I was hired. I love the job but not the environment. 

This new job is a GOLDEN opportunity for me in every way. 

Should I wait to follow up with them, maybe wait until Monday? Is one-week notice before resignation frowned upon? Would that be a red flag to the potential new company?"

I currently work in a bit of a niche industry, but a lot of my day-to-day work is transferable to other roles. Marketing, communications, social media work, and Human Resources are a few examples. 

Here's the thing, I'm having a hard time even getting an interview at entry level positions. Basically every job posting requires 4-5 years of experience doing exactly what the job posting is looking for. From what I can tell, virtually no employer wants to provide any training. And they probably don't need to seeing as basically every posting on LinkedIn in my area is getting a minimum of 50 applicants. 

I've been doing quite a bit of professional networking as well and even that hasn't seemed to open many doors. 

I still have time, but this job search is getting a bit deflating. I have roughly five years of retail experience under my belt that included some supervisory work. I've put in a lot of time and energy to get out of retail as it wasn't enjoyable before COVID and it's really not now. However, I'm beginning to feel like my options are to go back into retail/sales, or try to work an extremely low-paying job to get more ""experience.""

Don't know what job is right for me.

 I have a degree in journalism, and most of my professional experience is in journalism, corporate communications, and marketing. Writing is undoubtedly my strongest skill. But as social media management has become increasingly important in the field, I've struggled.

While I've created social media calendars, written social media copy, and analyzed metrics to determine the most effective strategies, the task has become more of a chore than a passion. I even experienced a physical reaction at times when creating social media calendars during an internal corporate communications job.

In search of a way to continue writing professionally without the added pressure of social media, I decided to pursue a certificate in UX design. Although I'm almost finished with the program, I'm not ready to give up entirely on writing.

I'm currently job hunting and can't help but feel discouraged by the prevalence of social media management requirements listed in job postings. 

While this post may come across as a rant, I am genuinely curious if there are opportunities within the communications field that don't require social media management. Have any of you found alternative paths within the communications field that allowed you to avoid social media? TIA"

Both my employer and myself have been noncommittal about a full time position, not for any performance or behavioral reasons, more so budgetary. In this tight labor market I fear being unemployed so I’ve been putting out some applications. I have a job offer with a different company and they’re expecting my response this afternoon. This new job would be a big pay cut and not really something I’d enjoy. My question is, would it be wrong to accept the job (which starts in June) and only go through with it if I lose my current job?"

My partner is currently job hunting.  She lest the fast food industry after 7+ years last month and was extremely excited to be starting her new job at a daycare. However, she absolutely hates it – there's been no training, her co-workers are very stand off-ish and just not very welcoming of new hires, and it just overall seems to be a disorganized mess. So, she has begun the job hunt again. She's applied to several jobs that she is more than qualified for, and on Monday she heard back from two of them that wanted to set up interviews, and she responded with her availability, as requested. However, it has been several days now and neither place has gotten back to her about interviews.  Does she just drop it and move on?  Does she reach out to them again?  She was actually really interested in both of these jobs, as they seemed like positions she'd actually really enjoy and be very good at, so it's been a bit disheartening for her not to hear back."

I really need to quit my job and more or less need advice, similar situations you have been in, or just reassurance. Basically, I took my dream job last year. It was a job that combined my two fields on interest and is a job dedicated to helping people who are considered ""at risk."" That's also part of the reason I am leaving this job. I was never given any training, nor am I supported in my position. Its a job no one takes unless they have a personal attachment to the work and makes the position more susceptible to exploitations I guess. My boss both gets upset with me when I make decisions on my own, but he shows up to work maybe 2 times a week and doesn't answer my emails. I am also expected to cover for him when he does these things. I can't write a good cover letter or spend anytime doing anything other than trying to decompress from the day at work and mentally prepare myself for the next. I am not helping the people I took this job to help, and I am held responsible for things I was not trained on. If i resign in two weeks not only my coworkers, who are the only ones who have done their best to help, but also our members who we work to represent will be left without anyone to represent their interests for a long amount of time potentially.

&#x200B;

The problem is, I know that there is no one they will find someone to replace me in two weeks, or even a month.  I know the answer is ""it is your bosses fault for putting you and your coworkers in that situation"" and that is true. But how do i convince myself and actually believe it?"

Where do these jobs expect entry-level candidates to get experience from?

If it's experience, period, I should be fair game for every job I'm applying to.

I've been there a little less than 6 months and am starting to want to make a shift to a more traditional career.

I'm not overly concerned with the type of job I do, and I couldn't care less about things like job title. What I'm interested in is a steady paycheck which pays better than my current job (Take home is 1900 a month),standard benefits like health insurance,  and where I'm paid not by hours in a chair but by accomplishing a task. 

I have some health problems and my current job's strange(late) hours allow me to make my weekly physical therapy appointments however if I worked a traditional in office 9-5 that would become pretty problematic. 

I primary want to work from home because I think it will improve my mental health. I hate being ""Idle"", in my current job Ive systematized and created hotkeys as much as I can (thats just how I am) but there isn't really any point. My job is to sit in a chair and wait till a task comes down the pipeline, do it, then sit and wait another 15-20 minutes until another task shows up. So doing it quicker, isn't really a bonus it just means more time waiting. I also don't like being in a front facing role. 

I'm completely fine with doing boring work and repetitive work. I almost prefer it since its easy to systematize. I don't mind hard work, My main complaint at my current job is it neither engages me mentally or physically, I spend most of my shift burning time and being bored. I need something more though. I'm 30 years old and I want a more traditional job than my current hours. 

Tl;DR I'm not wanting a work from home job because I'm lazy, but because my current position has crap pay, is boring,and I want to feel like effort actually leads to doing something and am interested in roles that would facilitate that."

Michigan is dominated mostly by careers in the automotive industry, tech, weed, or healthcare. I’m currently pursuing a degree in organizational leadership and I’ll hopefully be graduating in December. I honestly can’t take it here anymore, every job is full time $13.00/hr and that’s not even enough to pay my rent. 

I have a close friend who owns a house in Portland and her mortgage is cheaper than my rent. I’m planning to spend some time with her and help her set up her new house. Should I be throwing out as many applications as I can hoping something sticks? Part of me feels like this is a Michigan problem because everyone is just trying to get the lowest wage worker to do as much work as possible. 

I got laid off from my previous job in July  after they found out I knew they were violating labor laws and I haven’t been able to find an ethical position that works with my class schedule since.

I graduated in 2021 from a top CS program and had an internship with the company then got converted. It is a very cushy job. It is wayy more lax than other companies. I still go on call, but its fine. 

I just still hate it though. I don't feel passionate about the team? the product? the org? remote work? coding at all? I'm not sure. I feel unmotivated and burnt out even though I'm barely doing anything. Then I also feel like shit about myself because I'm not working for my money the way I want to. I'm not improving at my craft. 

I danced and did escorting in college and I'd love to make that my craft again. I'm so sexual and I'm solid at sex work stuff. I can make $600-$1200 in like 6-8 hours dancing. I can make $1000 escorting. I could work twice a week wherever and whenever I want. I could work very hard for a few weeks and travel for months with no financial worries. 

I know if I could stick it out longer in tech though, I could be better set up. The insurance is incredible. My psych/therapist charges $380 a session and it is mostly covered. I was trying medication (I'm not anymore) but it was like $1700 a month. That is nearly $40k. No way I can pay that out of pocket. I feel the golden handcuffs and I feel my issue with commitmment and feeling stuck. 

I have one property I'm renting out and it needs about $18,000 in renovations in order to stop losing me $500 a month (adding an extra bedroom). So I am thinking I'll quit my job after I make that amount... 3 more months. I'll slowly introduce the sex work I wanna do into the equation as well. 

I want to work for myself. I think I'd love a solution engineering role one day if I go back into tech. It's sales + tech + new people constantly + travel which are things I like a lot.

Previously for the last 4 years or so I worked under the table doing data entry for a non profit run by my grandmother. I get paid $7200 a year for a few hours of work each week, and attend college full time for a bachelor of business (2 years out from a degree at the moment). I felt really pressured to get out there and work because I didn't want my only job to be tied to family, and I'm autistic and was honestly worried if I'd ever be able to work a full time job to begin with, and I didn't want to be stuck dependent on my mother forever. Not to mention age, I felt terrible that at 21 years old I'd never even interviewed for a job before. 

I applied for about a billion listings and was finally accepted for a job as a telemarketer for a political organization I don't even like, borderline hate. The work is mind numbing, I just sit in an auto dialler queue and get a call every 1 or 2 minutes, and then get hung up on or cursed out. I'm only two weeks into the job but I feel like my brain is about to melt and me along with it. I get paid $10 a hour but money isn't that big of an issue for me right now so... Idk how to feel about that.

Is sticking with this worth being able to put it on my resume? Honestly I'm not sure if I'm considering my previous experience/what my resume looks like currently too harshly, or if I really should be worried about how empty it is. I guess what I'm asking is, with my degree in the coming years and all my experience being family related/barely even part time, is that enough to secure a good job in the future without this job on my resume?"

I'm trying to transition into a new career; however, I still work a full-time job in my original career, so I primarily rely on volunteer experiences to bolster my resume. The volunteer jobs have allowed me to create a portfolio and demonstrate the skills I've acquired. Recently, I received a job offer in the industry I'm trying to move into, which is great. However, they want to run an employment background check. I listed the volunteer experiences as previous employment history (in addition to my paid, full-time job), and I'm wondering if that was a mistake. Does volunteer employment technically count as real employment if I'm not getting paid? The managers at the previous volunteer gigs enjoyed my work, and I used them as references to get the job offer, but I'm wondering if I'll be seen as a liar because I didn't mention that the volunteer experiences were unpaid.

&#x200B;

Could someone please provide insight?"

before i took this last job, i was working for Chewy for the past 3 years. i worked in office until Covid hit and worked from home for another year until i got a better job offer. Marcus was also WFM, a $3.00 raise and just something new for me to learn. turns out, Marcus is a pretty sleazy company to work for, but i digress. 

i applied for Chewy this past week and got the interview after passing my assessment. from my knowledge, once you get the interview, you basically get the job at Chewy. they’re a very open opportunity job. but i assume since the job market is in the toilet right now, that’s just not the case anymore. 

pretty much, im just pretty bummed that i didn’t get selected. does anyone else have experience with trying to go back to a previous job out of, dare i say, desperation, and still not get selected? is every job genuinely just hard-balling applicants right now? i really don’t wanna go back to serving lol"

Eventually, it went past three, and I was wondering what was going on.

I then noticed that the zoom meeting was scheduled at 2 PM.

The email said that I was scheduled for 3PM EDT.

I live in the central time zone. It was an hour ago!

What a fool I am!

I have always been an outstanding worker when loaded up with tasks with defined due dates, but my biggest flaw is I am unable to go out and find work for myself. I need my manager to do that for me - thus me being an IC. 

Is this common? I just want to make sure I’m not in some uncommon situation and that I just need to buck up and get used to it. 

If my manager could just keep me loaded up with projects I’d knock it out, but if I’m being told that the only way to succeed is to seek out my own opportunities then I’m going to fail hard. I mean come on it’s a business job I don’t find much of it interesting at all,  I just want to be busy, get acknowledged for my hard work completing tasks, and get my pay check."

I would definitely not accept this job even at the top of the posted range, but I’d strongly consider if they bumped it up 10-15k.

I had none. Yet i still applied thinking “hey, what if they take me in and train me if they dont get the right candidate?”. Well the interview was today, and it was quite horrifying. I was quite nervous and somewhat all over the place trying not to stutter and speak confidently. The questions they asked were definitely questions related to people with at least 2 years of experience and although I did answer all questions to the best of my ability, I did repeat myself a lot and I think I definitely embarrassed myself attending it.
I dont know why they’d even called me to it. I know for a fact I’m not getting that job, but holy jeez I feel so embarrassed that I even attended it. This was an eye opening experience but I think I found myself problematic in two places:
1. Constantly having to repeat one or two of my experiences to fit their experience questionnaire since I dont have much of it.
2. Being articulate and not repeat myself/blabber too much.
How can I be better at no. 2?

At one point, the interviewer asked me a question to which I thought I answered vaguely considering my lack of experience but then he had to repeat himself clarifying the question pushing me to answer it which I think was the cringiest moment in the whole interview since I was not even able to answer him properly let alone do the job and I still suffer from that aftermath."

I'm working at a bank and it's in a really affluent area. My manager tells me several times a week that 'this is not just a service job, this is also a sales job'. Basically, I'm not just here to change pin numbers and help cash checks in the ATM (we're a cashless branch), I'm here to talk to people about their financial picture and essentially tell them about our products, and refer them to other officers like loan officers and financial advisors. 

It's just my manager, another coworker in an equivalent role to me, and myself. Well this week, my manager began her vacation, and outsourced a lot of the operational procedures to us 2 now. (We must have 2 employees in the branch at any given time)

My manager has mentioned the sales portion of the job a lot and mentioned that she will only get a bonus if I reach my sales goals, and she has children and stuff to feed and stuff.

At this point I'm kinda left alone a lot, and still feel ill-prepared for a lot of situations.

Also, we get hour lunches, and she will somewhat guilt-trip for taking my full lunch when her and my other coworker will take time out of their lunches to help me if I'm in a difficult customer scenario.

My manager also has a cat at the branch that stays in the back-office, and it's cute, but the back-office stinks like shit."

The work environment and team dynamic didn't suit me, so I gave notice on April 3. Tomorrow is my final full day, and I'll turn in all of my materials to the admin Monday. Since I sent my email calmly announcing my departure, things have been tense with my boss. 

She didn't take my resignation well and began our phone conversation by raising her voice and saying ""I'm so disappointed by how you've chosen to handle this."" She continued to guilt trip me by talking about how extensive the search to fill the role was before bargaining with me to stay. She concluded with a ""so there's nothing I can do to keep you.""

Is this a typical and/or acceptable way to handle a resignation? I realize the size of the nonprofit and the unexpected nature of the resignation lead to increased stress, but I find her behavior unprofessional.

Given her emotional response, I've avoided much interaction with her beyond some small talk and emails regarding my final projects. She made a goodwill gesture via email to put together a going away luncheon, but I have less than two full days left as an employee. I thanked her for the offer, the opportunity, and her professionalism during my notice period. She responded with the idea of giving me some ""constructive feedback"" over coffee in the future. (I'm going to pass.)

The job has been incredibly tumultuous and not what I expected because of my supervisor's family issues overtaking her life, the general disorganization and under-resourced nature of the nonprofit, and the hiring of a friend's neurodivergent daughter in a critical role.

I'm not sure what to do with my five-month tenure. It should go on my resume to reduce my post-graduate-school employment gap, but I don't want employers asking questions and trying to get a reference from her or another colleague. 

The last thing I will say is the woman I replaced in the role left on bad terms and told me she would only discuss her time with the organization if I paid her a consultation fee. At the time, I thought she was being difficult. Now, I'm not so sure. 

Please commiserate and share any ideas of how I can spin this for future employment. 

Thanks for your time!"

hi everyone! i'm (mid 20s F) at my current job (R&D engineer level 2 at a pharma company) for a year and a month now, 3 YOE total. i really like my projects, my manager, and my team-- i'm on a hybrid schedule and benefits are great, although the location has me left desiring more (site is middle of a low population suburban area and there isn't much to do around). i also got a decent raise and bonus, but still underpaid by industry and academic based standards by a decent amount-- it's livable for now but COL is going up. 

i was shopping around for new jobs in the area my partner lives in since we're a couple states apart, we're looking to move in together in the next year or so, same state where i went to college, all my friends live there, more social life and scene, job opportunities, etc. only good things sans the traffic. i know the only way to increase my salary and move up is to move to companies vertically/diagonally, but i want to emphasize i'm in no rush to switch jobs especially since my previous experiences have been around a year long each before i moved to the next role and i don't want to make that a precedent on my resume. i also think it's good to look to see what's out there, practice interviewing, learn more about other companies to leverage my current skill set. 

i applied to a level 4 R&D engineer at another pharma company in the aforementioned state a month ago. the recruiter reached out to me the same week, asked for my availability for a phone call, and when i responded the same day, they ghosted for 2 weeks even though i followed up twice with no response. i ended up having to call him 2 weeks ago (end of march) and thankfully he set up an interview that week, which went really well and i'm one of the strongest candidates he's found, according to him. he said that next steps would be that the hiring manager will contact me within a week to set up an interview and after that, i'd interview in front of a panel. it's been almost 2 weeks and i haven't gotten any communication from either the recruiter or the hiring manager. 

would it be unhinged/pushy of me to reach out to the recruiter and ask what's going on with the process? my application hasn't been pulled from the system so i'm still in the ring, and i'm also not on a time crunch for an answer, but a response would be nice. thanks all!"

Sheet metal will probably be a little less labour intensive and can be pretty fun building out systems.  Lots of cuts and pay isn’t as good as plumbing

Plumbing can be pretty labour intensive and dirty but tends to pay more.  I can also use what I learn on my house and also lends itself to side jobs if need be.

I know this is a stretch but hoping people can speak up from each trade to help me decide.

Oh.  I’m coming from a background in brewing, if that matters.

“Why leave brewing?!” You ask.  Well, I’ve been in the industry for 8 years, it’s pretty much manual labour and I’ve hit the ceiling and make about as much as a second year apprentice."

2,2023-04-13,How to cite a good reason for leaving a month after hire?,u/3INTPsinatrenchcoat,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12liykr/how_to_cite_a_good_reason_for_leaving_a_month/,jobs,"To preface, I'm a 20-year-old transgender man and only have two official jobs, plus freelance babysitting in high school, to put on my resume. One of those ""official"" jobs is the one in question here. It was a retail customer service position and my most recent experience, and I quit without notice just a month after I was hired. I know this doesn't look good on an application, which is why I need help with a professional way to explain why I left.

The basic lowdown is that my department manager was consistently rude and transphobic toward me and had no patience for my job training or onboarding. In fact, she left my training to someone else in the department who was technically still in training himself. I barely knew how to do my job, and she would get angry at me for asking questions or for standing around because I didn't know what to do. To say she was a living nightmare to work under is an understatement. After an unrelated incident with a customer that I'd rather not divulge much about, I hit my breaking point and quit the next day.

I realize now that as an adult, I can't just quit a job without notice like that because I have responsibilities and they deserve at least some degree of professionalism. I do regret being so hasty, but at the time I was too overwhelmed and distressed to think about it rationally. Now I'm stuck with the aftermath as I struggle to find a new job. On applications and in interviews, they ask for the reason I left my last job, and I don't know what to say. Citing transphobia and a rude supervisor just sounds petty and unprofessional. How can I phrase this in a way that lessens the blow of quitting after a month while remaining accurate to the situation?"

1,2023-04-14,Is this situation unfair?,u/Stark27_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12llch9/is_this_situation_unfair/,jobs,"Hello,

I have been having some troubles in my workplace. I feel like I have been unfairly judged for my honest work. Allow me to explain. It is quite the read. 

I am a Software Engineer working (or was working) on a big project that is quite complex. I am basically new to the whole thing and the learning curve is quite humongous. People have answers to questions while others have different answers making finding the right info or proper procedure a confusing experience and is not straightforward. The on boarding process takes quite a while. Think government speeds. 

I was given tasking to fix an issue that turned out to be a series of issues and has taken me quite a while to fix some of it with some help. The tasking was eventually split into 2. While the stuff that was fixed was set and ready to get approved for implementation, it never quite made it into the implementation phase because they needed to the determine value of the fix because the simulation software and real hardware have different behaviors making some of the problems difficult to consistently replicate and pinpoint as well as determine its value. 

On the other hand, the other task that spawned from the original task (written by me) was given to another team member. This task was the part of the overall problem that was difficult to pinpoint. This team member is more experienced than I am and he is sort of struggling with it as well even after I gave him a decent head start with the info I gathered on it. That's not a negative judgement on him as he is quite helpful and cheerful. The task is just difficult especially when the simulation software often has problems that act as impediments that they are all well aware of. Getting access to real hardware is challenging and I had some time scheduled but it got pushed back twice because of higher priority work others need to do. Plus the problem was quite difficult to get back into after a weekend or day long (or longer) training because the cogs that turn the machine are quite complex even for the experienced so to speak. Nobody understands the entire project. 

The management thinks my work was lackluster even after gathering all the information I did about it and the efforts I put into solving these series of issues and are basically laying me off. Some of my team members think my efforts have been great and the help I provided to the person working on the hard part probably saved him a ton of time and he is quite appreciative of it. The other software devs there know the tasking that I'm working on is complex especially for someone quite new. 

My theory is that the team lead doesn't really see all the efforts that went into the work and some of the work I did doesn't have my name associated with it because some other tasking prior to this one was a split effort between me and another new team member but his name is on it. My efforts do not reflect in the data and I believe this is what the team lead sees plus theres the perspective of the scrum master which is probably not fully established and understanding of the problem.

Another grievance is that I was told that I was leaning too much on others to get the work done, but the documentation and overall development process are not straightforward at all making being a new member a very challenging one hence the steep learning curve I mentioned earlier. They say that because I was asking quite a few questions to learn because the provided tutorials were dated and not fully accurate and sometimes I would express concern that I was taking too long to fix the issu while in sort of an overwhelmed state but I never did anything wrong.

I admit that some big challenges in my personal life were making things slightly more challenging to get the work done but I did make progress whenever I had time to work on it but one must still consider all the impediments and trainings above and there would be times the network would go down as well. The tasking was good at giving me and the other fellow working on the other task I wrote a headache often.

Basically my point is that I feel like my efforts are not being gauged well and me being layed off is not very fair. I could use some advice on this. I was planning on talking to HR about it but I'm not fully sure on how to go about it. Just trying to maintain my reputation of being an honest worker who occasionally makes mistakes like any other human does. 

Any advice is appreciated!"

1,2023-04-14,Can I leave a company after onboarding?,u/Kalex8876,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12loc66/can_i_leave_a_company_after_onboarding/,jobs,"Tl;dr I want advice on how to deal with a company with bad communication and to know if I can leave a company and accept another offer if I’ve already onboarded with former company

Hey, I got an internship offer over the phone after the interview and I accepted cause the search has been hard and this just seemed great (they provided housing). I onboarded and everything set up and stopped my search. However, it’s been over a month I onboarded/accepted the offer and the company is so unserious. I’ve had to pester them to keep the tracks moving, up until now I still don’t know my location posting or my team setup and this annoys someone like me that likes having a plan and early on. I’ve wanted to know the location to at least know if I need to book a flight or not and do it early on. School ends first week of May and I still don’t know. 
Anyways so I started the search again and I’ve gotten three interviews in the span of a week (this is mind blowing, previously I used to get three in the span of a month or more). And there’s this other company that will provide housing AND transportation in the area (my current company doesn’t provide transportation) and I had the interview with them yesterday over zoom. I know it’s not set in stone that I’ll get it but I’m really praying on it, the hiring manager wanted me to have an on-site interview towards the ending of the meeting/meet with others in the company and I want to take that as a good sign. 
The only kind of down turn is that this new company starts a bit after the semester ends so I’ll have to house myself for like two weeks (I think I can do that) before I can get in the company housing and it also ends a bit early (early July) so I’ll have to house myself again. And also that kind of shorter term may mean less money but this current company is kind of like pay based on jobs completed but the other is standard per hour so the peace of mind might be better.
So anyways I’m basically asking for two things, advice on how to deal with this current company (like getting them moving) and if I can reject the current company if this new one gives me an offer even though I’ve already onboarded?"
2,2023-04-14,A Guide to Grinding Leetcode,u/small_hole_energy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12lof7d/a_guide_to_grinding_leetcode/,jobs,"Leetcode is famous for being a perfect platform for practicing coding problems and to master coding interviews, unlike others, it is not for competitive programming, this guide will help you to get started with Leetcode without losing hope too early.

[A Guide to grinding Leetcode](https://theabbie.github.io/blog/leetcode-grinding-guide)

## Follow a list

Biggest reason why people don't find DSA interesting is because they are unable to discover good problems which are easier to solve, simply solving popular questions with no track of questions will bore you very quick. Even worse, you might try solving a really hard problem and lose motivation when it wasn't that hard, you just had to get a grip on it. That's why it's absolutely necessary to follow a list of questions, that way you won't have issues discovering new questions.

**Solving problems in right order is very important,**

you might see question marked easy which isn't actually easy, the solution will be small, but sometimes, it isn't easy to come up with that solution if you haven't done simpler version of it, thus, it will be demotivating,

[Blind 75 Leetcode Questions](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/)

This is an awesome list which is asked in interviews and is ordered by actual level of difficulty with prerequisites coming before harder questions, if you follow this, you'll feel interested, once you have done most of this, do problems in “similar questions"" section below each problem till you master that category.

Once you feel confident, you can use this,

[Leetcode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)

and solve problems by category, this will help you master a data structure or some algorithm.

don't get afraid by “hard"" questions, there is no hard problem which can't be broken up, try to break it, you might not be able to solve it but you'll convert it to much shorter set of problems which can be solved with some practice.

Thinking abstract and looking at bigger picture is very important, try to convert it to a standard problem. Leetcode is addictive if you improve gradually, try it.

## Avoid looking at solutions easily

It's not bad to look at solutions, afterall, you can't know everything and learning is necessary, however, looking at solution just after few minutes of brainstorming is bad, you have to give your absolute best and try every possible ""inefficient"" solutions you could come up with.

First phase is to figure out what Algorithm and data structure will be used, if you are able to determine what data structure will be used, you can check the  **Related Topics**  section to verify if your assumption was correct, and if after few minutes you can't figure it out, you should still check the data structure that will be used and then try to figure out how and where it will be used in given problem.

If you are able to come up with a solution which works correctly, just isn't the best one, that's still a success, coming up with a brute force solution is a bare minimum in an interview.

You can try improving the brute force solution by using some optimizations, that might not lead you to the optimal solution, but improving a solution is a great skill. After spending an hour, if you can't solve the problem, you should usnderstand that you just aren't well versed with the given algorithm and should try solving related problems with that data structure and understand how it works.

You should avoid looking at solution, a solution you made yourself will help you much more, you should abandon the question and maybe revisit in future when you have some experience with that data strucure. That way you can also track if you made some progress with that technique and if you could solve a new problem given to you in an interview,

## Interview Questions don't come with hints

One thing to remember is that Interview questions won't tell you what data structure will be used for the problem. That's something you can only master with practice, the patterns and requirements of problems determine what's going to be used.

There is no substitute for practice, reading about algorithms will sure improve your range of thinking, but practice is what will help you master it.

## Be Consistent

This goes without saying that practice needs consistency, simply overdoing once and abandoning for months will be destructive, it doesn't take much to take out some time everyday for Leetcode, as far as discovering questions is a concern, you can use Daily Challenges to keep the consistency and maybe also earn Leetcode coins which might buy you a Leetcode T-Shirt one day.

## Turn Demotivation into learning opportunity

There will be times when you can't solve a problem despite all efforts, that's very common and bound to happen, but some question being too hard is not something that should demotivate you, every question is a learning opportunity, you can always learn it. Demotivation should be avoided and that's only possible if you have confidence in yourself and will to learn as much as you can.

## Participate in contests

Eventhough Leetcode isn't a competitive programming platform, there are contests which allow you to try out brand neew problems and even compete with others. They have categories of 1 easy, 2 Medium and 1 Hard, and solving 3 is more than enough. Once you have enough confidence on your problem solving ability, these contests will help you gain interview experience as they don't have any hints and solutions aren't available during contest. This is pretty close to a real interview experience where time is limited.

## Keep Hustling

Leetcode is an addiction and soon you'll fall in love with it, all you need to do is start, there is only one good time to start anything great, NOW, just do it and you'll sure be satisfied with your decision and be proud of yourself. That's all, It's never too early and never too late."

Today I got a message on indeed asking to select a time slot for an interview for a company I applied to a few weeks ago.

I was extremely hopeful and very excited because this jobs ad post mentioned a starting salary of 80k. (The 80k matches up with the salary in solar sales at other jobs here where I live according to google) 

This is a solar sales job, and I have never worked in sales. This was mentioned in my cover letter. 

I have a lot of experience in different places and environments but never in sales.

First red flag 🚩 The job post was pretty bare bones, not much info other than a few requirements and basic job description. Also mentioned 1 year in sales is preferred. That was about it.


Red flag 2🚩 Now that I have an interview I started doing more research into the company. The company  on indeed is for example called “Krystal homes” but when I searched it up, nothing came up except a company called “Krystal roofing” and Krystal roofing is not based in my city but in the city next over about 6 hours away. 

Looking into “Krystal roofing’s” website I found that they do operate in my city, but again it’s a different name than the one from indeed. Could not find the company with “homes” instead of “roofing”. 


So for my questions, is it a good idea to go to this interview? It’s on the 19th at 10:30am. 

What’s should I look out for? 

should I keep my expectations low ? 

If it is possibly a scam, how could I get scammed? 

Sorry for the ramble, writing this at 4am and stressing. Thanks guys!"

11,2023-04-14,How to people navigate their job when there’s little work to do? (18 month paid marketing internship),u/bigoldthrifty,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ltkj1/how_to_people_navigate_their_job_when_theres/,jobs,For context I got brought into a big rebranding project at the start of my job in a small team as part of the marketing dept so there was loads of work to do - I have a lot of design experience so they gave me some big tasks to complete which was nice as it made me feel less like an intern and tbh I’m overqualified for my job role. The project has taken around 10 months to complete and has been the primary focus the whole time Iv been working at the job and used to a certain pace of workload. Since the launch of the rebrand work has slowed down massively and feel more like a spare part doing admin tasks etc for my manager with a few smaller design projects but they’re few and far between. I feel like I’ve regressed into the typical intern again and my insecurities of the job role are making me feel like they’ll not want to keep me on after the 18 months - even though I’ve had multiple contract extensions and my manager says they’re in the process of bumping me up a pay grade and most likely offering a permanent contract. Although this was mentioned in feb and they’re still sorting it now apparently because the head of the department has to state my case to HR. I feel like now work has slowed down it might jeopardise this new contract.

Based on my previous interactions I'm expecting to receive job offers from both. However, I am particularly interested in one of the positions as it offers a significant career boost and a 30% higher salary compared to the other. The issue is that the more desirable interview is scheduled after the other one. 

What's the best way to manage a situation where I've received a job offer from the first company but would prefer to wait for a potential offer from the second, more preferred company? I want to ensure that I don't lose the initial opportunity if the second one doesn't end up giving me an offer, but I also want to avoid burning any bridges with the first by rejecting them after I've already accepted their offer if the second one does end up giving me an offer."

I have a Bachelor's and Master's with good grades from a Russel group uni but when i was looking for jobs last year it seemed nearly impossible for me to get a job in the field I wanted. i made it through most of the interview rounds but never got an offer the closest i got was between me and one other candidate. 

Ultimately I settled for a job that im semi-satisfied with in that im earning OK money and im actually doing EEE but its its not what i want to do longterm because the projects arent diverse enough and im not developing my skills much beyond PCB design and C/C++ coding. 

Ultimately im wondering if it would still be straightforward for me to enter into consulting and whether my skills would be valuable enough to a consultancy. 

I fear the longer i stay in this field the less likely it will be for me to break into consulting but i hope im wrong...

Other important points: 

When i was first applying for jobs it was 9 months after i got my MSc because i took time off as my dad died just before i graduated and i suspect that made employers skeptical. 

I also had no internship 

I have no professional connections or connections with former classmates"

I was told to start Tuesday and not Monday as Monday is busy and is payroll for a lot of people. During the conversation when the guy said it is monthly pay another manager guy chirped in and said ""you should get paid on the 25th"" 

Now I am a little confused on whether he meant the 25th of this month or next, the 25th of this month would be one week after I start, so do I get paid on week on the 25th or have to wait a month and a week for my first payment. To me, both scenarios make sense.

I will ask on Tuesday but at the moment am overthinking this as I am very low on money and can barely afford to eat at the moment, I am currently on Universal credit and get a payment on the 5th of May and just want an idea of how long I have to suffer. 

If anyone can give me their opinion it will be much appreciated. I am aware you cannot really say for certain but would like an idea if ok!

So currently, I am a college student that is currently working as an undergrad research assistant during the school year. I was planning on working this same job during the summer and even recently met with my professor to discuss work plans for the summer. However, I was even more recently offered a position at the county's board of engineers that falls more in line with what I would like to do post-graduation. Additionally, the pay is significantly higher as well ($14/hour vs 20$/hour). On top of all of this, I am taking 2 summer classes as well, of which the board of engineers job said they would allow me to come in only 3 days a week so that I can focus on my classes the other two days. My professor also allowed me to do the same schedule as well.

I really don't want to burn any bridges as the professor could be a really good reference for future employment, but I also would really like to earn more money this summer and also do stuff more in line with what I would actually like to do. I also want to ensure that I do well in my classes this summer. Any advice on what to do and has anyone experienced a situation like this before?"

i currently gain 2000$ per month by illegal works(not in world, but in Islamic laws it is illegal to bet) and have enough fund to create such a factory(at least with cheap prices of my country)

i also need possibility to sell them easily in markets like EU"

I am hoping to get another offer today for a completely different position/industry that I could possibly use to counter. I'm expecting around 50K with them, but they're not the right fit.

If that doesn't come through, I still want to negotiate, but I don't know if I'll be shooting myself in the foot. I am taking a training at my own expense (2.5K) which isn't completely necessary for the role I'll be doing, but I know it will be super helpful and *required* if I want to move up down the road, which I do. It looks like they cover these trainings for employees. Is negotiating to offset these expenses a good idea?

I focus on other stuff like culture, environment, tasks, hours worked, etc. I keep telling myself if I quit, I could give up something really good because right now my life is relaxed, but with parents getting older and inflation, this isn't a good salary for me.

I would make sure to have something lined up before quitting, of course. But I'm wondering if maybe my work place's culture isn't so rare. Any thoughts?"

My question is, should I mention this in the the next step of the interview process or should I just request reasonable accommodation when/if I'm hired? If I tell them before I'm hired, as good as a fit as I am for the position, that may sway them to choose another candidate just to avoid the bother.

I’ve been applying for jobs for about 4 months now, and I’ve been contacted by 3 recruiters from different agencies, and my experiences weren’t very positive, so the first recruiter,called me,I didn’t prick up wasn’t available, they left a voicemail, I called back later that day and no one picked up, I called the next day, left voicemails and nothing, waited 3 days and called again, then a week later and nothing,I assumed they figures someone else out for the position and just didn’t want to waste 5 seconds of their time to call me or send an e-mail letting me know I wasn’t “the right fit”… moving on, the second recruiter got me and interview, I went to the interview I answered all their questions,everyone was super nice, we laughed and talked about sports and so on, it went really well and they went as far as saying I was their prime candidate. 
They said they would be in touch, and well 3 months later no answer, a few days after the interview I sent a courtesy email asking if they needed any more info if everything was checking out,no answer, then a week later another email, then 2 weeks after the interview another email, always with no answer, at which point I just gave up. 

The third recruiter, sent me an email thanking me for applying, and asking to set up a meeting, I replied with my availability and if it worked out for them if not to let me know what worked best and we could figure something out. Well it’s been 3 weeks I sent 2 more emails in the mean time asking if they received my previous email,and what time worked best for a meeting and so on,but never got an answer…

Is this normal? Or am I doing something wrong here? Any help is appreciated"

So here's the deal: I'm a white guy. I'm actually 1/4 Jewish but as far as ethnic survey purposes I think I'm basically white. I don't know if diversity hiring policies make me less likely to get a job based on putting ""white guy"" on an application in today's market. 

Also, I have suffered from depression & anxiety. It's not something I'm currently struggling with but it is part of my history. I don't feel like talking about that with an employer and I don't require special accommodations, but it is one of the items on the list when you're checking the boxes so I could qualify as a yes.

So here are my options: disclose race/sex info and risk being left out of the candidate pool for not being ""diverse"" enough, and I can list the disability but I'm not sure if that works for or against me. Assistance is appreciated."

I'm currently 26 years old, have a bachelor's in accounting, CPA license, and have been working at a Big 4 accounting firm for going on 2.5 years now (1.5 as staff, promoted senior August 2022).

After my time at the firm, I'm heavily reconsidering my career path. I've really tried to stick it out to give it an ""honest effort"", try to learn my job, get used to the ups and downs, but it just doesn't feel right. Best way I can describe ""this feeling"" is like forcing yourself to do something that just doesn't make sense to you. Like, imagine joining a professionally dance team, not knowing how to dance, and them just telling you ""figure it out"" mid performance. That's the kind of anxiety this job gives me most days lol.

**Alternatives**

Going Public to Private is always an option, but really unsure if this would be any better, especially considering the pay cut it seems like.

I also own an LLC providing photo/video services. Before you say, ""well that explains why you're burned out"", this is realistically my ""hobby"". I just fortunately get paid to have fun and do that. I'm just not sure if I would get paid enough to replace a full-time salaried job honestly...

One of the things I struggle with most here honestly though is WFH. I do enjoy it, but I'm extremely\* extroverted and love talking to people. I actually applied for a ""recruitment internship"" during\* my accounting internship at the same firm (they said no lol).

So I've considered this route too.

I don't know honestly. Feeling very lost and confused as to where I should try to go to next."

 This week, I got some responses back from things I have applied to:

1.  Screening for Seasonal coordinator role
2.  Screening invitation for full time coordinator role at large entertainment company
3. Screening for full time assistant role at entertainment agency
4.Offer for seasonal remote customer service rep role

Out of all these responses, the one I want is choice 2, but it is the least concrete currently. I want to accept choice 4, so I can leave my current retail role. Choice 4  also doesn't start until May 22nd. Any advice on how to navigate? In my previous experience, the hiring process is dragged out when it comes to full time corporate roles. So it very well could be until late May until I have an idea of If I'll land option 2. I'm not used to getting this much responsiveness in my job search, so I'm pretty hype tbh. Also, any tips regarding getting past the phone screening for role 2? Role 2 has to do with ad standards and practices, if that helps. Thank you."

My boyfriend got accepted into a research internship at a hospital for this summer and was doing all the required paperwork and tests and today he got a positive result back for codeine. He is severely asthmatic and along with his prescription medicine he has been regularly taking otc zyrtec, robittusin, benadryl, ibuprofen, and tylenol for a solid 5 years. Just one of these could cause a false positive as they conatain dxm, but with all five it was the obvious cause and so we weren't worried. 

The hospital (presumedly) looked at his prescriptions, his otc meds, and the letter written by his doctor, and emailed back saying he would be let in as long as he complied with random drug tests, he agreed and planned to stop taking the meds I mentioned (not the smartest choice but he needed this internship). Thirty minutes later they email back saying that after further review, he will not be let back because robittusin will not cause a false positive and he needs to show a valid prescription containing codeine. They completely ignored all 4 other meds and the length of time he's been on them. 

We don't know what to do, I mean how do you prove that you don't do drugs when they're convinced that u do? There's so many studies that show antihistamines can cause false positives, and robitussin seemed like an obvious cause to me, but they didnt seem to want to believd anything unless it was a prescription. Maybe I'm in the wrong here and misunderstanding the drugs, please tell me if I am. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to fix this."

That being said, I’ll have at least 4.5 years of solid marketing experience by then, so I’m wondering what the best increase to ask for would be?

If there is any job that is entry level and doesn’t require a ton of experience in any industry, I am welcome to suggestions that are not in retail. Thank you all for your expertise and creative suggestions.

Edit: They are socially extroverted, but can be a bit awkward if they get on a tangent about hobbies or random issues. They struggle with connecting to people on a deeper level, but are extremely friendly, loyal, and kind hearted. They have general anxiety and panic attacks occasionally, which affects their performance sometimes. I am just worried they will not be able to make it on their own as they still are relying heavily on my parents which idk how long that can last. They love animals, and honestly I think they would benefit from being around them. They have worked in retail since we graduated in high school off and on, for the last 8 years. They cannot handle anything too technical, as it will overwhelm them and trigger a shutdown. Anything that is repetitive and simple would be best."

I had just surpassed the two year mark and was doing pretty well in the words of most of my superiors. Although, my luck had finally struck out and I felt the consequences of my actions.

Story goes like this:

I worked in fast food with a good friend of mine and most late nights in the kitchen we passed the time by testing different food combinations (Boss didn’t care if it was food getting thrown out at the end of the night). This particular night we were trying out a chili that called for bacon grease. So, my nunbskull self was collecting said grease in a paper soup cup I left lying about. Couple minutes later one of our co-workers (minor) came up and spilt it on themself, burning their arm (nothing severe, no worker’s comp). Of course you can probably guess how it went. Boss was pretty unhappy that I created a hazardous environment and terminated my employment, which I completely understand. I left on probably the best terms in this situation, with my boss expressing that he had no other choice and even adding I could always reapply.

Anyway, I’m not looking to defend my actions or justify them. I know I was an IDIOT, and entirely accountable for them getting hurt. I also know any employer presented with this situation would do the same, but that’s not why I’m here.

I’ve been looking at position after position in my area that interests me, and I have been unable to find anything that fits or that doesn’t require prior experience. I’m really not looking to lie on an application or during an interview, but the reasoning behind my termination doesn’t really attract future employers.

What’s the best advice for someone in my situation?"

Basically I just want a job where I can sit down or move around when I’m feeling bored and there’s no one around, and I don’t want anyone micromanaging. Not getting snapped at for being on my phone would be great too, I haaaaaaaate that grrr

1,2023-04-15,Plumber or electrician?,u/SamSamTheHighwayMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12mtpc2/plumber_or_electrician/,jobs,"Hello everyone,

Need some advice. I am 36 and I work in construction as a 'Lagger' (thermal insulation engineer) and I'm looking to re-skill/upskill to either a plumber or an electrician and I am literally 50/50, however I don't have long to enrol onto the course.

So for a bit of context I did almost complete my level 2 plumbing 5 years ago but had to drop out of evening class because my wife fell pregnant. So I have basic plumbing knowledge already, so really the question is whether I should utilise what I already know and turn it into a career or go down the electrician route as it could be more lucrative?

Appreciate a lot of responses might be from you fellas across the pond, as I'm in the UK, but I am still interested in your take. At the moment, as an unqualified lagger I make £175 a day. Which isn't the best, but nor is it that bad considering I don't have qualifications for it. Ultimately whatever trade I choose I'll likely go commercial, and I'll eventually want my day rate to exceed what I'm on now as much as possible otherwise there isn't much point in reskilling.

Your advice is super welcome!"

3658,2023-04-15,I've interviewed and hired hundreds of people.,u/therealpicard,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12n00ua/ive_interviewed_and_hired_hundreds_of_people/,jobs,"I stumbled across this channel and read some of the posts and it occurred to me that there are a lot of questions and opinions being floated but I haven't seen any actionable advice. I have seen some bad advice. 

First: Who am I? I work these days in technology but I've been a carpenter, I've worked in the marine industry as a boat captain and various scut work jobs, Ive been a graphic designer, and I have been a Product Management leader for 25+ years with VP, SVP and CPO titles. I've worked at huge companies, mid-sized companies and I've founded four companies, two of which I was the CEO. 

So at the risk of pontificating, I thought I'd share some thoughts:

First: People are looking for coworkers - meaning people who they like, who are at the same level of *competence* as the rest of the team (not experience), who get things done, who are reliable, and who are creative problem solvers. Even at unsophisticated jobs, being a creative problem solver is a huge plus. You have to come across as likable. And ideally you want the interviewer to start rooting for you to be successful. 

So how do you do that? You have to arrive at an interview ready to tell stories that capture the interviewer's attention and illustrate your value. Most interviewers are not good at interviewing, so you need to help them along. 

These days I screen for 4 things when I hire.  I believe these things are universally desirable and necessary in order to be successful at any job: Grit, Integrity, Empathy and Creativity. 

I believe that if you can exhibit and illustrate these four traits in an interview, you have a much better chance of being hired.  So what do these things mean, and how do you illustrate them?

1. Grit:  this is the ability to get a task or project done, even if you run into obstacles. You need to illustrate that you have initiative, that you can identify and solve problems that are blocking you (sometimes this means asking for help, especially if you're junior), but mostly it means you keep on trying even if things get hard. 

So have a story queued up that you can use to illustrate your grit. Tell a story about a really hard problem you had to solve. Summarize the background, explain what obstacles you ran into, and how you solved them. For a first job or if you're junior (1-3 years) telling a story that isn't work related is okay.  Or a situation where you recognized a problem beyond your skill level and escalated to get help from your boss or a senior colleague, and then completed the project. Sometimes showing that you're a team player and that you have the humility to ask for help is better than struggling alone. However, if you're more senior, showing that you know how to get things done independently is probably more important.

2. Integrity: Are you trustworthy and reliable? Illustrate that you have integrity by telling about a time you had a moral or ethical quandary and had to make the hard decision to do the right thing. Or if you're brave, a time you did the wrong thing but learned from that failure. To be clear, I'm not talking about a time you made a mistake, I'm talking about the time you failed, the time you did the wrong thing, you knew it, you made the decision, and faced some consequences. Of course it's important that if you go down that path that your focus is on what you learned and why you won't make that mistake again. This can be really important if you have anything in your background that could become visible through a simple social media search or background check. Showing vulnerability in an interview, especially around integrity, can be the thing that gets an interviewer to start rooting for your success. 

3. Empathy: This is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, walk around, see things from their perspective, and make decisions based on that insight. I would tell a story about a time when you struggled to work with someone else, perhaps you didn't even like that person, perhaps you disliked that person. But then you suddenly had an insight into why they were acting the way they were, or what was driving them, you developed a sense of empathy for them, and were able to work through the issues. Maybe you forged a great relationship, or maybe you just found a way to get by with a difficult coworker. Either way this will illustrate empathy and the ability to collaborate with people even if they are difficult.

4. Creativity: This one is a bit trickier. When I interview candidates, I ask a question designed to elicit a story about creativity. So be careful about how you interject this in the conversation. Tell a story about a time you figured out a solution to something difficult in a creative way, maybe talking about a business you started, even something as simple as a lawnmowing business as a kid or a project you did at church or a summer project.  I ask the person to tell me an idea they've had for a company or a product or a nonprofit or service and what is exciting about it to them. Then I ask them to think through several aspects of the idea and expand on it until they finally either prove that they can think things through and to end, or they run into a wall at some point. Either way, it's very illuminating as an interviewer.

I hope this is helpful. Just remember, hiring managers are looking for team members. They're figuring out if they like you as well as if you're qualified. So it's really important that you let them look at you, the real you, so they can assess you for who you actually are. I've Filled people out of an interview process because they were too guarded and weren't letting me get to know them.

One last thing. As much as you are being interviewed, you should be interviewing them. Show up with good questions, do research about the company before you show up, and have a good reason for why you want to work there. If you discover that you don't like the people interviewing you , find out if they are someone you will have to work with every day or if they are not someone you will work with every day. It may not be worth it to take the job if you don't like the people."

0,2023-04-15,About to go back to a former employer for a job fair/interview. What do I say when they ask why I left?,u/CakesNGames90,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12n1f6h/about_to_go_back_to_a_former_employer_for_a_job/,jobs,"Rather, “if” they ask.  Some people in HR know why I left.

I was a teacher here for 3 years, and I graduated from this school district in 2008.  I never wanted to quit my job there.  I loved it there.  When I was hired, I had in my mind I was never going to leave.

But then my brother, who I also attended this district with, who was a year older than me, who was in the same building I taught in with me as kids, shot and killed himself in May 2021.

The 2021-2022 school year was then riddled with poor attendance, panic attacks in my classroom (that’s where I got the panicky call from my mom that he was being weird and she couldn’t find him), remembering I could’ve stopped him because I found him alive, flashbacks to hearing the gunshot and finding him deceased.  I ended up taking a leave of absence for the second half of the year.

I took a one year job at another company and now that this job is ending, I’m looking for another job.  I haven’t had any interviews in the 3 months I’ve sent out applications.  But I always wanted to come back to this school district if given the chance.

I know whoever I talk to is going to see I graduated from here and that I worked here on my resume.  They’re going to want to know why I left if they don’t already.  And I don’t really know how to answer this without going into detail.  What do I say?  How can I word it in a professional manner?

My attendance at my current workplace is fine.  I was absent for a week with COVID and took a few days for pregnancy appointments, but otherwise, attendance is good."

So I’ve seen this firsthand how hard it is to look for a new job.

I’m a founder hoping to solve this problem… and one thing we hear over and over again from candidates looking for a new job is: “It feels like its a full time job in itself”

Imagine being a software developer with a full time job that decides to look for a new opportunity. 

You spend your whole day working, 
But then you have to go home to apply to 10-15 jobs/ day, 
Then you have to do 4-5 tech assignments for interview screenings,
Then you have to do 5-6 round interviews with several companies, 
Then you have to negociate compensation…

All while making sure your current job doesn’t find out so they don’t fire you

Imagine how stressful it is for the developer. They rather just stay at their shitty jobs. 

And companies don’t benefit either, they’re under tight deadlines and immense pressure too. 

The way hiring is done NEEDS to change. It shouldn’t feel like a job itself."

But I always read through them and am shocked with just how much preparation some people are putting into what sometimes amounts to 30 minutes of standard questions from potential future co-workers. 

Am I the only one that prefers to go into interviews with a clear mind, without rehearsed lines that I would fumble over trying to recall? Not to say that if it was a super specialized role that I wouldn’t at least brush up on a particular topic. But I know my work experience. I know the roles and responsibilities I’ve performed. 

I personally feel like it’s easier for me to just naturally answer questions in an interview without it being a generic response. It also gives me the ability to “go with the flow” of the interview and oftentimes go way off course because I answered a question one way that opened up an entirely new path for the interview to go. And had I rigorously prepared for the interview to go 1,2,3 I never would have been able to fluently and naturally just went off course.

I can’t be the only one right? And fwiw this has worked for me. And worked well. I’m just myself. Nothing more. Nothing less. But my potential employers leave knowing exactly who I am and I feel like that leaves little doubt about what I can actually do in the role I’m applying for."

10,2023-04-15,What has working or finding work with a medical condition or disability been like for you?,u/WhitePinoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12n7ql0/what_has_working_or_finding_work_with_a_medical/,jobs,"I'm a 25 year old junior architectural draftsman who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer the previous year and learned just this year I also have an autoimmune disease (sjorgens with spinal arthritis). 

I chose architecture as my major, because I am a creative and I've always loved math, but also because I wanted to have a financially comfortable life. I wanted to be an animator and producer, but I guess I've shelved that now.

During my first year of college, I had immediate second thoughts about the profession. Doing all-nighter almost every single day, my body eventually gave out by my 3rd year and I barely scraped by any classes afterwards but still graduated somehow, while unknowingly having cancer.

Graduating was not easy either. I graduated into 2020 and I couldn't find a job. I was released from a brief internship with another company from a toxic boss and struggled to find work. I freelanced as an artist throughout 2020 and most of 2021, but that wasn't as fruitful as having a job. 

In late 2021, I worked for an engineering firm, and I was having issues which pissed off my boss. My boss was a micromanager who wanted things done right the ""first time"", when I am generally new into this profession  and need more time to grow. I was also having concentration issues, depression, anxiety and I didn't know why. 

When I told my boss I might have a medical condition and I was being tested, he let me go a few weeks later and told me that it was because I didn't have enough experience. They also let go another coworker that was experiencing issues at work as well months prior. To tell you the truth the firm had nice people, but unrealistic standards on some workers in my opinion. I stayed there for a total of 8 months.

I jumped around quite a bit. As soon as I was diagnosed I was told I have growth, which was later confirmed to be cancer. I was struggling to find more work and got recruited into this company near where I live that needed a CAD draftsman. I told them that I was going to have surgery by the end of the month and asked if that was a deal-breaker for them. They still hired me on. Near my surgery date I told them I needed a week to recover. My recruiter company then contacted me on the weekend to tell me that I'm being let go because a ""former employee who was on vacation is coming back full time and my services would no longer be needed"". They still had a new job opening for my position months later online.

I then quickly found another job where my boss had an issue with me leaving work early for a short doctor's visit. He told me that as a business for profit that my attendance was vital to the company and asked me if I had anything going on, to which I declined to prevent potential discrimination. 

I worked my ass off for an entire month and was forced to work OT. All my coworkers appreciated my help, and told me that I was nice and a great addition to the team. By the end of the month, my employer told me that I wasn't a good fit, because I'm not able to work independently or without a lot of assistance from other coworkers. After I left the company, my coworkers were shocked and confused and told me that I was very helpful. 

Months later, I'm working with their competitor and the environment is much more healthier with less OT and less drama. The problem now is it's 1.5 hours away to the office. I help architects make drafts for schools in California. I also have a second contract job where I'm helping a construction manager remodel and renovate homes. 

I have two jobs because I cannot afford to pay for medical bills without it. Now every weekend I feel pretty exhausted, but at least I don't have to worry about debt. 

I'm very grateful for my new jobs because I can afford things I previously could have never did. I'm also experiencing less issues with my employer badgering me about my performance or issues with my health. I am going to be undergoing radiation therapy soon, and my employer is doing all they can to accomodste for me.

(requirements, company, resume, etc.)",u/inspektor_eel,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12n86ng/for_those_who_used_to_not_get_interviews_but_are/,jobs,"I currently do not have a job after having to quit my previous one due to poor management and have only been reached back out to by scams. To be frank, I'm burned out and discouraged and now I'm thinking there may be something wrong with my approach to applying to jobs. So I wanted to ask people who used to be in my position the question in the title since I feel like there must be something I'm doing inherently wrong to not even get an interview.

For context: I've applied to nearly 250 entry-level jobs that deal with data (data entry, data analyst, administrative assistant, data associate, etc.), something I have been doing (myself, not in a job setting since that sometimes matters) for over 7 years. I lack a college degree due to having to withdraw due to a disability. I live in a town of 2100 people with mainly blue collar jobs, something I cannot do due to the same disability. I also cannot move to a new place since I do not have the financial means anymore.

Any and all advice is appreciated since I really want to feel like I'm contributing in some way again."

My current company was acquired recently and I knew this was coming for a while. Initial plan was to not retain any employees in my department. So, I was proactively applying elsewhere to make sure I had a job when the sale closed. Last week I accepted an offer (offer 1) from a company in a full time technical Consulting role for a 17% raise total comp. 
Earlier this past week I was contacted by a friend who referred me to a job at her company I went through 4 rounds of interviews and expecting an offer Monday (offer 2) - I expect the offer to match the salary of the first offer I received. Today at the last hour o received an offer (offer 3) from the buyer of my company with the same title and salary. 
All offers are perm Remote jobs 

Here’s my dilemma 

Offer 1: Technical consultant role
- This would sort of be a step back in responsibilities since it’s an individual contributor role with no direct reports .. Doesn’t necessarily align with my long term career path since I always envisioned myself to be in Tech Leadership roles. 
- I already accepted this offer since it was the one I had in hand.
- I never worked as a consultant before (I’d be working with external clients) 
- money is great benefits are pretty amazing 
- boss seems to be a good leader
- well established company with amazing reviews on Glassdoor.
- same time zone 
- working as part of a larger team of consultants. 
- If I back out I’ll likely burn bridges 

Offer 2: IT+ Sec Engineer role 
- Step back in title (non managerial)
- Decently established startup
- Would be the sole IT person supporting around 100+ individuals 
- referred by a friend who will be my direct manager (don’t want to burn bridges with her)
- Opportunity to learn a lot of new technologies I did not have previous experience with - But also major imposter syndrome 
- Salary will likely be the same as Offer 1 
- Benefits seem pretty good 
- Sounds like good work/life balance even though I’m worried cuz I’ll be the only IT person. 
- 3 hour time difference - which might mean I’ll have to work into the night hours sometimes. 

Offer 3: current leadership role 
- I know the environment 
- Gaining more responsibilities and potentially leading a bigger team. 
- get to report to my current boss who I know and respect
- Comfort equals complacency 
- benefits aren’t the best 
- salary would be the same (so lower than both the other jobs) 
-Aligns with my current career path
- really good people on the team
- same time zone I’m in
- really good work/life balance

So I don’t know what to do I have to make a decision by Monday. 

Please help!"

1. The places you are applying for is oversaturated with applicants... Nothing you can do about that.
2. You are applying to places and you are woefully underqualified... Can't gain experience without a job nothing you can do about that right now.
3. Your resume is lacking keywords or has keywords in it that is automatically rejecting you.... You should fix that...

I had a friend who was familiar with most application software, And I was complaining to him about not getting any replies to my applications. He asked to see my resume so I sent it to him... Turns out not only was my file format bad for automatically resume parsing. (Pdf) it was also formatted in a way that it couldn't be read from easily by the machines. 

Spend some time reformatting it with his help changing some words around making certain job description sound more professional. It didn't change much, but now I had docx to send around.

After doing so I started getting a lot more replies and getting interviews.


TLDR. If your scratching your head while you're not getting replies maybe your resume needs to be optimized."

We live in a small town (10k) with a couple big manufacturing companies that employ most of the surrounding communities.    


We're both employed by the same one of those companies.  The issue is that I absolutely love my job.  I thoroughly enjoy what I do, it keeps me engaged and I get paid very well (for where I live).

&#x200B;

I would be willing to leave my job, IF I can find similar work that pays well.  I'm hoping by posting here, someone will have an idea of what jobs I should look for.

&#x200B;

When people ask what I do, this is how I explain it:

""I work for a large window and door company.  I build the machines that the production workers use to make the windows and doors. We've got in-house designers that will design a machine to satisfy a need, then they send the blueprints to us, where we build it, test run it, then install it into production.  The job also allows me to travel to a few different states for work.  Basically a custom machine building service.  My main duties include assembling the machines and troubleshooting/problem solving, but am skilled at welding, running mills/lathes, and painting. Each machine we build is a new design. Very rarely do we build duplicates.""

&#x200B;

I'm sure I could find a job in another factory doing production work, but I need to have something that keeps me engaged and challenged. I've done production work, and it is \*not\* for me. 

&#x200B;

In the county I reside, the median individual income is 34k.  My job pays 68k minimum, with plenty of opportunities for overtime/travel pay. Last year I earned 98k (lots of overtime and travel).

&#x200B;

Any ideas on what type of jobs I should look for that I would enjoy?"

1,2023-04-15,Different Perspective: I've held many jobs in my life and I'd put my interview success rate at over 75%,u/TrapHouseinSMemphis,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12nhkg1/different_perspective_ive_held_many_jobs_in_my/,jobs,"This is a follow up to u/therealpicard and his/her post about interviewing hundreds of people.  I saw a lot of positivity in the comments, but also a ton of negativity.  By the time I wanted to comment the thread had so many comments and I thought I had a perspective that was unique, so I wanted to start a discussion from the opposite perspective of them.

This is an unstructured post because the other one really sparked some thoughts.  This may get buried, and if so I just spent a great deal of time writing, something of which I enjoy and will hopefully benefit me in the future.

I have held a few jobs since I started working in 2008.  I've had to navigate the recession as well as the transition from applying to places in person to online.  I often ace interviews, many times with no foot in the door.  I've gotten good jobs in new cities where I know absolutely no one.  I'm not tall, I don't think I'm good looking, and my skillset is not great.  I've had people say they've taken a risk on me even when someone more experienced has applied for the same job.  I do have priveleges of which I am aware and unaware, so bear with me on that.  I'm a fully functioning person, and without tooting my own horn too much, I do think I'm decently intelligent. Those things don't hurt.

I'll follow that with saying I have all sorts of issues.  The reason I'm so good at interviewing is because I can't keep a job.  I've had over 35.  I don't get fired, I just get bored and quit.  I'm pretty sure I'm ADHD (can't manage to make myself go to the doctor to get the diagnosis), and it's led to a ton of impulsive reckless behavior.  You certainly can read that and take it as a reason to write me off.  I get it, I'm not the most put together person.  But I do know how to get a job.  I'm usually pretty stunned when I interview for a position and don't get it, unless it was an obvious disaster.

We relocated in November to a new place, I've had two jobs here already.  One I left because we settled about an hour commute away from the office I was gonna work at.  The other was because it was a bad fit.  Since then I've been pretty selective.  Right now I have two jobs I'm deciding between, and one that I interviewed for Friday that I thought went well.

I have a degree in accounting.  I went back to school in 2019, graduated in 2022, got my first corporate job my second to last semester.  I quit that job in July of 2022.  That's the last time I held a job for more than 6 months.  Before my job I worked in warehouses doing shit work.  Many of my other jobs have been in various industries that I tried and didn't want to do.

If I could give one piece of (unsolicited, I'm well aware) advice it's to **not care**.  Not psychologically trick yourself into not caring, I mean really don't care.  What will happen if you don't get the job?  Are you going to die?  Maybe, maybe you will.  I don't know your life, but I'd bet you not getting a job is not the difference between life or death.  I believe in my heart that if that were the case, most people will work it out.  You wouldn't be trying to find a great job, you'd be working whatever shit shift at the local drunks watering hole, bussing tables, doing dishes, etc. just to make a buck.  People on this forum might be in that situation, but from what I've read many people on here are just tired.  Tired of feelng like they don't have the upper hand.  Tired of feeling like they have to put on the fake face to appease someone they probably will hate in 3 weeks.  Tired of feeling like the system is corrupt for whatever political stance they may have.  And all of those feelings are valid, but they don't help you get a job. 

So let's go back.  What's going to happen if you don't get it?  You'll be fine.  Likely.  You might not be settled on anxiety, but you'll be alright.  Go down the rabbit hole if you have to.  You got this interview, I bet you can get another.  Maybe it'll take a while, but I bet this won't be the last interview of your life.  And if it is, I'd say you have bigger problems.  If the world has gotten so bad that people are roaming the streets looking for work and interviews are worth gold, you have bigger issues.  We all do.

I don't know about you, but by the time the interview is there, I just want it over.  I start thinking about that feeling of relief when it's over.  That feeling of, ""cool, I did it.  I went to the interview.  I'm going to treat myself by binging a show."" Or, if you can't treat yourself in the moment, treat yourself whenever you can.  You did a good thing!  You tried!  That's all that matters.

And more importantly, **you literally can't do anything other than trying**.  You're not in control of most things most of the time and that's fine.  Nobody can take away you trying.

So, say you do all those things but you're like ""But I can not care all I want, it's hard for me to fake it.  I just want money!""

They know that.  They know you're there for money.  The other thread had great suggestions, and I'd be inclined to listen to them for practical application, but allow me to talk more abstractly on some of those concepts.  Do you have anyone in your life that likes you?  That thinks you're a fun person?  That brings out a side of you that's real?  Talk to the interviewer like you talk to them.  Just be you.

""Being You"" does not mean to let it fly and drop the F bomb.  It means to know who you are, understand that your main focus is to get a job that works for you, and then shut it down and listen to the other person.  Just listen to them, and respond like the person you are.  u/therealpicard said it best, they are looking for someone to work with whom they don't want to shove a bat down their throat.  I understand being buttoned up and trying to win the interview.  The thing is, you can't win a conversation with another person when it isn't a debate or argument, and treating the interviewer like an adversary will never work.  You're talking to them, they are talking to you.  Let them know you are a real person.  If you don't get the job because you were yourself (again, not unfiltered.  Just yourself), you dodged a bullet.  I know, doesn't feel like dodging a bullet when you need money, but your life will hopefully be long.  You aren't Walter White with inoperable lung cancer, you don't need to storm Tuco's office and blow the windows off the place. 

Listen to what they are saying and respond.  Relate back to your past position.  I don't even wait for questions in my interviews.  If they bring up something that's relevant to my experiences, I WAIT FOR THEM TO FINISH TALKING, and then calmly explain why I understand what they're saying and how my past relates to that.  Here's one example:

Interviewer: Well, right now we are having issues with one of our systems, the data transfer was supposed to happen but IT is working on something else.

Me: Oh, that's the worst.  When I was at COMPANY, our IT team seemed like they were awol for a month fixing Salesforce issues.  Luckily a lot of our work was done in Excel.

In what is probably a 30 second timeframe you've shown that you can relate to them and have empathy for their situation, those technical issues wouldn't be too much of a hindrance, you have experience in Salesforce, and you're well versed in Excel more than most other programs.

This isn't lying and this isn't trying to say the right thing.  It's talking to another person about your experiences.  If you are just sick of it, I understand.  I've literally been in an interview in a bad mood, someone asked me the stupid fucking behavioral questions, and I thanked them for their time because I just didn't have it in me.  It happens and I know how much this entire process is shit.  But as much as it's shit, I do like getting job offers.

I know a lot of this sounds hippy dippy and overly positive, which is not what people who are coming up empty on the job search are, but negativity, while it has it's place, will only rob you of your objectives here.  And you can cuss at me and call me a bitch, or ignore the post (I've already accepted that may happen), and if you do I hope it lets out any anger or negativity you might carry to the interview.  Because I'd be willing to bet when you go into an office fully appreciative of who you are and what you bring to the table, you'll get the job most of the time."

After a week, on April 2nd, I went in and inquired about my application and to see if we could set up an interview. I told them my name, they said they had me on the list to call, but when they checked the list they didn’t have my name or number down, so they asked for it again. 

I took that as, at least they knew my name, right? But then I was thinking that maybe they wouldn’t have even thought about calling me until I went in. Not sure. Anyway.

I have not got a call yet, and their website still says my application is “under consideration”. The manager did say they were really busy and didn’t have much time to get interviews set up. But it’s been 2 weeks since I went in? I feel like that’s plenty of time to call and set an interview up. 

I was thinking about calling (only time I have to go in I’d be in my current works uniform, feel weird doing that lol), but should I just give up? I don’t know if it’d be annoying or show determination. I just really want this job 😭

Please give me advice 🙏"

I am currently a nursing student and am looking into medical assistant jobs for the summer so I can supplement my family's income while I'm not in school. I've been a DoorDash/Uber driver for the past five years, but I've also worked a handful of jobs in service industry as well over the last few years. I am excited to redo my resume with all of the volunteering and experiences I've had.

My issue comes with one particular employer that I sued for sexual harassment a couple of years ago. I'm not sure if I should include the employment experience, as I know that it's possible for future employers to see that I had won a lawsuit against them anyway. Would it look bad if I left it off or kept it on? I only ask because I feel like saying I've been only doing DoorDash and Uber since 2020 doesn't look super impressive, but I mainly care about preventing any major gaps in my employment history. I don't want to look dishonest either.

I previously served in NAS JRB Fort Worth for five years on Active Duty. After completing my service, I moved back to Las Vegas, but I've found that I miss Fort Worth and my old job, so I have decided to return to the area in early July. I'll be rejoining the military as a Reservist with an E5 paygrade.

I'm close to finishing my bachelor's degree in business management, which I expect to complete by the end of May this year. Also, I plan to begin my master's in business management with a concentration in public administration starting in September.

In terms of accommodations, I've already arranged to stay with a friend (been friends with him for five years) for $750 per month. My primary focus now is securing employment. I've considered working for companies like Raytheon or Lockheed, and I've also explored job opportunities at the Fort Worth and Dallas city halls.

I would appreciate any recommendations for job hunting in the DFW area, particularly for positions such as Project Coordinator, Human Resources Specialist, Operations Coordinator, or Administrative Assistant. Ideally, I'm looking for administrative roles. However, my military background is as a maintainer (with three years of supervisory experience), and I've spent six months working as a Warehouse Manager at Tesla. Currently, I volunteer as a Disaster Action Team Member for the Red Cross and I'm unemployed (although I'm a full-time student at the moment). Given my experience, I understand that transitioning to administrative roles might be challenging, but I hope that my education will help me stand out to potential employers.

Any advice or suggestions from the community would be greatly appreciated!

As a background, I am a partly qualified accountant with around 5 years of work experience ( Auditing including Big 4, Fund Accounting). I don't really mind jobs like bookkeeping or data entry but I am finding only those within US and I am from a third world country.

2,2023-04-15,"I have been jobless for about 3 months now and finally caught a(n un)lucky break. The problem is there are many constraints that prevent me from keeping this job longer than a month. Should I take the job and quit a month later, or be very direct to my employer at the risk of losing the offer?",u/thatp,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12nif32/i_have_been_jobless_for_about_3_months_now_and/,jobs,"Here are some important things to know before I give the spiel and ask the question:

\- My job can be easily done remotely.

\- The job in question is a contract opportunity, meaning I'll be working for a consulting company contracted out to this company.

\- I have actively searched for mostly remote jobs, but very few on-site jobs due to the nature of my situation.

\- there are some potential remote jobs but the process is very long and unpredictable, so it's nice to have something somewhat secured.

\- I have quite a bit of expenses and even more coming up due to family reasons.

&#x200B;

The situation:

I recently interviewed for a position at a well-known company, which explicitly stated that they want some one on-site every day. I was a bit skeptical that I would even get the job offer, but I figured I would try anyway since it's good interview experience. Throughout the entire interview process they made it clear that they would like their employees to be on-site every day. This is not much of a problem; I don't mind the commute, and I like going into the office. 

The problem is, in a month from now, due to wifey reasons, I will move to a new state, where tech jobs are few and far between, hence why I've been searching for remote roles. (i am open to on-site, they just have to be near my new location, which is hard to find). The other problem is, I'm desperate for income at the moment so I'd take anything I'd get my hands on, and I still haven't managed to successfully close a remote opportunity. 

&#x200B;

I really didn't think I'd get this far at the company in question, but they ended up extending an offer, so here is my dilemma:

1. Do I say nothing, quit a month later, and burn bridges with a really good company with enviable perks?
2. Do I be up-front about the situation with my recruiters (who may or may not even pass the information along to the client company)?
3. Do I just do my best and gradually bring up my situation to my employers and hope for the best? I still have to quit in a month but they could potentially allow me to work remotely for a little while (which I highly doubt).

&#x200B;

Greatly appreciate any advice that's thrown my way. I realize this may not have enough details, so I'll edit as I see fit."

I am in Tech industry since quite sometime. Have seen small Bully (business) startups and also in some fortune 500 biz before but that was in 2006-08 and at mid-management levels (something similar financial economy though).

I now work as FT employee for a Canadian FinTech company (biz and esp parent biz has strong rules and compliance workplace bully courses and brand themselves in twitter, magazines ""Great Place to Work""). I witnessed my associate bullied me when we worked together sometime ago. He has upper hand and my manager and management relies on his expertise and has quite know-how of biz and tech rules. When he bullied me I kind a ignored him (I am quite patient in personality level). But this guy somehow is jealous (not sure if he saw my earning stats or what) for no reason and always gaslight me up if I say or write something incorrect in project management comment boards or emails or teams call.

He bad mouthed to my manager and other mid-managers like PMs, IT Director, and my manager kinda messed with me sometime back because of him. The manager is on extended leave, this guy is filling the manager's seat and now he has power to mess with me. I see him starting to mess with me with formal shitty complains of not filling timesheet in a day, poor work quality (he frames my activity and then blames me) and blah blah blah and putting it through my Performance improvement docs with warning to fire me. I do see I will be fired shortly because of him.

I did complain in writing to HR with written evidences about his bully but their response as ""it wasn't bully"" and have taken my manager's side (which wasn't surprising to me). 

I am quite senior in industry and age (indirectly) hurts in Tech industry for non-management roles. It will also get difficult to get any reference from here because of this situation.

Everything was good then my friend told me there was an open spot in his company doing garage doors, joined with the promise training would be done in 2-3mo and I'd be making \~$200+/day. Business slowed in a month and I got laid off, and since then(3mo ago) I've been lost.

I really just want a job I'll be able to stay at for more than a year with some sort of incentive to work and progression, I want to feel like I'm learning and getting things done. Most of the jobs I've tried don't give a sh#t about new employees and just see me as disposable, when I ask for training or progression they don't even feel the need to reply.

I enjoy being analytical, investigating things, troubleshooting as a network installer, studied IT in college for 2yrs, enjoy working with technology, electronics, working independent preferably, seeing new places. Interested in business/economics/finance, IT, cybersec, web design. Skills wise I have good communication skills when needed, have skills with power tools, construction basics, some networking/cabling specific skills(Cisco),

I've applied to a variety of jobs, mostly IT support, remote and in person, remote customer support jobs, some trades, security installer, delivery positions, I'm just trying to get in a decent job where I can make money($23+/hr) to save for future education, learn skills or at least feel useful. I might go back into my console repair business if I can't find the right job.

I feel stuck and don’t know what to do. I work at a company doing retail sales. When I was hired on about 3 months ago the DM told me that he wanted to train me to be a manager as quickly as possible. He said that as long as I perform well my first 2 months then he would move me into a management role. So far,  I have met or exceeded all goals I have been given.

 I have learned a lot and the DM has told me that he wants me to move up asap many times. Where the issue lays is my store manager. He has told my DM (while I’m around) that I need more training on the admin side of being a manager before he moves me into management.  That’s all fine and dandy, but my manager and I never work together. We are a very small team. Less than 5 with only one manager. 

When my manager and I do work together he spends most of his time on the phone talking to other store managers. When I have overheard conversations, most of them are unrelated to work. My SM also leaves early nearly every day I work with him. He schedules himself to a certain time and will leave about 2-4 hours early. To add to this I am asked to cover for him about 3 times a week. When speaking with a coworker regarding my management training, I was told “(Manager) said that you call him to ask questions too much when he’s not here”. This is NOT the story I have been told by my SM or DM. 

Another day I overheard him saying to another SM  “I’m gonna find an excuse to leave early” and then 20 minutes later come and say “My girlfriend got in a car crash and I need to help her”. I feel like I’m m being lied to constantly (I could tell many more stories about catching lies). On top of all this, when we went to hire a new salesperson recently there were very concerning comments made. He said “The only people applying are chicks. They just bring too much drama to work and I don’t want to deal with that. What do you think?” I said, “Well, I don’t care what gender someone is, if they’re qualified and have a personality that will mesh well then I would say they are a good fit.”

We ended up hiring a female (our only female employee at this store). Recently, my female coworker said that it feels like the manager won’t talk to her or give her feedback on how she is doing.  In fact, she said that since he isn’t there very much that it feels like I’m the manager more than him. She feels like I am treated much better because I’m a man. And quite frankly, I agree. He constantly asks what I think of her. Almost like he is trying to find a reason to get rid of her. I should mention that she is crushing her goals on her first month. 

What should I do in this scenario? I want to talk to my manager, but I feel like it would hurt my promotion chances. I also feel like going to the DM will result in me losing my job for going over my manager’s head."

The near-constant busy-ness, constant phone calls, etc. is getting to me and making me physically/mentally drained almost all the time. The only way for me to escape is by hiding in one of the back rooms; but of course, I can't do that for long.

I'm not really able to get quiet time to recharge at home either, as my dad has a goffin cockatoo who screams a lot. My parents have made it clear that they won't be re-homing him, so I'm stuck with it.

I got a tech-related position at WF and signed the offer letter and started the background check in Cisive. There were no questions regarding my work history where my last position at another bank asked for it so Cisive could verify it. I had to get my fingerprinting done and my offer letter is contingent on the background check and relevant docs for an I-9, but it seems like they're not checking my work history, is this a correct assumption? I fibbed a tiny bit in which changed a job title that my previous manager was working on processing before I ultimately left. Will they eventually ask for references, or am I basically in the clear and I'm just waiting for the background check to go through which is just checking criminal history + a credit check?"

I have passed everything except the work history. It was self employment for two companies I ran. I learned valuable skills running both companies which pertain to my future job. The problem is that since the companies didn’t make enough I was not required to incorporate them or file taxes and the only proof I have is a spreadsheet of all the transactions from the last year from eBay sales which I have submitted to them. Sadly it is taking a while for me to get an answer on whether this is enough information or not and I have become very worried I might not get this job which I’m very excited about.  One of the things they list as acceptable proof is “Statements of Earnings” Does anyone know if this will suffice?

I have my bachelor's degree and masters degree and in my current role I make about 105k annually + a bonus. My current role maxes out at about 107k so I'm almost at the top for this position. I can sometimes get overtime as well.

Does this seem like a good salary to people out there in Reddit land? 

I live in California in the San Francisco Bay area. Rent for my 1br apartment is $2000. 

I think because I surround myself with peers who are similarly driven, and who always seem to be getting higher jobs and better roles, I find that I'm comparing myself to them and sometimes it makes me feel like I'm not doing as well as my peers. But then I also recognize sometimes that I could very well be considered a high earner by many people. I'm just wondering what insight others can provide to me. It's exhausting always trying to do more and more, you know? Also I wouldn't consider my job to be stressful, but it is outward facing and I interact with people everyday all day and I don't necessarily like that; I'm more of an introverted person naturally and it can be a bit taxing."

So I asked the management woman how many hours a week that would be, she responded 30 and so I said then 30 hours a week. Well everything was fine for the first two weeks but I found out a couple of days ago that I was scheduled for 12-6:30 (4/16/23) instead of my normal 12-6. I saw that they don't include the 30 minute lunches I get so every day I've been working is actually a 5.5 hour day, instead of 6 hours for 5 days a week, it's 27.5. It's not a big deal to me that I am working less than what I originally wanted, but I do have an issue with working more because I told her that this is my schedule and I can't do earlier than 12 or later than 6 (for reasons relating to school and my parents bringing me to work).

I said I’ll call you back in two weeks because I am determined to learn the la gauge that fast. 

MY QUESTION IS: did I satisfy all the other factors that Italian was the only issue and that I could come back for the role? Or why is that they called me back ? And didn’t just say sorry your Italian is bad you’re not for this job. 

Im cv is really impressive for all my work experience I just lack the one thing Italian.

Please let me know ;)

TL;DR got asked to call back for the same job once I’ve learned Italian and mastered and when I do they will consider me for the job. Does that mean I am a great fit for the company?

They're associated with Smart Circle and after reading reviews on Glassdoor, these ""product analysts"" are simply salesmen who try to get you signed up for data plans at AT&T at the local Target/Costco. The website indicates nothing about that.

Like I am trying to run the show. 

He is about to get a promotion and I want that promotion to give me some benefits.  Instead of just stewing in resentment. But I am afraid of asking and not getting it and making me stew even more.

We just went to a training on good workplace culture so I think it could be a good time.

386,2023-04-16,I’m a PhD student who can’t get an entry level job because I’m overqualified.,u/CulturalNerve94,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12o8x8e/im_a_phd_student_who_cant_get_an_entry_level_job/,jobs,"EDIT:

I don’t want feedback on my decision to do a PhD, or why you think it’s ‘useless’. I’ve gotten a lot of contacts from it and invaluable work experience as well as the change to do my dream job (lecturing), and wouldn’t change it for the world. No, I don’t think I’m better than everyone else. But I believe that compared to new grads, I’ve acquired more relevant work experience.

I just want advise on how to reframe experience acquired during my PhD for entry level positions, how I can explain why I’m changing field etc. I’ve been working a minimum of 3 relevant roles (editing, writing, administration) since starting in late 2021, so there’s not employment gap either. 


I’m (24F) currently in the penultimate year of a PhD in English Literature in the UK searching for a full time position I can take on during my final/writing up year. I’ve been in higher education without a break, and have extensive experience as a freelance journalist and a university lecturer. Trouble is, I cannot seem to land a job after nearly 5 months of non-stop searching. 

I’ve been looking for jobs in journalism, copywriting, editing, media and communications, marketing, and research. I seem to be getting interviews for prestigious mid-level positions, but then rejected due to my lack of experience. Technically, I’m at a  graduate level (as I’ve never had a full-time job) but entry level positions have transparently rejected me straight away for being overqualified. I don’t even get interviews for these roles.

Does anyone have any sage advice on what to do? Ideally, I want to go into academia and be a writer, but the job market for unis is so bad in the UK that I’m willing to be flexible."
1,2023-04-16,i just need help/advice,u/minochria,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12o8xu6/i_just_need_helpadvice/,jobs,"Hi - I am in my mid-twenties and i have been unemployed for the past 2 years.

Before COVID, I was full time at a retail tool store. I did great work and was there for about three years before management changed. The new manager was horrible enough for my entire team to quit, like dominos. I worked the majority of my two weeks, but since i left 2 days early the guy put red on my history so i can not return to the company. I tried recently and they never returned my phone calls after they got my background check.

I went to a bigger box store after that. 6 months of great work - I did overnight stocking. That job ended because of me filing an assault case against a coworker and losing. Horrible.

Next was the dreaded McDonalds. You can probably tell by now i was in early stages of burnout. I didnt last a month.

My fiance saw how horrible my mental health was and allowed me to go unemployed to work on myself. I am so grateful for them. 

Now, I have recently been reapproved to finish my Bachelor’s degree, of which i only have 3 semesters to do. That starts in summer or fall. I havent decided what would be best time wise.

My question is: what the f do i do with myself? how do i get another job when my skills feel antiquated and 50 new breeds of anxiety have been born inside of me? I am a creative oerson and would rather be in the music industry or fiction writing. But where do i even start?

thank you for all of your advice."

I know in Walmart a managers weekly hours are more like 30-60. So how do I go about getting my market value of self worth without the hiring boss laughing me out of his office or just flat refusing an offer if I aim to high?

What I want to say:



Let us agree that the starting pay is 10$/hr for cashier.
30 hr work week=300/week
300x4= 1200/mo as a cashier

But 
Managers can work up to 60 hr workweek covering for other people and the opening/closing thats 12 hour shifts 5 days a week. Im not saying no, im just outlying what a worst case scenario can be realistically and consistantly. 
So 600/week, 4weeks a month, 2400/mo
BUT
You don't want to hemorrhage on a maybe, i don't want to be worked like a dog for minimum pay, so how about we do 15/hr and presume a 30 hour work week. So the 1200×0.5= 1800 month. Seems to split the difference but is like to round up to 2000 a month even."""

In december I was promoted, promised a raise, then on my second day working the job got told they were retracting the raise BUT manager promised to make it right in six months and bring me up to the minimum pay for the position. The explanation was the VP of the company screwed over everyone who was promoted between december and feburary and either retracted raises given for promotions or fired people.The promotion was in early december and the raise would have happened next month on the 18th supposedly. I asked about it on friday wanting to check in and see what was up. Manager denies ever promising it and says the best I could hope for is a col raise of 3% plus an additional 2% raise if I keep performing as one of the top 5 in the division.


I bring up that this is rediculous and im not asking for much i just want to be paid the same as everyone else and that we had a deal and basically the nice guy facade of my manager dropped and he said to me point blank I better just drop this or else he will start to find performance issues and then left the google meet.

Before anyone says it i know this is all pretty illegal. issue is none of this is in writing and its my word vs his because everything in my company is done via google meets that are unrecorded and when you try and message leadership to ask a question without fail they respond with a canned line that says ""i'm dont understand what you are trying to say. Jump in this meet here and we can talk about it."" and i know this is canned because ive seen it where the manager uses the text blaze and forgets to delete the EMPLOYEE NAME portion at the top in all bold.

What I need help with is some way where i can ask for all instructions and promises in writing so theres a record that is safe and i just dont really know how so thought it best to ask here."

I received a job offer than has a decent salary and benefits for an entry level position, with a well-defined role. The only issue is that I know this job isn’t one that I aspire to do long term.

At my current internship, I have concerns over my professional development because the company is smaller and spread across the US, so learning from people may be more difficult than in an office setting. My position would be less defined, but part of the job is what I ultimately want to do with my career. I will talk to my boss about salary and benefits tomorrow but he told me they would pay more than the other offer. I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR:
Job 1: Well defined role, defined plan for my development, decent salary, automatic 10% retirement contribution, 100% tuition assistance, not what I want to do long term

Job 2: Less defined role, less certainty over my professional development, higher salary, has work that I want to do long term

Applications were put in(august) and informal interviews given. We were told they let us know 2nd wk of September. Didn’t hear anything it kept getting pushed backed. Oct comes still nothing, I go on vacation they say they’ll text to let me know if a choice is made. I come back still nothing, the 16 yr goes on vacation. Mid of October on a Thursday I get called into the office and told I didn’t get it. They went with the new guy.

I ask questions, been here just a year, none of the certification classes and not even a team lead. Get told experience means nothing and seniority means nothing. And director of dept wanted him. I’m pissed I finish my work for the day and leave early. They don’t even tell the person they didn’t get it. So they put there 2wks in, they had a 2 person household income. So something to fall back, me not so lucky.

They finally put the other position up and I applied for S&Gs, I have been applying for other jobs.

So now supervisor want to talk to me on Monday for performance evaluation(good) and something else. If it is the other sup position how do I respectfully say no."

I got my first job in July 2019, it was at a Walmart, best job of my life until there was a new manager and a hard spot in my life that she just had to make worse. I got fired, yep very very sad. Anyway thay ended in March 2022. I made myself a resume and started applying to similar jobs daily, I'd do about 30 or 40. Finally in August 2022 I literally got a call the next day after I filled out an application, the interviewer was super happy to have found someone like me. Immediately hired. I'm still working there now but they couldn't and still can't afford to give me more than 10 to 12 hours per week.

So!! Here is where I need advice, I've updated my resume to include my new job and have started applying to listing again. I DO NOT want to quit my job, simply add on a second job.

Here are my questions to make this more simple:

Should I have left out I'm currently working?
Is there a best time of year to apply for jobs, seeing as I got my jobs around summer?
My mother thinks I should be calling and going up to the places I applied to, is that still a good thing to do?

Sorry this was so long, thanks for reading! Any other tips is greatly appreciated. Also let it be known I love Walmart and enjoyed the years I spent there, and I have indeed reapplied. Everywhere else except where I work is at $17+ starting pay, I'm stuck at $15."

So I have been working as an Implementation Specialist for a Donor Management company that services the non-profit sector for a bit over a year. A few months after I started the CEO (who hired me) quit and the lead sales person took over. It's been going well, but he told us that the contracts we signed with the old CEO wasn't in line with the local employment standards and we'd have to draft up a new contract that an HR specialist put together. 

Most of it was normal stuff until I noticed under ""vacation"" section that we are now only limited to 3 weeks of paid holiday. Before, the contract stated that it would be ""unmetered"" with an expectation we take at least 3 weeks. I live in Canada and the minimum is 2 weeks, but most places give around 3-4. Although I do work 100% remotely and can pretty much be anywhere I want, I'm not sure if I should bring up what was agreed upon in the old contract or not. Generally they have been cool with me taking time off when I need, but I don't want them to nickel and dime random days I take off for long weekends or something, which eats into the 3 weeks, leaving me very little time to actually travel somewhere and enjoy myself. 

Anyone have similar experiences with this?

As a gay couple we realise there are limited options for becoming parents. Adoption is the best (and we think) most appropriate option.

With this in mind, I'm also looking at moving jobs however I was wondering wether what I'm currently allowed in terms of adoption leave is good, bad or indifferent. I suspect its very good.

This is also in the context of a new job offer where the adoption leave is much worse in comparison.

Both jobs offer same adoption leave as maternity leave. It'll need to be me who takes it as my other half is self employed in a career which needs to be out on site etc.

My current job offers 6 months full pay, followed by 3 months half pay then 3 months at 25% pay (or statutory whichever is higher).

Job offer only has 10 weeks full pay, then upto 9 months at statutory pay which seems pretty poor.

I'm interested what others are allowed for adoption or maternity leave in comparison

Thanks!"

I am a fronted engineer working for a pharmaceutical company. 
My 2 colleagues recently changed their LinkedIn status and job title to “senior frontend engineer”, but this is not linked to any promotion, our internal job name is still “front end engineer” and there are no senior front end engineers in the company.

I would like to change mine too only because it bothers me that someone might mistakenly believe they got promoted and I didn't, and that they are a higher level than me. 

The problem is that I am currently changing job, and the new company has both the levels, frontend engineer and senior front end engineer, and I am the first one (seniors have much more experience there) so I won’t be able to write senior on my new job, and if I put senior on my current one it might seem I have moved into a less responsibility role, in reality it is a bigger company and higher salary.

In your opinion, considered the above, should I change my current job title to “senior” or not?"

I’ve applied for this position, and after speaking with the hiring manager for the role, it sounds like they intend to move very quickly with the interview/ job fulfillment process. However, I feel guilty about backing out of a position I’ve already accepted, and also do not want to damage my reputation at the company by doing this.

As someone who ties his values and principles to his work ethic, I have a hard time figuring out what to do.

I started working when I was 9 (I have autism Asperger) and work is legit for me a recreational activity as long as no one annoys me. From 9 to 21 I was studying the causes of poverty in Africa(I'm West African) on a social; economical, cultural, and psychological scale; I did it the same time while going to middle and High school; I graduated and got into Biology, chemistry, and geosciences at university where I took a break after the second year for health reasons and covid.

While doing my research I did tech jobs; biological research.; political sciences reporting, and entrepreneurship studies, I basically touched almost all fields learned 4 languages, and got knowledge in four others which are making me realize that there is no real barrier to growth potential once communication is mastered.

Since I took my break; I worked in corporates and had somehow amazing experiences; I recently worked with some NGOs and international institutes and to be honest I'm just glad that I am competent in almost every field, and I'm really thankful to God.

Right now I'm 24, I'm working as a Consultant Generalist specializing in Project Management and I have to say that I am a bit lost carrier-wise.

I enjoyed all of my experiences and I somehow want to be able to work in each of these fields, but It seems impossible to me to do intra-entrepreneurship while working for/with United Nations while having my own consulting firm, and legally wise I think conflict of interest might ensue.

Right now I'm just managing my firm which I was planning to expand, but I would like to know; if it were you all; how would you proceed? Thanks"

Last month, I was presented with a PIP. I’m so exhausted and disheartened at the impact this job has taken on my well-being that I’d rather resign than wait out the PIP for unemployment benefits. I’m not sure how likely rehire is, but the greatest value here is the pay/benefits and my network. 

My therapist has described this experience as “traumatic” and it’s been so consuming I don’t have a next role lined up - which seems alright for now because I have generous savings AND would like to pivot to different type of work anyway so I look forward to taking a bit of a pause.

Now it's on to my position's training.  I'll be spending a month learning ONE of our projects.  I have over 10 years experience in the field, there's no way I need all of that.  Plus this is healthcare-related which is notoriously understaffed.  Has anyone worked for a company like this?

What about company policies that strictly limit what is offered?,u/TruNorth556,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ox1y5/how_can_you_negotiate_anything_about_a_job_when/,jobs,"I see a lot of advice about negotiating. It seems like this only applies to very few people in the job market.

Like outside of a few very specific jobs you’re going to be facing a lot of competition. Many of the people you’re competing against will be willing to take whatever is offered. 

It also seems like most companies have set policies on how much pto they’ll offer and how much they will pay. 

So how would it be possible to negotiate better pay or better pto?"

I've got decent grades for both programs - about 3.8/4.0. I went straight from undergrad to grad school.

I have decent work experience - been interning every summer in big renowned companies in my home country. I also have experience being a founder of a start-up in the US, where we've got some investments and cash rewards from startup competitions and individual investors.

However, I've got rejected for every summer intern position I applied to for summer 2023. I haven't even got a single interview. I mostly applied to consulting/strategy-related entry positions. I have some peers (international students as well) in my UChicago program facing similar situations. They also have good academics and comparable work experience but got nothing out of it.

Meanwhile, I've seen undergrad junior students getting into big-name companies in the US easily without much experience. I'm very lost at this moment, partly because I don't know where goes wrong in my application, partly also confused why companies don't value grad students as much as undergrads.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could give me some guidance. Thanks a lot!"

Even when I had my degree and wanted a temporary job before I was going full time with the Army, I still couldn’t find a job even with 50 sent applications. As soon as I got in I became an artillery officer and what really worries me is that it’s not applicable to any civilian job. I’m terrified of losing everything because I won’t be able to find a job. I don’t live in a Silicon Valley but my area is incredibly expensive, and as soon as my income stops, there’s no way I would be able to afford my housing. With how hard it is to find jobs today, I’m legitimately concerned about what to do.

Edit: Thank you all for the replies, there’s a ton of great advice and info that I will be taking a look at. Just to clarify some extra information about my situation, I never took command as I don’t plan to go to captains career course.

I’ve been working retail jobs since I graduated from my office administration (general) program at Conestoga College. I’ve been working at the moment at a local grocery store for 3 years (since Feb 2020) and it’s come to my full realization that I’ve been working in a toxic workplace. Just the department: front end, cashier. I worked in a couple other departments: online shopper, and Joe fresh, and it wasn’t toxic at all. 

Anyways, due to the 1 year I completed in college for office admin general program, (I’ve lost interest in that career). I didn’t realize till a few years later the true reason why I loved working at a school in town for 2 co-ops in high school: it wasn’t the career I fell in love with, it was the environment. 

Anyways so I’ve been passionate in mental health (also live with mental illness, disability & addiction). I don’t have any job like experience in this field. I’ve been passionate in mental health since May 2016, 1 year & 1 month into my recovery. 

I wanna find a full time job in a different town (not far from my current, hometown, (plan to move with a high school friend) and want help looking for any jobs that I qualify for. 

I’m not a fan at all of spreadsheets, bookkeeping, etc of the office administration job; I’d only be open to the job if in a school. Otherwise I prefer any other job, excluding retail. Needing full time with benefits too so I can go for my long overdue dentist appointment, go back to therapy with a licensed private counsellor + coverage for my medications. 

Any ideas for me here?"

I’m downright terrified of what will happen during the background check. I looked at a copy of my background check from my last employer and it definitely verified my employment dates. I have no idea what company these guys use and if they want to bother with checking employment. How concerned should I be? Any way to know what they’ll see?

I've been working in the financial services industry for almost 2 years, after moving from retail banking customer services. My job is essentially contract work for investment banks. I've been burnt out as hell for the last 5/6 months, as well as having a lot of increased anxiety. I have zero passion for my work, minimal positive interaction with colleagues, and little support when things go wrong; I work fully remotely because I don't feel comfortable going into my cliquey little office, and clients spend half the day berating me over the phone I'd feel uncomfortable dealing with people overhearing that.

I recently took 2 months of sick leave for anxiety/work-related stress and started back a week ago. My time off was great for getting my anxiety, sleep patterns etc under control, but from day 1 of starting back this has all fallen by the wayside again. I'm barely sleeping, have constant cold sweats from the moment I get out of bed, panic over emails hitting my inbox etc.

My job requires a 12-week notice, but in theory, if I were to hand in my notice any time from now, I could get that reduced until the end of June (when my current project ends) - I have been actively looking at jobs in other sectors where I could apply my skills etc, and a few back to education routes as well.

The question I'm posing is this; should I just hand my notice in asap? Aware I'll have the risk of unemployment after, but is staying in a job until I find a job really worth it if it's putting my mental health in this much jeopardy?"

I’d been looking to move out of a job working at a large hardware store chain for nearly a year. I found this new job advertised on their Facebook group, threw my CV and a cover letter across and didn’t hear anything for over a month. In hindsight this probably should have been one of the first things I picked up on. After much delay, the owner responded inviting me to interview which I accepted. The interview went really well, very informal and just a good chat, but both who interviewed me failed to mention the most important and biggest expectation of the job which is manual handling - heavy lifting. It wasn’t even mentioned in the job description on their page. Now in hindsight, it makes a lot of sense that there would be a lot of lifting involved with the industry but I didn’t expect for myself to be at the forefront of it. I’m 5ft3 and not very strong or fit and previously worked a customer service desk. I guess I’m just finding it hard to adapt to. But aside from that, I only work with a team of 3 other people. And I only work with 1 most of the day. Now she is a lovely person, but I find out conversations fall flat and I end up cleaning or rearranging stuff for most of my day. 

Basically, I want to know if I should feel guilty about continuing the search for work. Because I don’t think I can settle here, I’m only on work week 3 and I’m already dreading the days as they drag beyond belief and I don’t have much of a lunch break. We get interrupted by customers constantly and the amount of time I can probably sit down for without distraction is only 5 minutes.

I have a decent amount of skills like being bilingual, cpr and first aid certification. 


I feel like just because my experience is on the medical field side employers don’t hire me. I’ve applied to multiple retail stores and have been rejected. I was wondering if I should write a small introduction letter at the bottom of my resume explaining that i’m highly adaptable and willing to work whatever position.

I’m a middle school dropout, though I have my GED and silver on my work keys. It seems the only jobs available to me that can provide a decent wage for my family are all factory jobs. Problem is, I really, really hate factory work and I’m now what would be considered a “job jumper” and it’s incredibly hard for me to find a new job anywhere. I’m 23 years old and have had 8 or 9 different jobs since I started working when I was about 17. My resume is honestly a mess and I get raised eyebrows every time I’m being considered for a new position. See I’ve had some really high paying jobs. But those jobs broke me down physically and mentally with absolutely zero work/life balance. I used to work 12 hours 7 days a week and decided when I left that place I never wanted to do that again. Now I’m working 12 hours 5 days and I’m still so sick of it, especially now that I have a daughter to spend time with. 2 days a week is not good enough for me. I want time with my family. And a wage that will keep food on the table and provide a comfortable living. But I’m honestly at a loss. What choice do I have? I don’t see any. If anyone has any suggestions for me I’d love to hear them.

Edit: I was forced to drop out of school because of my controlling, abusive parents. They pulled me out of school to keep me home when I was 13. Didn’t want to say that because I didn’t want to look like I was looking for pity but there sure are a lot of people here making assumptions."

9,2023-04-17,How to handle professional tantrums?,u/Ok-Examination4961,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12pc2nh/how_to_handle_professional_tantrums/,jobs,"TLDR; coworker got the short end of the stick, throwing professional tantrums, shooting down my ideas and efforts, making work more difficult. Looking for delicate phrases to try and ask him to stop at least the unwarranted putting me down. 

I fully recognize that I have received better opportunities than my senior colleague at work due to specific contracts that started with my acceptance into the position that had to be applied to just one new worker. This coworker overheard I am getting trained on a  very sought-after protocol in industry and started throwing what I have now dubbed the ""professional tantrum"" of closing doors loud, slamming supplies on the desk, being snippy, putting me down (more below), etc. It is so uncomfortable. We share an office so it just sucks. This is not a protocol that applies to this individual in any capacity, and is more tailored for individuals with my dual BS degree than the topic of the BS and MS he holds. 

Doing this training is going to be very helpful, is critical to my work, but it will be a miserable time period as I will be running 13-16 hour days (luckily it is in chunks) so I can do my regular work on top of this training. I have not complained about that though. Coworker wanted to get this training too, but the people training me do not want to train the coworker because the coworker isn't on the same contract as me, the coworker will not need to ever use this protocol so being trained once is useless in industry, and our main boss doesn't want this coworker to miss a month of regular business hour work. Also the coworker doesn't really put in full days and I think our main boss notices this. 

Additionally, for any project suggestions I have that involve more current/advanced protocols this coworker will shoot it down. Basically he will go out of his way to tell me it is not possible without having any clue what the protocol is or involves. Most recently something he had never even heard of he shot down and told me ""its impossible and you need to focus on publishing."" I already hold  publications from my previous field, and have two works started, so I am not worried. I basically told the coworker that I already have what I need to graduate, and I don't feel particularly stressed to get things out of the door (he does not have any publications yet), and stressing over it won't help my psyche. Now 8 months into one of my studies, he is trying to claim he had the original idea behind a the project, which to be honest is a natural progression of the precursor project five years ago, as seen across many journals and articles that do similar lines of work. No wheel was reinvented, and my contract had this project outlined without any of his input. He won't let me help him with any of his work because he doesn't want me to be on his publication (he would never admit this) but I couldn't care less if he was on mine. He won't even use my chemicals that I make stocks of even though my chemicals have been verified to be more accurately made through chemical analyses and stats.  

I feel bad for this coworker, and I realize a lot of this is likely projection, but it is making work a lot more miserable than it has to be. I am usually a very direct person, but I don't think ""I cannot be around you when you are like this"" would be helpful. 

This is a PhD program, and am unsure if he uses reddit so I am posting here instead of groups tailored to this demographic. He will be gone in 8 months, so my gut is just telling me to endure, but obviously by this novel of a post it does bother me more than everyday things."

Shitty work environment but I thought it would get better once they were 'forced' to respect me.

I've been trying to get back on track. It's been hard. I'm new to networking, and am very introverted (I'm trying to work on that, however the shitty racist colleagues didn't help) but that's an uphill task.

With the project experience, I'm trying break to data science /analysis. I have a non-tech background in economics and started on the intro to data analysis course on coursera and enrolled for a month.

At the same time however, I was getting a quite few callbacks last week and was trying to prepare for interviews and missed that I had only a week to complete. Now the calls are on hold, no interviews so far so I'm back to square one. Is there any way to complete this course without paying again.

I'm really low on funds and am not sure when I'll be able to land an interview let alone a job.

Not feeling my best right now. Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: I'm open to remote jobs too. I'd prefer in person because I think it'd be easier to make pleasant interactions, industry connections and for my mental well being.

My director is a tyrant. She is consistently out for multiple weeks, and is never in the office. She insists that everyone must work in the office regardless of the situation in the building. there have been multiple situations where the office AC broke, or the bathrooms flooded, and refuses to let us work from home. She will randomly get very upset for no reason. For example she held an meeting with the whole office to tell us that she does not see any passion from the employees. She believe this because she sent out an email and she believe we did not respond with enough urgency. This said email was send at 3:00 pm on Friday and we all responded by 3:30 pm (I responded at 3:08). Her expectations is we respond within the next five minutes. She said that she makes the office comfortable and she can easily take it away from us. I am fed up and so is a majority of staff in the office. At this point we are all on the verge of quitting and I terrified because I do not want to go through another job search. My mental health has been complete trash to the point where my body is numb from all the racism, exclusion, drama and immature behavior not only demonstrated from my boss but from my fellow coworkers. I experience my fellow coworkers getting drunk in the office, excluding employee due to gender, or race. I am stuck in the middle of this because my boss and manager are constantly at odds together.

I (F28) have come to realise something about myself in the 5 or so years I've been in the job market:

I am not an ideas person.

I can execute other people's ideas very well, I just can't come up with my own.

I've been trying to improve, but it's not really going anywhere. My mind just blanks whenever anyone asks me what I think, or for an opinion. I guess I've always been this way but it never really mattered in school since you were always told what to do and given very little creative freedom. 

Anyway, I'm wondering what this means for my future career prospects. Obviously there are lots of jobs that involve executing the ideas of others and not having to be the ideas person, but I feel like those roles can only take you so far seniority wise, and pay wise.

I would like to progress in a role and earn more money but I'm worried my mental block when it comes to being able to think up ideas will seriously hinder me.

I currently work in marketing so you can imagine how much this is already holding me back (in fact I've recently been demoted).

In my field for 18. It's a VERY niche skill set, and takes many years to learn and understand the business, product, and processes. Recently I spoke with the owner and told them that I want more responsibility and to learn and branch out in my field. I'm bored. I love what I do and feel I have way more to learn and offer.

It took a few months but by stroke of luck we found someone with some experience, onboarded them, and I personally spent 6+ months training them on procedures here.

Now, I already do a lot of managerial things here, such as HR work, hiring, conflict resolution, etc. that I am NOT compensated for. Because of this, employee files are kept in my office. I sorted them out a few weeks ago to prepare for reviews and by chance/accident I learned that this new person was hired on making 35% more to start than I'm making after 6 years. I was a bit surprised considering their experience, but if that's the number they wanted and the boss said OK, then good for them. This past week I finally had a sit down meeting with the owners, and they offered me a new position, managing the entire business, and then came time to discuss compensation. They offered me 20% less annually than the person I just trained as my subordinate, which is 40K less a year than the person I'm REPLACING.

I don't live in a state where it's illegal to discuss your compensation, but I learned about it by accident. I can't tell the owners I know how much they're paying this person to replace me. How do I negotiate my compensation now? I know I am worth FAR more than they're giving me credit for, and I feel unappreciated and taken advantage of after the offer they made me. They told me if I think I should be compensated differently I need to tell them why. How do I tell them without telling them I know they're severely lowballing me hoping I'll take it?

Thanks in advance for any advice. 

\*For those who will tell me to just quit, know it could take me a year or more to find work in my field. I do plan on polishing up my resume, but in the interim waiting for the right opportunity, I'd like to see what I can do here before I decide to move on down the road."

So, some background I'm a school counselor and have been working t a school in a large urban school district for the past 5 years. Back in January, I applied for a school district position to be in a position where I'd in a mental health support/consultation role. It seemed like an amazing job, if a bit of a reach for me and I figured the job would go to someone more experienced. However, they verbally offered me the job and finally last week, after a couple months of waiting for the official offer, I received it. 

The pros of the job include better pay $95k (a $15k increase for me) with the possibility to increase to $100k after the first 6 months, working from home most of the time but driving into schools to support crisis situations as needed, big step up in the organization, might be able to leverage this into other high paid positions, will hopefully be in a position to advocate for things I care about (the most compelling reason), chance to grow and challenge myself 

Cons: Possibility to be highly stressful as I will be one of three therapists responding to crises in our whole school district, larger amount of responsibility, some red flags...poor communication, the supervisor position above me is vacant and has been for over a year with what seems like a lack of urgency to fill the role, high turnover in this position,  bit unclear what training/support I'd get to be successful in the role, its understaffed (they cut half of the department from 6 roles to 3 roles), I have 2 good friends in this department who keep warning me about it (""Are you really sure you want this?"")...which all just gives me pause

Versus at my current job I love my school, I love my bosses and coworkers, it's flexible in that I can take time off whenever I would like, I get 12 weeks off a year (vs would get 5 in the new role), I know what I'm doing, it's not too stressful, etc. My main reason for wanting to leave was that I know how to do everything and feel ready for a new challenge. 

I'm so stressed out. I was excited about this role initially, but in the few months since I got the verbal offer, I feel like I haven't been impressed with the communication of this new department and I'm feeling like while I like the role itself, I don't feel confident that I'll be supported adequately and am worried that I'll feel very stressed out/not supported and it'll affect me negatively. It would be hard to leave this role in the middle of the school year if I don't like it. At the same time, it's a huge opportunity that might not come around again. Advice? How would you decide?"

I've spent the last 24 years in  software development with a large corporation;  about half that time as  team lead.  Prior to that I spent a couple of years teaching MCSE  classes (NT 4.0) as well as the nascent technologies of Macromedia Flash  and PHP1.  Unfortunately, computer science degrees weren't really  pushed in the early 90s and for various life reasons I have a BA in  History.

Despite almost 30 years  of IT knowledge, my resume seems to frequently get dropped by filters on  application websites.  These are looking for a BS in a field related to  computer science and have a static yes/no type response option.   Realistically, no one is going to check on my 30 year old degree but I  don't really want to lie on my resume either.  Suggestions?"

I graduated in May 2022 from Mechanical engineering from a well-known Canadian university. However, I still have not been able to find the job in the field. I do not have any internships whatsoever because I could not find any during the pandemic and a lot of layoffs happened during that time.

  
It's getting to a point where I feel like a failure and am starting to question my decisions and choices in life. At times, I feel like i have hit rock bottom because its been almost a year and no luck. it seems that as each day passes, the more im becoming irrelevant because most companies only want new grads. I do not know what to do.... Sometimes, it feels like Im almost on the verge of getting clinical depression just cuz of this toxic headspace I am in. People around me are getting offers that are beyond my imagination while I did a small data entry job a couple months ago just to start paying off loans and while waiting to get a proper job offer in my field.

  
If anyone can talk about their experiences or provide any advice, it would be hugely appreciated!"

As the title says I am looking to transition into a new career and was looking for general advice and guidance. 

A bit of background I am currently in Insurance sales. I am a lifelong salesperson. I started in car sales and even went into auto finance for a while before the pandemic blew me out. I went into life insurance and life/financial planning before getting into health insurance which is what I do now.

I have been in, managed and helped build call center and sales teams over the last 5 years but I am finding my earning potential limited. It seems that the only way for me to bump my income is to have my own agency which I dont have the funds or really the interest to do.


I currently live in south florida so but I will be leaving for Pittsburgh around august. I'm not sure if there are other type of jobs or industry that I can just take with me wherever I go. 
Am I in an NCA sadly but I'll go to court over it if I have to. 


I am just trying to do an appropriate risk assessment. I have thought of doing real estate or other ventures but I can't afford to have a period of no income or a substantial decrease in my income. I am on track to hit 70k for this year but that seems to be it for my position, i've tried to move into management but I make more as a salesperson.

So for anyone who is willing to give any advice or just general information I greatly appreciate it.


I have looked into MLO (mortgage loan originator) and other finance type of jobs. 
I'm begging to regret not taking the pay cut in exchange for the managerial experience since the official lack of it has lead to being turned down for recent jobs. 


Again any and all advice is appreciated"

I graduated in December with my Master’s in Environmental Science and Conservation Biology. I went into my Master’s during 2020 as job prospects didn’t look good with the pandemic recession. I worked really hard to get job experience with many internships and teaching assistant positions to help me learn and gain key resume builder roles. I felt great going into my last semester thinking I had made it and was reaching my goals. However, after graduating I still have not been able to land a job. I’ve gone through over 100 job applications, spent March doing so many interviews, and have been ghosted and rejected by most everything. 

I am distraught and feeling my gap (3 months) of employment is starting to make me look bad. I don’t know what to do, I’m too experienced to get internships but apparently have too little experience for a full time job… what do I do? How did you get your first full time? Did any women in science have the same struggle?

1,2023-04-17,When to do a second follow up for interview results?,u/Xkwizito,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ptjs3/when_to_do_a_second_follow_up_for_interview/,jobs,"Hi All,

Interviewed for a position at a large financial institution on April 6th. I had a referral for the job from someone who has the same position I am going for (they also came from the same company I am trying to leave, I was actually their senior). I thought the interview went well. Interviewers said they were going to compare notes and send to the recruiter who would get back to me. A week passed so last Thursday (April 13th) I emailed the recruiter asking if they had any updates for me and if they could let me know when I might hear back from them. They replied with, ""The team is still interviewing and making final decisions, I hope to hear soon"". I felt like this was a good sign because if they didn't want me the recruiter would have just told me right then and there.

Essentially this anticipation is killing me because I really could use this career move. Should I wait until this Thursday (April 20th) before reaching out again, or is it ok if I reach out sooner?

Edit: Also to make it clear, there are multiple openings for this position from what I was told and there were multiple candidates.

Edit 2: Also wanted to add that my previous coworker that got the position was hired like within a week, granted in her scenario they were looking to fill the position rather quickly and they were only hiring for 1 of that position at the time."

At this point, I'm considering a few different options to improve my chances of landing a job in finance. One option is to go back to school and pursue a Master's degree. Another option is to take the Series 66 exam, or to go back to school and become a CPA. However, I'm hesitant to take on more student loan debt if it won't significantly improve my job prospects.

I’ve been there 7 years and I’m leaving for a few reasons. Partly, it is just time for a change but there are a few other reasons. Primarily the ‘other reasons’ are that the management structure is very rigid and the company has a real problem with a blame culture. The company also reacts badly to anyone ‘disagreeing’ with the companies approach to anything and several excellent employees have been made redundant for ‘rocking the boat’ or just giving unwelcome feedback. These employees have since gone into excellent jobs in other similar companies. 

The culture of the company has changed and the organisational changes have exacerbated the negative points of the firm. It’s sad because I have really enjoyed it there in lots of ways.

I have now received my departure details and there is no longer an HR exit interview (see how big they are on feedback?!) but there is an online form. So my question is do I… find a person to give my proper feedback to (tough but there may be a manager I could speak to) or fill in the form with my genuine experience? Or do I do nothing, I’m leaving now and it’s really not my problem anymore?"

I had all the qualifications and I made sure everything I submitted was correct. This hasn't happened to me before, as I'm typically used to getting rejections 2 weeks after submitting them.

The job opening only lasted 2 weeks and I got it in a full day before it closed. Would that have any factor in this? I would think recruiters would fairly review all applications, even until the end. Would it be weird of me to try and contact them for further openings and/or an explanation of why I didn't make the cut?"

I fumbled on a really important question due to nervousness and I definitely think it was make or break, but I am not sure. Of course I know not to put all my eggs in one basket, but I have invested so much time and its the biggest company in its sector and it's a bit frustrating, especially when it's down to only 2 people making it 50/50.

I followed up with one of my recruiters (my main one was out of town) last Monday and she said they were regrouping that week before any hiring decisions are made and that they will reach out with an update. I heard nothing the rest of the week so I followed up today a week later (today Monday).

They have internal recruiters and the ONE thing I will give them is that they've responded to every email I have sent within an hour or 2 the same day which is nice of them bcuz I know most recruiters do not respond. I do think these recruiters at this company feel bad or at least like me in some way.

She said this ""Thanks for following up blah blah. We will be sure to reach out once we have more information to share, which should be this week. Thanks again for checking in and your continued interest in the opportunity. Don't feel sorry, feel free to follow-up.""

Tf does this mean and how would you interpret? Like I said, being between me and 1 other person, definitely makes me think the other person got the offer and they are just waiting to see if that goes through. Is that what you all think? The CEO is out of town this week starting Thursday so I don't know what to think..

This whole situation has me frustrated, and unfortunately I will be applying elsewhere in the meantime. :("

I've had entry level positions before and they've never had me do a project prior to starting, on top of that, screening candidates, writing an in depth report on who was selected and then creating a comprehensive orientation regarding their positions could take hours out of my day for a position I might not even get. 

Just wanted to check and see if this was typical or if I'm overthinking."

What should I do?,u/Historical_Oven7806,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12pw1wt/i_am_between_a_rock_and_hard_place_with_my_mba_i/,jobs,"I graduated with my MBA in Healthcare Admin in December and I have been applying for jobs like crazy! I currently work for a company that chose to go fully remote/hybrid after the pandemic and the lack of socialization is getting to me. Anyways, I am trying to find hospital, physician practice and nursing home jobs to just get experience as a manager onsite. Now, I am not sure why I want to be in 5,10, 20 years. I guess I am trying to find my niche. I would love to be in management and lead a medical practice or hospital one day, but who knows? 

I don't have management experience. I have never hired/fired someone, disciplined someone, created a budget, etc. However, I do have leadership experience in some volunteer organizations that I am a part of. I led fundraisers, events, teams, etc.  I really enjoy leading people and coaching them to be the best that they can be. I love employee recognition. I love rewarding my team with pizza, praise and admiration.  

I am getting rejected from employers due to ""lack of experience"". And when I do apply for entry-level positions as a means of ""getting a foot in the door"", I am told this ""would not be a step up for you"".  My hope is, although it may not be a step up for me ""right now"" it can lead to growth opportunities in the company. I am not sure how to sell the interviewer this....Thoughts? I hear people tend to hire/promote within.....is that accurate?"

I have a lot of managerial and sales experience, I had health issues and I had to start over with sales rep position. 

The thing is since then, all employers don’t seem to care about anything before this last position.

1,2023-04-17,Correction with an Interviewer went wrong - How should I handle this if it happens again?,u/R_L_Bmut,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12pwiom/correction_with_an_interviewer_went_wrong_how/,jobs,"Currently shopping for new positions to leave the first job I got out of university because the salary's just not worth it. Got a call from a staffing agency to talk to them about a position I applied for. Get on a zoom interview with part of their team a few days later.  


The hiring manager and I make small talk before they start confirming the information on my resume and asking me about it. They incorrectly state my title as a 'Temp Assistant'. I, worried that I made a mistake on the information somewhere, correct them that I'm not working as a temp. The position is a contract position with a different agency and is considered a permanent role, I'm just choosing to leave of my own volition. The manager looks at me and says that every contract role is a 'temp' role and goes, ""Did you not know that at all?"" This threw me off and I didn't answer right away, so she went into of how their agency does it where every contract worker is a temp and the only permanent workers are those directly hired through the company. It was embarassing to say the least. 

I finally remember how words work and tell her that it's probably just a difference in how the companies talk about these things and basically try to redirect things onto the main topic. She pushes a bit more about how she's using the proper industry terms and then lets it go. The tone was soured though as she was a bit condescending and I just felt like a spotlight was shown on my lack of experience and poor handling. 

Believe it or not, they did call me back and I have a second round coming up tomorrow, but unless that goes well, I probably won't take any offers should I get them. The entire interaction just made me question what working with this agency would be like going forward and cast it in a negative light. Not to mention the interviewer said she was going to adjust my resume before sending it out, and I'd bet my bottom dollar she changed it to 'temp assistant' before distributing it. I won't say no to free interview practice though.

&#x200B;

My question is basically - what should I have done? Besides the not freezing up part. Did I handle it poorly? 

For reference, I spoke to a manager at my current position (who knows I'm job searching and whom I trust) and she confirmed the ""temp assistant"" title is incorrect as they have that at my job and it's a completely different role. She basically said in her usual blunt way, ""she has no idea what the f she's talking about and shouldn't tell you what your jobs are called"". I appreciate this manager very much, but I'd love other opinions on the specifics of how to handle these kinds of interactions with interviewers."

Personal references aren't allowed.

My prior employers were short term temporary gigs post Covid pandemic. 3 months here, 4 months there. They are all large private employers who require me to use The Work Number. 

Their recruiters were remote and worked from home out of State. The employers all use The Work Number.

On the reference check sheet, I put down my supervisor's names, my job Title, dates of my job, location where I worked. That is all I can give out in the private sector. I can't give out their personal emails or phone numbers. I worked in ware houses and call centers. But that wasn't my typical career, prior to Covid. 

If they can only verify my job Title and employment dates with The Work Number, and that isn't enough, what do I do? Could I lose the potential to get hired? Its a GS-6 level administration job. Its not my fault my prior short term places of work lasted a short time post Covid. 

Some of us had to Uber, move boxes inside a warehouse to get cash flow coming in. Many older people lost their jobs especially women, and its been very difficult to get hired back into permanent FT work. I have no background issues. I don't even talk with my prior supervisors. 

Has anyone experienced this? If the Fed Govt isn't satisfied with The Work Number to confirm I actually worked there, and I have no criminal, what do you suggest if they come back and say, ""we couldn't reach the names of your prior supervisors."""

I honestly can’t trust them or their reactions. 

For each of both job interviews, the last round involved interviewing 6-7 team members and technical experts. Every time, I try to judge (afterward) how I think it went. They all seem very satisfied, based on what they told me - answers like “that’s what I was looking for” and “that’s a great answer”. And we all laughed and had great time. They all told me how I’d be a great fit for the team. My people and I all thought that I’d get the job based on the reaction of the interviewers. 

Heck, I asked one interviewer for feedback, and he said “honestly, I’m biased to give you an answer, because I see my younger self in you. I think you’d be an amazing person in the team.”

For the last job interview, I went overtime with everyone, because they all enjoyed talking to me. For one of them, we were scheduled for 45min chat (zoom), and we talked for 90min. 

Then I don’t get the job. No answer from recruiter or the hiring manager. It’s so exhausting that I get seemingly great feedback during interviews, get my hopes up, and not get the job.

But when i look for those type of position i just get the basic tech support role which i done for several years, and trying to break out of it.

Tech Support is great, but i am not a phone person but i faked it until i made it and was able to move up to Quality Assurance person, that made sure people were following company policies and all that jazz. But now i want to be the one to just support the one product role, and not having to be the first point of contact as i have the experience for it and a computer science & information tech diploma.

has anyone have this issue switching out of tech support position is it really that difficult to get out of? i just need some insight on how to move out of tech support role as i been support for many years."

Second interview was where he pretty much ran down my resume and asked this and that, strengths/weaknesses, a few questions regarding my current role and what I do.

Pretty much lasted 15 mins. Asked for the next steps and he just said directors are on vacation and said he genuinely doesn't know the next steps yet.

But yeah, prepared all weekend just for it to be a short interview lol"

I’m in a bit of a pickle and could use some advice. 

I have been at a new job in a new field for a year now and after a reorg, things when down hill. 

Since I’ve started I have had 6 trainers and 2 managers. The current manager is my bosses boss since the manager left. My new manager decided put me on a PIP. 

Since I have been here I learned everyone does the role differently and there is no documentation, the new manager is disconnected from the role and is relying on my coworkers to train me. 

Since I have been on the PIP things I have been doing for a year are suddenly not correct when they preciously were. Every email I send is cc’d to management and I have to submit a daily log of task completed so they can be reviewed. My trainers just add their work load on top of mine and say I will only learn by repetition. I don’t see how I’m going to make it out of the PIP successfully and I have been extremely stressed out. I haven’t had any consistency in training or how processes are done since I started. 

I have multiple colleagues that referred me to the company and they agree that my department is just not functioning right. To the point other departments had to step in. 

I don’t want to leave the company since the benefits are amazing but I don’t know for to handle this situation. I’m assuming the answer is to just quit and move on but I was hoping someone might have some advice. 

This might also be me venting a bit. 

Thanks for listening."
2,2023-04-17,Offer changed to tentative temporary instead of full offer at last minute. I don't even know at this point.,u/astronomaestro,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12q17xe/offer_changed_to_tentative_temporary_instead_of/,jobs,"I've been going through the hiring process for a science and tech dev job (python and c++) for a few months now. I've done many interviews, recently finished the final interview which I was flown out for, all my references checked out, set myself up with HR with only 3 days before they were going to make the final offer. I was then told hiring is frozen and they can't move forward with original offer even though funding is available. They want me to go for this other position which has temporary in the title. 

It's probably not the hiring managers fault and they are trying really hard to convince me that 'temporary' full time is just as good as true full time, and they really need me on their team. However, they still haven't actually offered anything.

I'm not convinced I should. Moving to some external market and hoping some temporary job will be stable (or even exist) isn't smart to say the least. It is WAY too much risk on my end given that I would end up in a market where I have no friends or family if things fell through.

On top of this, another science and tech job I applied for and made it to the final interview also fell through. I've put so much work into this job search for over 3 months and I feel I'm back at square 1. I'm so tired. Honestly, I just want to go to bed. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and find out it was all just a bad dream."

1,2023-04-17,"If I was terminated from an employer for ""poor performance"". Should I keep this employer on my resume and explain why I was let go for ""Reason for leaving"". Or keep it off?",u/thegreatdumbass,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12q1uzq/if_i_was_terminated_from_an_employer_for_poor/,jobs,"So here's a background to my termination: I was a teller at a bank, I worked there for a full year while in school and was full time for only 4 months. The job was ok. I struggled with sales and being direct with people when their check funds wasn't going to be available. Anyway, I messed up verifying if a check was legitimate for a certain individual. Turned out, the check bounced but I put it on the wrong ""Hold"" time, I put it on a 2 day hold instead of 4 days. 2 days later they came and withdrew $3k that wasn't even ""real"", per-say. On the 4th day it was found out by the clearing house that the check bounced. But, this person already got their cash and fucked off. Leaving me liable, the bank had to terminate me. 

This incident happened a year ago, I went back to my job that I had before leaving the bank. I have some great supervisors and they support me 100%, they were to take me back. Anyway, I'm applying to a firefighting position and I'm not sure if I should add this bank to my resume or list them on the application page with the fire department. I don't want to lie, but I also don't want them tanking my chances by telling the FD that I'm ""not eligible for re-hire"". It's just a little dilema I have going on right now. On the other hand though, my supervisors at my bank job were sad to terminate me and they said if I needed anything I can contact them, so that's good.

So, what should I do? What would you guys do? List the failed bank experience and explain what happened and what I learned from it? Or leave the bank completely out of everything? Also, does a background check show where I worked? Looking forward to everyones advice! Thank you in advance.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Got terminated at a bank job a year ago, applying at a fire department. Do I add the bank job to my resume and let them know I was terminated from that job?"

1,2023-04-17,Stay with new six-figure job or leave to start my own business?,u/Flyfant26,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12q23vw/stay_with_new_sixfigure_job_or_leave_to_start_my/,jobs,"I'm a young attorney with about 2 years' experience. Until two months ago, I was at a dream job with an awesome, very small two-partner firm. We shared an office building with a  couple other small firms, everyone got along great, very fun environment. I got to choose my own clients, set my own schedule, lots of freedom and flexibility. Pay was about $60k, not amazing but not bad by any means. 

Unfortunately, the partners ended up parting ways and the firm dissolved shortly after the new year. I jumped on board at a different firm in town, where I'm making more than double what I did before. The environment here is very different, though. I'm expected to be at the office during work hours, even if my work for the day could easily be done at home. The firm manager distributes the cases, so I have to accept the cases and clients that I'm given. Everyone is professional and polite, but nobody is interested in being close with their coworkers. It's been a pretty isolating experience so far, and even though I'm making six figures now, in a lot of ways I feel like I've taken a step back because I have much less autonomy over my work. I'm expected to show up when I'm told and accept the work I'm given, and I know it sounds spoiled, but that's been a hard adjustment after so much time managing my own work.

I've been kicking around the idea of launching my own firm. A couple of my classmates did it straight out of school with no experience; I've got a couple years under me now, and while that's still not a lot, I've handled most of the basic types of cases in my field. I've realized that I really value having control over my work and over my schedule, and I'd really like to take pride in building my own business. I've already got a lot of the mechanisms in place to do so, I'm just struggling with the financial security aspect of it. Starting out, I'd probably make $50-60k my first year, which I could easily afford to live off of, but the practical side of my brain is asking why it makes sense to toss away a six-figure salary just to be ""in control"". Also relevant: I have about $30k of savings to keep me afloat till I build up a decent client base.

I guess I'm looking for anectodes and advice from people who have made that jump and regretted it or celebrated it. What should I be thinking about? Does it really make sense to throw away a more secure job just when I've started to ""make it""?"

I have tried to even make my sessions on zoom but to no avail. I have to complete 3 hours of professional development and the semester is almost over. All the scheduling times would have interfered with my classes(I'm a grad student btw). I've been told that when future employers contact my employer that it won't look good for me at all. I honestly don't know what to do. I thought about just quitting my job and maybe not show it in a resume/CV to avoid future employers from looking at it. I feel really stressed from this job now and honestly regret taking it. I'm not even that good at statistics/Math anyways so I don't know why I took the job. :(
1,2023-04-17,Putting myself on the market after 18 years with the same employer,u/aja_ramirez,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12q2os0/putting_myself_on_the_market_after_18_years_with/,jobs,"I've been with the same employer (a University) since 2005.  I've climbed the administrative ladder steadily and recently reached the senior table (though I do not quite have a senior title).  It's a bit of an accomplishment, but a recent change in President has me fretting the next day.  I'm not going to say he is ineffective, but we don't seem to see things the same way a lot of the times.  It's gotten testy rather quickly.  He also has started cleaning house a bit, so it all has me nervous about my standing.

So I started looking at the job market just recently to see what is out there.  As it is, I ended up becoming a bit of a chameleon at work, fitting in where I could to fix issues.  Kind of a troubleshooter I suppose.  

That has provided value in my current situation, but it's probably not the best for finding similar jobs at similar pay rate elsewhere.  Unfortunately I am not a true academic either, not having come up from faculty to my current post.  My school training is in statistics and research methods, though I stopped publishing long ago.  I do use stats in my current role but most of it is basic.  

My initial searches suggest that I may be able to find comparable opportunities (salary-wise) outside of academia, but not a perfect fit in most cases.  A job in for profit sector would also be a shock to my system I think.   I have posted on Indeed and Monster and now I'm wondering if someone will see it? Anyway, I guess I am mostly venting for the moment.  It has been a stressful month or so, and I cannot imagine continuing this route for too long.  Something has got to give."

I make roughly $55,000 working 38 hours per week (4 day work week)+ optional overtime and am currently at the bottom of the pay scale (opportunity to make more). I like my coworkers, the job is incredibly easy, and I love having a 4-day week. However, I don’t love what I do, have to work 2/4 weekends per month, and currently work 3rd shift, but there will soon be promotional opportunities that I am very much qualified for that are Mon-Thurs 1st shift. I also have excellent insurance and a fairly standard retirement.

I recently interviewed for a position that plans to send me an offer letter within the next two days. The position is with a BRAND NEW company (with financial backing from a major science corporation). The work is fairly similar to what I do now, but will pay $73,500 to start. I will work 44 hours/week over 5 days and will likely have to work 3rd shift again (no guarantee about shift schedules). The company also has to prove that the process they designed works effectively within the next 6 months or they could lose funding (ie. I will be under a lot of pressure as soon as I start). Benefits are alright, but not as good as what I currently have.

I’m nervous to give up such a secure position for this brand new company and also worried that I’ll get stuck on 3rd shift again but have fewer days to switch back to a “normal” schedule. However, the pay increase is incredibly enticing. Any advice would be appreciated."

T/Th: 9:00 AM - 8:15 PM
W: 10:35 AM - 12:00 PM
Fri/Sat/Sun: Free All Day

I’m in a position where I don’t really need to go to work per day, but I’d like to have some money in the bank to buy something for myself every now and then.

I also need to invest into my voice acting equipment, as well as fees for acting. I’m currently a theatre major, and as you can tell, it’s not easy lifestyle, but I’m passionate about it. 

I’ve worked one other fast food job before my job at Shakey’s, and that one was a disaster. Lots of racism towards me, rude customers, etc.

Working in the back at Shakey’s isn’t really stressful, it’s just really busy, but I feel like I’m busting my ass off as a part timer just to make $15.50 when I could be making $17-$20 at an office job (which sounds like a better environment for me), or even be a waiter and make tip money.

The main reason I’m asking if I should quit is because my boss, who’s pretty accommodating, wants me to work almost every day. 

I get it, it’s a business and they need people, and I did agree to work weekends, but I practically have no social life anymore, and I have to keep reminding my boss time and time again that I’m busy Tuesday and Thursday, but she keeps scheduling me for those days.

I need to put in the work to get paid, but I feel like I’m being lowballed. I’m supposed to work from 5-11, but they let me go home early, so I actually lose minutes off my pay.

Ill have a new position that I never had, new responsabilités that I never had too, and it scares me a little.

I've been trying to get a job for a while, looking for UX Jobs (but they seem to want people who aren't starting off at zero professional experience and have at least 2+ years of in the field) and now I'm thinking anything remotely related to UX Design really (like web content coordinators, web design) would be good. Does anyone have any idea on jobs that are related to UX design that I could potentially get and use to leverage into a UX Design career? 

I have a strong background in art, I have basic coding skills (HTML and CSS (but I want to avoid coding at all costs because I just don't think that way, I think in terms of people)) and I've done some freelance graphic design and illustration. But I really need experience. 

So, any advice for me? What avenues should I explore?"

I'm not a permanent employee but a contractor. No benefits, paying me off an ABN number, but I just graduated from university and struggled enough as it is landing a job. It was only meant to be temporary while I looked for proper permanent employment, but then I got diagnosed with cancer and was stuck with it. 

I needed to work from home because, well, come flu season in an office and I would be dead on the floor. 

But for some reason, this company does not accommodate working from home and because of that only allowed me to work 3 hours a day instead of 8. I was getting paid for 3 hours a day, on a drastically below-minimum wage. It sucks, but hey, it gave me something to do every morning, and if anything it would be a resume filler. I'm not gonna be financially independent anytime soon, but I applied for government benefits so at least something is going into my savings.

Then today, just got a text that they are reducing my shifts to just two days a week instead of four, for 3 hours a day. Did not provide me with an explanation. I wake up every morning, do my work, and still get so much done for this company with the little hours they give me. I'm the only person in the office with my skills and knowledge. I can't believe they are doing this to me. 

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe just to complain. What can I realistically do? 

I've been thinking of looking for a volunteer role to do on top of this one, and keep applying for permanent roles once my treatment is over. 

Everything is such a mess. Fuck capitalism."

2,2023-04-17,Recruiter randomly reached out on LinkedIn… job seems legit but I’m wary,u/natnast420,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12q7mqw/recruiter_randomly_reached_out_on_linkedin_job/,jobs,"A recruiter reached out to me last week on LinkedIn with a job offer.  I did not apply to this job, nor was I connected with this recruiter at the time that they reach out. We agreed to chat over the phone so I could get some info on what the position entails.

Overall, the company that I would supposedly be working for seems completely legit. They offer pretty good benefits including tuition reimbursement. Has better reviews than the company I currently work for. The recruitment agency also looks legit. And the recruiter isn’t annoyingly persistent like others I’ve worked with in the past. The job is in the same field that I’m currently in, doing a lot of things similar to my job now which makes me further believe I was recruited based on my skills and experience. 

Here’s the catch; the job is 2hrs away from where I live. They offer a pretty hefty monthly travel stipend for anyone living a certain distance from the location and I fit the criteria. They mentioned it in the initial message on LinkedIn and my first thought was “scam”. When we spoke on the phone today I brought it up. They explained that because the company is basically in the middle of nowhere, they’re having trouble finding candidates nearby, hence, incentivizing those willing to make the commute. Makes sense, right? Now, that “travel stipend” is way more than my current salary in a month. Completely untaxed. Not to mention the base pay would be a significant enough increase as well. I’m a college student paying for school completely on my own. If this is indeed legit, I could pay for school, accommodations and travel, and still have money leftover to save, invest, or spend however I please. 


My gut is telling me it’s too good to be true. There’s gotta be a catch. My current job is sustaining me right now, it’s easy and I basically get paid to do nothing. However, the hours are awful, so I was already planning my exit strategy when this opportunity fell in my lap. I’m considering starting the interview process just to test the waters and jump out if anything smells fishy. If not, this could be a great opportunity, and I’d hate to say I never even tried."

I want to ask advice as I am about to leave my current company for a new role I start on May 16th. I was going to give me company 3 weeks notice, on this Friday, the 21st because I have a planned vacation from the April 26th-May 3 and wouldn’t be able to give them a 2 weeks notice. My question is would it be better to give them 3 weeks, or wait until I get back and give about 1 1/2 weeks notice? I am on good standing with the company, but don’t want to leave a sour taste.

Thanks in advance for the advice!"

I have never worked with a recruiter, recruiting agency, headhunter, etc to find a job.  In fact, I’ve only ever talked with one recruiter after applying directly with the company.  And I have no idea how this works or how to go about it :) 


I have been looking for remote work for about three months now, and I haven’t made it much farther than the first round.  I don’t know anyone who has had good experiences with a recruiter to find a job, so I thought I’d ask here.  



I have included some info below:


Education:
• Master of Arts, Education. Emphasis area: Educational Technology. 


• Bachelor of Arts, Business Administration. Emphasis area: Marketing. 


• No certifications other than education. 


Professional Experience:
• Education, ~5 years — (Elementary special education, ~2.5 years; secondary special education, 1 year; secondary social studies education, 1 year; secondary business education, 1.5 years — 1 yr concurrent with social studies). 

• Collections Analyst, Accounts Receivable, <1 year.

• Coaching / Club Sponsoring, 1 year (high school activities and athletics). 


Looking For: 

• Flexible, definitely not sales, prefer to stay away from customer service.  Prefer internal positions not facing customer. 


• Anything under business, HR, finance/accounting, compliance, logistics, etc.  


• Remote/Hybrid in MO; Remote in US. 


Just looking to be pointed in the right direction.  TIA.  


TL;DR - how do I even find a recruiting agency while searching for remote work?  Experienced teacher, recently transitioned to AR, earned BA and MA."

For those that don't watch the reel, it recommends using a numbered list to structure your response and prevent yourself from rambling. So, for example: ""Here are three important things you should know about me, first ..., second... and third..."".

I got my master's in computer information technology.  I go on interviews even for the jr. positions but unfortunately and not surprisingly I don't have the experience needed.  College taught me no practical skills and was a huge waste of money (to me at least).  I have been on several interviews and tell them, I have a master's with a great GPA and have learned very quickly with anything I take on.... I basically tell them with great enthusiasm that I'm a go getter, always have been and will learn very quickly because that's all I have to offer.  No one unfortunately will give me a chance without the experience (even in junior positions).  I have even had jobs say I did the best on the assessment tests for the job and still get denied because I have 0 experience.  I self-teach myself programming and other useful skills but it's hard to do it on your own and know exactly what each company wants.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.   


Basically, I'm here to ask what do I do?  Do I go back to school and hopefully get an internship?  Are there online courses that are going to get me a tech job?  I have tried for years and can't figure out the answer.  I have even posted on job networking sites that I will work for free and just want the experience needed to grow my career.

My tasks for my main job include:

* Graphic design (ie. designing the posts, as well as other infographics that we need to send out to clients)
* Video production (pre-production, actual filming, post production)
* Social media managing (have to plan out all posts and captions, as well as scheduling the posts)
* Social media analytics (track our analytics, ensure that we are on an upward trend, report to the boss whenever something is wrong)

My contract technically ends at the end of June, but I'd like to work as a freelancer for them after that. However, I'm unsure of how much I should charge them. Experience wise, I've been doing social media managing and publicity work for a youth theatre company since 2021. Aside from that, I've done an internship with one of the biggest TV/Film production houses in the region. I'm currently getting paid $7.5/h (after converting from SGD to USD) for everything, including the ad-hoc receptionist duties and other admin work. For comparison, some of my friends who have NO experience go into a similar type of job (without the ad-hoc duties) and get $15-20/h. 

That's besides the point. How much should I charge, by post/hourly/monthly, as a freelancer who will be doing social media managing, inclusive of the tasks listed above? Especially if our growth has been pretty good and increasing from what was originally a standstill/plateau in our analytics."

I don't love the role, nor do I have a good working relationship with my coworkers. It's definitely not what I signed up for, but the flexibility (hybrid, and family friendly) and relatively reasonable wage for the role has held me there for the last 5 months.

I'm so torn.
Job hunting was hugely stressful for me as a single parent and sole breadwinner, and TBH, I took the first (and only) job offer that came my way. I'm not particularly keen on going through that again any time soon. Being unemployed for a period of time is not an option."

Last Friday, 14th of April, I did my interview with the head of the social media marketing team (I applied for a part-time position in the said department) and the company's co-founder. For me, the interview went great. I expressed myself almost perfectly and the overall vibe I was getting from the interviewers was very positive. At the end of the interview, I asked when would be this potential job could start. Because I was leaving the city for a week for the religious holidays. They said it would start on a date after my return. Everything is great so far. The co-founder said they would notify me of any results on April 17th because they don't like to make people wait. Well, it's the 18th and there haven't been any results yet. The holidays are between the 20th and 23rd so I couldn't be able to connect with them on those dates. My question is should I send a mail to them today on the results or just wait? Also, do you have any recommendations on what to say? Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you in advance!"

I was able to flex my schedule so that on Tuesdays I don’t start until the afternoon meaning I almost never have to use time off for doctors appointments. I WFH 3 days a week.

The problem is I make $42k before taxes and about $32k after tax. I can’t afford a 1 bedroom in my city. The only reason I’m comfortable is because my husband income is higher than mine. In my current role I will NEVER make more than $48k. Even my managers won’t make more than $55k. 

I want to make more money but I don’t know if that’s worth leaving a job where I have few complaints.

I moved to Tasmania, Australia, 2 months ago for university, despite looking for a job before moving,, and for the last 2 months, I've only had one interview.

I've had someone look over my resume and CV, tried Seek, sent out my CV and resume through both email and in person, and gotten help from my godmother, who I am currently staying with and who is a local.  My mum is paying my godmother $250 a week and is understandably getting pushier. There aren't any job fairs for another month, I can't find any local job boards, and I've run through my savings.

I am chronically ill, and I physically can't do retail work and can only do 24 hours a week due to university. Does anyone know what to do next? Although I don't run the risk of being homeless, I can't keep relying on my mother, and I can't apply for government help as I am only 20.

Any advice?"

At first they said “we will get back to you in 24 hours! And then it was rescheduled to 48, and then next Wednesday, and then a week from that day, and then the Thursday after that Wednesday, and now nothing. They said delays were from other interviews and the hiring manager being out of state.

I’m not sure if I should be worried about this because they aren’t giving me a yes, or if it’s good news that they haven’t told me no. I’m very frustrated because we asked them if there was any hesitation or any other questions they wanted to ask and they said they were satisfied. I’m just very frustrated with the situation and I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do.

This role is in the US, but they have offices overseas. 
They are requiring that I fill out a form detailing my criminal history. Around a year ago, I was subpoenaed to court in Spain for a shoplifting incident. Although I was reported to the local authorities (the Catalan Justice Administration), there was no official arrest that went on record for this incident, and I was officially acquitted. Also, I don’t know if this is an important detail, but the police never took a mugshot or took my fingerprints- they simply gave me a piece of paper with the of the trial. 

I am not sure whether to disclose this incident on the background check form, as they ask if there have been any incidents that have called my integrity or character into question. I was told that the Spanish court system is very outdated and there should be no record of my incident, but I’m concerned if there is any way that this background check may be able to find that I was subpoenaed to court or any other public and permanent file on my record. Ideally, I would like to put down “no” as my response to the question on the background check form and not have to reveal this information, but I don’t want to jeopardize my employment if they come across my record from Spain. 

Additionally, if I do disclose my shoplifting incident in the form, I am worried that this might hurt my employability, even though I don’t have a conviction on my record. I have already received and accepted my offer from my company, but I am concerned that they might revoke it."

&#x200B;

I see this daily. It works. Its true, and its life changing. Do these steps...  


1. Go get a cup of coffee or soda and sit by yourself and stare into the distance. Start thinking about all of the things in life (products and services) that you actually care about. Solar, coffee, construction, the little rubber things at the end of the pencil....dude, anything.
2. After you get your top 3, go home on indeed and type \[insert idea\] sales.
3. Apply to any and all. In sales, the company's name on your shirt really doesn't matter. I'll explain later.
4. You WILL get an interview rather quickly, hiring sales managers will take on anyone, you have no idea who can be a good sales rep. I BARELY look at resumes, or your history. The things you say on the phone are MUCH more important.
5. On that interview, (sales in general is very casual compared to the rest of the white collar positions) so be yourself. The 3 things ANY sales manager wants to hear is A), ""I am trainable,"" meaning you want to learn more about the product/service. B) You are energetic on the phone, they don't want to see the happiest person alive, but don't give a soft ""yea"" answer, slightly expand on it. and c) You want to learn how to be a better salesman (meaning you are showing that you want to learn how to be a salesman, while acknowledging that you are entry level

EVERYONE that I know that I have hired or has taken my advice to go into sales on any level has said, ""I don't think I'll be good at sales,"" or ""I don't want to be in sales and interact with others."" What they don't know is that if you REALLY like the product or service, its not work and you're just standing around talking about things you love with other people who love it as well. Most sale jobs are order taking, meaning you are not really hunting down new business as much as you think, depending on the product or service, most will come to you, you just need to try to upsell. Finally, if you actually do love the product/service, then it will be a LOT easier than you think.  


I do not know anyone in sales that makes less than 80-100k a year (on the lower end), working from home, 20ish hours a week. I have 12 or so people (I can show numbers as proof) that now have life changing money just because they applied. They went from a $15 worker to multiple 6 figures.  I hate people, I consider myself an introvert, and I refuse to go into an office. Strictly work out of my house.

If you live in the Northeast, I can give you 25 companies of different services that will hire you right now.  


Side Note: No matter what, DONT go into sales management. I mean, I did and I kind of regret it. We don't get paid as much and there is a LOT more stress, sales is probably the only career where I would recommend NOT getting promotions. Take a Senior Sales title and call it a day. I have a nice salary, but it doesn't make up for having to come in everyday, always be on call, etc."

I assumed for a few months they were automated emails powered by Indeed based on a user meeting some requirements of the job posting. I’ve replied by applying to a # of these (15 or so) that I was interested in, completed a # of skill assessments, but have yet to get an actual interview from these applications. (And yes… I also apply directly via the company’s website if posted.) 


I recently noticed one I received was “sent” from someone who I actually had a business relationship with in the past, leading me to believe she actually saw my Indeed resume. However, I’m guessing she is the registered Indeed user for this company’s account and the email is indeed (pun intended) automated. 

These emails are helpful in getting positions in front of you vs searching the site, I just have yet to get anywhere with them. 

Thanks for any insight & good luck out there.

I did 2 interviews at a large company, first interview was just short of 1 month ago, 2nd interview was ~2 weeks ago. 1st Interview was with the  Company founder and VP, second was with who would be my direct manager. I received a call on 4/10 from the founder asking how the second interview went and that I was the first choice candidate if I was still interested, I said I am definitely interested and that I felt that the interview went really well and gave some examples and they said they were going to make their final decision ""Friday or Monday"". I do want to note that I failed to follow up after the 2nd interview (oops, now I know for future). 

It's now Tuesday, and I know I can be impatient but I'm beginning to think I may actually be the 2nd choice based on other reddit threads and they're waiting for their 1st to answer. At the beginning of the first interview they said they're not rushing to fill the position they just want the right person. So my question is:
1. Should i wait until wednesday/Thursday to email and not rush them. 
2. Should I send an email today following up.
3. Should I state that I would be open to other positions within the company in the future? Appreciate any advice."

My boss is always working at the office so I assume this is why he wants me there and I have asked multiple times to work from home and he’s saying that I need to ask him each time… I mean this is BS.

When I’m given tasks or assignments, it feels like I’m just expected to know how to do it when I don’t. Don’t get me wrong, of course I spend time trying to learn and figure things out. But it feels like a from for me to just ask a question or not know something to some of my coworkers. This isn’t the case for everyone, but for my boss and a few senior guys, this is how it feels. On top of that, one of my senior coworkers loves to make comparisons and pick favourites with someone else that started around the same time as me.

All in all, I’m wondering if this is a valid reason for me to quit my job, or should I stay. I’m still quite young, but I just feel so unhappy and stressed for the wrong reasons while working here. It feels like a toxic work environment, but I’m just not sure… Would this be a common occurrence at other engineering jobs? Or is this a bad reason to quit my job and should I just stick with it?

Fast forward she never heard anything so she followed up with the HR representative the Tuesday following (4 days after she was told she would find out) and she was told by the HR rep that they were on vacation and wasn’t sure of where the team was at with a decision and she would get back to her as soon as she finds out (that was 8 days ago).

Hi all,

Background -
27 year old who graduated last year and I am currently working in a support role where I earn around £33,000. I don't enjoy my daily tasks or the sector, and feel like I've been stagnant for a while. Company are putting me through a qualification but there isn't a clear path of where I can move up to and when I've asked about this, my manager seems quite evasive. There have been some hints at where I could go, but I'm not even interested in the new responsibilities that they alluded to and feel like it would be monotonous tasks that I really don't enjoy or am stimulated by.

Opportunity -
I interviewed at a company today who offered £27,000 with bonuses, which would take me to around £35,000 if I hit my targets. The role has a managerial title, it sounds like there's more of a career path, it's in a sector I'm interested in and read up on daily, and there are more people my age who work in the company. Looking on LinkedIn and speaking with the interviewer, everyone who started at the title offered has moved up within a year. 

I'm really stuck and can't decide on what to choose. I feel like this opportunity would allow me to gain valuable experience in a field I'm interested in and really learn about a particular sector. The title would also give me credibility, thus putting me in a good position to move to other companies with a higher salary, in comparison to my current title. 

I do have the ability to save in my current role and am looking at getting a mortgage too, which doesn't look like it would be feasible if I took the new opportunity. Also the uncertainty of bonus every month worries me and I do feel like I need stability. I have arranged a call with the interviewer tomorrow to ask if they can match my current salary or at least £30,000

Would really appreciate some guidance, some follow up questions, and honest responses about what I should do.

Cheers"

It's a non profit. The position posting did not mention any travel but he verbally said this in our initial interview. I reached out and told him although I was super interested in the position I don't know if I could satisfy the travel requirement. I have TREMENDOUS anxiety. Just the thought of it makes me want to puke. I also have a flimsy car and I would travel 1.5-4 hours in it. We talked it over and he said that he was sure we could accommodate to do things all over teams and phone and that if there was need for travel the part timer can do it. Seems to me like they were gracious to accommodate. But still haven't received the offer. The manager called me last night to verbally offer the job and said they would be delighted to bring me on board. I lost my job 2 months ago. It's been hard not to have a job and i am excited about this job. What would you guys recommend i say if the travel part is required ? Or how to inquire about it before I accept?.

I’ve just recently finished my Masters, and am currently in the process of applying to jobs. I’ve been filling out application form after application form, and I have a question regarding equality,  diversity, and inclusion (EDI) personal data forms that are more often than not a part of applications nowadays.

I live in the UK and was born here. I’m a straight, white, cisgender, non-disabled male. I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts as to how I should approach filling out EDI forms? I have no idea how the process works, but would I be at a disadvantage when applying to jobs - as my sex, gender, ethnicity, sexuality etc. is ‘typical’, and I by no stretch of the imagination promote EDI? 😆😅

Just wondering what people’s thoughts are, and how would be best to go about this. Should I be honest and upfront? Rick ‘prefer not to say’? Is this even a potential disadvantage or am I overthinking things?

This morning HR got back to me and said that I could meet the team on THIS Friday. She also set up a meeting with a Talent Acquisition Specialist to discuss salary, etc. on Thursday morning. The job is on the east coast, and I live on the west, how am I supposed to fly out on such short notice? How can I make the HR meeting if I'm flying out?  


I want to respond to HR saying something like ""I would love to come on that day, but I am a little concerned about the logistics of how I'll be able to fly out to the east coast in time while also making the HR meeting."" Is that an inappropriate way to respond? I suspect some people might say this late notice is a red flag, but I think it was just a lapse in common sense, and my mistake for being so eager."

I'm also pretty good with excel, and I can do stuff in excel with csv files that most people need python for. 

My job was good until about a year ago, when prices in my area started going crazy, and I'm no longer able to make ends meet comfortably. I've seen the posts on reddit where people talk about stuff where they're making 100k more a year working a ridiculously easy second job doing data management, or report generation,  and I'm wondering if I can do it too. 

My current job is getting overwhelming, so I'm considering the possibility of updating my resume and moving on, but if there are jobs out there where I can hash together reports from different sources and produce output. 

Nothing of my job really needs to be done in-office. 

I guess I'm curious of how manageable these overemployment opportunities are, and what kind of job titles these employers are looking for. I plan on spending days on LinkedIn investigating, but having an understanding of where to start would be very helpful.

I'm really only making this post to vent, but also to remind people that actually need a job (unemployed and running out of funds) that maybe settling for that job you're over qualified for might be the right thing to take, at least temporarily. I'm lucky enough that I currently so have employment even if it's low I won't starve and I know not everyone has that luxury."

I didn't use their exact software. They use Inventor (to make manuals and blueprints of products), but I use Blender (which is a free 3D software mostly meant for movies/games).

They gave me a take-home assignment which I did with Blender, and which led to a final round interview.

During the interview, they asked me to describe how I made the diagram and when I told them I used Blender to make the model and then used GIMP (a 2D software) to trace over it, they looked a little shocked. They asked me would the model be reusable at any point in the future if they wanted to reference it and make new diagrams, and I said yeah.

I then told them that I'm willing to learn their software (Inventor) and I'm very quick at picking up new software. Despite that I still got rejected.

Is this common? I keep hearing all the time of people getting hired for jobs even though they don't use the exact software the company uses and the company doesn't care that much. A java programmer can easily get into a job that requires Python because they know that he/she can pick up Python in a few weeks because their fundamentals are in place. "

I've had a bad experience with temporary agencies here. They're shady and seem to all be sourcing the same jobs. Most jobs are backbreaking hard labor.

I'm currently a college student doing a fellowship at my university over the summer. I also work as a student assistant (only earning $11/hr and 20-25 hrs per week). About to get an apartment in the city bc my university ran into housing issues and more than 75% of the students were left out + it's in a city that has been recently going up on everything now that people from the north are moving down here. My rent will approximately be $650-$770. Even by working 25 hrs per week at my student job, I barely have enough for myself by the end of the month.

I wanted to get some advice on what I could do. I have no transportation of my own, I will probably live in the center of downtown, about 15 min walking distance from my school. My only experiences are as a front desk receptionist, in retail, and at Starbucks. I want to work as a librarian, an office assistant, or something where I wouldn't have to do much as I will also be doing my research and working.

Bartending is an option but most of the listings in the city are for hotels and looking for full-time. I'm trying to find something flexible or remote to do after my research or student job in the evenings. Preferably more than $15/hr as I would like to have some left over for other expenses for my apartment.

Thank you and appreciate it\~"

0,2023-04-18,Career advice for family whose expenses have grown but not income?,u/Wooden_Radish180,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12r1vro/career_advice_for_family_whose_expenses_have/,jobs,"I know that's vague. Though I may verbalize our ""tough position"" to my wife to emphasize our financial deficit,  we are not in a ""bad"" position financially. We can still buy food. I can still put gas in the car. We can still make a co-pay, etc.

Our ""problem"" is that our income is not matching our family expenses. I've done just about everything I feel I can do to reduce our expenses minus our kids extracurricular. However, even if we took them out of extra curricular, it doesn't ""fix"" our situation. Our problem has been that we probably need something like $160,000 per year between us. However we are at about $105,000 between us, but with 4 kids (10, 9, 2, and one on the way) and student loans. We're behind on rent, car payments, student loans, etc. I can catch something up, but can easily allow it to fall behind because I'm juggling financial resources all around. We have no credit card debt which I cleaned up years ago and am keeping us from going back down that route.

Right now our job situation is suitable for us in terms of family flow. We both work for the same organization. We live within walking distance from that organization. My wife works mainly remotely and sometimes on-site. I work on-site, but can work remotely. We have a lot of latitude to take care of family things at various times throughout the week. We have some on-site childcare at our organization which helps us both get work done while our older kids are at school. Lastly, I am the only driver and we have one car, so everything being within reach works very well for us.

The thought of looking for a higher paying job that may require me to travel away will be a major hit to us. Also if my wife went that route too, I sense we'd lose our financial gain by paying for more dedicated childcare.

The questions I have are based around alternative options. This is me exploring some thoughts that I might not be aware of. It is very possible that this may result in me simply having to find a job that pays more and dealing with the major dynamic shift for our family. However, I am curious about what might be available:

1. Are there completely remote jobs that are high paying enough to sustain a family of 6?
2. Are there completely remote, task oriented jobs that can provide great additional income for someone already with a full-time job?
3. Are there wealthy people out there starting businesses that are willing to pay well for someone to help their startup function even in the simplest of roles.
4. Should I even consider asking people for gift help even though we're working parents?
5. Overall, if I can't expect my income to simply double with a single new job, should I be grinding for multiple streams of passive income?

I ask those questions because I am looking to think out of the box of my current/career role as a visual/graphic/video/media production designer in marketing. I've done Strengths Finders and my top 5 are ""Relator, Adaptability, Maximizer, Developer & Futuristic"" which makes me wonder if there are roles that I am not even considering that could help change our trajectory.

I guess this is more career advice question from a man who needs some seizmic shifts for a family with expenses that have not been matched by income over the past several years."

Typically, I've been in the same position as everyone else on the sub, having to spend three or six months, and sometimes more, looking for jobs. I think this is why it went different this time:
- Using a strong resume showing 10 years of experience to ""quick apply"" to anything and everything even remotely close to the kind of work I want to do
- Filtering job postings down to those posted in the last 24 hours and being one of the first people to apply
- Asking for a higher wage than I would have before - I think this shows confidence 
- Luck - let's face it; luck is always part of it


My stats for more context:
- I work in marketing
- I am 30ish

As the title suggests, I (20M, living in the US) am about to graduate with my associate degree with zero debt. I'm still living with my parents for the time being (for which I am incredibly fortunate), and have about 4k in savings.

I've finally decided what I want to do with my life---commercial airline piloting. Getting certified is obviously an expensive endeavour, but I'm certain this is what I want.

I'm having trouble navigating the finances of flight school. Based on my prospective school's pricing, it adds up to just shy of 67k total, including private, instrument, commercial, multi-engine training, and flight instruction certification.

There is a Sallie Mae alternative loan option for students like me, but I'm skeptical of private loan institutions, and would rather avoid them if I could (though I'm not against taking out this loan if it gets me through flight school).

My plan right now is to build a credit history after I graduate through careful usage of a credit card and a part-time/full time job. This will help me qualify any loans should I end up needing one as well as build some healthy savings. Aside from these things, what else can I do to better prepare myself for the financial hurdle ahead?

If anyone has any advice, I am all ears. Thanks for reading."

I knew it would be a temporary situation but I decided to take the risk and jump into the startup world. 

After working to build a better customer support process internally, was offered a full-time position with the company. Needless to say, the risk I took 100% paid off! I've never been happier in a workplace and I actually enjoy the speed of the startup. I'm getting great experience in all aspects of the business which is something that I never expected nor was I experiencing in my previous role.

Everyone out there, good luck, and keep your head up. It's a brutal market out there but remember you're not alone!"

712,2023-04-18,Job searching is so unbelievably draining,u/sakuramoons,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12r5d9t/job_searching_is_so_unbelievably_draining/,jobs,"Not sure if it just me, but I find the search for employment so mentally and physically exhausting. I’ve also found it humiliating and humbling at times. I think we can all agree that the job market is tough at the moment, really tough. ‘Entry level’ jobs want 5 years experience, jobs that pay minimum wage want experience, jobs that are open to all ages want experience. It’s just a shambles. I spend most of my evenings scrolling through so many irrelevant jobs on Indeed or Facebook just to find one that sparks my interest. Then, once I’ve finished reading the job description, the long list of ‘requirements’, I slowly close the browser and Indeed and give up. 

I’ve had a few people who have said to me that the best thing you can do for yourself is hand in your CV to the jobs you think you don’t stand a chance of getting, but even after trying this I keep falling short. I like to think of myself as relatively well educated, but I’ve found that companies could literally not give less of a shit when it comes to trying to get a job. 

I’ve been looking for nearly a year for a full time position, I recently took a job offer and began a new job three weeks ago but have very quickly come to realise that it is not for me. The biggest pain in the arse is having to go back to the drawing board with applications, cover letters, interviews and all those things that come with it that i thought i was through with. I hope something comes up soon that i actually stand a chance for. All the jobs ive applied for that i desperately wanted I have been unsuccessful with and that can be pretty gutting. Like most people, I just need a job that will bring money in at this point as i cant afford to live in the current climate as i have been doing. 

To all of you who are in the same position as me, I hope that you get an offer soon from your dream job or at least one that you are going to enjoy. This group makes me feel a little less alone about it all at least."

When he asked what my salary would have to be I responded with a number on the higher side for someone with my experience ect. He said that wouldn’t be an issue. 

I guess my question is how do I prepare? And how do I ultimately calm my nerves heading into such an ambiguous situation.

I’ve been offered another job now, with better pay +$8,700 and slightly better time off and offers hybrid work. Seems like a no brainer - the issue is that I’ve been trying to get out of the public sector. Every full time job I’ve had since graduating college has been with a governmental organization. I have mostly found the work to be dull, the public can be  exhausting, and I find that many of my coworkers and I value different things in a workplace. So I’ve been hoping to branch out and try something different and am quite excited about the original job I accepted. It’s with the premier regional foundation in our area and seems like a really great environment. I feel like there’s a lot to learn, and that is exciting to me. Anyways - thoughts? I know which job I want but my husband has just graduated medical school with a load of debt, and will be in residency for the next three years making $55,000, no wiggle room. I’ve gotten conflicting advice from family and friends. One friend thinks I should take the new offer to my new organization and see what they can do. I worry I will start out on the wrong foot, and they already negotiated to offer me $5,000 above their listed range. Anyways, thoughts please!"

Context: I’ve been working at firm A for about 7 months now and though my anxiety tells me I’ll get fired any day, I still carry on and try my best to cope. I’m not very good at my job and my boss, including my coworkers, know that. They’ve adjusted because of it and have let me slowly progress into their firm. I feel like I’m treated like a little brother here right now. The advice and help I’ve received from my boss here have really put me into a close relationship with them. When I think of leaving, my brain tells me to stop. The firm isn’t anything big however and it wouldn’t really help progress me anywhere further in careers as well.

Present: I recently attended a career fair just to get a scope of what’s out there and ended up getting interviews for two other firms( let’s call them firm B and firm C). Both of these firms are exclusively bigger than firm A and would realistically propel me to a higher standing after working there. The thing is that I feel like the same issues I have at firm A I’ll have at the other two. There’s also a huge chance that I won’t be treated like how I was at firm A there as well. 

I guess my issue right now is that I’m too attached to firm A and don’t know how to detach to Firm B or C.

Should I leave Firm A? Are my feelings justified? Is the risk worth it? Will I get over this?

Thanks Reddit."

At my old job I never felt the need to take time off when burnt out and if I did I had PTO or could just ask guilt free whereas here there’s no PTO, and there’s lots of guilt for asking for time off.

I genuinely don’t know if something’s wrong with me because I quit my old job after a year from being bored and burning out and now that I’m here for a year I’m leaving because it’s demanding when I can’t care about it anymore.

I’m worried I’ll carry this into my next job too. I just can’t find something that excites me to no end.

How do I deal with this?"

Can somebody tell me about those days when any degree and a firm handshake would get you a job that you can live off of? When was that? The 1990s and before? When do you think times will get better because this has been the environment I grew up in."

I found a position at a big tech company that looks right up my alley, but have some reservations about job security, what with all the tech layoffs in the news right now. The last thing I would want is to leave my current job, head over to a tech company, and be laid off within the first 6 months of starting.

1,2023-04-18,GS position classification...help.,u/bubba_lexi,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12rb39q/gs_position_classificationhelp/,jobs,"**Context:** I'm a GS 4 at a military hospital in a newly created Information Receptionist position (0304). They originally created my position to relieve the soldiers who sit staff duty so they can attend their sections and to create consistency in the section since it was transient. Each day I have one soldier with me (PVT-SPC) to cover when I step away for lunch and to assist with answering phones; a different one each day.
**
The issue:** It did start as a simple information desk job. However, it has transformed into something different. Each day I have to start fresh training the soldier assigned with me, I go over codes + emergency procedures, the leave SOP, visitor pass SOPs, patient types and eligibility, appropriate offices for issues, and step in to assist ""my soldier"" with difficult situations with patients; I have to take responsibility when they make mistakes or make someone upset since I am rated for complaints. They turn to me when they need help, Which is constantly since once again, they are fresh. They stacked ""staff duty"" and ""customer service training guru"" onto my information receptionist job, and I took the role of the SGT that used to be there; that comes with much more responsibility. Additionally, I provide guidance to admin about hangups in our internal processes by taking feedback from patients, I address safety and security concerns with the respective teams, and call in work orders for all the sections, keep track of and make public announcements for company events and seeking information. I feel like I have my hands in everything in the hospital, but I'm the lowest GS in the bldg. Shoot, I even initiate evacuations when there is a fire drill and take accountability for the building while coordinating with safety and security teams. I'm never supervised and fix issues whenever I can. I rarely raise issues with my rater, except to escalate and fix them if they need to be resolved higher in the chain.

**The part where I ask for advice:** I have a new rater and we plan to discuss my PD because many of my extra tasks arent listed and take a lot of time and expertise; But upon research in FASCLASS, it says that 0304 (information receptionist) can only go up to GS4. I know I'm performing above that level and have contributed much to the company and my section. Is there anything I should bring up in the meeting, any advice? My goal is to get paid appropriately for the extra tasks I have to take on.

**Conclusion:** Believe it or not...I do love this job and feel like I make a difference for the company. I love that I'm able to provide advice to the soldiers who work with me; I like working with them and helping them. It's just weirdly...disheartening when people above me and section heads stop by the desk to compliment me and say how much I helped them, smoothed things out, reduced confusion, streamlined processes, and gave them great advice. Yet, I don't feel like I'm sitting at the table with them. Thanks for reading."

0,2023-04-18,I got fired from Intel for not keeping up to speed. What do you guys think?,u/dahomiesilent,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12rbjv6/i_got_fired_from_intel_for_not_keeping_up_to/,jobs,"I (23M) got a job at Intel nearly three weeks ago. I applied as an inventory technician which are in charge of keeping track of inventory and providing data through an excel spreadsheet. In the job site, you need your own windows laptop. In this case, the supervisor would order you one to pick up. The hours were from 8-5 Monday to Friday. The job was lenient towards arriving on time. As long as you show up before 8:20, it didn’t affect your work performance. One of the bosses would sometimes show up at 8:20-8:25. Every now and then, I did show up slightly after 8:20 and my team members didn’t seem to care. 

Throughout the first week, I didn’t do much as my team didn’t really train me on the Intel website. As a result, I had to sit down and watch them work. Whenever, I asked them if they needed any help, they would respond with no. While they were working, I was scrolling through my phone(which I regret later on). Every now and then, they would send me to shipping and receiving to unbox anything such as cables and SSD. In the inventory team, I would be assign to count hardwares or count to a certain number such as 250 usb and place it in a bin. When the lead couldn’t find task for me to do, they thought of sending me home early, but they couldn’t 

In the second week, I was finally able to use my laptop. Every now and then, they would assign me to scan the serial number and QDF of CPU and sending the spread sheet to my team members. After that, it was a repeat of the first week.

In the third week, I learned the required info needed for the labels of CPU’s. In order to access the info, you needed to log into the Intel website and it will tell you. During that week, I didn’t have much experience with any of the websites that they were using. In the middle of the week, I get called into the office by my supervisor. After I arrived, he wanted to keep an update of my work experience so far. After I told him what I knew, he said that I’m really behind with what I should’ve known. He states that I wasn’t engage or active with my team members work because I was on my phone. Meaning, I should’ve watched my team members work all day. Also, I wasn’t asking any questions. In my defense, I didn’t ask because I didn’t want to bother them while they were working. Considering I was new, I thought they would teach me whenever they had the chance. During the first week, I would rest my eyes because there weren’t any tasks to do. And, my supervisor thought I was sleeping. After that, they sent me back to work. I decided that I was gonna be more active and ask more question. The next day, one of my team members finally taught me something. It was mainly just updating data and sending that information to the supervisor. In the same day, they hired five new employees. In their second and third day, they would go through training such as using the Intel website. On the other hand, I spent two weeks doing the same tasks with not much experience with the website. I spent most of the time doing small projects. 

In the fourth week, I spent the first day counting hardware and sending them to where they deploy all accessories. During that time, there was another employee that I didn’t recognize and she was getting trained on using the Intel website. I never understood why they couldn’t have one of the new employees with small projects while I get trained on using the website. The next day, I get assigned to remove labels on all of the empty CPU treys. In the middle of the task, I get called by my supervisor to meet with him. When we got to the hallway, he told me that he was going to end my contract with the company and return my laptop to him. According to him, he stated that it’s because of poor work performance and not keeping up to speed. It didn’t make sense because I managed to finish most my tasks before the end of my shift. Also, they never gave me a list of assignments that needed to be done at a certain time or date.  They would just assign me small projects left to right. The company doesn’t like it when you try to stay to finish your tasks after the end of your shift. It didn’t bother any of my team members if a task wasn’t done before the end of the shift. 

I’m still trying to process what just happened. It was partially my fault, but I feel  like the company lack of planning and preparedness should be blamed as well. 

What do you guys think? I’m open to different answers."

I recently received an email around 9pm from a small IT company in Fairfax, VA for a software engineer intern position. The email stated that I was scheduled for an interview the next day(12 hours after the email was sent to me) and asked me to confirm my availability between 10 am to 5 pm. The next morning, I had an email correspondence interview meaning the interview where the interviewer sends a set of questions to the interviewee via email, and the interviewee responds with their answers. The interviewer and interviewee do not communicate in real-time but rather through a series of email exchanges, and just six hours after the interview, I received a congratulatory email from the recruiter, offering me the position with detailed information on salary, benefits, and next steps.

I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar hiring process with Encentric Inc and can confirm the legitimacy of their process? I did some research on the company and it looks to be a legitimate business, but I'm still a bit wary of such a quick hiring process.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Encentric Inc or any other companies with a similarly fast hiring process? I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences."

But once I got to the interview and learned more about the program I really liked it and will consider it if I am offered. 

My question is when looking at their website I see the next position up (I am qualified for) is still available. Would it be acceptable to ask if I could be considered for that position? Do you think it would ruin my chances with my company in general? 

I just don’t want to sell myself short of opportunities or pay wise. I applied for both positions but got called in for an interview for the lower position first (probably because I applied to that one first)"

But when will it come, like I have to keep pushing myself to learn and work on myself... but then this is uncertainty and not knowing what I am doing fucks me sometimes, I just want to know what I have to do... without any confusion....

8,2023-04-19,Are you struggling to find a new job after a layoff? I was too!,u/oldwornpath,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12rgmla/are_you_struggling_to_find_a_new_job_after_a/,jobs,"I was laid off last fall and after taking some time off, I got really serious about job searching in January. I landed a job this month (junior level role in marketing). Here's some advice for all you currently on the hunt:

Don't give up! Don't believe any of that negative crap people are throwing around. Stop doubting yourself and do everything you can to present the best version of yourself. It took me a while to come to terms with how fake you have to be when writing a resume or interviewing but just do it. It is a process but you can do it. If you got laid off, it means someone hired you there and odds are you were decent (or amazing) at your job - so be positive and reflect on your strengths! Don't focus on your layoff but you **must** be able to talk about your last role without being emotional - again, this will take time. Do lots of research on resume writing and watch youtube videos that break down how to answer every common interview question. There are so many videos from current or ex recruiters that tell you what the common interview questions actually mean and how to build a strategy for answering them. It's time consuming but it will pay off. Preparation will make you so much more confident going into the interview.

I applied to over 150 jobs. I still haven't heard back from probably 95% of them. Yes, it's ridiculous. I never really had a solid schedule but I was consistently applying through job boards (and directly on the company sites) from January to mid March. Nothing is wrong with job boards. I got my job through Indeed. Also, the role I took wasn't even the one I applied to! You never really know what other jobs companies are hiring for but not actively advertising. Some of it is luck, for sure. But it's not about networking or building an entire website to promote your personal brand - my advice: don't waste your time. I honestly think I succeeded because I kept my approach simple and learned a few lessons the hard way (bombed a few interviews).

Finally, it's super unfortunate but **people will try to take advantage of you since you are unemployed** (and therefore at least a little desperate). Stay calm and composed but don't give in. Always negotiate the salary. They expect you to do that. If they're moving fast and give you an offer the next day, great! But make sure you take some time to review your options. No one is forcing you to sign that offer letter so understand that you have the freedom to do what's best for you. If it's not good, walk. You'll find something better.

I hope this is helpful and I'm happy to answer questions if you have any!"

He even keeps up with new technology and softwares. The only thing is that he’s not that fluent in English. He can understand and speak it, just not as fast. He has applied to several jobs by now but very few are interested and when they are, they end up choosing someone more fluent.

We're a smaller company based in NYC and business is slow right now due to lack of customers and the recession scare. We came to an agreement that I can cash at least one check a month to cover my rent. But the delay of cashing checks have made me use up all my savings and max out my credit card as this has been going on since December. The check I cashed last week was for mid February. I agreed to this because we are focusing on sales and getting new customers since January but the customers coming in didn't pay as much as our previous customers. I know that the company is struggling financially as I'm the manager and review the P/L statements for the month. This job pays extremely well... when I can cash the check. But I'm getting impatient and my savings are running dry. The others in the company are in the same agreement as me to delay checks but they're older than me and probably have more savings. My question is, if I call the department of labor, what will happen to the company? Will they have to close? I know I will have to find another job, but part of me thinks if I hold on maybe we will get more customers over the summer and everything will resume as normal."

So I had to reschedule and got ghosted. I was told by my partner that this is a bad idea. Because it signals to the other employers that you are not that eager to work there. I should’ve just taken a sick day instead.

I don’t know if I agree. Obviously the answer is almost always “it depends” but an interview doesn’t guarantee a job and you’ll likely go through multiples of them before landing something new. It wouldn’t make sense to jeopardise your current job performance and by extension, current employment for something that may or may not work out.

Personally, I think if an employer isn’t flexible about interview schedule when hiring for currently employed employees, that’s kind of a red flag.

Any perspective on this? Thanks in advance."

I hope this message finds you well, This is Name. A former commercial wireman under the IBEW, I previously worked under Coltrane systems and KayBee electric. I worked for the IBEW from October 28th 2019, to about October 19th 2020.

I admittedly left the IBEW because I was young and dumb. There was a couple small things that maybe led me in the wrong direction like working under an apprentice for my first 2 months of being with a company, or getting a DWI with the substance being supplied by the company while I was underage. Or trying to work two jobs to try and keep up on my bills and being greedy. These are things I cannot blame anyone for as I am my own man and I made the decisions to drink when I shouldn’t have been and also overworking myself. Like I said before, young and dumb. I take full responsibility for my own actions and my irresponsible choice to brush away an amazing career. Being a young man that joined the IBEW straight out of high school, I wasn’t ready for such a commitment. 

It’s been almost 2 1/2 years since I left the IBEW and I’m realizing what I’m missing out on with the career I so recklessly abandoned. I would like to ask the board of the IBEW, to employ me again as a commercial wireman. As a growing and learning young man, I acknowledge my mistakes and I’m looking to right my wrongs. My work ethic and determination has grown enormously for the past 2 1/2 years as I’ve curbed most of my vices and young ways. I’m looking to pick back up on the amazing opportunity I once had and run with it. I loved working for the IBEW because I was learning something new every single day, I loved completing each task that was thrown at me because it once seemed overwhelming. I’m looking to grow as a young man and learn this skill and career to my very best ability. I’d hope to be a committed and hard worker the IBEW can rely on, unlike before. 

I’d just like to say a quick thanks for giving me your time and consideration of rehiring me. I’m thrilled I’m making my way back into the great opportunities that lie within the IBEW. I’m a hard working young man looking to put my efforts into something that really matters. My phone number is (314)-307-0183, I’m available to come and interview any time because as of now I work over nights. I’m excited to hear back and work my way back into the IBEW!

Warm regards,
Name

This might be very off-topic and potentially be on the wrong subreddit but I'm not sure what's the right one is. 

I just found out over the weekend that my poor mother who barely speak the language was let go from her job because I made a mistake while making an urine test appointment for her and the whole process got her fired. 

Detail here: my mom was a contractor (assembly labor) for a few months, and the employer (Stryker, Redmond, WA) decided to hire her so she was required to go through an onboarding process which involves background check and drug screen. My mom was very anxious about the whole thing since she speaks very little English. She was constantly asking for help. Yes, I was annoyed, but I helped. But I felt like I didn't put in my 100%. I recently just completed an onboarding process myself, so I thought I knew the basics of it. My mom told me that her co worker recommended us to make an appointment for a urine test which I find unreasonable because I never had to but it turns out thr facility they sent my mom to did need it. So I made the appointment on Lapcorb. Here's my mistake. Instead of selecting pre-employment screening, I selected urine test>pre-employment option. They also ask for 25$ non refundable fee, which I gladly paid. I thought it was weird, but I'd do anything to complete that task so that my mom could stop bothering me. On appointment day, she called me frantically and said that they refused her service because it was the wrong type of appointment. So we called the 3rd party company that does the onboarding and they told us to schedule another appointment which is past the deadline because that's how busy those places were (I've checked with the availability locations within 50 miles radius of us).
So they told us to inform our onboarding team or manager. I had no information on the onboarding tea,  and neither did my mom so weemailedl her manager. No response so we thought things were fine. Come another appointment day, mom called again, saying that her confirmation code for the screening had expired because it was only valid to the deadline. This was something that the onboarding (Sterling) service should have told us. So we again contacted them and they advise us to contact the onboarding team again and have them send sterling a request for anotheconfirmationon code. So I reached out to the manager again. No response. The coming workday, my mom called me and said that the company is going to have to let her go due to her failing to complete the drug screen. I was confused so she had me speak with the HR. HR told me that we needed to reach out to the onboarding team if we had any issues with the appointment. I told her I've reached out to the manag, r who should've guided us to the correct channel but he never even responded. HR said that we can contest the decision with the onboarding team. I sent them screenshots of appointment confirmation emails and my email with the manager and details for each screenshot. They said thewouldll review. She also said that we should've received an email from the onboarding team to contact them if anything went wrong which we later found in spam folder. A wlaterfter, I talked to my mom, and she mentioned that she was let go and her last day was yesterday. My heart dropped. I've never felt so guilty. But I instantly became angry because they never even responded with the reason and their official decision. I'm on anti-depressants, and this is still keeping me up at night and gives me really bad anxiety for a week now. What can I do? 

TLDR:
Made wrong appointment for a drug screen and missed deadline. Provided the company the reason and proo,  and they still fire my mom because we didn't notify the onboarding team. 

Sorry for my grammar and misspelled."

A few days ago I got a LinkedIn message from a recruiter who is working for a competitor and they are hiring for a Market Development Manager. Now, a lot of the role are things that I am familiar with due to my current position, just amplified a bit. But other things are totally new to me, plus I really don't feel ready to lead a team and make management decisions quite yet!

I'm not necessarily considering taking the position, as again I do really love the company that I am with, but it got me thinking, at what point will I be ready to move into management? Is it normal to move up so quickly? Is it normal to take a management position while not being fully qualified for the role yet?

I need a job, and I already have 1 PT job, but hoping to get a second one. 

I have 2 interviews lined up for today and tomorrow, but the problem is...they dont pay as well as I hope. And I may be able to negotiate, but I doubt they will bump up as much as Im hoping, BUT something is better than nothing.

I found another PT job closer to home, and it pays well, so I applied. But what happens if I get a job offer and I then interview with the better company and then also get a job offer? 

I can hop ship, but I am wondering how I dont burn the bridge because it's complicated to find good jobs at libraries in my area. So I hope to maybe not burn the bridge and then set myself up for failure.

Any advice?"

I work in higher Ed and was recently offered/accepted a “dream job” if such a thing exists. The job includes on campus housing, which is something I’ve never done before. I was hesitant about living in staff housing but with the way the rental/housing market is right now I figured free housing is worth whatever downsides might come with it. Now here I am less than a week away from moving 5 hours away to a new state to move into a new apartment and start this new job and they still haven’t told me where I’m living or given me an address. I’ve followed up about it weekly since signing my offer letter 5 weeks ago and am told over and over again that they’re still deciding. I’m incredibly irritated. Beyond the small issues this causes, like I’m not able to book movers until I have an address, I’m irritated about how nonchalant they’re being about it. Like this is my real actual LIFE and what is supposed to be my new home and I’m already getting brushed off by higher ups. This is a terrible first impression and I just can’t comprehend why they don’t give an F??

At this point my current lease ends at the end of the month and I’ve already left my old job. If I had the time and money to find new living arrangements and a job in my current city, I’d probably tell this new job to forget about it because this is ridiculous. But I’m pretty much helplessly locked in because I need a place to live and healthcare. Anyone else get a major ick from a new job before it even started? Did you get over it or did it end poorly? I don’t even know what to do about it or say to them."

A friend is scared to tell his new employer that he is going to have a child (mid to late May birth). The child will be born in Mexico. He's afraid that if he tells them, he will be fired. He was laid off back in Dec. Took him a while to find this job. Just got hired April 10th. One of the background check questions was if he had any relatives or family overseas. His answer is ""no"" which is the truth since the baby wasn't born, yet.

But now it's getting closer to the baby's date, he's getting concerned. PLUS he's not entirely sure if that is even his baby. He had a one-night stand with the baby's mother. She claimed it's his. He said he will do a paternal test when the baby arrives. If it is truly his, then he will take responsibility in raising the child. Apparently that baby's mom doesn't want to move to USA. So no go in her and the baby living in the USA. The job requires that he work in the USA.

I told him the truth is the best policy. He works remote so technically he can work in Mexico, but with the approval from the employer first. What would you do? Tell or no tell??"

This morning I received a message to talk on Signal and he asked all the generic questions that I was asked last time someone offered a fake job.

Work has been really slow lately because we had a work halt order on our main project. I work for a large company and got an email that they needed people to go out to a hazardous waste site for two weeks. I figured why not and my boss and I got everything ready for me to deploy last week. I had to finish a 40-hour HAZWOPER course and get an extensive physical exam. No one contacted me to confirm if I was going last week so I was a little confused. Yesterday one of the coordinators called me to say someone was compiling a list of eligible people and asked if I was still interested. I said yes, however, I have to be in the field for another project on May 8th so I would basically have to go tomorrow in order for the two projects not to overlap AND I would basically only have a day's turnaround.  

Now I don't even want to go but I feel compelled to because my company spent money on my training and I do not want my boss to get in trouble for wasting the company's time. In order for this to work, I would have to book my flight on Friday (haven't had confirmation yet) and then get back on Saturday, May 6th. I haven't even gotten work on what I would be paid and what kind of work I would be doing.

My current job gives me no support at all, I am overworked, there is no career growth for me, the expectations and demands are unrealistic even when I set realistic boundaries - I feel so alone and isolated. Not to be dramatic, but I literally feel like I am deteriorating as a person with each day that passes. I am barely eating, barely sleeping, have severe anxiety and borderline depression - tbh, I can't even muster up the energy to shower anymore. I am suffering from the most severe case of burnout and cry myself to sleep every other night. The only thing going for me at this job is that I have a pretty good salary. Sucks that it seems like you can only pick either mental stability or financial stability. I'm scared to take FMLA or any more time off because I have already dealt with unrelated health issues earlier this year and even if I take FMLA, I don't think I would get paid my full salary. I feel stuck because I probably only have savings to stay afloat for 1 month.

What makes it harder is that I am applying for jobs in my industry and even slightly outside my industry that I am very qualified for, but am barely making any progress. I know people say not to take it personally, but it's freaking hard. I don't know how much longer I can job search. I have made so many revisions to my resume and I really wish someone would take a chance on me because I do believe I have so much potential that I could contribute to a company who would take that chance on me. The competition and over saturation in my field doesn't help either. I need to get out of my current job ASAP because I honestly feel like it is killing me.

I have concluded a BSc in biology and worked as a lab technician for about a year. I recently started n MSc in psychology (not accredited) due to my interest in working in mental health. 

I live in Oxford, UK, and want to start looking for a role in mental health that would give me some entry experience. 

I have seen many entry-level roles on paper, but when you read the requirements, they want you to have accreditation and/or experience. 

Does anyone know of roles that don't require experience or accreditation and would give me some experience until I finish my degree? 

Ideally, I would like to work with older students at a college or university and have an advisor sort of role.

I have a ""non-typical"" post interview follow-up question:

I had an interview last week and during the course of the interview it became clear that my background didn't match up with what the role was looking for.  I have some of the skills/experience but not perfect match by any means.

However, at the end of interview the hiring manager made a recommendation that he had a different open position that better aligned with my experience.  He sent me an email shortly after the interview with a link to the new position and stated ***""Let me know and I can provide more details on agenda for the next call""***

I replied and said I was interested and applied via the website to the new position.

That was one week ago and I havn't heard anything yet.  

I have a couple of questions: 

* Is a week too soon to follow-up?
* Should the follow-up be anything more than a friendly check-in asking about timeline?

Thanks for your thoughts

I already maxed out our overtime limit (we can’t get over a certain amount and can’t be payed out), so I can’t stay longer at work.
Somehow everyone just kind of expects me to meet my deadlines even though I communicate from the start how understaffed I am and how it’s impossible to meet normal deadlines. Whenever I tell my manager about this problem, they’ll say something like: “It’ll get better”.
Do you think I could do anything better or different to meet everyone’s expectations or am I just at an unfortunate time I have to get through?"

This company is huge for my career and I’ve never really had to negotiate, or have a “job offer discussion” or anything like that so I am super nervous and worried about this meeting.

About 3 weeks into the job, I started getting high fevers and noticed my jaw was burning hot. Went to the dentist and was told I had a huge abscess and needed to have my tooth pulled right away. A few days later, I notice a huge piece of bone poking from my gums and stabbing the inside of my cheek. Went back to the dentist, and she said she doesn't want to remove it because it's actually a huge piece of my jawbone from a fractured socket due to the extraction. She made it more bearable to deal with, gave me meds, said the bone should reattach. Took me about 4 days total of going to work on and off to feel better and start to heal finally.

The entire time I kept my boss updated, and provided doctors notes for every occasion. She kept reassuring me that everything is okay with my job, and all they care about is me getting better and taking care of my health.

I start coming into work feeling a ton better and work a few days. Then fast forward to last Friday April 14th, I work the entire 8-5 shift, and I get pulled into the office 20 mins before 5 with my boss telling me that the director had decided to let me go and that, that day would be my last working with them. Signed some paperwork, returned my stuff, cried.

My boss was even crying while letting me go because she didn't want to have to fire me, it was all the directors decision apparently. I was given NO prior warning and was blind sided by this decision.

I'm extremely sad because I genuinely loved my job there and all my coworkers. My boss constantly told me that I was performing very well and was very competent in my work and caught on more quickly than anyone she's ever trained in her 17 years of working there.


I live in an ""at-will"" state so I know there's not much I can do when it comes to any wrongful termination, I don't think. I just find it ironic that despite all the reassurance, and what this department does for housing the homeless, that it's ridiculous I got no prior warning or anything before being fired. just left to deal with potentially becoming homeless again on a whim. Crazy to me.


Some questions:
Should I put this job on my resume still? otherwise, I'll have a big gap in employment again.

And would I be able to get unemployment even though I was only there for a month?

How do I move on from this huge loss considering the circumstances? I've been frantically looking for another job to avoid homelessness again. I absolutely hate this."

They are more technical but I’m shocked by their attitude (didn’t congratulate the other person and were salty AF to everyone). I’m disappointed in my manager and think it’s a sign to learn all I can and look elsewhere. Has anyone else had this?

ETA - thanks for all the responses. Just to clarify, I’m not seeking promotion and have been the person carrot-dangled to in the past so get it but there are ways to make your unhappiness known. If you direct it at **everyone** because you’re not getting what you feel you deserve from management then it’s a dick move and to let it slide is a toxic environment (for me)."

I started this role fresh out of college and chose the company based on its growth and internal employee development promises. When I joined the team, it was a team of 8 + a branch manager. Within my first six months, every team member was either fired or quit (including the manager), leaving me as the sole employee on the team. I didn't complain or slack off; I assured the SVP (now semi-overseeing me remotely) that I was dedicated to this office and believed we could rebuild a fantastic team. 

The SVP and president of our division told me they would rebuild a team around me, commended my metrics and work ethic, and thanked me relentlessly for my loyalty. FOUR MONTHS after being the sole member of my team without a bonus, raise, or complaint, the SVP externally hired a branch manager from a different industry. On the new manager's first day, they employed two additional team members, and I am so excited to rebuild our team. 

They don't involve me in hiring or training the two new team members, and my manager only does one training day?!? Two weeks later, during my one-on-one, my manager told me it was my last day and said, ""I don't feel we need to go into detail; I just feel this is the best thing for the team."" and then hung up. (I live in CO - an at-will state, by the way).

My coworkers, my previous interim supervisors, and I were all gobsmacked. What the hell happened? Was this my fault? MOST IMPORTANTLY: What do I say about my situation/""reasons for leaving"" in interviews/with new prospective employers??

Potential vital details: 

* I work in a sales role, and the manager also sells, so we compete for business (flawed design, in my opinion), and once I was fired, they absorbed my entire book of business.
* My one-on-one the week before was entirely positive.
* I exceeded my metrics every month.

TL;DR: How do I explain looking for a new role after ten months of employment when I was terminated without reasoning"

If I continue with the course at the latest I only want to stay for 6)7 more months but Idk if my mental health can take it. I don't know if I should just cancel it or go through with it because I can technically just self study for the certs myself.

My actual reasoning is my mental health and that I was in a treatment facility for months eventually running out of protected leave. I really disliked my job and I was worried going back would send me back to a facility. But I don’t want to give this reason.

I found a role that I am interested in and the job description states that the base salary is 55k/year, with OTE of 75k/year, and uncapped commission. What exactly does uncapped commission mean? Does this mean that 20k of my OTE is commission payments? If so, what happens if I exceed my OTEs? For context I am coming from a roll that is 100% commission. When I negotiate my salary, how can I negotiate the variables in my salary if it's uncapped? I obviously understand the premise that you can make as much as you want, but how does that actually work? Do other companies have a standard in terms of what commission you get from each deal?

I went to my job and asked my co-worker, she didn’t know and said she’ll call the district manager to get it fixed.

Nothing changes after a couple days so I contact my assistant manager who tells me the district manager was watching my and another coworker’s performance and told him to wipe us from the schedule immediately. I never have been late to work, I never would hold loads of conversation with coworkers; I was pretty quiet. I loved and respected my customers. I did everything I was told to do. I didn’t receive a message until today after contacting corporate through Twitter. This is what I received. Shes very passive aggressive and childish in the subject title. The email says:


Subject: Terminatio 

Hello,
This is Tameka, district manager. We are an at will employer, which means we can terminate an employee without notice. We can also remove you from the schedule without notice. 

Thanks,

Tameka (her last name here)
District manager

I have never met nor was aware of a district manager so her existence wasn’t known until my coworker told me. How do I proceed? I still want to know what I was fired for. I have never been fired by a job before. I am also still receiving emails (2 today) about specials our guests and payment errors involving the corporation and its employees."

However, I've struggled so much in this role that I just want out. I'm planning on going back to grad school to finish up an MPH that I had to put on pause halfway through a couple years ago due to medical issues. This will begin in August of this year, so I have a few months.

Should I stay with the current job, that I hate, until I start the program? Or, should I try to find a new job and only stay for a few months and bail? I hate the first idea, because I hate the job, but it seems less shitty to the employer. The second idea makes me feel bad for staying at a job for just a few months.

19,2023-04-19,Should I accept a job knowing that I'll have to leave within a month?,u/throwawayy_3891,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12sbkss/should_i_accept_a_job_knowing_that_ill_have_to/,jobs,"I'm in a interesting situation and not sure how to deal with two job offers.

I've been in the process of looking for a career and may have found it with a position in the post office. The hiring process is long and tedious with an intensive background check. Even after submitting the background check, I've heard it can take months to receive a start date.

In the meantime, I've been looking for part-time work. I found server job here in town that wants to hire me. As my luck would have it, the post office reached out with a start date before I had a chance to accept or start this server job. The starting date for the post office is less than a month away so I would essentially have to give my two weeks right when I start the serving job.  

I think either way would make me feel super guilty whether I turn down or accept the job only to leave in  a couple of weeks. What should I do in this situation?"

I'm applying for a city government job where I have to send my application to a specific email. I've applied to the exact same position (different department) in the past, and the recipient would send a confirmation email within a business day. This time however, it's 2 business days until the deadline (sent 2 days ago, 4 days before deadline at that time) and I've received no confirmation. The last time that I applied, there were specific instructions to ensure that the recipient didn't gloss over it, but this time, there were no such instructions. Would it be rude to send a (2 days left) follow up? On one hand, it might be pushy, but I also don't feel like staking my application on them having sawn my email."

1,2023-04-19,Should I consider taking a 100% on-site contract job w/ terrible benefits because I can’t get anything else? Advice wanted,u/refreshingturtle7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12seajy/should_i_consider_taking_a_100_onsite_contract/,jobs,"Had a first round interview today, it went well, HR from the consulting company who is doing the hiring said they are going to pass on my resume to the local health department who will reach out to me for a second round interview. 

For context, I am graduating with a masters in public health (an oversaturated field) in May and have been searching for a post-graduation job for several months with absolutely no luck—straight up rejections or just ghosting. This was my first interview and so I am really hopeful. I have 3 years of full-time experience in public health pre- and during my masters and so I’m not applying fresh out of school with no experience—I think it’s just a really tough market right now. 

The pros: the job is in program evaluation, which is an area of public health I’d like to get into, and it is in the town where my parents live so I’d be able to live at home. This is important to me not only because I’d save money on rent but also because my dad has stage 4 pancreatic cancer and I want to be close by to help my parents out and to spend time with him for however long he has left. 

The cons: 100% on-site with no possibility of remote; I had really wanted remote both because of my dad’s health situation and because I’m also immunocompromised and a bug that’s mild for most people can have me out for a couple weeks. I am concerned about getting accommodations if I do get sick. The salary is 29.50 an hour with seemingly no room for negotiation. I don’t know what the PTO and 401k is like but I’ve actually worked with the staffing/consulting company before and the benefits were awful. Also, since it’s a temp job, it’s not the most secure and would not lead to promotion or direct hire. 

Do you think it’s worth taking it if I get an offer and trying to find something better, or continuing to apply and take my chances?

Thanks in advance!"

I can understand when an employer has reasons to doubt an employee or signs they might’ve done something they shouldn’t.

But being super vigilant is weird. Sales have been lower this year at my job. I overheard a coworker saying that our boss was looking through our screenshots (screens) with IT. Now none of us are doing anything different. It’s not our job to increase sales. But he sometimes feels the need to just look at our screens just because.

This is micromanaging right? He says he doesn’t like to micromanage but he does it a lot. Even when he’s working remote he’ll call in multiple times a day and keeps my coworker on the phone for an hour or more which cuts into his work. My coworker often complains about it."

1). Not being at your workstation on the dot in the morning means you are tardy, even if you're just a few minutes behind.

2). Required to take small breaks and go to lunch, but if you come back a few minutes late you're penalized; but you get in trouble too if you don't take your lunch time and breaks; and you can't skip your breaks or lunch period to accumulate time to leave work early.

3). You are scheduled to work until 5:00 PM. It's 4:55 PM and you start wrapping things up at your desk. It's 4:56 PM and you start making your way out the door, but get stopped by the ""time police"" saying you can't leave because it hasn't reached 5:00 PM yet.

4). Having to ""clock in"" to a computer system that tracks you the moment you start a project and then having to ""clock out"" when you finish the project, essentially letting your manager know how long you're taking to work on a project."

It was my first and only offer.  I was actually interviewing with another company at the time that I was almost sure I'd get an offer from but they were dragging their feet and I had to go with a sure thing at that point.

And now I'm kicking myself for not explaining my position to the other company so they'd stop dragging things out.

This job has great perks, 100% paid health insurance, tuition waivers for myself and eventually my child.  I'd been trying to get on there for years, but back then, the pay was more than I had been making.  Now, it's a $7K a year pay cut.  Yes, it's more than unemployment, but my net pay (bi weekly)is anywhere from $100-700 less per check.  And I've been in ""catch up mode"" since I started.  With very little extra.  

So I've started job hunting again.  Which sucks because in addition to the great perks, I love the company culture.  My manager is completely chill.  Coworkers are great.  I do spend quite a bit of time isolated, but I'd feel even more isolated if I'd secured a fully remote job I was pursuing.  In every way, it's almost perfect...except for the money.  And I'm really not at a point in my life where I want to keep struggling.  I don't want my child to have to do without either.

I have an interview tomorrow afternoon.  I feel guilty but I have to do what is best for me. 

Anyway, was just needing to vent."

I had left a remote job that I had been with long term for this job in a hospital, which is also part of my field.

My previous position has not been approved to be posted yet, so they are unable to take me back until it is. I have an offer from one company so far, but it is a temp job at a 20% decrease in pay. I interviewed last week at another hospital, and the person I interviewed with emailed me last Friday and stated a decision would be made next week. She is on vacation this week. I have another interview tomorrow for a job working with special needs adults, an area I have been interested in for a long time. I also have another interview on Monday with the same hospital that I interviewed with last week in a different department. I have until Friday to give the lower paying temp job my answer. I also had another company that also works with special needs adults contact me today, and I just need to set up a time with them as well. Would it be a bad move to tell them no if I do not have a solid offer, but have all of these interviews in progress right now? All of these other jobs are in the pay range I am looking for, and I feel like something should pan out with my work history and experience."

Since most of my experience was with Apple products, I definitely want to get some Microsoft certifications. And I guess CompTIA, is that still a thing..? Also I just signed up for a self-paced Python course. I’m interested in seeing where any of this could take me…maybe something to do with cybersecurity. Or it would be cool to get into QA.

 I got a job before I left college at the Big 4, which are the largest firms in the industry. However, after 11 months, I was let go during a mass lay off. 

A month later, I then got a job at a small firm. However, they kind of used me by immediately firing me and the other new hire the day after busy season. Thus, I was there for only 6 months. Why do I think they used me? Well, I later found out they were known to do this: advertise a temp job as a real one.

Within the same month, I got a job at a large finance company. I worked there for 4.5 years and had a management position and ran the office. 

However, I got burnt out and job hopped to an assistant controller position. However, the new company is disorganized, toxic, openly racist with even the n-word being said on occassion, and constantly just dodging financial ruin. I have been there for 9 months. 

I had a call with a recruiter who told me my resume looks ""hoppy"" and that I am going to have trouble ever getting another job even if I stayed at my current job for 1.5 years. She said she'd do my best, but I was pretty unemployable with a resume like this one. That killed my spirits.

What is too soon to leave a job? Should I prerhaps remove my 6 month and just have a gap in my resume? Should I tough it out at my job for two years?"

2. She expects me to send all my emails to her for approval before I submit it to anyone else.

3. I’m not allowed to meet or talk with other leaders from different departments. I was invited for lunch and went with a few of them and she got mad.

4. She expects me to work on weekends. I’ve not been working on weekends. She’s frustrated, but I told her to go to HR to give me overtime.

5. She is always right with her opinions.

6. She always stares at my screen. 

7. She uses her phones, but if I touch my phone for a few seconds, she gets mad. 

8. When I do something, she always assumes it’s wrong. For example, I spoke with the state health department about how to escalate a TB patient, she told me to talk to them again because she BELIEVES the process is different. I literally just talked to them. 

9. She expects me to save all my emails in the shared folder. She doesn’t, though. It’s almost like she doesn’t trust that I do my work."

I’m from Thailand and I want to make a change in my life, that means to go study and work abroad, especially Australia.

I used to work for an airline that required me to travel to Australia very often (Melbourne, Sydney, Cairns) but I left the company years ago.

Now as time flies, I really miss Australia and Australians (along with my Thai friends over there) so I decided to do some research on how to go back to Australia (via Student visa and Employment Visa). Yes I already talked to some Thai people in Australia, Travel agents, and I joined many facebook groups. But I just want to increase my chance here on reddit too.

My goal is to find a good job there as well as to further my education. Possibly Master degree. 

So, my question is, I would like to ask any Australian redditor if you or someone you know is looking for a staff and, if possible, can help with/sponsor for my visa. 

Please feel free to send me a message if you would like to see my resume or ask personal questions to get to know me better. 

I hope I can meet some opportunities here :D"

I’m leaving my job after 9 months because I decided to go to medical school and I need to focus on getting my pre-reqs done before I apply. I’m a non-traditional applicant so I really need to do well in school. My manager emphasized multiple times when he hired me that he wants someone that can stay at least a year. At the time I had different plans and said I could definitely do that. But of course my life changed (and he knew I was going to go back to school at some point, so that’s not new.. I just was planning on a different career that I didn’t need to prep for so seriously).

I gave my two weeks yesterday and my boss was PISSED. He said “this has never happened before. No one has ever given this short notice.” He compared the notice I gave him to someone quitting McDonald’s. And he also criticized me for taking a week off before my classes start and said “you just want time off.” It’s more than that though because I need time to make sure I have all my books, I have my schedule, and I have everything else in order before making this huge transition. He rejected all of that though.

He kept pushing me to stay. He said over and over “I’m very disappointed and very shocked.” And he kept asking “what can we do to extend your time here?” He didn’t listen to me when I said I just can’t work full time while I’m in school. I told him I’d think about it and check in with him on Friday (tomorrow). But honestly I haven’t changed my mind, I just feel way more uncomfortable and guilty about it now. But I don’t think I should feel guilty. 2 weeks is normal (I’m a RECEPTIONIST) and I know I’m leaving sooner than he wanted, but my life changed and he knew I was a student when he hired me.

Just needed to vent but also if anyone has advice on how to approach my talk with him tomorrow, please lmk."

2,2023-04-20,Youthfully F^%$D,u/jazz2k19,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12sweo9/youthfully_fd/,jobs,"Lol. Ik the title. Anyway

Im a 19 year old male, currently in the midst of trying to become independent from my mother. So i thought i'd share some of that journey by ranting on Reddit about the S\*\*\* show it's become. 

Heres the problem: (And perhaps yall could give advice)

1. Cant find a job. Not asking for high pay, or benefits even, just simply something to afford a studio apt. 

A. Cant find a job that trains. I have yet to come across any blue collar/white collar even job that wants to mentor someone or ""show them the ropes"" to become a skilled member of a team, job, etc. That sense of work community just isn't there anymore. Common problem I find amongst the same ones saying ""No one wants to work"" 

B. Too many conditions for employment. The amount of paperwork, procedure, application work, it takes to simply get an interview, let alone the job is pretty crazy. Even when you bypass all of that, you still gotta contend, and compete with others probably, because the selection for any job for youth nowadays is reduced to Fast food/Retail and Markets. This creates time management problems, especially when looking for other assets, like a vehicle or apartment.

2. Transportation/Housing

This seems like the other side of the coin, when it comes to this current phase of life. Trying to find all 3, Job, Vehicle, and Apartment is a gamble of timing, time management, money, working nuances, and a risk. Your working with only so much select territory. It all has a time limit, so its probably a little luck too. 

A. Finding a house/apartment nowadays is very difficult. I'm genuinely surprised by the amount of options available. Because there are none, and this explains a lot about why people are living longer with parents. So simple, alot of these concepts, yet so complex in what they do to a work culture. 

B. Everyone knows the expense of a vehicle, but its necessary, if not needed. So you can take out a loan, but to get that loan you have to have a certain threshold of income, which can be accomplished by a good full time job, or 2 jobs. AT least this is what i found, i could be wrong. And no. The internet does not help everything. You cant google everything, not everything is googlable. Alot of things HAVE to be done through communication. 

3. Final Note

On a final note. Im ultimately just ranting to a bunch of people on reddit who's eyes are probably in flames (I probably suspect lol) because im wrong about something. OR maybe im not? Maybe this is just the reality check that comes with venturing as a young hungry boy into this world? Idk. But when it comes to the concepts of work/Housing/Transportation these really fall in the lines of the current society we live in. And lets just say, its amazing to me, how no one seems to wonder something is wrong. This is alot for me tbh, as a 19 year old starting out. So, if yall got advice or maybe want to give me some harsh criticism im all for it. Usually parents help with all of this, being the frontier of this venture themselves to help the future generation but... My family is abusive so. Im on my own. If i ever get ahead in my life, if i ever find a place, or a job, or have some future. Kids, etc. Or get rich (lol) then i will make sure, to keep in my heart, everything ive learned in this category, and help fix these problems im finding God willing.

1794,2023-04-20,I was offered a job while attending a conference my current employer paid for. Not sure how to approach the topic with my boss because I want to maintain a good relationship.,u/hibbert0604,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12swq6m/i_was_offered_a_job_while_attending_a_conference/,jobs,"My current job is phenomenal. I love the people. It is pretty stress free. And they have been very good to me. The only drawback is the pay. A few weeks ago they let me attend a conference that I asked to attend and paid for everything. 

While at the conference, I was approached by a friend from a different company who told me that he wanted to connect me with someone who had some questions on the work that I had done at my current job. I interpreted this as him wanting to ask questions about specific projects I have worked on for advice as that is very common in my field. 

In reality, he was interested in hiring me for a new branch of a pretty well established consulting firm as a project manager. I haven't been looking for a job but this one is pretty hard to ignore. It would result in a substantial raise as well as allow me to work from home, which is something I have been very interested in.

He said he would call me in a few days and send me the job description by email.

While interested I have no idea how to approach this with my current job. I feel like it would probably rub them the wrong way if they found out they paid me to go to a conference to get poached. It would also be a VERY bad time for me to leave. We have a two person department and one of them is new and we are in the middle of a few large projects that I'm pretty instrumental for. I would feel horrible doing that not only to my staff but also my boss as well. Like I said, this place has been great to me so I just want to do right by them. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

At the time I didn’t know what was going on, but over the past 2 years I found a rheumatologist who was able to give me a diagnosis and after some trial and error I’m finally on a medication that’s working for me. 

Since I’m finally in a place where I feel like I can work again I’ve been trying to find a new job. I have experience working as an administrative assistant, with my previous position consisting of me supporting four vice president’s. I also have a master’s degree. 

I’ve been applying to jobs since January (multiple applications a day), and I have had a lot of interviews as well but I haven’t received an offer yet. Just recently I managed to get all the way to the last stage with a pretty good company that I was really excited about, only to get turned down at the final stage. 

I’ve completely revamped my resume and my LinkedIn, and feel pretty good about my resume at this stage as I started getting even better interview opportunities after I reworked my resume. And I make sure to study and prepare for each one. 

However, I really feel at this point that my gap is holding me back and I don’t know what to do about that at this point. I’ve been telling the companies that I’ve interviewed with that I took time off in order to take care of a sick family member (instead of telling them I was the one sick) because I have to explain the gap somehow, but even then I feel like the gap is hurting me. I know that I needed the time off to take care of myself, but it’s still frustrating having interview after interview and not receiving an offer. 

I’m not sure if I’m asking for advice or just venting here. But after my latest rejection yesterday (which was after 4 interviews and a months long process), I’m just feeling run down and tired from this and I’m not sure what else I can do at this point."

I'm not quite sure if that's the correct word to describe it but is it only me that thinks this is true?

Before anyone shoots me here, I agree all jobs require a certain skillset and are skilled in their own unique way but I just see some professions that have more in depth, specific, tangible skillsets than others. I can't really describe it but for example. A product designer will most likely have design skills, it's tangible and very specific. A software engineer will have programming skills. But jobs like HR, Project management, IR, don't really have these technical or 'tangible' skills. 

Not sure how to describe it. Skills that can be assessed maybe? You can have a design or programming competition. But there is no HR competition for example.

Reason why I bring this up is I'm currently considering a move from software engineering to sales engineering and I'm hesitating on it because I guess I'm scared that I won't have any 'tangible' skills. Yes I will have different skills that are associated with a sales engineer and by no means should those be underestimated but theres something about not having 'tangible' skills that scare me and I don't know why."
3,2023-04-20,New job. Manager of another department degrade me for not knowing about something.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12t653u/new_job_manager_of_another_department_degrade_me/,jobs,"I don’t want to sound like a baby but in my 5 years of experience in my field I never had a situation like this take place. 

For context, 

New position- a month in, newer young management, on my own most of the time, mass uncommunicated responsibilities. 

Other position - highly spoken of, more defined responsibilities,neutral work environment. 


So I had a manager and someone he was training come down to my department saying how they called multiple times and spoke to me which never even happened. Anyway, I explained I don’t remember speaking with them before and introduced myself appropriately with a smile to their blank faces. They requested some supplies to which I was trying to figure out specifically what chemicals they needed because they used a generalized word to request them (Could’ve been 3 different chemicals). Anyway, I was getting these supplies as quickly as possible while I briefly informed them that this was my third week and that I’m still learning the ropes and all (in a friendly way). The manager was like “yea yea yea so they just threw you in here” in a very egotistical manner. He proceeded to go on about how he was training the employee with him etc. Whats crazy is in my other position I was regarded as one of the best workers and never ran into an issue like this. In fact I was the person training everyone. 

I had another situation yesterday where security was called because they assumed I wasn’t in my department when I was here the whole time and they never called the number on the door or even knocked. This makes me feel like I’m giving a bad impression when I literally just got here. 

I’m feeling a pattern at this new job. There’s so much undefined responsibilities. I don’t want to sound like a crybaby but I feel like in turn since I’m really unfamiliar with the who what and where of everything people are looking at me like I’m inefficient and stupid which is something I’ve never been through in my other position. At this point I might just leave because I’m still in my older position as well and renowned as one of their best go-to employees. It’s pretty disappointing because at first everything seemed great here and now I’m realizing all this extra stuff that I haven’t been informed of is making me look like a jackhole.

What should I do in this situation?"

Hi All,

A few days ago i had an internal interview for my dream job at my company and was wondering what people think of the manner it went. I Met with the senior and current manager of the team i was looking to join the 1 hour interview over ran by 30 mins and the whole process felt very laid back and relaxed almost like a conversation with mates just chatting. The hiring manager had said after the initial role questions he has to do the HR part which he hates and doesnt like (Not sure why he told me that) being told that led me to think this part was not so relevant regardless i answered the questions to the best of my ability. Does anyone think the fact he told me that part he had already come to a decision on the hiring or generally just felt comfortable enough to tell me. The other Manager on the call was using phrases like ""when you join the team"" and ""when you're on call"" which i have read is a very good sign. Anyway so at the end when i was asking my list of questions to the interviewers they had provided me with very in depth responses about the role etc which again i think is a good sign. As the interview was wrapping up i was told there was still three people to interview and i would hear back on monday of next week. After the interview i got a ping on slack from the non hiring manager telling me that it was a fantastic interview with some really good answers but he however did not have the power to offer the role as this was with the senior manager.

Obviously nobody has a crystal ball and knows what will happen but from the information provided does it sound like a promising interview. I have only had very few interviews in my life so i dont have much Xp in this area to gauge what a good and bad sign is."

There are 2 stations I work in, the ER and main dept., I typically work in the ER on weekdays and weekends evenings and in the main dept. just on weekend mornings/afternoons. I like my job but there are clear issues with how the place is managed.

On Monday morning, before I came into work, a person who previously came in as an outpatient a few days earlier for a routine test came back. Without checking in at the front desk and getting a visitor or patient ID like they’re supposed to, this guy walked back to the main imaging dept. and threatened my coworkers, saying he was going to return with his guns and shoot them all, because the results of his test hadn’t been sent to his primary doctor yet. My coworkers called security and the police, but the guy had walked off and gotten further into the building, into a restricted area that can only be entered after swiping an employee key card. He was eventually arrested and jailed, the guns at his house were confiscated, and the police came back to take statements from my colleagues.

I found out about this when I came in for my evening shift, and it really rattled me. There’s never any security at the entrance this guy used, just receptionists. Anyone could easily do what this guy did and walk back into other parts of the hospital. He even got into a restricted area where procedures are performed. I have serious safety and security concerns about where I work now. Though I mostly work in the ER which has more security, I still have to work in the main dept. at times, and I feel unsafe knowing how easy it is for someone to get back there as it’s quite close to the entrance and not monitored by security.

Should I think about moving to a different job? I’ve found positions at other hospitals I could apply to, I’m just not sure if I’m being paranoid. I also have only been at this job for about 6 months, I wanted to stay for at least a year before possibly leaving. Is my fear reasonable?"

I’m a bit of a softy and don’t want to engage with the constant negativity and mean-spiritedness. 

I’ll also say that I’m just tired of the super negative and tasteless experiences with my own people. Tired of the assumptions that just because my skin looks like theirs that I want to participate in their constant degeneracy*. It seems no matter where I go, there they are ready to pounce on me. Other races of people have never treated me the way my own have. It’s all just making me sick. I know I have freedom to move about successfully because I’ve worked towards this. I walked into an unexpected situation and am just trying to back my way out safely."

I was hired as a Registered EEG Technician, which I enjoyed my role. This focus and dedication has allowed me to make shift to backend operations rather than clinical work. I have always aspired to lead and manage, and my current job has provided me with the opportunity to do so. I am set to be promoted to Operations Manager of the Neuro Department within my company upon completing my bachelor's degree in August, however, the salary increase from this promotion has not been discussed in detail so I am unsure of what the raise will be.
Recently, I came across a job posting on LinkedIn for a remote/hybrid Operational Manager position and applied on a whim. To my surprise, after one interview, I received a job offer with a $135kyr annual salary and nearly the same level of benefits. Naturally, the prospect of almost doubling my current salary is quite tempting.
However, I genuinely enjoy my current job, appreciate my colleagues, and have great respect for my boss (the CEO). The only reason I earn $70k/yr is that I was initially hired for a different position, but the company recognized my abilities and skills, transitioning me to the managerial side without a pay increase. There have been discussions about a possible raise during my one-year review in July.

I would appreciate any advice on the appropriate path to take."

I’m also keeping this a vague as possible for anonymity sake. Also sorry if this is a bit long.

Some background: Basically, this coworker and I started at the exact time in the exact same position with the exact same pay(we were pretty close and transparent about what each of us were getting). About six months in, a position directly above is opened up and we both applied. He ended up getting the promotion which is no big deal. I had a chat with the general manager of the company(our boss) and he basically said he wanted to train me so that I would be ready for when the next position opens up in the company. 

Fast forward to a year and I have been working my butt off across three different locations and taking on varying projects even outside my job scope. I however, don’t feel very challenged in what I do and don’t feel I’ve been growing and getting ready for any kind of next step in my career. I have started to apply for varying positions within the company at different sites. Due to the unique structure of the company, the job doesn’t necessarily exist at our site, but does at others and would essentially be the direct next step for my career and growth within the company. Each time I have been shot down because “they just don’t feel I have the experience” or “there were more experienced candidates”, which is fine. But I like I said, I don’t feel like I am getting the experience I need. I expressed this to our GM multiple times and how I would love a growth plan, but have yet to see one. 

Now a couple days ago, my coworker(I guess direct supervisor now) informed me that he was being promoted to the very position at our site that I have been applying for at other sites. Essentially our GM created this promotion for him since I site didn’t have this position and according to them, “they didn’t need it” when I asked about it. 

While I am happy for my coworker and his success, I just feel a bit slighted and overlooked by the company as whole now and I am starting to question whether there is a growth plan for me at all. 

That’s it. Sorry for how long this is. Just needed a place to vent before I did something stupid and rash."

My boss is a bipolar who likes to be bossy telling others what to do and is often times disrespectful to people for example when Mr.X is not in a meeting he tells to everyone out loud about Mr.X not doing a good job.

A. I have been working on the tasks that are assigned to me. Some of them are software team’s work so I filed a bug and assigned. I created documentations for testing procedure and have been executing. 

B. I never wanted and never asked him to become a position title Z but he said my knowledge is not enough that he can’t trust me to be the Z.

First things first: I want to be very very clear - I am not paid by any of the services I mentioned, nor have I recieved anything free for my reviews. Just sharing my experience in this market. 

&#x200B;

A little about me: I have 10 years of experience in marketing and account management for agencies and direct for companies. As some of you may or may not know low funnel marketing tends to get cut earlier then not. I, unfortunately, met my fate early February from a role I was recruited into 4 months prior. Luckily, it was in the resume optimizing space so I learned a lot about what is and what isn't bullshit about recruiting and what job coaches say and what you actually pay for when you pull back the curtain on their paid services. So I figured I would share with you how I landed this role, and ended up with 2 other competing offers. I hope it helps you on your job hunt too.

* Build your resume. Start with livecareer or myperfectresume (2.99 trial - cancel as soon as you finish first 2 steps, you have 72hrs).  

   * I have spoke with multiple recruiters and coaches and their advice has generally been to format like this:
   * Name  
Location| Phone  
Email | Linkedin  
Introduction/summary  
\-experience-  
Role, company, location (remote) dates  
Impact: A statement about what impact you made in the org: During my time here, I consolidated x programs, increased y sales, and defined z marketing ecosystems (get super granular)
      * 1-5 data driven statements about what your role consisted of
      * Repeat this as needed, the further back you go, the less bullets needed
   * Education
      * Degree type, Major, Date
      * School, Location
   * Certifications
      * Certification, ID#, Date rcvd, Date expy
      * Certifying body
   * Do you best to keep it under 2 pages, if needed stick with the most relevant roles, working your most recent role backwards.
* Then find 2-3 great fit jobs, and continue to optimize via the builder. You can also use a free trial with a place like Jobscan or Teal to help you optimize your resume quickly. You want a 75-80% match rate to those job specs. Use chatgpt (free verison should be enough if you are using the pregiven phrases from my perfectresume/livecareer) to help you massage language and match YOUR voice).
* once you hit 75-80%, CANCEL the trial - no need to pay for a month :)
* Now we apply - I applied in 3 ways and had offers come from each way so I will share based on my experience and how I rate the usability:  

   * LoopCV (free verision): Pretty easy to set up. It works to send a canned message to recruiters from a given org that has a role based the match rate to your cv. It will also apply for you. The paid version includes a lot including a lot more apply for you capability, but the free version, well it identified someone, then sent an email on my behalf (that I prewrote based on some prompts) and sent over my resume. This lead me to successful conversations and invitations to internet. I rate it 8/10 as it did the job with limited set up and was pretty mindless for someone who is even slightly technically inclined.

The next two are tool bars, so if you aren't so inclined to use a bot or 2, probably time to skip this:

* LazyApply - Using the description of your last role is the best way to set it up. Trust me, it will make sense later on. Also have a ready to go cover later ( I am excited to apply for THIS role blah blah blah - ask chatgpt to spit something out based on the roles you used to build your resume). I will say this is a paid service but I came across this in the comments when I was searching a way to find a job while watching netflix and chillin doing some competitor research before I took my last role, and holy crap - it's a bit of a crap shoot, but it also found jobs that I am not sure I would have unearthed because I don't really use indeed or ziprecruiter, and for most of my career I have been recruited or via linkedin since I found an office job in my field... 10 years ago. Anyway, it is a lifetime license, the base will get you linkedin and indeed, but i encourage you to do the upgraded plan for the 3 I mentioned and some 750 auto applies a day, which means - yes once you set it up, you hit like 4 buttons and you are applying. You do need to be wise about this and ensure you are setting your settings the same as you would if you were searching yourself. You will get some mismatches, and it is based on how you set it vs match rate. It also has a targeted mail system that I did not use and loopcv seemingly covered my bases here. Again this is a toolbar - it lives in chrome, but has opera has a plugin. I do encourage opera as a browser, as it does have a chatgpt plugin as well, but ymmv. This is a little buggy, but again it did the trick. I will say it took away a lot of the manual work of the easy apply of all the sites mentioned. 8/10
* Simplify Jobs - Another Toolbar. Again, using the same resume you built, set up a profile. THIS IS FREE. It will one click apply to a lot of those sites that don't easy apply so in case you do come across something that one of these others don't catch, you can quickly and easily apply for the role. 10/10 - its free and easy to use.

Other than that, be personable, responsive and knowledgeable about your work and how you can be a culture add to the team you are trying to join.

I wish everyone the best of luck."

On the other hand, I like the idea of being a project manager, as well as the earning potential that comes with the title. Still, I wonder if, because it would be a New York state-specific opportunity, I could lose the flexibility to work in different states without losing my current salary level. 

Is there anything I am also not considering that I should?

Currently, I have the option to work for a well-known medical hospital as a research administrator or for a government agency as a project manager for economic development initiatives.

I hope to relocate to a city with a lower cost of living eventually, so I want to keep that in mind.

The common advice is to search at job boards like [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com) and [Craigslist.com](https://Craigslist.com) are saturated with applicants. Furthermore, my school's internal job search is dry. Lastly, my social network is unreliable. Basically, my resume is not competitive for the late spring-early summer window. Therefore, I'm lost.

I have:

\- no clerical experience

\- no labor experience

I do have teaching experience. That's about it. However, since it's the end of the school year, there are only low-paying part-time tutor roles.

With all this info in mind, what should I do? Thank you."

I have started a SDR position 5 month ago, in a nice successful corporate. They started another company under them that has a different product so I work for this new office.

We haven't been doing well as a unit (no sales from anyone) because our product is b2b and market is Saudi Arabia (decision are being stalled).

Today I got an email from my line manager saying that I am quiet and he added me on probation for 2 more months. He believes that I am not fit for sales and to quote he said he doesn't believe that I can be successful in sales. He said that I have been low performing etc etc.He send this to the HR.

On the other hand there are colleagues that are worse and in general we all are the same performance based, have been doing much meetings (which are hard to land and are within our KPIs) but apparently thats not enough for him.

He found some bs excuses and said that maybe I can start searching for a new job. But I am in probation until June so lf i dont perform they fire me.

Personality wise I am ambivert. I have done sales before and he knows it. I always felt that he doesnt like me to be part of the team even though the team is great and we hang out a lot. I feel like he is making random reasons to fire me but I have been feeling really low after this today.

While my self-esteem is certainly boosted from this praise, I cannot make a meaningful presentation for the life of me. People who only read my reports praise me to no end. People who only see my presentations are not super impressed. 

When I use words, phrases, or sentences on a slide I seem to not hit the mark with my audience. This has lead to me just wanting to use slides with titles and pictures/data only. I am really struggling to find a happy medium with presentations. I am in my mid 20s, so it is not a ""tech issue"" I am facing with using the programs. 

When I go to other presentations, I write down what I like and dislike about the presentation from a slide point of view. I tend to like the presentations that are 90% images because I focus more on the speaker's voice than trying to read. 

Does anyone have any resources or personal tips on this topic?"

So far, it’s been way better than the other 2 companies I have been at…which were small businesses where the owners were borderline abusive. It was hell in that regard. I’m so grateful to be a part of this team where I’m able to learn at a much slower pace and my boss doesn’t fly off the handle in our team meetings anymore. I job searched for over 6 months and finally landed this job and was able to get away from the toxic environment. 

My new team is great, they have been really sweet and helpful. I haven’t been yelled at, I’m absorbing the material, and it’s a very organized environment to learn in. The work is fun and I am able to master it. My biggest issue is that I feel out of place. The 3 other girls that I work with are long time friends and I’m on the quiet side. So there’s lots of times where I feel awkward speaking or they’ll have inside conversations that I’m not a part of. I don’t really mind it, I just don’t want to come across as anti social. 

I am an introvert and keeping more to myself allows me to do the job well. But it does feel awkward when I’m so out of the loop on certain things and I feel they are all so connected.  It’s also weird because they are all engaged or married and I’m single, it feels like I’m so young and inexperienced compared to them even though they are only 3/5 years older. So they are taking about wedding planning and kids and I’m just there waiting to get home to my pets and plants. We do engage in small talk about restaurants, weekend plans, etc…but it’s not the same as what they have and I also have a really hard time engaging with the whole group. I can connect better with people one on one."

To start off, I don’t have a huge or impressing resume. She said she was giving me the interview out of the passion of my Coverletter. But, as I mentioned more and more volunteer work I’ve done, she told that she was going to give me a chance to update my resume and send it to her by the morning. 

I spent hours updating/perfecting my resume and sent it to her that evening. But, I’m not a college graduate (dropout)  and most of the work is volunteer based. 

My interview was Friday. It is currently almost 8pm on Thursday and it’s been radio silence. I sent a professional email yesterday (Wednesday) morning, thanking her again for the interview, stating that I’m excited for possibly being apart of their team, and asking if their where any steps. Again, radio silence.

Thankfully I've had (and fucked up) a couple interviews by now so I'm less of a literally shaking red faced wreck and more of a constantly wiping the sweat off my brow lowkey mess instead. Anyway, the first interview went for an hour and a half and was a mix of technical and behavioural questions, they mentioned that they don't hire grads often at all and I assume thats why the technical questions were so fucked, it felt like I had to pull out every single thing I've ever learned, heard of or skim-read just to stay afloat while two of the final bosses of finance split me into individual molecules and scrutinized every single atom. 

Nonetheless, despite having to pass or half-answer quite a few questions and walking out the building feeling like I just got hit by a bus, I actually held it together fairly well and even though they said they'd take 4-5 weeks to get back to me while they conducted other interviews the recruiter called me yesterday to say they were ""very impressed"" and want me for a second interview in May. Apparently out of 200+ applicants there are only a couple others who have also been called back except now its with the bosses of the people who interviewed me last time, including the director of the fucking company. Recruiter said they ""just want to get to know me a bit better"" so its going to go for another hour and a half, yeah right. So my question is what exactly should I be expecting here? A rerun of the first interview with similar questions? Less questions and more of a detailed run down of the job itself? Or me getting torn to shreds twice as badly as last time? 

Part of the reason I wasn't so nervous the first time was because I wasn't even sure if I wanted the job and I was almost certain I wasn't going to get it but now I do want the job and there's pretty good odds I'll get it if I don't fuck this up so yeah, taking any and all information and advice."

I have many qualities that make me a great candidate. 

I'll start by saying I try to always be humble, though the following may make it seem as if I'm not. (Can't sell yourself short. Know what I mean?)

Undoubtedly, I strive for perfection, knowing full well that perfection is impossible. (The closer the better.)

I primarily focus on doing things PROPERLY. As experience gains, I try to improve efficiency. In order to do so I remain detail and analysis oriented.

Attention to the safe practice of procedures is something I believe is of greatest importance to ensure longevity and repeatability for anything. (Be it Work, Play, or routine Tasks.)

I'm coordinated in my movement and communication as is necessary when working with my hands, on my feet, and in partnership with others. 

Additionally, I'm aware of the type of clientele that will seek the services of this business. I'll make efforts to understand their wants and needs and be realistic in managing them.

As a final note, I'll add that I do indeed desire to be a part of such a community and grow within the field. I'm cognizant of possible applications that may be provided and the utility they may serve.
As well, I maintain friendships and recollections of previous experiences that I can call upon if necessary to provide unique insights.

My hope is that this breifing is useful in exemplifying some strengths and the potential that could be of benefit at different stages of employment and life in general! 

Cheers!"

I'm on the verge of securing a senior IT role at a company in Illinois, but I have some apprehensions regarding my background. I'll need to reveal two misdemeanor convictions during the pre-employment screening process:

1) Property damage (a front door at a house party) in 1996.

2) Resisting a peace officer (I was underage and attempted to flee from a party) in 2000.

Regrettably, I had completely forgotten about these convictions until I conducted an FBI fingerprint check on myself and discovered them listed. I'm presently working on having them sealed.

I know it’s up to the employer’s discretion and these are convictions from a completely different version of myself - but has anyone heard of an offer rescinded under similar circumstances?

I’ve been working there a little under a year now and my 1 year performance review is 4 weeks away, so I had no idea why I was being called in to speak with them. To try and summarize a 1 hour 30 minute meeting; my boss hit on the following points 1. Slow down and make sure the to follow through on an assignment based on the instructions (a fair assessment I have owned up to and apologized for) 2. Stop emailing coworkers as much and start getting up and talking to them. “While emails can be good, nothing builds a relationship as good as in person conversation.”  Please give me your thoughts on this. I think that the most important thing at the end of the day is getting the job done. The way I socialize in the workplace is my own business as long as it’s polite and within reason. I always ask my coworker who sits next to me questions out loud because he is not even a foot away. Not going to go into all the details here; just know  I am an introverted person but I always ask questions and have good intentions. 3. Stop cc’ing (will not name person) on emails. That person asked me to forward them emails and my boss admires them. Maybe look into the matter before jumping to conclusions. 4. My HR manager downright said to me to take speaking classes (because I email more than I speak to people.) This is incredibly defamatory and unprofessional but my boss was eating it up. She also had no right to evaluate my performance because she is not involved in any of the work I do. My boss probably told her behind my back what he thinks of me and she blindly knelt to every word he used to demoralize me. It was blown way out of proportion and I feel like he’s trying to chew me out of the equation. They said if I make mistakes again like not checking an email 3 times for errors then I’ll be terminated. I wasn’t going to sit there and say I’ll never make a mistake again. I said I’ll continue to do my best.. already job searching though. Nothing was said about all of the things I’ve been doing correctly. Thoughts?"

2. Part time, contract-based, or flexible hours, as I can have rehearsals any time during the day

3. This is just me being picky but I’d prefer it not to be in sales or business, no call centers or marketing. I just can’t do it anymore lol

4. Something I’ll be able to do for a while

5. Something I can do with an education bachelors and a music masters that isn’t teaching (my schedule is too variable)

Was just offered a position of similar style to start up a similar company and build from the ground up making $155K.

This would significantly change my life by allowing me to live in a more comfortable location without the need for roommates. However, building from the ground up is not some thing I’ve done before and will require a tremendous amount of research, travel, and stress. I can do my current job with my eyes closed, can take time off easily, and work only 40 hours/week. 

Have also been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety lately regarding my personal life so the thought of turning my life upside down and possibly failing and giving up my comfortable job where I make decent money is terrifying. In 2010, I was fired from a job because of performance issues that were due to anxiety and stress about the job.

I worked left a company about a year ago for a 30% raise in a tech company. The tech industry blew up in the last year and I was laid off after about six months. I was fortunate to have a few opportunitites available to me. 

One opportunity was a job that would have been a promotion at my prior company. 

The other was more of a lateral role but at a younger, smaller company where my friend is a VP. This opportunity seemed to offer growth and a fun culture. 

After losing sleep for countless nights, I decided to take the offer from my friend's company. 

I've only been working there for a month, but I hate it. The culture is nothing like what I expected. I hate the work and don't enjoy working with some of the people I have to interact with multiple times a week. I've become depressed. I started going to therapy because I just feel so empty. I regret my choice and unfortunately the other opportunity was filled. 

Have you ever turned down a job offer, regretted it, but ended up getting an even better opportunity soon after? How did you get past that period of regret?"

In three months, I’ve had four interviews and a dozen rejections, after applying to over 600 roles. I want to pull my hair out, I feel so beyond defeated. 

I’m on benefits, food stamps and unemployment. Today they just notified me I make too much on employment to qualify for food stamps. What??!!  

Applying for jobs is a job in itself. It’s definitely not like it used to be, even two years ago, it’s wild. Recruiters are so out of touch; do this, not this, but make sure this, but never that! I just can’t. I feel like a failure. I’m 32, no husband or family. I live with family and I’m living off of my savings. 

I feel depressed. I don’t have a degree and I feel like a ghost on the job market right now. I don’t know what to do. If I go back to school, I lose unemployment benefits. It’s like I’m between a rock and a hard place. I have no direction.

**LET ME MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR**
As noted above, I have a savings account that is dwindling and I’m living off off. Am I in the most dire of situations from an unemployed perspective, no things can absolutely be worse and I am blessed. I am allowed to feel sad, depressed, worried, and anxious about my situation. Comments about me not knowing how to manage money or living beyond my means are blindfully diagnostic and frankly rude. I’m not sure what person loves to sit and watch money go out and not come in. Additionally, yes I qualify for benefits in my state because I have no income. Not sure why that’s so hard for anyone to understand. The nastiness some people exude is so unnecessary."

In terms of work, I haven't been their long. About 6 and a half months maybe, but my god was it difficult. Before you tell me the generic ""Every job is like this, all jobs have their ups and downs"" listen first.

When I first realized I was hired by macys I was over the moon. Such a well known company and I was hired with ease and no interview(which should of been my first red flag), I was told I'd be paid for training and then I shadow another employee. Not only was I not paid for training, the employee I shadowed kept leaving me behind. I ended up only doing 1 hour of shadow work before I was on the floor by myself. Macys had a system where their workers are called ""generalists"". Generalists typically do all job, including cleaning the fitting room, cahsiering, recovery, stocking, etc. However, when you're working on a three level busy sale floor, it can be near impossible to complete all your tasks. There were many days where I had to skip my breaks and sometimes even my lunch to finish them. I was not paid for the time I spent working. Additionally, I was always stuck with cleaning the fitting room. I was trained to be on the register.

It was fine at first but then I realized there was no real way of organization. Macys didn't require a clothing count and there was rarely a person managing the fitting room all day, so by the time I came, the rooms were left covered in clothes from floor to ceiling. I would usually spend 3 hours ALL BY MYSELF cleaning the fitting rooms, whilst running go backs, and cashier's as well all the while the manager kept urging ""faster and faster""
I complained multiple times about the disorganization and level of work,( by the way i was not getting paid for, it was not in my contract that i would manage this, and i was only being paid 16.50 an hour), but to no avail. No response nothing, generic to most jobs unfortunately.
I thought macys would be different but working there showed me that it really is no different from working for other lesser known retail entities if not ALOT worse because you're a lot more expendable.

-Been successfully working in the company for 4+ years, IT field, good feedback from all managers. 

-After being promoted to the current positions 2 years ago, I got bairly any salary increase and zero professional growth. 

-Manager keeps adding ""impactful"" responsibilities to most of the team members, but from what I know they promote only those who got lower salaries so far, hence no motivation for anyone who delivers and performs well, no matter how hard they try.

-Zero indexation, zero amendments to the market. Also bonuses were cut around 2 years ago. 

-Toxic team. Most of the meetings people share personal details and probably expect everyone doing the same. Since I don't do that, I am mostly perceived as a ""quiet"" person which is basically a problem. I also don't like to join their drinking night outs if they are not within the team building. I cannot recall this in my other teams in this company so I think it is unlrofessional. 

-As the result, I asked my manager if they can consider moving me to my former position to another team where I have good relations with everyone, including their manager. My manager reacted kinda okay but also said ""it is a weird decision"", as if they did not receive my feedback for the past 1.5 years about things I am not comfortable with, including absence of motivation, growth, etc.

To make matters worse, I left my last job as the workplace became very toxic and full of bullying, which has had a very negative effect on me. This has also added to my anxiety about starting a new job.

I am about to go start working in a consultancy firm and I have another job offer from a company I had applied a few months back, initially they wanted me to move to a different city which has a higher cost of living than my current location, for the same salary. After a while, they increased the salary, but to be honest I do not believe it is enough given the city. I wanted to know should I use this to increase my salary at the current firm. The reason I am asking is that 

1. this is my first job out of university
2. I have not started and don't want it to hurt my chances of getting in

Any help or advice would be appreciated."

I finally landed a job!!! It’s a very niche job (as my field is) in a car company. By the way,I didn't plan to stay in my field of study, life decided that this is where it wanted me. I applied to jobs I had the skills for. 

I had jr project manager job while I was finishing my PhD in 2022. The company laid me off and it shut down operations in April. 

I finished my PhD in August 2022. From the day I was laid off until last week, I applied to at least 60-70+ jobs since April. At some point, I was applying to more than 1 a day, but I noticed that my resume and cover letter quality dropped and got fewer results. I switched my resume 3 times following advice. If you are a PhD reading this, I recommend you watch “Cheeky Scientist” conferences. I didn't pay, but I got a lot of insight and I learned to improve my resume from these.

During this year, I almost got hired at Ansys (they selected the other candidate and now I can see that they are looking to fill that position again. I dodged a bullet, and I knew it. What a bunch of pricks, they were post-docs and PhDs trying to show off who had it bigger), I interviewed at Pratt and Whitney, a Canadian NGO focused on science, a company in the States (they even flew me over), and many other companies all over Canada. 

I got so exhausted from everything that my spouse and I booked a vacation to Asia in November and I stopped looking for a job for a month. 

After the time off, I had my most productive time, because I interviewed with 3 companies that almost led to 3 job offers. I met my future employer during that time.

My employer started the process in December, and my second interview was in January, I heard that they wanted me in March and they offered me the job this week. They will be paying my moving expenses, they are unionized, and have a pension plan and a retirement savings account. 

The next step is to improve my French, as my level is not as good as I would like, because the province where I am moving predominantly speaks French. 

To help pay the bills, I was working in a call centre as a bilingual customer representative. I enjoyed a lot this job and I am extremely good at it, like really good. 

Feel free to ask questions. If you are a PhD keep pushing, it is possible.

Edit: Thanks for the award! I wasn't expecting this at all!

My new employer’s HR department informed me that it may take 15 days to complete but they have my start date set for 4 weeks from now (I must give my current employer 4 weeks notice in order to get paid out my PTO and keep what they matched in my retirement account).

In the background check portal, I was required to provide my current and previous supervisor’s contact information. I feel like I need to let my current manager know before the background check company calls her. I also know it’s best to wait until after the background check is completed. 

My manager has an idea that I was leaving, I am moving to a different state later this year and even though I am 100% remote and my current employer has my future state approved for work, my entire team has been rejected to work out of state.

I've been a stay at home mom for 8 years, so my resume is crap, other than volunteer work.    I have two college degrees but nothing in the way of recent or relevant experience.   I was what some call a ""career student"".  

I'm only available 8am-2pm weekdays, when she's in school.  (My husband is in management,  working crazy hours & weekends. There's no school bus, so it's my job to get her to school & after-school activities. )

I need a job where I won't get fired, should I call out due to a school snow day or her waking up sick. 

To work a full 8 hr shift, I'd need child care.  But I cannot accept the majority of local jobs due to their near-minimum wage pay vs high cost of child care.  I could try commuting,  but I'd need to be home by about 6pm for her (homework,  fed,  showered,  bedtime). 


I looked at gig jobs, but demand is limited in my less-populated & spread-out area.  Things like DoorDash may not work. 

I looked for work-from-home type jobs, but many listings don't seem legit.   Some require shifts I can't do or specialized experience I don't have.  

No job type is beneath me.  However, I am just not able to do physically demanding jobs.

My bosses told me I am not allowed to discuss anything work related to anyone outside of work, including therapists, doctors, and my immediate family, or I could face termination. I live in at at will employment state. How terrible would it look on me if I get fired for this? 

We had a meeting about a month back discussing not sharing shelter information publicly. They had put an employee's facebook picture and DMs about an adoptable cat she was thinking of getting on the big screen in the meeting room and began questioning her intensely in the meeting room with the entire staff present. During this meeting it was discussed that employees are not to share anything shelter related unless it has been previously approved by the bosses or media manager. This includes what we are allowed to discuss with our families, doctors, and therapists without first getting permission on what subject and what detail first. We are not to talk about any animals available or not outside of work, we can not wear uniforms outside of work, we can not talk about animals we are fostering outside of work and are supposed to keep names, ages, medical status etc of fosters a secret to household members, unless previously given permission. 

I normally don't use social media so that part wasn't too hard for me. But I absolutely use my s/o to vent to about things at work vaguely, and I've been thinking about going to see a therapist. I feel like it is going to be exceptionally hard to talk to a therapist without discussing anything work related, and I feel incredibly embarrassed even having my bosses know I'm seeking a therapist, let alone asking my superiors permission to talk about specific events to a therapist and why.

I'm looking for advice on how to proceed. I like my job and I like that I feel like I make a difference. Am I blowing this out of proportion? Should I just keep talking to my husband and talk to a therapist and not worry about it? If I do get caught and fired, would releasing business information make it really hard for me to find another job? Just talking about it here is giving my anxiety I might get fired."

My wife talked to a friend of hers who does hiring elsewhere in the country and he noted that, given the choice between a local applicant and an applicant from somewhere else, he'd favor the former for a few key reasons (I can't remember them all, but I guess it has something to do with not having to wait so long to get a new hire into the fold). We've talked about burning the ships, so to speak, and just moving to Philly and \*then\* continuing to take our chances once we have a foothold, but I'd like to get some perspective as to how much truth there is to that idea.

Day before yesterday I received a brief email that said this company got my application via LinkedIn and they had some questions about how I approach Project Management. I've applied to probably a hundred or more PM roles in the last few weeks, so I didn't really remember the JD, though I do remember applying to remote PM roles based out of the same state.

I thought it was some pre screening thing, responded to the questions to the best of my ability, figuring it was some kind of screening process and they'd call or email to schedule a proper interview.

This morning I got an email saying they were going to mail me a check to purchase equipment for a home office, I would begin virtual training nearly immediately. The pay rate is hourly and competitive. I'm supposed to email them my information to get a copy of an offer letter.

This feels really weird and I'm not sure if I need to do something to protect myself in case this is a scam. I've googled the company name and they do not have much of an online presence The domain associated with the company on LinkedIn resolves to a website with a different company name.

Does anyone know if this is a scam?

Edit: Thanks for your responses everyone. I will not be providing any additional information to these people. I'm going to wait until Monday to see if they actually send the alleged offer letter so I can include it in my FTC complaint. Kind of a bummer since I thought for a second there my job search was over.

 I was contacted for Client Services Associate by a company called Dialectica which is supposed to be an expert network company who builds conmections between clients and experts/consultants. From what I have seen in terms of reviews, they tend to contact new grads of about 20-24 years of age, mostly in less developed countries. My question is this: is there a potential career here later that I can brach out to? The company seems to have very low retention rates, so people don't stay for long. But I would like to know if their experience could open doors for a different career.

Some people in reviews saw the company as a glorified call center but I would love some opinions.

I currently make 70K as a supervisor and have been in this role for one year now. I’m due for my yearly raise this month (April) but I’m struggling with what would be appropriate to ask for and would love some advice. 

I know a 3-5% increase is pretty standard if there is no promotion or title change, but I was planning on asking for more (7-10%) because I do a lot for the team and complete many additional tasks for upper management. I also know that the supervisor (33M) of a similar team makes more than me and has had a company car for a year now. My direct supervisor (28M) also makes significantly more (understandably so, he has a masters and lots of relevant experience) and has a company car. I have been here longer than both of those employees, but I know some of the pay differences are justified by experience that inevitably comes with age. 

~anyway~

We unfortunately had layoffs about 8 weeks ago and business has slowed even more since then. We have a new sales team that higher ups believe will rejuvenate the company but there’s no fruit of that labor just yet. 

So my questions are - how much is appropriate to ask for a raise at this point? Should I wait until things get better to ask for better results? My mom suggested asking for a lower raise but add a car stipend as a separate perk. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
0,2023-04-21,hr nightmare,u/SB_Because,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ubjoa/hr_nightmare/,jobs,"I was recently hired to work remotely for a company company in NJ .  I have applied for numerous positions but this is the job U really wanted so I was ecstatic when they called letting me know I was hired. I completed my onbarding paperwork which nowhere stated anything regarding a background check but did stipulate passing a drug screen. Shortly after submitting my signed documents, I received an email from a 3rd party background check company requesting my consent for the background check and the information / pass in order to do my drug screen. Although I thought it odd, I had no problem in consenting to both. Up to this point nothing had been said verbally or in writing about my employment being conditional upon ""clearing a background check."". In fact I received an email with the verbiage "" Thank you for completing all of the requested onboarding documents. You are all set . Welcome to the team!"".  I started work this past Monday and had a great first two days of training. On Wednesday, an hour before my shift started, I received a phone call from HR and was terminated because of something on my background check report. About 30 minutes later, I received an email from the background check company informing me of the findings , a copy of the report and a link to file a dispute.   A 4 yr old unexecuted arrest warrant was showing from where my father who had dementia and was divorced from my mother ( who died in 2013) had filed a police report alledging I stole my mother's belongings and even referred to her as his wife in his statement. My father died nine months later in Sept 2019.  As the only child. I was the sole heir and beneficiary to each of their estates.  For whatever administrative error, the warrant was not recalled as it should have been for obvious reasons (false police report, only witness is deceased, I legally owned the property in question, the alledged crime never took place, etc). The sheriff in my town has been to my house on a neighborhood matter and knows who I am. I have not been arrested and not convicted. I know my employer was wrong in terminating me before allowing for me to dispute this matter. An email from the background check company even stated they would advise the employer of the dispute and inform them to not  take any action until their reinvestigation is complete. I have tried talking to the young woman from HR but she does not seem concerned about what has transpired and did not wantcto allow me to provide any sort of explanation. All she wants to say is that employment is conditionsl on clearing a background check. She has not allowed for the background check process to even run its full course. Am I correct in thinking that since my contract says nothing about a background check that this is flat out wrongful termination by someone who does not know the law and was judgmental in their actions? Aside from her, I really like the people and LOVE the job itself. I have sent a very professional email asking them to revisit the facts and even included an excerpt from the EEOC website stating warrants with no arrests or dispositions cannot be used to take adverse action. I have clearly stated the facts and have even provided court documents supporting all I have said. I got the same response. Please advise keeping in mind I really want to work there. I feel that I am not the person the adverse action should be taken against."

I've been trying to help my partner get a job and we are having a really difficult time with it.  She was in a very abusive marriage for 10 years where she wasn't allowed to seek employment or basically leave the house.  She is now separated but has no recent employment history, no college degree, and has 4 kids to look after (the youngest being 2.) so working somewhere like Starbucks just isn't feasible since it would be ""more expensive"" for her to work because the cost of childcare (she doesn't have anyone who can watch the kids) and the loss of benefits would outweigh part-time job money.

She has experience working for a computer repair shop 10 years ago, has an interest and knowledge of computers, and 2D and 3D modeling, and has applied to a local community college for animation while also working on her A+ certification.

With all of that being said, does anyone have any tips or possible jobs she could get? She'd prefer a work from home job so she doesn't have to pay child care, she's considered doing data entry jobs since that's ""techy"", but is having some trouble trying to figure out what to put on a resume.  Even if there are some resources or programs to help single moms who've lived through traumatic events find work, that would be super helpful.

I love helping people. I have anxiety and severe depression. I can't handle call centers. My body is not great for warehouse. Even sitting for long periods of time is awful because I have a messed up tailbone which causes pain.

I just want to be able to get into a job that I will love for years. I've got no idea where to go for that. I want to interact with people most days but not every day, can't do sales because I'm very practical in money spending, and like to use my body for jobs when I can. I don't think I'm made to sit at a desk all day.

I'm still young as I'm 25 and considering an art degree so I can do 3d modeling and learn programming with it (that stuff is super over my head on my own). I have done cdl trucking, call centers, retail, warehouse, sales, personal delivery (like doordash), and just feel absolutely lost.

I've taken a test that tells me I'm more humanitarian and such but if I took that test again I know it would be a decent bit different.

However, during the last two months, I have been experiencing micromanagement and nitpicking from my managers, which began after I made a comment that they did not appreciate.

 Recently, I was confronted about a mistake I made in January, and when I was asked about my errors, I responded by stating that I felt constantly micromanaged. My managers were surprised by my comment and asked me to clarify. I explained that I received frequent updates on my work, had to fix minor grammar mistakes in my emails (even though others with worse grammar were not corrected), and received constant negative criticism that others did not receive. They told me this was to help me grow, and suggested that if I did not like their management style, I could quit. Despite this, I told them that I enjoy my job.

 The fact that they do not acknowledge their behavior as micromanagement raises questions about their awareness of their management style and empathy towards my perspective."

i'm 26 years old and I was fired from my tech sales job 9 months ago, after that I took some time to get my life together. I went to rehab, got sober, got in shape and worked full time as as server to pay the bills. I am now itching to get back into the corporate world and am having a bit more trouble than i anticipated getting interview opportunities.

My resume currently lists my tech sales job as my most recent experience because I feel it is much more valuable to an employer than restaurant in experience. However I am worried that hiring managers may be getting the impression that I have been laying around doing nothing over the last 9 months.

As a product analyst/business analyst specializing in enhancing websites and mobile applications for nearly 10 years now, I've been facing an extremely difficult time finding a white collar job in today's market. I've tried everything in my power to improve my odds, including revamping my resume, having it professionally rewritten, and applying to a staggering 500+ job openings. Despite my best efforts, I've only managed to secure a couple of interviews, and I'm still left without a job offer.

It's no secret that the tech industry is going through a rough patch right now, with numerous layoffs and cutbacks being announced on a regular basis. The job market seems to be oversaturated with talented candidates, making it even harder for those of us looking for opportunities to break through the noise.

I know that persistence is often touted as the key to job search success, but I can't help but feel disheartened by the current state of affairs. I can't be the only one experiencing this, so I wanted to reach out to the community to see if anyone else is in a similar situation.

For those of you who have successfully navigated the job search in this climate, how did you manage to stand out from the crowd and secure a position? And for those still struggling, how are you coping with the challenges and staying motivated in your search?

Any insights, advice, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Let's support one another in these trying times and work towards a brighter future in the tech industry.

My current job is...god awful to say the least. I've been job searching for almost a year now.

So late last month I was offered an interview with a medical device company in their claims department which is something I'm more interested in. 3 interviews over the course of 3 weeks and then one week after the final interview, I got an email saying that my application was not accepted and they moved to the next step. I was upset (mainly because it made me feel like I couldn't move up in the world)   
Today, I'm off work avoiding the shit storm that is currently happening at my job and I get an email from the medical device company with an offer letter saying they want to hire me and start on 5/8.

Currently I get paid $19.50 bi-weekly. I said my going rate was $23-$30 based on what I researched in my area.   
I work about 36 hours a week.  
Standard health/vision/dental/LTD/STD package.   
PTO is on an accrual bases of like 2.50 per pay check (around there)   


Here is the offer letter/ benefits-

A friend suggested I ask for more pay but I've never done that before.  
I would love to hear what people think! :) 


UPDATE: Thank you all for the input!! I did ask about higher pay and they unfortunately couldn't meet the amount I asked for ($24) I'm still happy I asked!
They did mention they do $500 quarterly bonuses if you meet a certain criteria. They also do annual merit raises.

I did take the job regardless, since it has better pay and a better working environment than my current job. It also gets my foot in the door to a new area of medical :)

Today I was fired from my senior analysts role at a financial firm. Feel completely blind-sided as I reflect on “happenings”/what may have been the root cause of drastic action from management.. I was in this role for LESS THAN 5 months, coming over for a role in a completely different department as they needed a backfill from a recent termination. Quite a learning curve as the role was complex and I didn’t have experience in a few of the applications/tools they used on a daily basis. I was picking these processes up quickly (but still learning) and doing well, or so I thought… 

This is just mind boggling as I have not received a warning or anything in writing *indicative of a termination* leading up to this. No improvement plan or deadlines to improve by. No feedback that would make me worried for my job safety. Again, was there for less than 6 months…From my experience, HR has a plethora of legalities to follow related to termination and having this sort of feedback needs to be taken seriously and in writing. This is a process that should of been followed by management. Nothing. There were a few mistakes here and there, i do take responsibility for, but there wasn’t anything that materially affected the company. I was new and still getting integrated! People make mistakes, and I’ve seen it many times over throughout my career thus far. Their reasons seemed super petty and could of been handled appropriately if there was better communication from management (my opinion). Was never told I was on “performance watch”, but did have a few conversations that would be considered as “coaching” instead of Formal performance conversations. I knew there were certain items that needed improvement, and was working on it. Nothing that should lead to a termination though… How am I supposed to know what areas need improvement outside of the small constructive criticisms that aren’t material? Just a huge lack of communication on their end… just don’t get it..

Here’s the feedback I got from my manager when getting fired:

1). “Not being a good fit for the role” (did not go in depth on this). I Don’t really agree with this… the whole team was relatively green and people were always leaving the department. Was fired after my first round of budget/forecasting. Was told the small mistakes were okay because it was my first go around… and I was improving
2) “a few accuracy errors”  (submissions to my manager for review). Again, was working on this.. and all the cancelled meetings didn’t help with this..
3) “minor skill set issues” related to 3 NEW platforms/tools that we used on a daily basis. (Never used these before and was going through training).. how do you expect someone to just come in and fully learn everything in such little time??

Just from the start I’ve just felt like management didn’t want to invest into me as an employee..That’s what they are there to do! There was a non-existing onboarding process. No formalities. Joined at a strange/busy time so that was to be expected, but I was essentially left to fend for myself and learn everything without “hand holding” or direction (unless I asked about next steps).. Managers and other analysts were constantly moving my meetings around making it extremely hard to get oriented from the start. I’m just very confused and kind of at a loss of words. Feel like I didn’t look both ways and got smacked by a passing semi.. I know I will be taking action for a higher severance.. this just feels unjustified. Thoughts?"

0,2023-04-21,"Is it normal to be excluded from the annual raise, when annual raises are given companywide?",u/bbqcornnuts312,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12unn6j/is_it_normal_to_be_excluded_from_the_annual_raise/,jobs,"I've worked for a company for 4 years. They strung me along as a contractor 18 months and I am going into my 3rd year as a fulltime employee. 

They *never* explained raises when I joined, so I don't even know if I qualified during my first year of perm employment, but I got a 2-3% raise last year, and had annual raises explained to me.

My team lead gave me a solid review this year, as usual, and then told me my current sales manager (who has only been in the role 6 months, is an asshole, and doesn't really have an interest in a relationship with me or even use the software I put all of our bids into) said I will not be getting a raise this year, during **companywide raises**. He has seen what I do in our sales meetings (I create the sales reports). I've told him what I do for this office day to day. Whenever he sends me an email, I reply confirming I've completed it so he has verification and send him links where he can find it. I am the only person that does my sales ops job.

In our office of 10-20 (inside team + sales team), I suspect I am the the only person being punished.

I've vaguely heard of this before, I guess, people being ""passed over for a raise"" (not just individual requests?), but nobody in HR reached out to me, I get no sense my sales manager is unhappy with my performance (but then, he's the sort of guy that wouldn't even send an email to tell someone they're fired and all their stuff had been tossed/that they should not come into the office, he's such a prick)...

My team lead said, consider this the first step before being fired, and scared the shit out of me. At a minimum, he didn't allay my fears when I asked what that could mean. My sales manager gave no background, no reasoning. It's not a good sign and indicates HR has me in their crosshairs. I don't know why, and they haven't notified me I need to change anything. 

The company's HR is deeply adversarial, and my previous (kind) manager and a few other employees that asked for things - one to be mostly remote, another for a senior title he more than deserved - were edged out. Stuff like that gives me cause for concern about my own job and how valued I am here. 

I've been looking for new jobs for a year and it's been such a humiliating, disheartening process and is not going well, but in the meantime, just having some peace of mind would help, because now I'm paranoid I'm being fired by new management and because HR is on a warpath. 

I'm already grossly underpaid and was lied to about what the salary would be in this job. It's such a small raise to begin within; right now it feels like getting a big ""GFYS, we don't want to employ you, you're trash, there's the door"" pay cut and as a prelude to something worse, during a recession and when my job search has been been a stream of rejections or radio silence after firing off job apps.


I worry this is retaliation because I transitioned into semi-remote after moving, despite never changing my productivity level and being available by phone from 8-6. I answer every email from my team immediately, and I'm in the office 1-2 days a week. No one has given me an ultimatum about it. I don't even have a cubicle, that's how limited space is.

 Another employee in this office is like me, he was hired on a fulltime-in-office basis and he too is now totally, 100% remote and works from home. 


I am going to ask my manager what happened but I do not expect him to be candid, even if this is because he specifically does not feel I deserve a raise, and this isn't a budget issue."
3,2023-04-21,Food For Thought: References,u/BjornReborn,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12uo1nr/food_for_thought_references/,jobs,"I'm not in this situation right now, but I was little while ago. I used to work for a company that overall; doesn't give references out to any employees. All they provide is dates employed and rehire status.

Long story short, everything was going very well until a few months ago which was when the new manager was onboarded. I absolutely have a do not rehire status because I was set up by the new manager who came in and tore everything down that I built and threw me under the bus one last time before I left even though I tried to leave peacefully by going so far as providing notice and negotiating my end date. Said manager successfully turned the director and all higher leaders I worked with against me in my own department. Other leaders I worked with on-site, were more than willing to provide references but for a certain agency, that wasn't enough. I needed a direct supervisors reference. It was also a funny situation because I didn't have a direct supervisor either. I reported to the director, but they weren't my supervisor. Even though the company doesn't provide references, said director provided one apparently to someone else they let go when I was being onboarded... which is now confusing when I think about it. 

I've been noticing that this has been coming up more and more due to the fact that most people assume that whomever you put on will speak only positively about you. It seems like so many places now are denying giving out references. Did a law change?

A few questions...

1. How are you supposed to get hired if places refuse to provide references and yet agencies and full time jobs, require at least three references - two supervisory?
2. If I can't provide a department reference other than potentially a colleague of the same level, should I leave off that work? It was a six month project. I was offered full-time and I did accept. But it all went to shit when the new manager came on and destroyed everything even my reputation because they had it out for me from the beginning.
3. If I do list the six month project on my resume, is there anything I can that's not going to raise red flags? Adding to this, previous to this six month project, was a different project. I can get references from them; but I don't want to because that place was also a toxic hellhole. I've only now found my current place which I genuinely love and am excited to log on to work everyday which has never happened.
4. If I list the agency during the time that covered my very short full-time (2months), is that lying? I figured it's easier to explain that I was offered full-time, tried it out, went back to consulting because I prefer consulting more than being an employee."

I had a 3 month contract, I complete it successfully and have been searching since. Applying diligently and turning up nothing. I have come to accept that there's nothing available in my industry locally or remotely, as remote jobs seem to have all gone back to office. So I made the very tough decision to leave my home and my family for a job in NC. 

I was being considered for an extremely high paying job that I am very well qualified for, with a leader in the industry. They scheduled an interview for this coming Monday at 3. I've been pouring over the job description and making sure that I have brushed up on my relevant experience and interview skills.. and today I got a text message from the recruiter saying he has some bad news. ""They said they're going to shuffle some things around and will hold off on filling anymore positions for now."" 

Devastated. I am completely crushed. This is the best fit I've found since November and I lost it on a whim. I stooped as low as begging. ""I know it's unorthodox but is there any way we can beg (manager) to just take the interview? I think this position was made for me and they sound like they need someone with a solid worker mentality. I promise she won't be disappointed, but if she feels the same way after the interview I'll take the L and she's only out 20 minutes of her time. Please can we try?"" 

I'm begging just for the chance to interview. He basically said it's not personal just business, and I spent the whole afternoon sobbing and feeling heartbreak? That's the closest feeling I can equate it to. I feel the disappointment and pity from my family when they ask what I'm doing. I didn't tell them about this opportunity because I just assumed this or something like it would happen and I was right. 

My husband is trying his best to be understanding but he doesn't work in my industry and it's hard to explain why things keep falling through. It's not fair that companies keep posting jobs that they have no intention on filling. This has happened to me several times and I feel like there's someone full-on sitting on my chest. I feel broken and helpless and useless and hurt and betrayed. Someone please tell me it'll be okay. Will it be okay? Why is this happening with every job?"

A big contributing factor is my boss who works 9-12 hours per day. Because I am supposed to support my boss I feel obligated to be there when he is there. However he comes in so early it’s just not realistic for me to come in that early and also I am not legally allowed to work that many hours anyway.

I thought coming in earlier would help my problem but the only result was that instead of working 8-6 I worked 7-6 so I stopped. 

I feel like I can’t say anything about the work-life balance because I WFH. When I finally get a break I can play with my dog or rest in my bed and that’s a luxury office ppl don’t have. 

But the trade off is I’m always available whenever anyone asks me for anything. I don’t want them to think I’m slacking off at home since there’s a lot of pressure to make everyone go back to the office. So many times I sit down to eat lunch but after one bite I have to run back to my desk.

My salary is not high for my position but I grew up really poor so I have too much fear to coast. 

How can I cut back my work to a more reasonable level or control my schedule so that I’m not working this much? Or should I just accept this is what every achiever at my company has to do…"

2,2023-04-21,Potential Resume - Job Description Trap Identified,u/DevuSM,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12upaho/potential_resume_job_description_trap_identified/,jobs," **Job Description has Misspelled Industry Software Names** 

Conspiracy mode.

In two separate job descriptions I have seen a trend of misspelling the name of a specific prevalent industry software program. This misspelling takes the form of adding or removing a single letter from the software package name.

My read and subsequent analysis is that if you include the misspelling in any way in the text of your resume, they dumpster it.

No human will ever read or acknowledge your resume.

Thanks for applying though.

The point of this is to defend against blind keyword matching. Due to the exceedingly primitive nature of HR applicant tracking software, misspelling through exclusion/inclusion of letters can create very distinct and simple red flags vs relying on capitalization, verb tense, etc.

If you really think about it, through keyword matching and chatgpt, anyone can create a job application for any job and. based on the current HR pipeline. progress past 90% of legitimate applicants.

The purpose of this post is to serve as proof of prophecy based on 2 data points.

Further discussion in comments, my indicators were perfectly constructed documents with a single, specific, repeated error with logical reasoning behind it."

I sent him an email saying that he was being rude, and that I was swamped with other items he had previously assigned me - but that I had planned to respond to this email as soon as possible, when I had a moment.

There are pros and cons to both jobs, I posted earlier this week about it. I wasn't sure which one to take and now I'm even more unsure.

Job 1: cannabis industry, management title, less pay, remote

Job 2: event/tech/education industry, more pay, lesser job title, but travel is involved.

For the tech ed job the recruiter had mentioned the range was 100k-120k, and ended up only being offered 5k more than what I'm going to be getting at job 1. He asked me what the other company had offered, I naively told him, and now I feel like I'm being low-balled. He also said he didn't remember what the salary the recruiter was offering, which kinda sounds like bullshit, how would you not know?

He didn't think I was ready for a management position, which is funny because the title was a coordinator role with the potential to be management, but mentioned nothing about jobs tiers/pay tiers or anything. Over all the vibe was cool between us,  the owner talked a lot about the company but we didn't go over my experience, said they read all that and wanted to know who I was and asked about my life and how it led up to now.

The job seems cool but involves travel. Didn't say how much, but pretty much said it's events require all hands on deck and I imagine that will only increase in frequency as they get bigger. It's a start up and I understand things can be nebulous in that phase of an organization. Travel is also not something I'm big on, I don't hate the idea, and on one hand it would be cool to go places I've never been considering I haven't travel much. But on the other it doesn't sound to great because it consumes more than just an 8hr shift right? Showing up to a city isn't experiencing, and obviously we're there for work, so I understand that's not what I'm going to be there to do. I'm definitively a bit COVID adverse but a mask can help with that for the most part.

My question is how much of a red flag is it that they dropped the pay from 120-100k to 75k like that? I'm just not sure how to feel about either job, despite accepting the remote offer first. I think the tech/ed company is trying to poach me, but I would have to come up with some excuse to give job1 this following week to meet up with them for one more interview. I've never been stuck in this position and I'm trying to sus out what might be worth it in the long run.

Pay vs Pay, Pay vs Job titles, Pay and Travel vs Remote working.

Not sure what to do, not sure if the fast talking CEO is being intentional in being vague or if that's just how things are at this phase. But I figured there would be some idea how often travel is gonna happen. All they said was ""its not a tour, we're there then we leave."" Also, The fact the pay dropped so drastically makes me less excited about it.

This isn't the worst problem to have, but but the gray areas don't help when it comes to making decisions.

TLDR: recruiter reeled me in for a tech/ed company which involves travel with 100k only for the ceo to drop it 75k which would be 5k more than the other remote position i accepted earlier this week.Should I be concerned at all? What to do?"

About 20-30 employees. Its pretty niche in the industry and there aren’t many competitors. It has been 2 years since I graduated and I joined the company as a fresh graduate. 

Im wondering if I should move to a bigger organisation. Here are some of the pros and cons IMO: 

Small company 
Pros:
- big fish in small pond (I get all the opportunities for the junior positions)
- good colleagues (I have very good mentors, as long as I do my job, no one bothers me)
- surprisingly competitive pay
- I get to learn a lot of things out if my job scope. I think this is impt at the starting of my career

Cons:
- narrowing myself in a small industry 
- unclear hierarchy 
- there are times i feel a little insecure for not working in a “big” company 

Big company
Pros:
- good benefits 
- clear career progression 
- more opportunities 

Cons
- small fish in big pond (highly competitive)
- need to compete for opportunities 
- corporate politics (ofc not applicable to everything)
- limited learning opportunities (this is what I see from senior and friends who work in big companies, they said that their work is linter and they cant learn much outside of it)

Please share your take of on it. Im conflicted and would like to hear more POV."

I don’t know what to do or how to continue my life. I feel alone and confused. My life was turned upside down in my late twenties when I dealt with major health crisis. Like everyone I graduated college and had a normal life prior to everything. I have been unemployed in my field for the past 10 years or so due to some severe head trauma that left me disabled with hearing loss and vertigo and some other health issues, but over the years I’ve learned to accept it and live with it even though I still have the disability and it’s permanent. I am in my early 40’s and I feel like a good chunk of my life was stripped away by the disability because my late twenties and thirties I didn’t make any money and lived on poverty off of disability. I have 2 options which are either give up the disability (which I am very scared to come off of) even though my disabilities are permanent and work a normal job on the books or stay on disability and work a cash job which seems very impossible to get these days. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO! I am honestly very tired of this dilemma. I am yearning and dying to get my life back and want to work and have a normal career and income. I am very capable person. I hate being on disability because there is so much stigma behind it and I am so young. But I am also scared that my health may get in the way again. I am very skilled and knowledgeable person with many talents. I live in the NY area. I miss the feeling and the thrill of working so bad and I hate being in poverty as a young man. I was raised differently. I have values and dignity and I love to work. I have been suicidal and have been stuck with not knowing what to do and how to get out of this mess given my health condition. While I can’t control the health issues, I really want to live a normal life in my forties so badly I cry to sleep every night. I was a finance major and worked few years before my disability. I would do anything to have my normal life back as I did not sign up for this crappy life due to unforeseen health issues that impacted my life. I have been slowly trying to apply to jobs in my field but absolutely no one ever hires me and I don’t know what to do and how to get out of this trap! I too want to feel like I deserve to make 6 figures and be successful. I am tired of the trap. I am tired of the disability. I’m tired of everything. I don’t have who to turn to. I am all alone and I honestly don’t know what to do. Please anyone I ask to please have empathy reading this and offer some suggestions or help with a job and or what I should do because I definitely don’t want to end up committing suicide if I continue living like this. Please, if anyone else in this situation and was able to come out of it, share your experience. I would really appreciate it. Maybe someone give me leads for good cash paying jobs that I can do from home or from computer please? I am living poverty levels and can’t afford to even pay my rent sometimes. It’s really difficult for me. Thank you 🙏"

1,2023-04-22,Thoughts on my part-time job.,u/G-MoneyBunny,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12ux8ae/thoughts_on_my_parttime_job/,jobs,I am a part time worker and I work 3 times a week at this place for minimum wage of $16.04 as a manager in California. I regularly do 4hr or 6hr shifts but sometimes I would have to do 8hr or 12hr shifts because I’m the only manager available. All employees never have breaks at my workplace. So I would go on for these many long hrs without breaks. Is this illegal or something and what are your general thoughts on this whole ordeal or my job?

I moved to a firm that's objectively better,  with better pay end colleagues. My actual work is less interesting and my new boss is fine,  but doesn't compare to my old partner.

Last week,  I learned that my old Partner had quit and joined another firm.

1,2023-04-22,Should I quit now or later?,u/SNRNXS,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12uzlyy/should_i_quit_now_or_later/,jobs,"To keep a long story short, my job has gotten progressively worse with time becoming more hectic, relations with coworkers seeming to sour, and it’s affecting my mental health more and more.

I’m ready to give my two weeks notice. It’s just a part time job so no serious salaried job. They could probably let me go on the spot and I’d be 100% okay with that.

However, I’m not sure if I should tell them I’m quitting now or wait until I have a new job lined up. I don’t know how much longer I can stand it. Right now I only work about 20-25 hours/week or less because I’m in college. I’ll be graduating in less than 3 weeks, though. And then just over a week after that, I’m going on an overseas trip for about 3 weeks that I told my employer I can’t come in those days.

So basically, I’m not working much at all but it’s still taking a toll on me. And I really wouldn’t start back with more regular hours until mid June. I was already planning on job hunting once I got back from my trip and quitting after then, but if I did now and left in 2 weeks, it wouldn’t make much of a different I think. 

I’m not worried about being unemployed. I have savings to last me several months and lots of EBT money accumulated for food. Leaving a job when without going straight to a new one probably looks bad to someone looking to hire you, but that’s what I did with my last job and I had no issues. I never got asked about it from what I remember.

Is it worth waiting until mid June to tell them I’m quitting? Or should I just get it over with?"

I am in need of advice regarding my career. 

I (m/29 y/o) work as a medical doctor in germany, salary is not as good as in the us (only 60-100k/year) and work really doesn't suit me. Working with patients stresses me out, so I switched to laboratory medicine. While I am really good at that and work is easy for me I am very very bored. Routine work kills me. I just want to do someting different.

So my strengths are that I am very charismatic, I am good at mediating between and building relationships with patients, customers and colleagues. I can also be very good at convincing others of my ideas. I love action and getting in contact with new things. I am a sensation seeker and I have a somewhat ENFP-T type personality. 

I thought about switching to the pharmaceutical industry but I am not so familiar with the field yet as there are so many sub specializations e.g. marketing, Medical science liasion, medical advisor, medical writer etc etc. . For a MSL I fear I might not be skilled enough as I only have 9 months of research experience in molecular biology. Or could that be enough?

I am also contemplating doing a Master in bio-informatics / data science to further increase my knowledge to build a new network and maybe do a PhD later. But that costs time, and at some point I want to settle in a career. I am very intrigued to learn something entirely new though.

I am single and feel very energetic and take good care of my health. I am still very flexible to change everything and I want to do something great with my next 5 years.

Also, my dream is to go back to switzerland or maybe even go abroad.

Any advice would be appreciated. maybe someone has been in the same situation before?

Thanks a lot :-))"

Hi all. I am a procrastinator. Always have been, always will be. I am a UK civil engineer with 5+ years of graduate experience, earning reasonable money but not a fortune. I’m not really satisfied with my current line of work (salary, lifestyle, work-life balance). 

I have always been a last minute merchant. I wrote my 14,000 word Masters dissertation in the two weeks before the deadline and got a very high mark. With my current job, I frequently get my projects over the line at the last minute, but to a very high standard. It’s just how I work, but it does bring a high level of stress. Sub-consciously, I justify this work method my head because I know that I *can* and frequently do make it work. 

I am looking for a career change, but to something that pays more on what you can do “in the moment”, rather than something you plan for and work at over time. 

A good but obviously hypothetical example would be a professional athlete (football, golf, whatever). Or a bus driver. They are both jobs where the pay is very much dependent on how you perform “in the moment”, rather than the time between those moments (although I’m fully aware that professional athletes spend a lot of their time training). 

A bad example would be PhD student, where you spend years working on a single project and chip away at it over time.  

What other, more achievable professional jobs are there that fit this description? Hopefully I’ve explained it properly"

I'll try and keep it brief, bit of background:

\- Graduated with my MBA 2 years ago

\- Took an entry level position with a fintech company. Job and company were fine but pay was far too low and it was not the kind of work I wanted to do and did not want to waste time. Left after exactly a year

\- Took a new job in Logistics industry last year. I am a data analyst, working with SQL, Power BI, etc. The team I am on (me and manager) work together pretty well and have and continue to work to leverage company data to be visible, clear, and making lots of dashboards/tools for management to use. Since the vast majority of this company is not data proficient, that leaves me and the few other analysts in what I feel is secure standing in our roles. Despite all of this, I know I am being underpaid compared to my other MBA classmates, and want to pursue a higher analytics role in a different industry (such as healthcare) or just get into supply chain tech consulting where a friend of mine is.

So that's where I am now. Earlier this year I would get a few messages per week from recruiters on LinkedIn. Most of what they were offering I didn't care for, until I got a message from a recruiter from a huge medical device company regarding openings for Sr Data Analyst. I decided to talk to her and apply for the hell of it, mostly because I wanted to see if my updated resume with this job/skills would jive with them.

Apparently it did, and she wanted to call me. We talked a couple of weeks ago and I explained my skills and background to her and asked about the company. Apparently this specific role pays just a few thousand more than what I currently make, and my current company has really cheap health insurance along with fully paid 3 months paternity leave, and yes I do have a kid coming this October. I told the recruiter all of this, and she basically said that I should apply since management seems to like my background, and that there is another Sr Analyst role that breaks $100k/yr, which is what I want. I went ahead and applied for the ""lesser"" role and told her the timing might be bad because my wife is having a kid and I don't want to sign up and then have to take leave very quickly.

After applying another Sr recruiter emails me and says he wants to call me about the lesser role. I agree and he called me yesterday. Long story short I was up front and told him that I want a role that pays at least $100k, and I have a kid on the way and that honestly, while I am very interested, it might be best if we continue the conversation early next year once the dust settles and I have another full year of experience under my belt. He said that makes sense but he did encourage me to at least apply for the six-figure analyst role and see what the hiring manager thinks, since he likes my background. I applied for it expecting them to pursue someone else. An hour later I got an email that they want to have a one hour video interview with me next week about the six-figure role. They are still interested in me.

This is where I am a bit conflicted. On one hand the company and role sound great and I would love to make over $25k more per year, but this is would also be the third job since 2021, and again, I have a kid coming in october and do not want to complicate things, especially considering my wife is on my current insurance and do not want to screw up her current care with her doctor.

My main plan with this whole thing was to have them remember me and my skills so that early next year I can continue the conversation and hopefully find a role for 2024. I am not a job hopper and did not plan on this, but I was in school during Covid, things were weird, and I needed a job. These last 2 jobs have been excellent resume builders, and a job like this in this industry would be something I stay with much longer so I can eventually get into management or a more Sr role there or somewhere else.

What would be the best way to approach this without burning a potential bridge?"

The reason is that the more honest I am, the more innocent and inexperience I sound. And I don't like it.

I know that you should be honest in a job interview.  Since it can help you in some ways, but that's not the case for everyone.

People of Reddit, please tell me on a scale from 1 to 10, how honest are you when you have a job interview? and when you lie, what method or scheme do you normally use to get yourself hired?"

I had one interview last month and it turned out they weren’t interested in training a new grad. Then I applied for a different job last week, and they seem to be interested in hiring me. I emailed HR Thursday, just to clarify that they received my application and that I’m still very interested in the position. 

Well apparently, the lead from the department called me yesterday afternoon and my phone didn’t even ring. I was literally on my phone, and didn’t get any notification. So I didn’t see the voicemail until just now, called back and left a message in her office and the person who I talked to said she’d be back by Monday. I seriously hope I didn’t just ruin my chances and that they don’t think that I don’t care😭😭 I’m sure this happens all the time but ugh!!!"

Maintained 100% honesty throughout. Made it to the next round of interviews.,u/EmanAvan,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12v8aor/one_time_i_spent_an_entire_call_with_a_recruiter/,jobs,"Disclaimer: This was when I was jobless and was just applying to media research jobs on a whim out of desperation (had very little interest in this, as I find it extremely boring). Throughout the call, I spoke confidently and without hesitation. I kept my answers short and was friendly. All of those videos on YouTube about the interview tips, skills and advice—I was all that personified for these 10 minutes. I was just being honest and didn't do any of the normal BS. She started trying to put words in my mouth, as if she was encouraging me to take on this job as a new experience.

My Question: How powerful is confidence? Has being honest like this ever helped you job-wise?"
1,2023-04-22,Putting in my Two Weeks - Field work already scheduled for the day I plan to give notice.,u/Superiorarsenal,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12v8q81/putting_in_my_two_weeks_field_work_already/,jobs,"I plan to give notice to my current employer at the start of May. On the day that I am planning to give notice, I am scheduled to be working at a remote site over 2.5hrs from the office. I am wondering how I should approach the situation.


Options off the top of my head:


1. Instead of going to the site straight from home as I would normally do, I could visit my office extra early and leave my resignation letter on my supervisor's desk before departing. The main issue is that by the time my supervisor would actually get to the office and receive the letter, I will be either driving or out of cell phone service and would be unable to take any calls. Not until much later in the day/evening anyways.


2. Give notice on the next day that I am in the office. The only issue here is that it cuts down the two-week notice period by each day that I would be out of the office.


3. Give notice earlier. I could give notice the Thursday or Friday before. This would come at the cost of not being able to use a planned day of a certain type of PTO that would not be payed out to me on exit (As company guidelines state that no PTO is allowed to be taken during the notice period). The rest of my PTO would be paid out except for the 8hrs of ""floating holiday"" that I intended to use the Friday before. 



I have a lot of respect for my colleagues, so finding the way to cause the least amount of bridge burning would be ideal. 


Side question: There is a non-zero chance that a quarterly ""Professional Development Goals"" 1-on-1 meeting with my supervisor gets scheduled sometime next week. If I can't get it postponed until after I give notice, what is the best way to approach this meeting?"

Help!,u/tnguyenx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12v9l0l/deciding_on_a_job_offer_help/,jobs,"I have been in the work force for 8 years now and have been with my current company the entire time. I like the people I work with and the projects that I get to work on. Recently I was invited to apply to a job at a local municipality and had two interviews. Yesterday I was given an offer by said municipality. I am having a hard time right now trying to decide and would like any advice and thoughts. See below for a breakdown between my current company and the local municipality job offer.


Current job:
Pay - Fairly paid for my market (HCOL)

Stress Level - at times stressful to meet project deadlines and satisfy clients. 

Vacation - currently PTO includes vacation, sick, and holidays. I have over 400 hours of PTO and my company is very flexible with time off. Can rollover 280 hours per year and anything over that either have to use by end of year or cash it out.

Health/Dental/Etc. - Pretty average and not the best

Commute - work from home and pretty much guaranteed that. I do go in once every couple weeks and that is a 40 min commute.

Retirement - 401k with employer matching every dollar up to 5 percent each pay period.




Local Municipality Job Offer:
Pay - slightly more. About 10k

Stress Level - less stressful. There are deadlines but not to the same degree.

Vacation - I would have to restart the clock on that one and starting out for years 1 through 4 I would accrue 12 days per year. Sick leave is separate and holidays as would a typical government position.

Health/Dental/Etc. - Very good especially for families. Currently just me and my wife but eventually in the next year hoping to start a family. Interesting enough they also have a 20k lifetime max on fertility benefits.

Commute - job is requiring 2 days a week in office. Would be a out a 20 minute commute via train one way. They also work a 9/80 schedule. 

Retirement - government pension which would have me contribute 7% of my paycheck. There's a long confusing way of calculating the overall benefits but let's say I work there for 30 years then retire at age 60 I would get about 52.5% of my top two years of salaries averaged out. That would be my yearly payment for the rest of my life.


Something that I forgot to mention is that I also currently caring for my elderly father at the same time whose health is not well. So I am really appreciative of my current company's accommodation for me in that regards. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!"
2,2023-04-22,"Advice on government jobs (3 hour assessment, specifically)",u/thisdanginterweb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12v9td4/advice_on_government_jobs_3_hour_assessment/,jobs,"Hi all,

I'm getting my MPH in a few weeks and I've started applying to jobs. CMS posted a job on [USAJOBS.GOV](https://USAJOBS.GOV) and I got my application in within the time frame and their limit on applicants. I got a confirmation email that they received it and I also got a link for an assessment that could take up to 3 hours. In my portal it says the job is cancelled. I'm assuming they had an internal candidate.

Has anyone else gone through the government process before? My link works to my assessment and it says if I qualify for jobs based on that particular assessment my resume and assessment will be kept on file for 12 months to apply for future jobs. But it said that before the job closed. 

Should I waste my time doing the assessment when it might not possibly get registered since the associated job is gone or will it really be on file?

Thanks for any advice!"
2,2023-04-22,Not sure what to ask for for pay raise slightly odd situation,u/beewitching_frog,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12va1vn/not_sure_what_to_ask_for_for_pay_raise_slightly/,jobs,"My husband found me a job being a personal secretary. My main roll with my boss is being his property manager. He also runs a construction company and I help him run all of that as well. He also will purchase renovate and flip houses. I keep track of all his books, QuickBooks,  payments made to sub contractors, all township issues and tenant issues. I also have run personal errands for him like when he went on vacation I picked his dog up from daycare and dropped him at his house.

Recently our dynamic has changed and I think for the better a little bit. I'm no longer chained to his office I have more freedom to work from home and drive to places where I'm needed instead of waiting for him to go and meet with township officials and things like that. However now I realized I'm getting a little screwed because my work week went from 40 to 50+ hours. I was making 40k a year getting paid cash $1625 every 2 weeks. 2 things however he has me filled as an independent contractor rather than an employee so protections and benefits are non existent in the traditional sense. There are benefits for working for him he's usually a pretty chill guys if I have a personal emergency of some sort and he was able to put me in one of his apartments without a security deposit. I do like him as a boss.
However he is always asking more and more and more. On the one hand I appreciate the valuable education I'm getting as I come from a retail background. On the other hand at my current rate I'm making about 16 an hour minimum wage in new Jersey is 14.35.

The other day I asked for a raise and told him look I'm doing more for you and hourly it doesn't make sense to stay with you I don't want to have to somewhere else for employment so can we talk about an increase? He said sure think of a number and get back to him.

A side note I forgot is that I'm always on call. By him and tenants and while most tenants are respectful and only contact for true emergency others have contacted me in the middle of the night for complete bs.

Anyways.... Idk what to ask for. I don't want to get fucked. I don't want to constantly feel like I'm running around for nothing. I also don't want to create bad blood as there's only the two of us... And while I feel like I could ask for a lot more the benefits of creating my own routine and schedule is beyond helpful and I don't want to create a situation where he feels he needs to control me because he's spending so much on me. If that makes any sense??

As for the travel he does pay for my gas but there's never been a discussion on milage wear and tear.

My thought was to ask for an extra $200 a week. It will keep my hourly at $20ish I know that's not an overtime rate but the condition will be that he can not expect me to be in the office all the time.


The other option will be to just simply find another employer. I'm not against that but I'd like to learn more from him first since I don't have a great work history in these fields."

Needless to say, I need more money, but I have extremely limited time outside work to develop new skills. I have a bit of decision paralysis, because I'm afraid of spending months or years of my life developing a skill for a career path that is hard to find a job in. I am afraid of picking the ""wrong"" skill to try to learn, so to speak.

Anyway, I have been learning code/web development, although it's pretty damn hard for me. Web design looks a lot more interesting, but I feel there is less utility in that then web development (no idea if that's true or not though.) I have a strong interest in video editing, and it even comes easy to me, but I have a gut feeling there aren't many jobs in that field, at least comparatively to coding. 

Does anyone know the projected job growth between these three fields? Are any of these foolish to try to learn and expect to land a job in given my circumstances? I just hate the thought of wasting time and would like a second opinion.

i didn't want to do fast food and was trying to get a job at the walmart next to it but i can't reach to them by phone and i have limited transportation so it's been hard to just go up there and ask them 
so i've been applying everywhere and i have gotten interviews and even a second interview at one of the places but no job offers

every interview i have goes great (in my mind)  but after i follow up i am told i didn't get the job and they picked other people 

i don't know why i can't get the jobs idk why they are so picky as last year i had gotten hired on the spot for my job for a target (and a grocery store but i don't say it interviews because it was not a good experience and that my boss would probably talk bad about me)  and when i look for advice online and on reddit the workers usually say that these jobs will basically hire anyone and i am someone that is capable and willing to work so i don't understand why i am not getting hired 

 
i try to follow advice i see on online too
i don't talk bad about my last job 
i try to give good availability (4-close for weekdays and open on weekends which worked for my last job) 
i try to answer the questions good but it's honestly so hard to say that i just need money (cause i heard its not a good look) and that i don't care abt working there because its so and so restaurant
i also hear that they look for people that can fit in with the team and at my last 2 jobs i didn't really fit in and was left out from the other coworkers (it was more worse at the grocery store job)
i also have audhd so i think the interview probably can tell so i think that's hindering me from getting past the interview 

i am getting interviews but not job offers so i think it's has to do with me 


i will be honest too and my last job was not a good experience because i missed allot of work due to my mental health going downhill and that why i lost the job but i just lie and say that it was just a seasonal job and they just didn't have enough payroll keep me.  i don't know if these places call my old job and ask how i was because that may be a reason i'm not getting jobs but i am really looking to change and won't be the worker i was before but i do need some experiences to show so i can get jobs easier than to say i have no experience

1,2023-04-22,One job moving faster than other and I feel conflicted,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12vhvkq/one_job_moving_faster_than_other_and_i_feel/,jobs,"So, I'm a teacher who has been out of the classroom since 2019 for personal reasons but I'm going back in for the next school year. I've been job searching seriously for about a month or so. Truthfully, earlier than districts put out openings but still.

Back during mid-March, I applied to a top performing charter school (like, top 10% of my state) and was contacted within 2 days for an interview. The interview went well and while she was hard to read, it seemed like it ended positively. More specifically, she dangled the carrot of if I get the job, my kids can attend. 

First, I understand that the interview process can take a stupidly long time in other fields. This hasn't really been my experience in education but I didn't discount it. But this school has been dragging their feet like crazy. It took her 2.5 weeks to get back to me about meeting the department I'd work with. I meet with them next Wednesday.

While all this is going on, I applied for a private school last weekend and was also contacted in 2 days. She wants a phone interview which I do 2 days later. She said she'd contact me next week with a decision but ended up asking me for a 2nd video interview with teachers and admin by the next day. I did that interview yesterday, which aside from one question I felt went well. She said they'll finish up interviews this week and have a decision by early next week and hopefully have finalists on campus for demo lessons by the end of next week.

Here's the thing. This second school has been...aggressive with their timeline. Early on their timeline even. They've also been extremely transparent about everything, especially the next steps of the process. Their website is SUPER detailed; anything you want to know, it's there. They've also been really forthcoming about their workplace culture, details about their evaluation system, changes they're excited about, etc. 

I feel really good about my chances with this second school. But, even though they'd offer me 50% off tuition for my own kids, that's still $20,000 which isn't happening. As opposed to this charter school that's private school quality but is free. While I don't feel as good about the first school and like I don't have near as much info about the school as the second, it is a good opportunity for my kids. Yet, since this private school has been so aggressive with their recruiting and seem really interested, and it's seems like a good school, I kind of feel obligated to take that job if offered.

Do I take the job I don't know as much about, who has dragged their feet with interviewing, but could be a better learning setting for my kids OR take the job that I know the most about, who has shown clear interest about wanting me, and could be a better setting for me?"
1,2023-04-22,Salary negotiation,u/rngplease123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12vi7dh/salary_negotiation/,jobs,"Hello everyone,

I have recently come into an interesting situation that I am wondering if you all can help me with.

For some background, I am a recent Computer science graduate and have been fortunate enough to receive some job offers as my graduation date approaches. I have worked at a helpdesk for two years and have decent background knowledge for the duties required for both jobs. It is also relevant to mention I have not received both job offers but just one, with the other saying I am the ""Top candidate"".

Here is were my problem comes in. During the interview, I was told the hourly range was from 30-40 /hr, to which I said that was fine and we can find something in that range which works for both of us. Today, the offer I received from them was 22/hr. This is quite the low ball and I am not entirely sure how to negotiate this back to the point previously discussed. As of now, the other job for which I am the top candidate for is offering a salaried position which equates into roughly the same range (mid 20s).

This being said, the hourly job would have me as the sole IT person of their small company, which would all a lot of stress to my life, and the other salaried job, I have some kind of a support team to help guide my growth and progression. I do think I would be able to get a higher paying position from the hourly offer, but I am not sure how to proceed as this is the first big step into starting my career. 

Any help is much appreciated, thank you all!!"

There are quite a few staffing agencies in the area and I was wondering how stable the income would be if I don't get hired through the first job. Would it be a couple of days without income, or are we talking closer to a few weeks?   


I feel like a staffing agency is about my only chance of getting my foot in the door around here right now, but quitting a stable job in favor of that seems risky if it's going to just be a huge question regarding whether or not I'll have a job in 90 days  - Even if it is paycheck-to-paycheck for now."

Hello, I work at a $4 B company in the US. We recently hired an overseas contractor to do some sales support for us.  I have no problem with that.

Either nothing was updated and should have been or b. It was done incorrectly,  essentially tagging the contractor.  Yesterday our VP emailed several of us and said the tags were not ""helpful or inclusive"" 
I'm very upset about VP using ""inclusive"" to me that is saying I'm somehow discriminating? I can't see that it means anything but that. Thoughts?

Will my employer terminate me if I put down my MBA degree now?,u/Beginning-Emu-4647,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12vlgrp/i_left_off_my_mba_degree_when_being_hired_for_my/,jobs,"It was so much easier to find jobs when I only had a bachelor's degree, as opposed to an MBA. Employers were more willing to give me a chance. However when I obtained the MBA I found it far more difficult to find work. The interview would become all about the MBA degree and usually that would be a red flag that the managers thought I was overqualified. I would also get suspicious looks from HR directors and one Director (who was male) straight up told me I was overqualified. 

So I'm under qualified for higher positions that require the MBA because they want so much training in the field, and I'm over qualified for all the rest. 

So I left off my MBA degree in my latest job search and I was hired for an entry level position that pays $50K starting out. 6 months into my role the company has posted new positions and I would like to update my company 'About Me' file and resume and list my MBA. 

But I'm afraid that will be grounds for termination since I left it off my resume when hired and I would have never been hired for the role probably if they knew I had an advanced degree. 

Should I list the MBA? Or leave it off?"

Since joining the company they have fired two of my managers. They hired (my third manager) a female about three weeks ago. This manager just recently dissolved the parent company's marketing team that I was working on (team A). The company asked if I would like to join the subsidiary company's marketing team (team B). I accepted to move teams since I did not really have a choice or I would be out of a job.

I have a meeting with my new manager (team B) next week to talk about the work, and mandates, set my KPIs, etc.  I am already familiar with my new manager as I have worked with them on projects in the past.

During my meeting, I would like to talk to my new manager about my path to growth in the company. I aspire to become an Art Director. The company does not yet have an AD.  I have experience working on both teams and with both of their branding. I also have past experience being an AD and I have been doing AD work already for this company. 

I would also like to ask my new manager to change my position title from Graphic Designer to Senior Graphic Designer. The title of Senior more accurately reflects my past experience and the current work I do for the company. If I ask for the title change, I would not ask for more compensation. Or should I ask for more compensation?

Also, the new team I am joining has one other graphic designer, between the two of us we are splitting the work. The other designer does not have the title Senior either. I have been at the company longer than the other designer and have been doing more AD-type work. I believe this team will have more demanding work as well. 

Any advice about making a lateral move at work, or how to approach this conversation with your new manager? Or should I just keep my head down, since I am moving teams and I could have been without a job?

Thank you for the help."

(19m) i’m fairly new to posting so forgive poor formatting- so to explain my situation thus far, I have high anxiety and most of my high school years were spent in quarantine very depressed and unmotivated, so i ended up dropping out. i’ve basically had no guidance around jobs or how to succeed in school, and therefore feel extremely left behind. 

neither of my parents or grandparents had jobs in the time i’ve known them, and my mom is very high anxiety and low functioning as she is disabled, and my dad is absent, so no real help at home around my future- when i did get support at home, it was usually way too stressful of an interaction for me to be able to focus or calm my own anxiety. 

so here i am, and i can say for certain i’ve grown to care more and more about my future and what i can do to control it, and really wanting to be independent and move out, but i feel entirely lost. it feels like i’m missing information that everybody else seems to know, and while i’m a generally intelligent person, there’s a lot i never had explained to me- and it makes me feel scared to put myself out there. i’m not sure how to apply or “interview” for a job without looking like i have no idea what im doing, and whether or not there’s something i need to do to get “credentials” for something like a coffee job, when i haven’t had a job before. 

so for people who have worked in places like small coffee shops (not starbucks), how do you apply? what can i expect for an in person interview? do they base it on how much experience you’ve had, or does it not matter that i haven’t had a job before for that kind of service? how should i cope with anxiety or unexpected requests/confrontation about my past or what makes me a good hire? do i need a GED to be considered? 

and on the other end- if i end up not liking the job or end up turning it down, how should i go about quitting/explaining myself if need be? how can i tell if a job is going to be a healthy environment for me, and can i request specific days/amount of time i work or is it a cycle i’m responsible to follow that i have little control of? how do i speak to superiors or take time off if needed?

i would really greatly appreciate any advice or experience sharing that anyone’s willing to give, if you’ve read this whole thing thank you!"

I currently work my first full time job as an assistant paralegal at an immigration law firm. I am an IT major and I like the legal field and it is something that I love to do. My company is toxic and  on my team, me and this one other woman are really overworked due to the amount of people on my team who barely do any work or are too dumb to even handle the work (and my job is really entry level and if someone cannot get it at all, they are just dumb, trust me) and we come in every morning doing unpaid work just to get stuff done, because this is a big immigration law firm where so much work is thrown at everyone and things are fast paced and time sensitive. Sure it is a job, but this law firm is not great and has a high turnover rate. I am also tire d of my miserable commute from the East Bay to San Francisco every day and I cannot see how people  can live their life working at a terrible company with a long train commute every day where I have been waking up at 5:30 AM every morning.

I have been searching for remote jobs a few months after I started this job. I did get a few interviews back in early 2022, but none for a long time until one in October 2022, but never had an interview after that, I am assuming I had lack of interviews due to the recession stuff happening in 2022 and now.

I know that I am very young and this is only my first full time job, so I hope I am not just making fantasies here. I am considering going into a trade, being self employed, escaping corporate life, and moving into a quieter area. I really want to move out of the Bay Area so badly back to the East Coast (where I came from). Blue collared does not sound like a fantasy where I have to stress out my body parts of lift heavy objects (which is why I think landscaping is a popular trade) and I heard doing these blue collared jobs is not bad for your body if your are young, but can create damage to your body if you are over 40 and I heard blue collared work has higher disability rates (although being a sedentary white collared worker is bad). I sometimes dream of owning a farm in semi-rural Pennsylvania. I do not mind gardening although I do not actually do it at home right now, but I have a fascination with growing food. I think people should do this in their own backyards instead of mowing a lawn and the good thing is you can legally consider land under 10 acres a farm as long as it generates more than $2000 a year. Is this going to be back breaking if I give up a white collared job and own a farm where I can control my actions enough to manage my bodily stress?"

It was fine in the beginning, wasn't staffed on anything big just one peripheral project so was able to manage. A few months later more work started coming in and I had the realisation that I may be not that good at my job. 
For context, I am a lawyer in work in policy. We are required to come up with research to address and solve policy level issues. I have just realised that I suck at writing which forms a major part of my job. Everything I write is heavily edited to the point I can't recognise it's written by me. I also am unable to think up half the things my seniors write when they make changes to my work. Like I look at their work and think why couldn't I have thought of that. Essentially no connections between ideas, cannot think and articulate complex thoughts, have no nuance to my analysis. 
All this is really taking a toll on me. Recently I did a mini project with my boss for the first time and she made it clear that she was not happy with my work because she had to make a lot of language and formatting changes. My self-esteem has plumetted. I work up on most work days riddled with anxiety and dreading going to work. Any new work coming my way makes me panic because I think I can't deliver.
Any advice on how to deal with this is appreciated. How should I improve my writing? What should I do so that I'm able to develop deep nuanced thinking? How should I upskill while still maintaining work-life balance? Currently because I'm not skilled enough I spent more time than required on tasks and that leaves me with little time to devote to my personal life."

I received one offer, but I would have to compromise a lot for it. 

I consider myself to be a pretty competitive candidate (internships with two well-known companies, starting my own business in college, graduating a year early, high GPA, community involvement, etc.). I've heard the job market is really bad, but I didn't believe it until I started searching. I've been applying on LinkedIn and company websites to 60+ roles in the past 2 months, and I've got nothing. I've also been networking like crazy, trying to grab ahold of recruiters, which just leaves me at a dead end. I think we're all familiar with this experience by now :)

Anyway, I got an offer from a BIG consumer goods company through my university. It's a Sales Management position, and it's across the U.S. I'm not interested in sales, nor am I interested in moving to this state. However, the company is a worldwide-recognized name, and that's the only silver lining to the offer. 

I know I have to compromise in one way or another, but I just don't see myself in this role. However, I'm not sure if waiting for a better opportunity makes sense since I have had no luck anywhere else. Is it better to pass on a job opportunity in this market? 

I'm also considering staying an extra semester in school to get a certificate or minor in data analytics if this job process doesn't work out. Maybe then I can wait for the next cycle of recruiters to come to our university and hopefully have better luck."

They said on the phone their top skill is independence and that they don’t want me to push a matter up a hill for them 

2nd firm is newish and has only been around 2 years solo practitioner who said she is looking to grow and has a lot of work; she said she wants to hire me and then another Solicitor next year; she seems super nice and around my age 10 year older I would say. She seems polite. 

3rd, I had a great interview, and the guy repeatedly said I would be a great fit. I want this job so much! He said he will get back to me within two weeks! It’s been a week, and I haven’t heard yet.

The coworker I am having issues with is right out of college and has yet to work in a professional setting before--she also works in customer service, so she is in a different department.

Because she started before I did, she offered to be helpful if I had questions about the company or workplace process. I appreciated it at first. She was very enthusiastic about having a coworker around her age and said she doesn't have many friends and never has had a coworker before...I didn't mind sharing my cellphone number with her for work purposes, but she doesn't stop messaging despite my lack of responses or sharing anything personal.

Never in person and NEVER in front of the boss; she will sometimes text me with extremely rude, condescending messages, despite my attempts to create boundaries and separation. For example, she asked me abouting my MBA, then put down my degree, saying, ""When I decide to get an MBA, it would be from an Ivy League school.""

She texted me once, trying to direct orders toward me, which aggravated me, so I went to my boss and showed him. I said, ""If it is her responsibility to tell me to do tasks, I will get on them, but if not, how do you want me to deal with this?"" He stressed that she was not my superior, nor should I be working on her stuff. I told her, ""If you have an issue with something related to work-load or my work-load, you can take it up with \[our boss' name\].""

The other KICK she has been on is texting me about how much I MAKE. She's unhappy with how much she makes and claims she needs leverage for a raise. I politely avoided the question, didn't answer, and changed the subject, but she did not catch on. I finally replied, ""I am not comfortable sharing that; I am all for pay transparency in the workplace when necessary, but we work in different departments and have vastly different jobs. Knowing what I make is inappropriate in this situation, so I would appreciate it if we refrained from speaking about it."" She didn't reply.

The latest issue was slightly my breaking point; I woke up to a message of her screenshotting my profile on a dating app and sending it to me, asking who I was looking for in a partner/that she could help.

My last resort will be going to my boss or HR, but at this point, I would like towipe my hands clean. It's not preventing me from doing my job, but it annoys me outside of the workplace.

[[Edit: in the past when she asked if we could be friends/hangout outside of work, I said I’d prefer to keep it professional. I also have ignored further “personal” messages, like the latest ones.]]"

They sent over the background check and it includes education and I am worried that I am completely fucked now that this has been sent and I never told them this info and they never asked. How fucked am I and what do I do?? On the background check I listed no and just put the date of graduation. 

What would you all suggest?? This is a huge company and an amazing job working as an assistant to the CEO. Do you think I may get it rescinded even though I am actively in college ???

This isn’t a career move, I just need a new full time job in the meantime. No I can’t really get a full time job in my career field yet and no unpaid internship is not the ideal choice in my financial living situation.

I’m asking with the skills and experience a front desk receptionist gets, where can I go with it that isn’t administrative?"

It's a self-employed role. There are no training or education requirements, but I have post-secondary education in the selected role.

The employer seems to have a high school degree and talks about his excursion to Indonesia when he was 15.

There's a 5-10 minute interview. I know that at least a 30 minute interview is acceptable and indicates that the employer is interested in you, but he seems to prefer it short.

(If I don't get this job I have no idea how long it will be before I actually get a job.)

I'm planning on saying that the reason my gmail includes the word spam is because once one of my business projects I was working on got accepted into a website, but the next one I uploaded was not. So I was angry and decided to send seven messages to the website's Gmail. The project got millions of views. The second project did not get accepted again because it was not high quality enough.

I grammar checked above. It's honest (except seven gmails, I think it might be 10 messages but I have bad memory). He will probably wonder what the project will be about - indicating that I'm secretive. Also I'm worried he might wonder if I'm going to take revenge on him one day by sending spam.

Or I could just respond with ""My last name is Li"". That way he wouldn't wonder, but I wouldn't be able to show one of my greatest accomplishments of getting millions of views.

Or I could respond with the natural ""okay"", with the other two options being ""yes"" and ""hello"". It's the first option. Then I'll respond with ""My last name is Li"" (which is generic).

Also, naturally it's an odd gmail. I wrote it during a time where I wasn't feeling okay.

If he wonders if I'm going to take revenge on him by sending spam, I don't think I will get the job."

I have been on this team for 3 years and have a close relationship with our clients and extensive knowledge of our products. He's about 15 years older than me.

I had seen some toxic behaviors in him as a subordinate (such as asking for opinions when he's already made up his mind), and at this new level, I have recently gotten more insight into his motivations.

We were in a meeting with a VP and talking casually about our children, and he stated that he thinks of his employees as his children. That connected some dots for me and a lot of his previous behaviors are making more sense. I don't think he realizes how condescending he comes across to the people below him by trying to ""parent"" them instead of treating us like adults/professionals in our field.

So my question is: does any one have any advice for stepping into this specific partnership role? I have already felt like he does not fully respect me, and he himself said it would take him some time to see me as an equal. I need to make this relationship work for the sake of our team, but I disagree with his leadership style and don't want to support his narrative.

Edit: all departments in my company have two team leaders due to project volume. He's been my boss for 4 months because the boss he just replaced was mentally abusive and moved by higher ups to another team after several people under them quit. I was promoted (I applied) after my other boss quit to move across the country to be closer to family. Was just curious if anyone had any advice for working alongside someone who 1) has a different leadership style I don't agree with, and 2) can be inflexible."

1,2023-04-23,"Dealing with an invisible condition affecting my ability to work in my particular job/profession, possibility to switch into different rolls in the company, but I don't know how to feel about it.",u/FaAlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12wnxqx/dealing_with_an_invisible_condition_affecting_my/,jobs,"Excuse the long post. TLDR at the bottom.  

A little background: I'm not new to the workforce. In my late 30's. Have worked in a lot of jobs in different industries (mostly in a technician / engineer capacity), but most of my career has been survival and not really specializing in anything. Because of an invisible disability (hyperacusis) I'm having a hard time maintaining my current job without making my condition worse. I'm beyond burnt out, have been for the past 3+ years, was working my way to FIRE, but dealing with health issues throws a wrench in all that.  

After a hearing injury years ago I developed a condition called hyperacusis. Loud noises can be painful and make my tinnitus worse. It's permanent at this point, and it only seems to be getting worse with occupational exposure to noise. I've worked as a technician, engineer, and for the last 5 years as a field engineer. The problem is working in the field requires me to go into loud areas that are bothersome to my hearing even with hearing protection. My new job is turning out to be a LOT louder than I expected. I could easily get another field engineering job, but I really don't want to, the travel took its toll on me, and the noise is too much too. For several years now I have felt trapped in field engineering and my actual engineering skills have long since atrophied.  

My hearing issues have been bothering me, so I've been working in the office temporarily because my actual job on site has become a lot louder than expected and I cannot deal with the noise levels, they are detrimental to my hearing even if they are okay for most people. I have been coordinating efforts in the office and dealing with more administrative tasks. The thing is even the office can get quite loud. It's an open office which I'm learning to hate. The acoustics are terrible and there are lot of young people in the office that are very loud. Yelling (talking in a very loud voice) about stupid bullshit, playing tik-tocks on their phone at max volume, etc. Even working in the office my hearing is tired and tinnitus is ramped up by the end of the day. It's difficult to explain, but think of it like a chronic migraine where loud noise and other things exacerbate it.  I swear, suddenly I'm one of the old guys in the office, but I don't recall being this unprofessional when I was in my 20's. There is just a bunch of young people in and out of a new office and most of them have never really worked in a professional environment before. Is it common for 20 somethings to behave this way in the office these days? 

Anyway, this puts me into an awkward situation where I cannot currently do the job that I was hired for and may have to look for another job. Working from home with my condition would be ideal, but it just doesn't line up with my experience and the job. I even thought about quitting for health reasons and going on disability (short term) as my condition does qualify, but then I would be fucked. 

Last week I had a discussion with my (temporary) manager that I don't quite know how to interpret... He's only here for a short time (less than a year left) to set up the satellite office and promote from within. There was a different engineering position (quality engineering) that that my actual manager (different location) had suggested about a few weeks ago. Then there is also the management position that they plan to train someone for and promote within, which I have thought about but wasn't sure if I was in the running for or not. 

My temporary manager came out of a meeting with my permanent manager where they were discussing a plan forward with running the satellite office.  He asked me if I had already been already been offered the other position, and I told him that I thought it would be a better fit. He said ""I'm sure you can do it, but is it something that you want and will enjoy"". After that and some other discussion he started talking about the other two positions that they plan to promote for. It wasn't clear to me from the conversation if I was in consideration for the site management position or not. I did ask who they were thinking of promoting for the site manager position and he told me he didn't want to say because they were still discussing it and they 'may have to hire from outside now' even though they would rather promote from within. There are a couple other people that may be on the list that I can think of, one might be an alright manager although he's old-school, the other I don't think I would work for, everything is a power play with him and I don't think that makes for a good middle manager. Work is going to ramp up and things are going to get chaotic, especially when my temporary manager leaves. It's an odd situation, my company has the money coming in and is growing rapidly, but there doesn't seem to be much structure (at least locally).  

I'm still unsure which I would rather. People come to me for advice and I think I'm good at managing projects, I think I'd be okay at managing people that are professional, but the thing I don't think I'd be good at or would want to do is manage a bunch of high schoolers that run around screaming. The other quality engineering position could would work out, but only if I could work in a relatively quiet environment where I would be able to concentrate. It is a lot more documentation and administrative work, which I can see myself getting bored with, and after reading on reddit it seems like a lot of people get pigeonholed in quality engineering too and seem to hate the field which is disheartening. That being said at least I wouldn't have to wreck my ears on site. 

TLDR: have a invisible condition affecting my ability to do my job, even working in an open office has been difficult with my condition. Thought I might have to quit my job/career for health reasons. I'm working in a new satellite office that is just getting started where they plan to promote individuals from within. There might be an opportunity for another position, but I don't know if I jumped the gun on that other position and screwed myself out of other opportunities for promotion."

I've applied directly on the site of the company many times but have mostly gotten no replies even after weeks. The jobs I've been looking for have also mainly been in the customer service field (retail, barista work, waitress) so if there are any specific sites for these jobs I would really appreciate it if they were shared."

Preparing in my youth and old age that’s many decades away makes me feel good, but it’s not a job goal. Those aren't good goals that can get me a job. I feel like everyone else has goals that are job related and I try to create goals like that to tell people since childhood because of what I feel like I'm lacking. By doing that every year from middle school to college, at job fairs, and in interviews, I forgot to take a look at what I'm good at because I've always been obsessed with worrying what type of lofty dream I should have that's good enough. Because of that, I speak of that instead of answering what my skills are when I'm asked about relevant skills in an interview.

When I graduated with a science and policy focused sustainability degree, a minor in art history, a masters, in business, and experience with Japanese, but not high proficiency or fluency, all I wanted was a job with detail work where I can work with numbers, do research, do something with operations/administration/systems/daily tasks. I graduated in 2012 with my bachelors and 2013 with my masters. I’ve had this thinking since then or really my whole life that I needed to get started in one thing that I can build, and show my builded experience to employers, so that they can trust me to hire me. Even though I’ve heard that hiring is becoming more focused on what a person brings with their skills, which I should be happy about since when in between jobs I’ve scrambled because I thought I knew my skills more than desiring a dream job title and thought that was the issue, I’m actually now more confused. 

This is more of an elaboration to a similar post. I posted in r/Aspergers."

I’ve had my current full-time office job about a year, it’s a niche field that I have no particular interest in so I’ve been constantly job hunting - I finally got an offer for a part-time job that, even though it was an obvious pay decrease due to being part-time, I was going to take it because it was more aligned with the field I want more experience in. I worked out a start date with the new job that would have been about a month from now. So I told my boss that I would be leaving the company to pursue other interests, but that I really appreciated everything about working for him, he also said it was a pleasure working with me and bummed to see me go but he understands that’s just how business is. We worked out that I would help train my replacement for an easy transition.

Fast forward - the new job notified me that there were some “unprecedented changes” in their hiring plans and that the role will no longer be available to start anytime in the near future. Great! The panic started.

So then I pathetically asked my boss if there’s anything I can do to keep my job. He’s been a very understanding boss the whole time I’ve worked for him, but he (validly) explained that he already has interviews scheduled for my position and that since I made it clear this isn’t the field I want to stay in, he can’t keep me and have this same conversation in another month when I’m in a position to leave again. We’re also a very small startup company, so he doesn’t have any room to transfer me to a different department or anything like that. He’s sympathetic to my situation so I think he isn’t rushing to replace me by next week or anything, he also said I can list him as a reference in my job hunt, but I do know my time at the company has a definite end date that will come very soon.

So now I’m job hunting like crazy, which I’m sure you can all imagine how well it’s going with how the market is across the board right now. I’m stressed that I’ll have to go back to a part-time food service/retail job that will pay even less than the part-time plan I originally had. Also feeling stupid that I was maybe TOO transparent in telling him I’m leaving because I don’t think this field is a fit for me - if I hadn’t told him that, maybe I could have kept my current job?

Not sure if I have any specific question to ask here… any advice? Words of encouragement? Job offers (lol)?"

I got a useless degree and I am not sure what to do with my career now. I got a degree in Cultural Studies because I switched my major too many times to count in college and I settled for something that was interesting to me. I was already 4 years in and I just wanted to get out of college at that point. 

The stress of having a useless degree and not finding work I'm interested in is causing me to have frequent panic attacks and crying spells because I don't know how to dig myself out of this. Luckily in college I had quite a few scholarships so my student loans are relatively low (only a little over 10k) but if/when I have to start paying those back I feel like it's only going to get worse. 

When I graduated, I got a job at a staffing firm  but the pay was pretty bad- $16/hr for a job I despised. I would dread going to bed at night because I knew I would have to wake up in the morning and do the same day over and over again. I had to quit because I couldn't take it anymore and got a job at a chain store because the pay is the same. The months before quitting the staffing job, I applied to roughly 400 jobs and did a few round of interviews at different companies but never got an offer. Most of the jobs were entry-level sales positions, recruiting jobs, things I knew I could do. I even got a few referrals and it didn't help. 

I also have this doom mentality that it's pointless to go back to school because once I get out I'll be in my late 20s starting a new career with little to no REAL job experience. I've toyed with the idea of going back, maybe getting a Masters, maybe getting a whole new bachelors, maybe just getting certifications in Marketing or something similar but I feel like I'm in a hole and won't ever be able to get out of this or feel successful. 

I just don't know what to do and when I talk about it with people in real life they just try to tell me that it's fine and everything works out, and sometimes it does but it had been 2 years since graduating and it's not getting any better."

He got fired from his last job (he admits it was his fault... he missed a few deadlines) doing office work that makes software.  The company he got fired from told him that his last supervisor won't be available as a professional reference (which is fine because none of us were going to ask him anyways given the circumstances).  As part of exiting the company, they also sat him down and told him that he would be marked as ""ineligible for rehire"".  However, they don't want to deal with lawsuits, so the company made it known that **when other companies call to ask about his time there, they will only confirm dates of employment, his job title, and if perhaps that he's been marked as ineligible for rehire.**

He does have a couple of supervisors who he worked under at that same company.  They both left to pursue jobs elsewhere, and they both thought positively of him.  I mentioned you could call them up and ask if they would be willing to be used as a managerial level professional references.  **Then the question came up of whether or not he should mention to them he got fired.**  I don't think it matters (for all I know, they probably noticed the place had issues, and something like this was bound to happen), but I leaned towards not mentioning that he got fired.

**What are your thoughts on this?**

UPDATE: Friend filled me in... he contacted both of his supervisors.  For both of them, he didn't mention that he wasn't with that company anymore, and they didn't ask.  He believes one of them may know that anyways as he sent his resume to him to critique, and it does say his employment ended (last month, as opposed to saying ""present""), so whether or not he caught that is another thing.

My current job and (at the time that I left) my last job didn’t use any JS frameworks. Using a JS framework at my current job isn’t a viable option for several reasons.

However, now that I am applying for other senior frontend dev roles (I’m in higher education in the US getting paid about $75k but really hoping for something paying over $100k) I’m finding that I have enough years (15 years) in development to be senior, but I don’t have that core requirement of working with react, angular, or Vue at my job and it’s killing my prospects.

I made my own portfolio in react and plan on doing a couple “for fun” sites in react involving accessing a REST service… but I’m finding that every job I apply to wants the word “React” on my list of job duties at some company.

I have an interview tomorrow that expects me to have experience in react, react context, and graphQL, and outside of what I learned on my own, I don’t have any professional experience.

How do I spin this weakness as a strength or at least an opportunity?"

When I was training at that position, however, I was either asking my trainer or copying and referencing their notes, and at my current position I'm constantly trying to compile notes for every unique issue I encounter, and I'm always finding new ones. Why not just have the people with experience make the notes so the inexperienced can acclimate to doing the work more quickly?

Even though functions change often, I can't help but think about how much time it would have saved me, the people who have trained me in my jobs, and the people I've trained at their jobs to just have this kind of documentation. 

Is it a security risk? Is it a subtle capitalist ploy to extract the most possible surplus labor out of its employees, even at the cost of efficiency? Is there a job as a consultant that would do this for other companies I could take both for the career and the catharthis it provides me?"
6,2023-04-23,Adult / non student internships? Is there such a thing?,u/nakedpumpkinn,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12x0bvb/adult_non_student_internships_is_there_such_a/,jobs,"So I’m in my mid 20’s and I’ve basically spent my whole working life in one career straight of out of highschool and have now realized that it’s no longer something I want to do as a career. I’ve worked in pet care since I graduated, both as an employee, as well as running my own business for 6 years. I am soooo ready for a career change but despite applying and interviewing and showing how eager I am for a career change, nobody takes my work history seriously. I’m very interested in social media work, marketing, branding, all of that fun stuff. Now I don’t want to go back to school. I’m also a more learn by experience type of person. Now I do have some marketing / social media experience with my business as I had to build my whole brand that way and learned a lot. But I have a feeling that won’t mean much to anyone I am applying for. So, my question is, is there such thing as an internship for someone wanting to break into a new career? I’m even willing to “work for free” if it gets me the right experience and helps me get down a new path. How would I even word an email like this? Has anyone successfully done this or has any tips? Thank you in advance!"

I am currently 24 years old and I graduated from a state university in 2021 with a finance degree. I am on my second job post graduation doing anti-money laundering investigations and financial compliance at my current company. I have been here for ~7 months of writing this post. My salary is $40k/yr, but I have recently learned that my company charges my client ~$105k/year for my services. 

My prior job was as a manager at a large transportation company where I was making ~$55k/year. I took the hit to get into my degree’s career field as that is what I was wanting to do and the job was eating away at my mental health.

Is it logical to assume that I can find a new job within my finance career that pays $70-$80k/year? I know this depends on experience, licenses, certification, etc, but I was curious about where I could go currently.

I am more than happy to send someone my resume to get a more detailed response/input if they’re curious.

I greatly appreciate the time and consideration anyone puts into my inquiry!"

There are a lot of of opportunities to grow with this company. But, once these positions are filled, they won’t be open unless someone quits, moves up, or transfers to a different location. 

Since I’ve been with this company, we’ve had district managers, managers, asst. managers, and supervisors who have either moved up over time or transferred to a different location.  Recently, there have been 3 other employees who are moving up into a manager position, district manager position and a supervisor position.  Now, these coworkers are absolutely incredible people and I really do think all of them deserve it because they’re good people and hard workers. But on the other hand… I can’t help but feel like maybe I’m doing something wrong? I go above and beyond on my job. I come in early/stay later to help several times a week, help others catch up on their projects when I finish mine, and I have a very good work relationship with all my coworkers (at least to my knowledge). I’ve mentioned to my boss I’d love more hours( working full time) many times.  I don’t know how to go about talking to my boss, or if I even should. I’m honestly hurt that I wasn’t approached about an opening. Two specific openings have been open for over 6 months and these other workers were all approached for the job. 

Currently, I’ve been keeping my options open, applying for other part time and full time jobs. I really like what I do, and like who I work with, but am bothered by not being even considered for these opportunities for advancing with the company. These other three employees have been here less than 6 months. 
I’m thinking maybe this chapter of my life should come to an end. I’ve never experienced this before and am not sure what I should do from here."

I've been working contract to contract since the pandemic seeing as I graduated during it and it's been nice to get some experience under my belt and fill out my resume with some pretty relevant opportunities. My current one has taken me off full-time and I don't want to be caught by surprise should something happen so I've taken the liberty of refreshing my resume and profiles on all the usual platforms but feel as though I should be doing more to ensure my next job is as good as my current one. I intend to stick around for as long as is feasible and I am lucky to be entirely remote and making a fair amount of money for my level of experience so I am keen to keep the ball rolling and hopefully take on more responsibilities to help me sell myself to more employers in future.

Hi everyone,

I currently work a 9-5 job in Spain with over 4 years of experience in .NET and React.js. I've never freelanced before, but I'm interested in exploring it as a second job to make some extra money. I don't need to earn a lot, but I also don't want to work all night to make ends meet.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for getting started as a freelancer and how to balance a second job with my current 9-5. I'm particularly interested in finding clients who need help with .NET and React.js projects, but I'm open to other opportunities as well.

Any tips on how to set realistic expectations, manage my time effectively, and find freelance work that fits my skill set and availability would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!"

I think the title makes it seem selfish but I’ll try keep this as short as possible. 

I have just been offered an internal promotion to a fairly established management position in a reputable company and have been working my backside off for it but I was getting worn down from it so in this period where I wasn’t sure if I would be offered the promotion, I applied for another job that I didn’t expect to hear back from.

I heard back two weeks ago and my interview is Wednesday but I got offered the promotion a week ago. I have until Friday to sign my new contract for the promotion (which also contains a 3 month notice period compared to my current 2 weeks).

At the end of the interview on Wednesday, is it appropriate to ask when I should expect to hear back and highlight that I have a contract that I need to sign by 5pm Friday otherwise my notice extends considerably?

I don’t want to seem like I’m trying to force their hand but ultimately may make a difference in their decision.

Thanks in advance for any advice. This is UK, England based."

A couple of weeks ago, on my last paycheck, I was incorrectly paid a $500 referral bonus that was supposed to be paid out to the person who referred me to this job (I just started about ~4mo ago).

After taxes, that $500 became $327, and I saw a $327 increase on my paycheck.

That following Monday (still 2wks ago), I got an email from Payroll explaining their mistake and that they’d have to correct it on my next paycheck - which was this past Friday. 

On Friday, I got paid, but something didn’t seem right. I went into my paystubs and noticed a $462 net DECREASE in my paycheck. I reached out to Payroll to which I got a confusing response, where they went back on a tax related question I asked a couple weeks ago - clearly just had no idea what they were talking about.

I dialed the head of Payroll (who I was emailing) and they didn’t pick up. I received an email back again “explaining” why there was a $462 decrease in my paycheck. But the explanation didn’t make sense. We left off on Friday with Payroll saying they’d dig deeper into this and get back to me. 

My confusion is that, if there was a $327 net increase by mistake on my last paycheck, shouldn’t the net decrease (correction) on this paycheck also be $327? Not $462? Not sure why I’m paying an extra $135 out of my paycheck for their mistake. If someone else could weigh in, that would be great. 

TL;DR: payroll incorrectly paid me a $500 bonus, after taxes it became $327. When they corrected their mistake on my most recent paycheck, they took $462 back instead of $327."

Problem is, that was SIX MONTHS ago. Every month my friend would send an email to follow up, and every time the HR says the same thing, that they are waiting for the go signal from the higher-ups.

The length of time spent in waiting made my friend worry that the employer really has no longer any intention of hiring them and is just waiting for them to get tired. This lead to overthinking, maybe they did not pass the background check, maybe the job is actually no longer vacant, etc.

Is this plausible? Would company HRs really keep the applicants hanging and wait for them to give up instead of just telling them straight up that the job is no longer going to be offered to them for one reason or another?"

However, they are all scams, as per Upworks  interviews are only to be conducted through them and interviews that require the use of 3rd party entities are to be reported, each of these jobs want Skype or MSN interviews. And the names they message with change dramatically when they give their Skype info. I swear I have an invisible sign on my fore head that even when I don’t meet in person it says desperate, and it can be seen. 

A “job” I had in October absolutely broke me bc of how much of a scam it was. Got it through indeed and what they posted on indeed was Nothing like the actual job. First of all the job they posted was for social media assistant, go to the interview and what key component would someone need to do social media work? A computer. The owner is 40 years old, and hates using computers, but he swore up and down a laptop was being ordered…no laptop was ordered and I would an additional $400 for every post that was created that resulted in a contract. The job was nothing but cold calling people off of lists that were 11-12 years old, 98% of the numbers were disconnected, and 2% that were active the people that answered threatened physical harm on me if I called again. I would go to the bathroom or my car and just cry.

The job before that the owner was this abusive Austrian woman who constantly called me an idiot, moron or stupid. There was zero training and my only contacts I could ask for help lived in South Carolina, and I could never get ahold of them, they never answered my calls or emails. She fired me bc I couldn’t write backwards, yea she wanted me to write out contracts right to left and called me an incompetent idiot bc I couldn’t do it. Also I never used this thing called Cricut, and I told her that more than once and she would insult me if I printed something wrong. But this job was also listed on indeed as administrative/social media assistant.

Now, obviously, logic would indicate you should sign first, then quit...unless you want to negotiate. (In my current situation, my HR knows I'm unhappy with my salary, they just excluded me out of likely everyone in my office from 2-3% std of living raises this year, despite a solid performance review and no notes from my new manager he is unhappy with me...and my yearlong search for a higher paying job is leaving me hopeless. I would much prefer to get a real raise, and stay). 



I'm interested to hear what people say, the posts about people quitting only to have the rug yanked from out under them are horrible and I wish there were legal recourse for it. There are so few protections for employees built into the system.
 

I ask because I am afraid of getting a better job - e.g., remote admin with the software I'm using now, and for higher pay - and being fired in six months because we're in a recession and companies lie, without any qualms, about admin, somewhat non-technical jobs. It seems remote jobs aren't actually too stable if you work outside tech (if that).

I’ve been working there for about a month now. unfortunately the employer has a different definition of hybrid, flexible schedule than I believed at the time of receiving the job description and offer letter there after. Under the job, description benefits it specifies, flexible schedule and hybrid. During the negotiation process, I took into account that this was a benefit and it get compensated for the low pay. In fact, when I negotiated the pay rate, the counter offer from my boss included the fact that it was a hybrid position and dad work life balance was important to her and the organization. Even further, when I asked about a stipend for my home office, she said that they wouldn’t be able to provide that being that it was a “option” to work in an office or at home. So as you can see the word, flexible an option are the words that implied it was my choice to wfh or in person as well as her hammering in that the hybrid work was a perk. 
Now I am seeing that it actually is not a choice at all and that most of the time I am required to be in office I have been able to work from home about three days out of the entire month that I’ve been working there and these were of the discretion of my boss. Right now we are gearing up for a lot of events that I am having to have a lot of input on and so up until now I’ve been understanding that she wants to meet in person. but today she said “unless I say otherwise, you will come in office. is it just me or is that not at all flexible? I responded that we will need to revisit the job description and offer letter to specify that it is not employee choice I guess my question is how would you handle this? Is there a way to leverage this to either ask for more pay or a different title parentheses I am also doing work that is not in the job description parentheses? Or do I accept the fact that it’s obvious they use this as a way to reel someone in with the intention of not delivering and go elsewhere?"

* Is it legal to not be transparent about PTO accrual and availability?

The company uses a program that shows employees the breakdown of their paychecks, however, there is no option to view how much PTO you have available or how it is accrued. If we want to know how much we have, we must email our ""HR"" (which is just the boss' wife). All other jobs that I've had allow employees to view their available PTO whenever they want at their leisure. I feel like I'm at the mercy of trusting this person to tell me how much PTO I have. Is this normal? Is it legal?

&#x200B;

* Is it legal to not be transparent about how monthly bonuses are calculated?

The company gives us monthly ""bonuses"" based on individual upsells as well as how much the office generates in upsells. So if everyone is doing well, including you, our bonus is higher for that month. If you did well one month, but the office as a whole did not do well, then your bonus is lower for that month. There is no transparency as to how these ""bonuses"" are calculated. It's my understanding that the sales lead determines this. Is this normal? Is it legal?"

I took a long break living off of my savings and doing what I wanted, but now have to go back to work. 

I will keep all my sick leave and continue my retirement if I go back to work for any state agency or local government within the state. I am looking at applying for a job with the Department of Transportation in a similar pay grade as I was in before, but with different experience expectations. I have many skills applicable to the job, so I think I'd be a good candidate.   

Knowing that most of the jobs in the state start you out at the bottom end of the salary range, should I request to be paid what I was making or slightly higher? I was making 25% more than the starting salary for my old job and the job I am now applying for.

Should I request this information from the HR person listed in the job description before I apply?

I don't want to jeopardize me getting hired, but I also don't want to waste a bunch of time for them just to say ""no"" in the end. I would not be able to live on the lower end of the pay grade, so I would have to decline if they did."

I have been at the engineer role in my department for the past 6yrs. All this time I've been trying to get to the senior engineer role by working hard and doing extra bits around the department like COSHH assessments and database maintenance, however despite this I'm still being refused promotion by either rejecting applications (in my company you have to apply for a promotion) or by not making the application process available for myself and my colleagues in the team. This past few months I've given up trying and caring and in recent discussions with the department managers I've been told that I need to change my attitude and go back to working hard if I want the to get the promotion and that I will only get the promotion if I do something like going to other departments and bringing back work to my department. Now I can tell you for a fact that no other senior engineer in my department got their promotion by going off to other departments. They all just got it by working hard and doing the job that's infront of them. Every time I mention the extra stuff that I've been doing (and how, in other departments, they are done by senior team members or every team leaders/managers) i am just told that doesn't mean anything and that maybe other departments should give those jobs to lower level team members also. I feel unappreciated and that everything I do shows more that it can be done by a lower level employee rather than showing that I'm doing work of higher level employees. At this point I think I should just give up altogether. Do you think I should just quit and go work somewhere else or is there something I can do to help my situation? P.s. sorry about the rant."

I am in the construction management field, 23 years old with about 18 months experience. 

A year ago, I was making 52k and went job searching. A company offered me 80k in a better role and I took that to my employer. They counter offered the same role and 85k. I accepted. 

Fast forward a year, still with the same company but about a month ago they hired a new employee with a role above mine, becoming my manager I report to. Basically all my day to day actions were stripped from me and now handled by new employee. I went from having a decent amount of responsibility, to now having very minimal responsibilities (doing document management, meeting minutes, various tasks here or there) after I had been doing more high level tasks for the better part of a year with no complaints from my supervisors. 

A recruiter connected with me about a potential job opportunity last week, and I said why not take a phone call. Fast forward a week and I have a job offer for the same position and 95k. 

Job Comparison

Current Employer: Pros - Been with them 18 months, know the ins & outs of every process and every employee, 85k, work remote twice a week, 30 min commute to office, never use personal car during work hours (use company vehicle), own office, double amount of paid company holidays Cons - “demoted” while keeping job title, work done specific to a niche in the construction industry (residential remodels), don’t use 2 of the biggest softwares in the construction industry 

Job Offer: Pros - 95k, 30 min commute (same just different direction), opportunity to grow, will actually be doing what my job title refers to, does multiple work in the industry (residential, commercial, public works) 300$ gas allowance, uses 2 biggest softwares in industry, Cons - use personal car during work hours, 5 days a week in office, no office would be working in “cubicle” in middle of office 

Update: I accepted the offer on Friday of last week. Start date is in 2 weeks. Current employer is willing to revamp my role where I will be doing alot more meaningful work, but no raise in pay because work is slow at the moment, with a lot of potential projects in the process of being bid out."

I feel I have a strong resume and a unique background (majoring in Psych and minoring in Data Science) but because those fields can encompass a large space, I feel I might not be applying for best-fit jobs. Can anyone suggest a resource/website where I can upload my experiences and it recommends job titles/roles (less actual job listings rather actual titles that I can add to my job search).

I have also attached a blanked out version of my resume (ignore the spacing it became weird when I was blanking stuff out) if y'all have any recommendations for specific roles I should apply to. I have mainly been applying for marketing and branding positions - but if you have specific role recs in those fields as well I would be so open to hearing them.

In addition to job searching, i'm also working on networking, certifications, reaching out to recruiters, reading more books on the career i want to get into, etc. It's all a little overwhelming/exhausting especially with how much sheer time im 'supposed' to be flat out applying for jobs.   


So, iv'e got two questions that i'd love some thoughts on:  


1. How do you plan for 'all' of it? How do you organize the books to read, seminars to attend, recruiters to reach out to, and all of that jazz on top of the time void thats simply 'applying to jobs'
2. How do you prioritize it? Is reaching out to that recruiter a better idea than reading a few chapters of the new book on 'how to be an effective leader in \*new career you want\*'? What about a networking event? Or simply spending the time applying for jobs outright?  


Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

I was looking into it and I found this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-use-linkedin-automation-augment-your-job-search-benjamin-mena/) which informed me that there are a plenty of LinkedIn automation tools which might be used for job hunters for more active and aggressive job searching while expending your LinkedIn contact list as well. So why not automate my side of things the same way?  It seems that networking and social recruiting becoming is more and more important. And also as I heard referral recommendations in recruiting process are the most effective and widespread manner among HR-professionals.  

Whats your opinion, is it worth the effort to make a such LinkedIn Network Booster for Job seekers - like a new automated job searching way on LinkedIn to turn personal connections into career opportunities! 

I'd just like to thank everyone who responded to this post. All of the feedback is greatly appreciated. There are good points made for and against the tool idea.

2,2023-04-24,I have applied to 10 jobs a day for three months and have gotten maybe 10 first round interviews total and not progressed past that point with any of them. I can’t do this anymore.,u/BrennusRex,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12xohjb/i_have_applied_to_10_jobs_a_day_for_three_months/,jobs,"I just need to rant. I’m so stressed that I’ve been puking all day and think I have an ulcer. 

My girlfriend got an offer to her dream job in the city of Salem, Massachusetts. It’s the perfect job but it doesn’t pay enough to support us out there. I would need something that pays at least as much, preferably more ($40,000 or more and I would likely hold a weekend job waiting tables or making coffee as well). I have a bachelor’s degree and five years of experience in jobs pertaining to customer service, receptionist work, administrative assistantship, and the like, as well as fantastic references. 

I have applied with thorough, careful, well planned applications to HUNDREDS of jobs in the area between North Shore and Boston in the past 3 months. I have sat down for maybe ten interviews at ABSOLUTE most. None of progressed past a first interview. I have been ghosted by staffing agencies, ghosted after asking what the basis for my rejection was/what else they may have wanted to see from a candidate, just completely sidelined. I’ve applied for jobs where the requirements are a high school diploma and the ability to blink and breathe on your own and I’ve been inexplicably denied. Literally jobs that are so low paying that I’m readying myself to work 2 or 3 different jobs at once just so that we can survive and the only job that got back to me with something positive was a cafe that wanted me to work weekends because I have experience as a barista. I even got to the point of considering joining the fire academy or becoming a deckhand on a fishing boat and even those seem to be dead-ending me. Across Salem, Beverly, Peabody, all the rest of North Shore, and as far down into Boston as Southie, I cannot find work of any kind. 

I pretty much mentally gave up on Massachusetts and started looking local, figuring if I move to detroit (biggest city near me) I could live somewhere cheaper and find work. After another hundred applications and bartering with several staffing agencies, my absolute best offer was seasonal public parks maintenance. 

Five years of mid-level office experience and a bachelor of science. And the best offer I get is seasonal work where for 20 hours a week and $15 an hour, a wage that I couldn’t survive on if I lived in the poorest county in Michigan, I can go pick up trash.

I’m at my wit’s end and the two ideas that have occurred to me are to either enlist in the army so that I can at least not worry about when my next meal is coming or to simply elect to stop breathing. 

What the fuck do I do? My lease is ending soon and I have DAYS to find a job that will dictate where I move to next, along with proof of a source of income in order to actually qualify for an apartment, but it seems like the most generous hiring teams will only reject you after your application has been on the back burner for a month."

That’s fine cool, they said there was someone who was better aligned with the role. Part of me wants to ask what it was about my experience and the interviews that didn’t align with the role, especially since I hit all the requirements. 

Part of me is like fuck them fuck this who cares. Another part of me is like … but why? I did 7 interviews — what was the problem, what did I do wrong?"

I always stressed myself on wanting to work in some form of data entry, whether it's a remote job or office, but I honestly never took the chance to look into it.

I didn't feel like I needed to at the time, but I'm at the point of my career, where things are affecting me physically, emotionally, and as of recent, financially.

I figured now is the time to take a chance, so what are the chances of getting into such jobs?"

My company (retail/apparel) announced and began layoffs last week. My department will be notified of decisions in May. (I knew it was coming based on 2022 earnings and coded language)

Anyway, how do I stay motivated to do any work? The timing sucks, because we have some of our largest workstreams kicking off in two weeks. I planned my vacation around it (i.e. I'm still going on vacation but since this workstream is important to us, I'm working a couple days from the hotel).

The strangest part is my team (manager, director, vp etc) still conducting business as usual. A part of me wants to say fuck it, and come up with an excuse as to miss the meetings in two weeks so I can 100% enjoy my vacation. 

Thinking about the outcomes:
1. Work hard, enjoy vacation 50%  get laid off. 
2. Slack off, enjoy vacation 100%, get laid off
3. Slack off, enjoy vacation 100%, keep job."

10,2023-04-24,I am finding my job being boring is having an effect on my mental health....,u/unpopularonion90,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12xrao9/i_am_finding_my_job_being_boring_is_having_an/,jobs,"I know what you are thinking: complaining about a boring job? I must be crazy. Trust me: I'm trying to make the MOST out of it and not complain and be grateful-I leverage the down time to learn courses (I've finished one so far), do my own personal projects, cook/clean and do household chores and keep going at my hobbies. I try to leave the house AS MUCH as possible and almost everyday after work.

That being said, I have been really struggling over the past year. My job, to be honest, is not really what I want to do. I just changed to this organization/role a year and a half ago. I have a lot of incredible, multidisciplinary skills and don't feel I get to use them and feel like even though I am getting a decent salary, my skills are worth more than what I am making. When I do get tasks, I am so bored. This is the same stuff I've been doing since I graduated my masters nearly 5 years ago. I'm not learning anything new. I feel like what I have to do at work is making me stagnant. I have learned a lot from projects I do on my own time or initiate myself outside of work, but coming up with new creative projects takes a lot of energy that I don't always have. When you are already bored, the enthusiasm and motivation can be really hard to muster.

I don't really see myself growing in this job at all and am giving myself a few months to learn as much as possible so I feel ready to apply to new jobs. But in the mean time, I really am struggling. I've looked back to my old job-I knew I had to leave, but I think I was less depressed and anxious than I feel now: I was hybrid and felt that worked well for me-when I'd get bored of being in the office, I was at home. When I was bored at home, I'd be in the office. I know, I know: as they say, coworkers AREN'T friends, but I had some good conversations with coworkers, I'd meet new people all the time and it felt like it made the day go by faster. I was doing courses then too in my downtime and felt like my brain was working faster. 

Now I feel like my brain is slowing down. Outside of my professional life, my personal life has a lot of challenges too: I'm in my early thirties, single, not many close friends at all and unfortunately a lot of friends who have abandoned me which weighs heavier on me when I'm not busy with my job. I live in a big city and have been making the most out of it: I use meetups, apps and other things to meet people and make friends. I have done an incredibly good job at making initiatives, but it's hard at this age to really bond with others my age-people are too unmotivated to hang out after work, they have a set group of friends or their own families which they are very busy with. This is why I felt like interactions in the workplace helped me, though when you go online people say they HATE talking to their coworkers and workplace gossip and I totally get that, but I think I also had an opportunity to just have casual conversations which was kind of nice. 

I do therapy every week-I have been doing this for over 10 years. Still, I just needed a place to vent about this. I'm wondering if others can relate to me. I am not necessarily looking for advice, but if you have been in my shoes or relate to my feelings, I wouldn't mind hearing what helped you or motivation. I'm telling myself to work hard and finish my courses soon so I can finally feel ready to start applying for jobs, but I feel so tired and overwhelmed some days."

Company B offers better pay/benefits/vacation and more room to grow as it’s a bigger company. 
I’ve already done the pre screen and interview with the team at company B I would potentially be working with, and got a call from HR on Friday saying he was pretty sure they would be extending an offer in the next week or two. HR also said to let them know if I get any other offers so they can potentially speed up their decision. My question is do I tell them I have another offer?

I feel like I’ve made myself look a bit lame in their eyes as I’ve been vague when they’ve questioned if I’ve had any other opportunities from other employers. Best way to handle company B?

I left my previous job because of the long hours, constantly being thrown into the fire, the late nights, and the effect it was having on my mental health and personal life. 

My current job seemed like the solution. I was told I wouldn't be doing any OT/Weekend Work unless absolutely necessary and, even then, I'd have upwards of 2 years of training where I'd do zero OT. My hiring manager literally said ""we won't through you into the fire until you fully understand everything that's being asked of you. We want you to really feel confident and have a good Work/Life balance""

fast-forward just a few months later...I was thrown into the fire, working OT, and Weekend Work.

I've been at this company for almost 2 years now and it's absolutely awful. It's taken such a negative toll on my mental health and personal life. On top of all of that, my immediate manager does not know how to communicate and delegate, which just leaves me drowning in work with unrealistic time expectations causing me to constantly make mistakes which only sets up back even more. The ""team"" is just two people, my boss and myself.

I'm tired of working/living this way. 

Can anyone suggest some solid TRUE 9-6, Mon-Fri, jobs (with benefits) that can be a solid career? I'm also currently making an hourly wage in the mid-twenties an hour so I'd love to either match that or beat it.

I've been working at a job for 3 days as a sushi chef in a small kiosk of 3 people. At this point, I'm still clocking in and doing theory stuff on my phone and have not made sushi at all yet. The managers are leaving my texts regarding technical difficulties within their app for the theory work on read, and I don't know what to do. Even the guy training me said its ridiculous that he has to be the one to help me, which sucked to hear even though he did mention its obviously not my fault at all and doesn't hold it against me, but the managers, who are apparently well known to be like this.  


This job takes 2 hours to get there, and usually even longer to get home because public transport is a nightmare at the end of school day. I have a job offer with a place that I could walk to in 10 minutes, if that.

Keep in mind, this is based in the UK and I have just moved here in January from Australia, and I am unsure of the common customs, like if I even need to hand a notice in while still on probation, whether its a week or 2 weeks etc.

 Would it still be best to hand in my notice, even though me abruptly leaving wouldn't affect them at all and keeping in mind that they're being shady and unprofessional?

It just kinda sucks being left in the dark like this, since this is my first job in a country thousands of miles away from home. I just wanted (or expected) a little more transparency and help and I'm left feeling very self conscious and unwanted (not to play the victim, it just sucks mega hard).

It's just faceless resumes with no personality, the employer is naturally only going to pick the person with the highest level of qualifications and experience, and skim over the unremarkable looking ones, which 10 times out of 10, isn't going to be you. This doesn't account for the fact that I (or any applicant) could have a one of a kind personality and leave a lasting and positive impression on people, customers for example, I'm still constantly recognized in public by strangers for my work as a cashier 6 years ago in a town with hundreds of thousands of people.

I have never gotten a job through indeed and I've been applying for years, I decided long ago that all it's good for is seeing job openings, then forget using indeed to apply, find out where that place is and go there yourself, dressed nicely with a resume, otherwise the primary function of indeed, the online application part of it, is an absolute joke."
6,2023-04-24,I have a boss from hell.,u/Mom_of_boyz45,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12xwr9y/i_have_a_boss_from_hell/,jobs,"I work for this small office in a small town, so opportunities are few and far between.  I’ve been at my current job for 7 years.  When I started I was full-time, no benefits.  My boss is just an awful human!  If she’s having a bad day, or even if she isn’t, she screams at me (for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with me).  My job consists of paperwork, details and knowledge of real estate laws.  I am not a sales person.  One day my boss came into my office screaming at me and threatening that if I don’t find a way to make her more money I’m fired. I calmly replied that it’s not my job to do sales and if she wants more sales she needs to talk with her sales people, because it is their job. She screamed that she didn’t care and that I need to find a way to make her more money.  If I were to do sales without a license I would get fined heavily.  She has screamed for other reasons too, but mostly I tune her out anymore.  She changes her mind on company policies as often as she changes her clothes.  I can’t even keep up.  She has recently started getting mad that she’s paying me “too much”, which is ridiculous because she cut my full-time job down to part-time, then cut my hours again.  She insists that I started out at part-time, but I did not.  I was hired in at a full-time position.  I don’t even make enough anymore to pay for groceries.  I had to start door-dashing to make enough to feed my children.  I used to be very hard working, but I’ve lost all desire, because of her.  She gives me extreme anxiety because I never know what she’s going to do next.  She of course has her favorite employee, which is fine.  I’m good friends with her favorite.  I just don’t kiss-ass and I never will.  She’s always telling me that her favorite is just so perfect, while she tells me how awful I am.  Everyone else thinks I am invaluable to the company and I’m damn good at my job and if I ever left they’d be screwed.  I basically keep them from receiving fines or from being sued.   I’ve only missed one time in 7 years, which was something very minor.  According to everyone else no one has ever done my job as well as I have in nearly 25 years.  My boss’s excuse for cutting my hours is that she can’t afford it.  I call bull$£*% on that.  I see how much the company makes, as I take care of many of the financials as well.  Then today she again wanted to change policy on something.  We changed it in the first place to save the company unnecessary spending.  She changed it back again.  Then tells me its her money and she can spend it on whatever she feels, which is true, but what a slap in the face! She is constantly telling me she can’t even afford to keep me even at 25 hours a week, but she can and does constantly waste money on nonsense.  I’m not talking just hundreds, more like tens of thousands if not more.  Then she shoves all this nonsense company spending in my face.  My boss has sucked any happiness I had away.  I now hate my life, hate being here and can’t stand my job in the slightest. I’ve even started having extreme anxiety attacks.  I have never had anxiety issues and I grew up in an abusive home.  She’s slowly sucking the life out of me.  

I’ve been looking for another position, but it’s such a small town.  I’ve sent my resume to anyone who is hiring. I don’t even care what kind of position anymore. I’d do just about anything to get out of there!

Is there anything I could be doing in the meantime?   I’ll take any help I can get…I’m desperate."

3,2023-04-24,Quitting a job (on a temp contract) less than two months in…,u/PanCanAlt01,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12xyz7k/quitting_a_job_on_a_temp_contract_less_than_two/,jobs,"So, I guess I just want some “confirmation” and courage since this company hasn’t treated me super bad or anything. 

This manufacturing company I work for has an owner that frequently yells at the AP Specialist (I am the AR Specialist) and changes things around frequently (the job posting was revised numerous time and had a higher pay rate when I first applied). A week ago the HR Manager said they would want me to start supervising the veteran AP Specialist, which I’m not necessarily comfortable with because the reason they want me to “supervise” her is because they think she is doing a bunch of stuff wrong. I have been there long enough to know that the way their system is set up makes it easy for one mistake to cost the company thousands of dollars. That isn’t the AP Specialist’s fault and when I’ve discussed it with her before the owner refuses to change anything (according to the AP Specialist). 

Then, late last week the owner approached me and said they want the old AR Specialist (the person whose job I took) to supervise me and the AP Specialist when she comes in to do collections (she does collections on her day off from the job she left for). 

I was told when I started that the “reason” the pay is where it is is because they give production bonuses based on sales, apparently they haven’t given those bonuses to any employees for months because their budget is so tight. 

Also, our office is in an old converted building and people keep having respiratory issues (including the owner). Even though there is no construction going on, I often (including today) come home smelling and feeling like I have “dust” all over me. The owner wears a face covering often (including today) because of it. 

I guess I just feel weird because I haven’t been there even two months yet. I have gotten other job offers during this time but accepted one on Friday, but I am so nervous to tell the owner. The longest employee (the AP Specialist) says the owner flys off the handle. I kind of don’t want them to know my new employer but it would also be weird if I didn’t tell them because I’m sure she’ll ask until I tell her and try to keep me there. They tried to buy me out of my temp contract numerous times but the employment agency won’t let them until I hit a certain number of hours. So I am technically still on contract. I don’t want to just stop going but I am concerned if I stay two weeks they will be really awkward if I don’t tell them where I’m going. 

Can anyone commiserate and/or tell me leaving is the right decision? I don’t know why I feel so weird about it. I guess because they “trained” me (the AP Specialist that they hate did, and was completely wonderful about it) and told me (until it got switched up possibly) that they wanted me to be a manager."

I left due to a toxic work environment, but didn't fully think it through, as a few weeks before that, my wallet was stolen at a local IHOP.

I don't have a physical copy of my SS card, though I do know my numbers. My drivers license was issued in my home state, and a replacement will need to be from the new one I live in (ID).
From what I've gathered, the best place to start replacing documents is applying for my birth certificate out of state. That requires money, and a long wait, and as we all know, life will not wait for you.

Any advice for my situation? I have tax forms from this year, old pay stubs and mail with my name I was hoping to prove my identity, but all places I've applied want to see a physical copy of my SS.
How can I work to earn money until I can afford document replacements?

Is it appropriate to ask for a salary increase? Or should I ask for over time pay? (From what I know, he only likes banked overtime, which I am opposed to until I've caught up)

2,2023-04-24,Has anyone ever taken a pay cut for a less stressful job?,u/ticklishguy_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12y0s4k/has_anyone_ever_taken_a_pay_cut_for_a_less/,jobs,"I moved internally into a Senior Consultant position 3 months ago (on an accelerated pathway due to high performance in my previous roles), and I’m really struggling with the increase in workload, accountability, hours, scrutiny, etc. 

It also doesn’t help that one of my two new managers has a very erm, frazzled, personality type. Consequently, I frequently leave conversations with her feeling more stressed, confused, and flustered instead of supported and clear on tasks. She also frequently throws me under the bus to cover her ass and has a point-and-blame approach of solving problems instead of being solution-oriented. If you’re really bored, feel free to check out my post history regarding this job about some of the ridiculous things I’ve faced in this new role.

I’m also pretty young, and quite frankly, have been experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome in this role due to how politicky and toxic it can get. For example, I recently got in trouble for collaborating with an employee from another team because my manager has professional beef with the other manager of that team. However, this collaboration was 100% necessary for me to get a deliverable done on time. Now, I frequently overthink collaborating and setting up meetings with other colleagues because what if my manager has beef with them or their team, and I get in trouble again?

The job itself isn’t even that complex, but the unrealistic timelines and some of the people I work with make it 100x worse than it needs to be.

That said, have you guys ever taken a step back from a more “senior” position (along with a pay cut) to give yourself peace of mind? If so, did you regret it?

This position has me so stressed that I’m starting to feel physically ill, and am considering getting a doctors note to go on a medical stress leave for a while and take EI before my burnout hits a critical point."

I met him at a conference a few months ago and asked if there were any opportunities open, at the time there weren't but he kept me in mind apparently and offered me an interview!

Anyways, it's exactly my niche that I want to be doing and I'm working in a larger city. 70k plus 6 weeks minimum PTO and healthcare and retirement contributions.

4,2023-04-24,On the verge of getting fired,u/dedreanna,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12y2v03/on_the_verge_of_getting_fired/,jobs,"I’m 26 with a business degree and graduated December 2020, right when covid started so it was really hard to find a job. 
This was the first real corporate job I’ve had, even though it only pays $16 an hour and is entity level. I spent months and months applying to jobs; this was the only one to give me an interview and an offer so I took it right away. This job literally requires nothing but a high school education and basic understanding of a computer. 

I started this job at the end of February. It took about 2 weeks to train, Because the trainer was out for 2 weeks so me and a girl Amanda started on the same day. 2 weeks or so after we were working on our own, I got called into the office for my monthly report and it wasn’t too bad, just a few errors here and there. 

I’ve told my boss about my home situation. I lost my car, I don’t have a relationship with my family even though I live with them, none of us speak. My job is about 10 minutes from where I live (another reason I took the job, I can get a ride there and Uber if I have to, it’s $8 to get there). 

I got a write up today, about some work being inaccurate. I’ve told them from the beginning my computer has been having issues, all of my websites that I need I can’t log into, the data entry I put in is correct but my account deletes all of the entry and I’ve told them about this several times, dealt with IT for months, everything. 

So, while I was in my own office doing busy work, which consisted of opening these little holster monitors and some notes, separate them into different bins for an 8 hour shift. My options are to switch my position to that, doing that for 8 hours, or essentially get fired. 

TLDR: 26F, working an entry level job for $16 an hour with a college degree. About  to get fired over technical issues that are beyond my control , overlooked by bosses even through I have told them multiple times, sent emails to anyone that could possibly help, and as a result of the work not being entered (since it’s healthcare its pretty important  to get the data entered right. My current options are to take a position with the same pay, and to this forever. I can’t save for a car, to move out of my parents, or anything. 


I guess my main question is, how would I find another job when it took me about 8 months to get this interview and job after hundreds and hundreds of applications through indeed and linked in. Obviously I’m going to start looking for a new job that pays  $20 or more? I guess I’m going to take them up on this offer and start looking for more places.  Any idea where to start?"

0,2023-04-24,(24F) Want to leave my 6 figure paying tech job,u/sw33tp0tato3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12y5b7e/24f_want_to_leave_my_6_figure_paying_tech_job/,jobs,"

Disclaimer: Before delving into my situation, I want to make it clear that I am fully aware that I am in a very privileged position that many people would kill for, including myself just a few years ago. However, despite my financial stability, I am struggling with my current job and could use some advice or insight.

As a 24-year-old female, I currently make upwards of $150,000 USD between my base pay and stock options working for a big tech company, let's call it Tech A. I am a project manager in a field related to my undergraduate studies in engineering, but unfortunately, I cannot wrap my head around the technical aspects of my job. I have no interest in it whatsoever and feel unmotivated. I did graduate with an engineering degree, but I had zero interest in my undergraduate and ended up almost flunking out many times.

To give some context on how I even got to this job, my father used to work as a blue collared worker at a vendor, lets call it, Little Company, for Tech A. After I graduated from college, with a GPA of around 2.7, my dad asked HR at Little Company to interview me for a project management position, and I ended up getting the job. Interview process lasted 5 months and was 4 rounds of interviews with written essays. Little Company onboarded me as a project manager, and I started working closely with the team at Tech A for their projects that I was managing, travelling for installs and commissioning, etc. I was a hard worker, and after 1.5 years, Tech A recognized my work and asked me to join their team. Although the pay bump was significant, I had to move to a new country (Canada-&gt; US which is not a big deal) and transition to a new team and role, which was more niche but still project management. I started working remotely with the team at Tech A in November, and officially transferred to the team in February. So roughly 6 months of working with the team and I feel like I havent ramped into the job at all.

Since then, everything seems to be falling apart. I know my colleagues are impressed with my work, but the truth is that I'm not doing much. I'm supposed to be a project manager for a specific discipline that I know nothing about, and I'm constantly anxious and crying every day. I feel like I'm dead weight, and the engineers must think I'm an idiot. The higher-up managers seem impressed when I report up meaningless information, but deep down, I know that I'm not contributing much. I have been having so much anxiety and just stopped showing up to work (going into office is required). I straight up do not like the job or the lack of direction. My role is a project manager for shit I do not have a concept of or understanding of whatsoever. Ive retreated to trying to plan team socials, recruiting interns, filling any gaps with pushing other projects and vendors, and Im just all over the place and lack the technical know-how or caring to learn it. My manager is located in another state &amp; when I reached out with these concerns it didnt go anywhere. I straight up told him that everything I am doing does not relate to the team I am working with at all and I am just on my own tangent absolutely directionless. I feel like everything I do is just not tangible and does not yield any actual results.

I am considering asking my old company for my job back but thats just embarrassing. Plus, I was working on projects which I feel like didnt give me alot of transferable skills but idk , I may have just been overthinking that part.

Furthermore, I've been experiencing a quarter-life crisis lately, reflecting on how I even got to this position. Growing up, I was more interested in non-STEM subjects, but I pursued this degree because of the pressure to achieve financial stability and security due to my low-earning background. I somehow managed to get into a decent engineering school, graduate, and land a role at a respectable company, but I don't feel like I belong. I barely got into university by like 5% threshold, I barely graduated that university, somehow scratched my way into a small company and ended up at one of the most competitive companies to get a job in the world. Like I am not on the same level as the people around me at all.  


I've been applying to jobs in marketing, real estate, and travel agencies, as I want to leave engineering altogether, but I don't know what to do. I have a screening interview for a junior product analyst position coming up this week, but I'm not sure if this is the right move.

I have been applying to jobs and have actually gotten a few responses for pre screening but the truth is I won't be able to work in the US because if I leave my current job then I lose my current visa. Its hard to find a workplace to sponsor you unless you have highly technical specialized skills.

Who has switched from engineering to non-stem roles &amp; how did that go ?"

5,2023-04-24,I just started what I thought was my dream job and now it seems like a nightmare!,u/StudBoi69,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12y5inp/i_just_started_what_i_thought_was_my_dream_job/,jobs,"Long story short, I left my staff accountant job at a tech company because I wasn't getting the upward mobility I wanted after working there for 4 years. I left it to pursue an accounting manager role at a non-profit (one that has been in the city for about 50 years now). I thought I had hit the jackpot getting a role upgrade, a pay increase, and working at someplace where I could make a difference. The only doubt I had about the role was when they told me the accounting department was in a transition role, and pretty much everyone there was new but I didn't pay any mind since everyone was in the same footing.

Soon after that I started the job, I began to realize how much fucked up our department was. Accounts payables was a mess, with a lot of things severely past due. No one was maintaining the required schedules like prepaids and fixed assets. Two weeks after my start date, we fired our A/P specialist, and I became the sole person in charge of A/P. I worked 9-10 hours a day, even half of Saturday, just to get caught up on bills. Eventually, I got most of everything cleared up and now I had a temp-to-hire to be able to handle all the A/P work from here on out. Things were finally starting gel for me.

Then came the time for my boss to go on vacation starting the 18th until the 27th. My boss assured me that the CFO had everything she needed to take over her duties while she was out. I should've pressed more about that, but I took her word for it and let her be on her merry way. Then last Friday, when I was doing a check run with my direct report, I asked my CFO to approve payments in the bank site. My CFO was like ""I don't know how to do any of this"". Apparently when she was set up on the bank, she didn't get any of the admin privileges that she should've gotten and never got the training to approve payments, pull statements, etc. Neither did I, as it took 6 weeks for me to be finally added as an admin for the online banking site.

My CFO gently called out to my boss that were some gaps in our team that needed to be addressed and that we didn't get the training we needed to continue operations while she would be out on vacation, and that's the tone I got from the email. The CFO called me to assure that she wasn't trying to grill my boss, and that she thought we were all a great team and didn't want to lose anyone. Still, I guess my boss took it as a personal attack, because she seemingly lost it and called out my CFO in turn for not fulfilling her end of the bargain, and quit her job today. 

And now I'm just stunned. I don't know what to do. Should I stick around? Should I go? Should I try to ask for my previous job back?"

I have background doing surfacing and moldflow analysis, and am in school for CAD, and know a couple of different softwares. I was told they were looking for a surfacer or designer during the interview, but the softwares I knew were used at an alternate location, but they had one similar I would most likely use. Everything went well until today. The person I was communicating with in HR is on vacation for a week, and my boss is on vacation today and tomorrow. No one in the office really knew what I was supposed to be working on (besides a couple safety videos) and told me I was going to be doing mold design in a software that I have no experience in and they have no training videos for. Others in the office were using a software similar to what I have used to do surfacing work, and I was left alone in a corner desk to look at the software and figure out some of the hot keys. I ended up having to Google for YouTube tutorials and pdf practice because they gave me nothing to work on and don’t know what I should be doing. How do I discuss with my boss when he is back from vacation that I don’t feel like this is the right fit for me unless I receive some form of official training in the software, or that I would prefer to work on surfacing work? I’m also concerned as they left me in a dark corner with almost no guidance and no information on punching in or out! I’m one of their youngest employees and the only female in the entire design/engineering department and already feel as if they don’t know how to interact with me. 

I’m just looking for some guidance. I want to make this job work!"

3,2023-04-24,reference checks USA,u/LGBTQIA_Over50,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12y6cu2/reference_checks_usa/,jobs,"Place: Veterans Administration Hospital

I applied and interviewed for an Advance Medical Support position GS6 and they won't move my resume on because they can't reach my immediate supervisors at my former employers.

I am told to give out The Work Number. My former employers do not give out direct references from supervisors. I worked in banking. 

VA human resources recruiter was able to verify my job and dates of employment but because she can't speak directly over the phone with a former supervisor and ask three questions, they will not hire me. 

My prior employers give the Work Number for many reasons. To avoid lawsuits, to maintain equity, and because the supervisors where I worked aren't allowed and don't have time to give a job reference for every employee, and answer questions. If they did that for one person, they would have to do it for all employees who leave. 

I don't know if there is a written rule that states, ""job references for potential Veterans Hospital, non clinical employees must be given by a completed questionnaire from the applicant's former supervisor, or that former supervisor must speak with our Veterans HR staff to give a verbal reference.""

If it doesn't specifically state that then why isn't The Work Number which confirms my job title and dates of employment sufficient?

I have a Masters degree and multi-industry experience and my background exceeds the job requirements. I need a stable job. I have no spouse or anyone to support me. I can do this administrative job. 

But they will not hire me unless they speak to a former manager. 

Should I write to someone higher up at the VA or ask to speak with someone else?"

1. nobody takes breaks - everyone is operating as if it’s an ultra marathon or the 100m sprint (they proudly say this and at no point during the interview process was this brought up). i prefer to have a good WLB and felt that i was lied about this. 
2. i ask for support on how to extract data/how to accurately analyze it, i send calendar invites for 1:1s with stakeholders and they don’t show up. i wait 10-15 min then slack them if they’re going to join and i get no response or they respond hours to the next day later. i’ve been getting more and more responsibilities but at no point do i feel like i’ve actually learned or retained the info to succeed. 
3. recruiter told me i was able to work from home before i signed (2-3 days wfh) and that was a huge part of why i signed. when i brought this up with my manager i was told that right now in-office was more needed and diverted to asking me if i was planning on moving to their HQ metro city when that was never discussed with the recruiter or set that expectation.

My employer at a food service place demoted me from my host position that I have been at for nearly a year to a new position they just put in place called ""door"". Basically you sit and hold the door open for 2 hours PER WEEK. 

The mistake I made? A guest came in and said ""party of 4 including 2 kids"". I put them down as a total of 4. Called them up when the table was ready and apparently it waa 4 adults and 2 kids! I apologized and explained it would be a bit longer; she wanted to speak to my manager. 

The other mistake in the same day unfortunately: a lady came in with her kids and wanted to go to the bar but our policy is to ask the manager first. I called the manager over my walkie and told her he would be right there. Apparently he never came so she sat back down and never told me. My fault I guess. She asked when it was her turn and I just put her name on with a note saying ""seat first"". 

Well my manager pulled me to the side and told me off then asked me to walk away because he was ""going to yell at me"". At the end of my shift he completely insulted me. Told me if this other girl was in my place the whole day would have been perfect, that I have no focus, that they always need to hold my hand, and that they were demoting me! 

And guess what? The next day, the girl he said would have done everything perfect made the SAME mistake (put 4 instead of 6) AS ME! Did she get demoted? Did she get told off? Nope. 

I rarely make mistakes here by the way. I am the perfect employee. I clean things nobody wants to clean, I help all the servers clean their tables when I am free, etc.. 

I talked to other coworkers. They said they have done worse and never even had a word said to them.

1,2023-04-25,Asking for a Summer Pay Raise,u/LadyLonely47,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12yfwbj/asking_for_a_summer_pay_raise/,jobs,"So, I work at a before and after school program as the site supervisor for one of the two sites. Technically, my job titles states I am supposed to be in charges of both sites but whatever. 

I started this job September 2022 right as the school year started. It was a bumpy and often frustrating start. But I've gotten the hang of a lot of things and am doing a lot more interesting and new things at the site. I really enjoy my job despite its faults, and hanging out with the kids is usually the best part of the day (I swear some of the things these kids say is so out of pocket). 

Anyway, onto the topic at hand. There is a summer program that I will personally be the site supervisor for for the older kids (I'm talking 3rd through 6th grade). Summer programming is much different from school programming for multiple reasons, one of them being more intense planning on mine and staffs' part. We have to plan every week of the program in advance with various activities, field trips, etc. Its honestly a lot. 

So, with the summer program, I guess there's a pay bump for my part-time workers. One of them was talking the other day and mentioned how he would be getting $15/hour, as opposed to $13. I thought that was pretty rad, especially since they will all be working at minimum 32 hours a week during the summer. However, I will still be at my contracted 40 and making the same (just above $18). I've asked my second in command if she will be making more, but she said she isn't certain yet and will let me know when she knows her pay. 

I want to talk to my supervisor about this and ask for a temporary pay bump for summer, similar to how the others are getting it as well. It would financially help me out a lot, and I have previously asked for more hours in the past with a rejection. 

Do you guys think this is reasonable? How should I go about this?"

The pay is decent (60k) but the work is grouling. 50-60 hours a week. I'll be honest it is fun and I find it quite enjoyable. I recently moved out of the rural area I grew up in and am looking to get out of the blue collar trades and maybe into an office setting. I still want to stay in tech, I don't mind something with similar pay I really just want to get out of the consistent long hours. 

I have been considering cybersecurity perhaps. I have talked to several people and they suggest pursuing some certificate programs, others suggest I start looking into going back to college and pursuing a bachelor's in computer technology. The bachelor's will be difficult since I will have to take classes in the evenings after my 10-12 hour shifts and it could take me the better part of a decade based off the difficulty I've seen in the classes.
What are my options here?"

I don’t know what made me say what I did if I knew it wasn’t true. I’m very good at what I do now and I know the rules and policies and I basically told the managers in this different department that a rule was something else in my job when I know it’s not. I realized after that they work with those same rules and definitely know that I either 1. Lied and/or 2. Don’t do my job well because I should know that rule.

I was really nervous and the questions they asked, I wasn’t prepared for. I was so prepared for other questions.

How can I never let that happen again? I guess, how can I not be so nervous? I don’t know what I’d think if I interviewed someone and they said what I did. They’ve gotta know people are nervous, right?

My job, it's been getting more and more work with less support and riases that don't match inflation. 

In this job I get amazing benefits, but bad salary, with no bonuses and 1% raises.
Latest ríase to be 3%, and all riases that go accross the university must be approved by the board of regents. 

Individual Raises based on merit/performance virtually don't exist, as HR will fight you and your supervisor tooth and nail to get you nothing. 

Recently in my role I was ""promoted"" to director of the program I operate. With no raise. 

Note asking for a raise is complicated and I always get the same answer, that it's up to HR. But my supervisor has done everything from reclassification, to nomination for awards (with some one off payments), to fighting for performance based riases (1 easily percent at a time). She fights for me so she doesn't lose me, but it feels like I am still getting exploited. Especially after this so called promotion in title only. 

The longer I sit with this, the more cynical, upset and frustrated I get. I went to her to ask for possibly more flexibility to work from home as a compromise, with a answer that my job is front facing so no, can't get it in writing. Been starting to care less and less about the job too... And putting more efforts in job searching. But I'm finding it hard to identify a title with the type of skillsets are a good fit, since I am a jack of all trades with mainly experience in the university working in all industries (I work at the research park so I deal with every industry you cna think of). 

My thoughts are to schedule a meeting with a number in mind. One that is industry standard for project directors/managment, and show how I'm actually making less than I did when I first started due to the low raise percentages when you look at purchasing power/inflation. 

Any advice on how to deal with this delicate situation? 

TLDR - HR runs and approves everything, boss is amazing and has fought for a good number of raises, but the Raises have always been so low that I make less money now than when I first started (with inflation) back in 2015."

They invited me to participate in a video interview, in which you film yourself responding to questions, and then, within an hour of submitting, they offered me a real interview, so I assume they remember me from the last time.

I (24F) graduated in May of 2022 with a B.A. in Healthcare Administration and Business. 

I currently work full-time as a support coordinator within the human services field. I work 37.5 hours per week at $19 an hour and have been with the company for two months. 

I also currently work part-time at a big box retail store with availability that starts at 6pm Monday through Friday and open availability on Saturday and Sunday. The big-box retail store cannot guarantee any number of hours for part-time employees, and during off-season, part-time employees can have zero hours per week. However, we are currently in peak season where I have been making $300+ per biweekly paycheck. I make $14 an hour at this job, and I have been with the company for almost two years. I have been waiting two months for them to honor my previous pay rate of $15 per hour, and, despite HR's involvement, I have yet to see my pay increase. 

I interviewed this morning at a local clubhouse (bar, kitchen, game nights, pool table, etc) to work within the kitchen. This would be guaranteed 12 hours every other weekend with the potential to pick up shifts on the other weekend. The pay would be $10 an hour plus tips that would be split with the other person working the weekend kitchen hours. 

I am still applying and interviewing for other part-time jobs. The clubhouse is the first offer that I have received, and I am looking to maximize the amount of money that I am making on a weekly basis. 

Would the above workload be an advisable way to go about doing that?

Any feedback, thoughts, and/or advice is much appreciated!"

Hi y’all! 
I (27F) accepted a fantastic new job, that would offer a ton of new opportunities for me (let alone the pay raise). The thing is, there is a fair amount of travel involved over the next year and a half. For example in May June and July I’ll be gone around 30 days 
My husband (28M) is incredibly supportive, and told me to take the job that pays more than my other offer. But he also admitted to me that he is a tiny bit jealous, sad that I will be gone, nervous that we will grow apart since I will be traveling so much. His parents split when he was a kid, and one of the factors was his dads business travel that was so intensive when he was younger. Rightfully so, he is a little nervous. It’s just the two of us right now so we are wanting to do the career moves now, so when we do have kids we will be a bit more settled. 
For those of y’all that have a spouse/ is the spouse that travels, how do you stay close with your spouse while you are gone? I’m not (too)concerned since he married an overly independent only child, but he’s always had someone around. He really is my favorite person, and I am a very lucky girl to be married to him."

1,2023-04-25,Was Just Laid off for ... odd reasons,u/jetiau,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12yo956/was_just_laid_off_for_odd_reasons/,jobs,"Now, I will preface this by stating that every manager I have worked with could tell you that even though I have a problem or two here and there ... my customer service has never ever been one of them. In fact, I am more mean to myself than I am with customers and/or coworkers ever.  
Today I went into work. Thought things were going great. Until my boss, who didn't even approached me waited until I clocked in and head to the back to wash my hands, bombarded me with accusations from ""three different sources"" that I was rude to people. At first, I wanted to ask what happened, where did I go wrong, and how could I solve the issue and work towards better treatment if maybe I was missing something. Instead of getting that, he told me that I could travel (knowing I take a bus) to another location to work as a dishwasher or just leave. Because I could never be a barista at that café again.   


I just politely handed him my uniform, shook his hand, and left without a word.  


Friends and family I have spoken to said this was ultimately due to the color of my skin. I have never been rude to anyone. Never given friends who visited the establishment freebies and special treatment, always kept things clean. I don't want to fly that flag yet, so I am here to ask what should I do? How should I think? Why did this happen? The most I could say is that I did go to the ER for legitimate reasons and got a doctor's note explaining that I needed to rest. I was only out for two work days. Not a week. I am just hurt and now I don't even want to add the place on my resume. I just want to do away with this. Probably work from home.  


TLDR: Boss never written me up or discussed things. Just gave me an ultimatum to either take a demotion or hit the road."

How Does It Work?,u/ButterBiscuitBravo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12yo9ac/do_recruiterscompanies_consider_final_round/,jobs,"I know that the pattern for most jobs is that the first few rounds of interviews are done virtually and the final round is done in-person.

But what if you have a pool of candidates and 1 or some of them are in another country (but they still have work authorization, so don't need sponsorship)? How do you deal with cases like this?

Are companies ok with remote final round interviews? Or will they just prefer the candidates who are present locally? 

Is a candidate at a disadvantage if they are not physically present locally? I'm just wondering how much importance companies give to the factor that the final interview has to be done in-person. 

Also I wouldn't want to take a 8 hour flight for an in-person interview not even knowing if I'll get the job or not."

From application to interview completion it was a period of two weeks. It seems like they have interest as other Glassdoor reviews said theirs took more like two months. 

At the end, I reiterated that I'll be traveling internationally for two weeks with spotty internet and asked if I would hear back before I go. The recruiter said that they would get back to me by Monday with either an offer or ""we've decided to go with another candidate"" type deal. Here we are on Tuesday and I've heard nothing. Normally I wouldn't worry but I don't want them to send me an offer while I'm away. 

Is it too soon to ask if they've made a decision? The recruiter is really forgetful so I can't tell if it's just him or if they're undecided. 

Overall I feel neutral. I'll be fine if they say they're not interested. All I want is a yes or no before I leave so I don't have to think about it."

I'm fairly junior in work experience and so far the external recruiter who hired me at the company where I work now, has said to me that my supervisors are content of my work.

Unfortunately since I started working there in the beginning of January, I have had to take sick leave each month for a couple of days due to having had: a bad cold, covid, 'stomach' influenza and a handful of unpaid days.

In my country (in Europe) the employer pays your full wage up till the first 30 days that you are legitimately ill when you can provide a sick note for instance from the general practioner. Of course the fact that your employer pays your full wage when you are legitimately ill, it makes it being looked down onto when being ill.

I personally I'm a bit afraid to get fired, not because of doing bad work, but due to these regular ill days and the fact I'm a smoker at work.

We have a whatsapp group of our employees, and in the beginning they would say 'get better and so forth' but lately they are becoming quiet when I tell them I'm ill.

How should I approach this to my co-workers and supervisors, and are my fears legit?"

They’re giving me a laptop so I can basically go anywhere as long as I’m connected.

It’s more of an issue because I don’t live alone, but I do live in a big city with lots of cafes/libraries etc so I’m wondering if that’s a bad idea."

They place lots of contractors at the company but it's in tech so there has been a slow down. I've had positive feedback from most stakeholders I work with a peers but there is something about my actual manager I don't trust. She hasn't been entirely as supportive with one challenging toxic person I've had to work with in the past but I put that behind me (the toxic person is known for being toxic and difficult so that wasn't new but I felt her behavior change after that)

Anyway she ended my contract supposedly due to ""reallocation of budgets"" and it has been a little slow in that she hasn't assigned me any new projects (don't know if there aren't any or she wants someone new) but my concern is the agency would send her a survey or questionnaire for a reference and she would provide negative or neutral feedback because it's in her interest to not have me work at the company again just in case I ever relay my experience with her. Yes it sounds paranoid but I've seen it happen with contractors before.

Last week when I told the recruiter at my agency she emailed me that she was ""confident that we can place you again with (the company I was at) because they should have new openings next quarter or with one of our other enterprise clients. I'll call you Monday to discuss.""

That was last Thursday. She called today and was nice, apologized for not calling sooner. Said she was disappointed the contract ended but ""you have our support. we want to place you with another position. you had good references"" etc. BUT there were little things she said that have me concerned such as ""I'm going to try to place you and also stay in contact if you haven't heard from me"" and ""I'm going to send your profile to our other recruiters to see if they can place you with one of their enterprise clients"" and even worse she gave me advice on how to change the settings on my linkedin profile so people know I'm looking for work because it helps people find candidates. Why would she advise me to do that if she is confident she can place me in another assignment? She also said she would email me the JD for another role at the same company but that was over a hour ago and she hasn't done it yet. Not a big deal but weird because at the end of our call I confirmed she would send it to me.

Am I being paranoid and crazy? Sorry for the long post. Also posted on recruiting sub."

1,2023-04-25,Should I tell my mentor that I’m probably getting fired?,u/SASSYSP1CE,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12yqv50/should_i_tell_my_mentor_that_im_probably_getting/,jobs,"Essentially I’ve been struggling with my job for months. 

I’m pretty sure it’s been a mix of disliking the work I do (PR), feeling overwhelmed and burnt out constantly, and not really feeling welcomed or comforted in the workplace (I feel like people just act awkward or like they’re walking on egg shells around me, which is strange because I feel like I’ve been fairly open, welcoming, and understanding towards them??). 

Anyways, my manager, who often corrects and points out the issues that I’ve consistently had in the workplace, was my also mentor for a solid 6 months. This is my first job out of college and I started at an entry level position, so initially the idea made sense. I was a bit slow to realize that this was actually a horrible idea as I could never really be honest about my experience at my job, how I felt she was doing as a manager or my opinions on the on-boarding process. She’s also very type-A (understandably for this line of work) and micromanaged essentially every item I worked on to the point where I had no confidence in what I do at my firm. Because of this self-consciousness, I felt like I was unable to progress or allow myself to take on bigger tasks out of fear of messing up or not meeting standards, all the while the work I was doing was apparently already not meeting expectations. 

I feel bad about causing other people trouble and having my colleagues do extra work because of my shortcomings, at the same time though I wish I was able to honestly talk to someone at my firm who wasn’t my manager about my comfort level and who I could turn to for genuine advice. 

That being said I finally got a new mentor around a month and a half ago who’s been very nice and understanding when it comes to some of struggles I’ve faced. She actually seemed to kind of care about what I thought about my progress, didn’t seem judgmental, and offered good advice to me. She wasn’t quick to call out all of my errors or problems with no solutions in mind like my former mentor. Jumping right into an in-person full time job directly out of college post COVID was definitely an adjustment for me and she’s told me she understands the struggle. Around 2 weeks later I was pulled in by the president, CEO, my manager’s manager, and my personal manager/former mentor, and we discussed how I wasn’t a good fit for the company. They gave me a 30 day “probation period” where I was supposedly given an opportunity to “prove myself”. I’m in the final week and I’m about 99% sure I’m being fired. I haven’t told others at the company and I haven’t told my mentor either. 

I’m not sure if I’m even allowed to tell her, or if she already knows. I don’t want things to come as a complete surprise one day when I’m all of a sudden off the team. If anything I feel like it’d be good to discuss next steps or lessons learned from my experience. I’m still kind of weary based on my experiences with my former mentor though, who seemed to use the issues I initially vented to her about against me when it came to evaluation meetings. It doesn’t help that I’m a pretty open book I guess..."

I'm not really worried about my qualifications, and I've been told by university career services I have a great resume (I do tailor my resume/cover letter for each role.) I'm graduating in the top 10% of my class, and I've had 2 internships plus a role as an editor at our university's newspaper and another leadership role in a student org. I've also done my fair share of networking. 

So far, I've only had the time to apply to 25 or so jobs I'm qualified for (plus 75 or so LinkedIn Easy Applies where I just lob my resume at companies.) I've gotten ghosted by most of them and six of them have rejected me.  

Do any of you think it's realistic to have an entry-level job lined up within 2 weeks? If so, what should I be doing differently? If not, what do you recommend?"

2,2023-04-25,"some questions: searching and interviewing after a long period unemployed, salary/compensation, looking for the first real job (details in post)",u/MissionSalamander5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12yrywk/some_questions_searching_and_interviewing_after_a/,jobs,"Hello everyone:

I have done some searching here and there particularly on Reddit, so I wanted to get some peace of mind for myself. Thanks in advance for reading and answering.

My background and first question: I earned a degree in history from a small Catholic liberal arts college. By senior year, and I don't **regret** this at all, I decided to enter a program of priestly formation. Obviously, I left (since I'm posting here!) and earned a master's degree in French, knowing that I was interested in teaching or some sort of corporate job that required French — and that's my ultimate dream position. My French is excellent, at C1 level as certified by the French Ministry of National Education.

Then I worked in France for two years (see below, number 2) and am trying to get on my feet. I'm in my latter 20s.

With a history degree, I don't know what I could do, mostly what I probably can't do (plus, I'm fairly shy and don't like traveling constantly): so marketing and sales are not good fits for me, but working with people internally, that's fine. I don't mind customer-facing jobs that are temporary (I have strongly considered hospitality, but front desk, auditor, or GM positions wouldn't be something that I could handle semi-permanently). And I work **hard**: I've only gotten excellent reviews, and while I realize that I'm not special, I don't have a long résumé and work history…

but I almost don't care what I do: logistics, hospitality, finance, even tech… how do I look for jobs if I'm open to different jobs in different fields? I know **where** to look, but not really **how,** a result of having spent senior year not focused on that like my peers were; I also know that I'm not going to be super-hot interviewing (I'm too forward).

2) I have not worked for approaching two years. After coming home from a temporary post (to be more specific — I did TAPIF, the Teaching Assistant Program in France) the what should have been, and likely still will be, that is often good way to get a foot in the door, particularly for jobs that require using French regularly (ish, it's harder to find these positions in North America) and with the possibility of gong back to France or even Belgium, Luxembourg…

I got discouraged searching for something temporary, and some other things happened in my personal life along with some relatively minor health issues that together really knocked me out. I kept busy as much as I could, and I did learn some new skills, such that I can honestly say ""I'm detail-oriented, motivated to finding the right solutions to produce high-quality work"".

I'm not 100% back, but back enough; is saying that ""I had some health issues that required my attention, but nothing will impede me from working"" an appropriate answer? I don't want to be needlessly open or coy. Or should I say something ""it's just taken a while to find appropriate positions and to move along with interviews""?

3) I already had one application for a major-ish national bank in the US where the salary band expectation was requested (and it was an obligatory answer). Glassdoor gave an estimate. I went one band above, because, well, I don't want to be low-balled with a minimum of $4000 debt plus interest (if not $10000 more if the administration doesn't forgive any in the end). Is it really just a roll of the dice with this? (The estimated band was 57k to 74k; I'd rather be at the upper end of that, of course.)

As an optional follow-up, the application asked about total compensation. I'm clueless. I live in a state with no income tax, so if I was hired (the position is remote, although there are two other jobs in states with income tax, one of which I'd take if offered although I don't really want to move, and I'd consider the other) so I personally am happy maxing salary; I do need to get a move-on with something that can go towards retirement and other investments, even small (there are some mutual funds that need to be transferred to me and perhaps other assets). Any advice here is welcome.

&#x200B;

Thanks again for reading and for your counsel."

I hate my job. I don’t like the ambiguity of it and the environment is horrible. The communication is horrible, my co workers always promise to help me and then ignore me, I can barely communicate with my manager because he is always “too busy”. I always feel like I am behind and being assigned tasks that I was never trained to handle. 

I have been looking for a new job for months (as many people have mentioned on this sub as well) and I can’t find anything. 

I have been applying for positions that pay below what I’m making now and for positions that have “preferred” requirements. I have been actively looking for administrative assistant jobs (I am very good at tedious, repetitive work, I do actually enjoy it) and even for ones that don’t require experience don’t want me. 

There are several other jobs that don’t require experience that also don’t want me. I’m willing to try any industry and there is just no interest

I am stuck. I don’t want to be in my field anymore, but it seems like the only jobs I am qualified for is the job I am already working now at similar companies. I lucked out with this job because I networked my way into it…. I say that because I don’t have any college education and I can’t afford it right now either. I feel like I have no transferable skills. 

Do I have to go to school? I am weary because even people with degrees can’t seem to get jobs but at the same time I have no experience in anything else. Any advice?"

I did not want this information to be disclosed as it was of a private nature. I am concerned about the legality of this situation, especially as there appears to be a pattern of my boss sharing employees' medical information without their consent."

I’ve had no issues, and my manager seems happy with my performance so far, I am even being awarded a bonus this month!

I signed all of my documents, provided reference details, and was given an offer (unconditional) and accepted in Feb, no issues there as far as I know. 

I happen to know one of my referees quite well, who recently informed me that she was just today contacted about a reference for me. 

This isn’t common practice, as far as I know, and I’m wondering how worried I should be about this? I’ve got no concerns about a bad reference, just about why my job are asking for one this far into my employment.

Recently I’ve been told by my manager that I haven’t been meeting their expectations and my manager and boss want to workshop it by implementing a strike system. 

It’s a little hard to explain to people who don’t edit photos themselves but I get strikes for unclean cut outs or missed spots in the photos since they want me to be better with my attention to detail. I also get strikes when I don’t meet deadlines but they want me to complete photo sets/edits usually with a day to complete them. 

I really am trying so hard to meet these expectations and I have been for the whole time I’ve been employed here but I am feeling extremely overworked and burnt out and have had a multitude of breakdowns during the workday. I never even feel like I can take a lunch break or take my eyes off my monitor since it feels like I won’t be able to finish what they want me to finish. I’ve tried hinting that I’m really struggling and basically have implied that I would like them to ease on the deadlines and restrictions they set for me but they respond with suggesting to workshop things by adding a ton of check in times to send progress on my work and more touch bases which basically ends up with me feeling extremely surveilled and micro-managed. 

I’m already looking for new positions because I can’t handle this anymore but I also feel like I’m going crazy because it seems like they just expect that I should be able to do these tasks to their liking with no problem? They’re always saying they would like to see more progress and if I’m struggling then to reach out for help. I appreciate that openness but it feels like my actual concerns and wellbeing are being ignored since a lot of times I’m not really struggling with anything, I’m just working and it’s taking longer than they’d like. None of the deadlines they set are really any hard deadlines and the timelines are just set according to their wishes. I would also like to add that I am the first of my position in the history of the company and my manager is pretty inexperienced as a supervisor as well as my boss but I’m wondering if their demands are actually unrealistic or if I’m being whiny and maybe just unsuited for this role?"

I am going to have this talk with my boss when they return from their vacation. (I’ll get back pay for the time accrued post 30 days) and am completely unsure how much to ask for. 

For reference I am in digital marketing and design, and the person who held my position before me was making about 115k/year after about 1.5 years in the position. I started at 24/hr and that it a substantial amount less.

Is it crazy to ask for 80-90k/yr? I’ve been told many times the work I do is great and they are very thankful for how helpful I’ve been.

He said to be pushier but when I asked what more I could be doing, he didn't have any suggestions. He acknowledged that its tough, given where I am on the totem pole.

It is normal to have someone else's work included in your review like this? It's never happened to me before. I don't know how to take it or how to talk about it with my manager.

Also I want to do better being pushy, as he asked,  but I cant figure out how. Any suggestions? Do I go to others to ask for help? Maybe HR or  my manager's manager? Any advice on how to get folks to complete things when you have no carrots or sticks for them and aren't their manager?"

after working there for about a year and getting tired of everything, i began searching for a new job. my boss became aware of this. and for reference, just about everyone there that is a server works there as a side job, even the other teenagers, because it has none of the benefits of a regular job, it just pays. he became defensive about this and apparently told other higher up employees because they started asking me questions about it. 

just recently i got hired at a movie theater right up the street from me. the hourly pay is better, the schedule is normal, and the manager is pretty much the complete opposite of my previous boss.

my training day was scheduled on a day that i was also supposed to work catering. this is the first time i’ve been asked to work catering all year. i texted my boss and let him know that i’m not able to work that day anymore, not giving any specific details because normally when i say i can’t work, he’s pretty chill with it. but after i told him, he asked me how come.

i'm not sure if i should tell him. despite hating him, the job does pay relatively well, normally at least $100 for one night including tips. i don't want to give it up completely because i feel like the extra cash could be useful for college. but if i tell him i can't work because i have another job, i know he'll stop asking me to work for good. so do i owe him an explanation as to why i can't work?"

Company A: 2 years (entry level)

Company B: 1.5 years (entry level)

Company C: 2.5 years (mid level)

Company A: a few months (leader)

I left Company A for higher pay at B. Company B was toxic as fuck (like newsworthy toxic). No regrets leaving B. Company C was awesome and i loved it. All through these job changes, I maintained  good relations with Company A over the years, and when my old boss’s job opened up, they asked me to apply. I hesitated a lot because i was really happy at Company C and planned to be there 10+ years, but Company A convinced me. 

I’ve been there for only a few months and my new boss just resigned! The major tipping point that convinced me to leave the job i liked at Company C was that i had worked with my current boss when I was at Company A previously, and I loved his leadership. I explicitly asked him privately during the interview process if he planned to stick around at least a few years while I got my feet under me in a new leadership role, and he said he did. 

He was almost certainly lying now that he’s leaving a few months later. I feel hoodwinked and defeated, very much regret leaving Company C. Even before my now boss announced his resignation last week, i was struggling to manage feelings of regret. My long term goal is definitely to return to a place like C. They are related but different industries and i 100% prefer C over A. I also am quickly learning that I do not like being in leadership - I much prefer the role I had at Company C which was much more independent work. I also feel bitter because i think Company A somewhat misrepresented the benefit package. Yes, I’d worked here previously but it had been 4 years, so I didn’t really remember. I left Company C on good terms, but they’ve hired my replacement who i helped train in etc. 

How many years do I have to put into my new role at Company A before I can leave without it looking bad? I am kind of freaking out because it’s likely to be a 6-12 month process to replace my boss, and i am going to have to pick up the slack in that time frame after only being here a few months. 

Advice appreciated.

Edit: took out some details to keep this anonymous, i still think readers can get the gist"

They are not really flexible right now, it a really estructured, there are around 50 new employees, I can not take days off yet as I haven't been assign to an office (which can be a good or a terrible place), I basically don't have a direct boss to talk to either, and I don't know if I can change my hours in the future, but (probably) not this week.

As I am usually unlucky, today I had a new job offer, from an employer I wished to work for a while and have work to do specific tasks in the past, this offer is also related to my studies. I immediately told them my situation, as I was trying to be as transparent as possible, so they haven't communicated a salary (but I expect something low as it is part-time in the evening, as a student, 10 hs a week). The problem is the other job's training is not letting me meet the other company rrhh this week (which is when they need me), neither can I confirm my available hours until next week.

I will probably (hopefully) be able to make it work, as the ""main job"" is likely to have normal office hours. They already know about my new job at this second place (and clearly didn't like this), but I honestly don't know how to formally communicate the organizational issue... so I can still make a good impression and they don't choose another person instead, all for one week. I am aware this offer has to do with the posibility of a better offer in the future and they are trying to test me, as I am aware of the lack of opportunities in my field, but it probably won't happen until next year... and it certainly won't happen if I don't accept this. Both need me to start the same day I believe.

What to say? Should I directly reject it? The truth is, I have been having a panic attack about it for hours, as I can not believe how unlucky I am."

I accepted this position with the intention of having some income while i continued applying for other jobs in line with my career (which i gave up a few months into it due to no success) since at the time I was not in the best place financially or mentally.

As the time went i landed on a project a few months ago which is very time and mentally demanding and has been getting into my nerves a lot to the point of that i been getting anxiety attacks due to the amount of responsibility the job requires; this added to my desire(and guilt in a way of not using my degree) to once again try to find a job where i can use it has left me questioning if i should quit and focus on what i really want.


The job that i have doesn't pay that bad plus i work from home so i am able to save a great deal of my income, and honestly any entry level job that i might find for my degree will pay me at most half of what I am currently earning. 

If i chose to quit as per the contract there is required a 3 month notice or if i decide to leave immediately i need to pay the 3 months in cash to the company.
So I'm just left wondering how would this work if i decide to apply for other positions, should I take the risk to present my notice and pray that i land a job in the next three months or accept the fact that i might need to pay the three months to the company once i have accepted an offer?"

I quickly picked up another job just so I can pay bills but it doesn’t pay nearly as much as my last job so I have been searching still. For context, I work in Operations Management in Healthcare with all my experience really being in the Medical Scribe Industry. 

One job that I interviewed was exactly like my last role; word for word matched the job description. The person that interviewed me called me because she said she loved me, had great experience, and interviewed well, but I didn’t have a specific certification that they wanted (even though in the job posting they said having that certification was preferred but not required). She said that if she could hire two people, she would hire me but they went with another candidate. Essentially had no feedback and said I interviewed really well and was otherwise an amazing candidate. However, months later they are still advertising for that job and haven’t filled the position. 

I interviewed for another position as an Operations Manager and was in the final interview stages but was told that there was a change in plans and they were going with an internal candidate that might relocate to where they need them, but if they backed out they would follow up with me. Never heard back and they just posted the same job on LinkedIn. Again, they said they loved me and said I was a great candidate and didn’t have feedback about my interview or resume because they said I did  amazing. 

I have applied to over 100 jobs in the last 4 months at this point and either don’t get an interview for lacking skills and experience in that specific field, I interview but something comes up and I don’t get hired, or I interview and get offers for entry level or low level positions that don’t align with my pay expectations. 

I just keep thinking I’m doing something wrong and I can’t figure out what because I never get real feedback. I feel so incredibly disheartened and discouraged, and feel at such a low point in my life because I can’t find a job where I made at least even close to what I made before. I have been taking up so many side hustles like cat sitting and listing my third bedroom on Airbnb and I just want a stable income with a job I like. I miss my old job."
4,2023-04-26,"l got the job!

Now to unapologetically brag, I had my sights set on one position and I got it! I'm so excited and proud of myself, this job is more than I thought I could get! They show they care about their employees, and their programs are well thought out and effective. Ugh I'm so happy! So thank you past me, present me is celebrating tonite!

Now for the part I'm both excited and terrified of. It's important to me to vouch for our programs and employees, because no one else will. I want this place to succeed, and since I'm the longest standing employee I think I should be honest.

Here are some of the issues;

-My boss negatively affects programs, and doesn't let people disagree. Once people stop being yes men, it's taken personally and their expert advice is ignored. Changes are made on a whim and are often a massive waste of time,  resources, and hurt the clients we serve. 

-My boss undervalues staff by not offering adequate wages, no yearly raises, no benefits, no direct deposit, and won't include staff with low income (all our staff are low income) in our low income programs.

-Also undervalues volunteers by hiring staff who won't work with or train the volunteers the organisation relies on. My boss snaps at them when things aren't perfect. I've had countless volunteers leave telling me they can't deal. There are no real benefits (when there could be) besides listing it on their resume. 

-The biggest one, my boss sets people up to fail. Staff are given unclear direction, and very little training. Roles and methods are constantly changed making it impossible to keep up with. They are piled on till they break then blamed for it. Management problems are always put back on staff, so our retention is obviously terrible. 

My boss is great at giving opportunities, I've taught myself a great deal in these positions, and have this job to thank for getting my new one. Those are the good things, but there are many negatives that hold this place back, and they all stem from the top, which is just one person. 

So how much should I share?"

""What if there is a crisis at work"", ""What if a client wants an urgent response"". I admit that being in sales my success is tied to how often I check emails after work but this sadly is not good for my mental health. Any tips would be appreciated."

So earlier this week,  I had a meeting with HR and they basically said I haven't been performing well enough for them, and that I either have an option to go on a formal review process or accept settlement payment for a couple months of pay. They are pushing me to take the latter option, and I don't know what to do. I'm in shock in all honesty as I didn't see this coming. 

There has been an informal process discussing my performance, but this was in relation to me getting a promotion, or so I thought. It looks like they're just using this to get rid of me? I'm honestly confused as to how it went from discussing whether or not I get a promotion a couple months ago, to me leaving the company.

Any advice?"

About a year ago I was fired. There was no performance decrease, I was just a loner that didn't fit in. They treated me like shit. Before that, I thought I had an OK life trajectory. I'd stay at my entry level corporate job and work my way up. I'm lucky enough to be able to provide for my family and allow my wife to stay home full time off a relatively meager salary, but climbing the ladder would let us build an even better life. 

When I was fired, I put out a bunch of job applications and through some miracle I found a comparable job in just 1 month.

Does the company give indeed permission to apply through indeed in addition to their own application method?

And I ask because many of my applications via the ""apply now"" feature go unchecked for some of the larger companies Ive applied to. There's also no feedback data available - like, employer actively checked applications 2 days ago, etc. And then I see the job reposted several days later.

In/out and done in 39 mins, and 30 mins of that was a test. The interviewer only asked me one question ""what am I looking for?"" and then brought up the test and asked if we should start. After the 30 mins he came back in, didn't even sit down and there was no opportunity for me to ask questions about the job or company. I managed to ask when I'd hear back (a week) and how many candidates are they interviewing (answer 10), no discussion on my notice period or salary or mention of any second interview. I get my history and job experience is on my cv, but in my experience there's usually more questions and a chance for the candidate to ask about the role. It felt more like a box ticking exercise.



I'm not hopeful, is this normal? It's a bookkeeper position at an accounting firm (hence the technical test) but nothing C level suite or high up. Not sure how I feel.


*~edit should add based on my cv showing past experience in the role, and with strong skillset in what they are after I pretty much figured I was almost guaranteed an interview.

If this is not the right area to ask this question, can you please suggest where to go?  I am currently working in a school and was offered a job at a nonprofit outpatient clinic. I thought I was ready for change, now that I have an offer I am unsure of my decision. 

At my school job, I make approximately 60k, I am 8 years into my pension (I think for IL, you have to be vested 10 years). I am offered health insurance, vision, dental, &  life insurance. I have approximately 8 weeks off during the year.

The outpatient clinic offered me a salary of 71k. I would work 40 hrs/ week. They only offer health insurance (stipend to gov healthcare) OR a Traditional IRA with 3% match (I assume it's a simple IRA since they are contributing to the account). If I took the outpatient job I would go into my husband's insurance. I would have approximately 3wks of PTO, and about 12-15 paid holidays 

The drive is about the same to both jobs. Staff is nice at both jobs. I am pretty happy at my current job (7/8 out of 10, if we put it on a scale). I think I would be happy at the new job too. 

I currently contribute into a ROTH IRA, and a 403b from a PRN job.... Not sure if that makes a difference.

If you were in my shoes what information would you be considering for your decision? I'm wondering if I should get my 10 years into IL TRS then think about a change?"

We're a hybrid company, although most people—myself included—work fully from home. My job is pretty simple and I very rarely face many conflicts outside of project deadlines.

Until this week, at least. One of my colleagues, who I've always felt has been short with me, surprised several of us earlier this week by scheduling a meeting after requesting last-minute changes to a project never before requested. The issue, though, was that these requests went against protocol, and they were implying my team was the cause for a potential missed deadline (which didn't end up happening).

The meeting started off sour as they showed us very, very basic computer literacy as if we were unable to figure it out ourselves. Mind you, they're not in administration or management, nor do they oversee my day-to-day work. They then asked us questions they knew the answer to but pretended they didn't, and later contradicted themselves to make a point and try to guilt us of a deadline we'd already met much earlier this month. At one point, they were nearly shouting at us.

It was incredibly unexpected and left me very irritated. Eventually, my bosses caught wind and issued their apologies. As it turns out, they purposefully bypassed our managers to hold a ""secret"" call for the sole reason to blame us for a non-existent issue. My bosses let me vent and said they'd be handling this behind the scenes, but still, it's left a bitter taste in my mouth.

Not really looking for advice as I am just venting. It's been a long time since I've been treated so condescendingly in the workplace. Not a fan."

And then let them know I’m only interested in working 20 hours a week? 

I’ve had a previous job that I mentioned my school to and the schedule and everything and they still didn’t work around it and still put me on for 40 hours a week.

I don’t need 40 hours a week, I am perfectly fine with 20 hours a week while going to school. 

How should I go about approaching this for my future interviews? 

I want to be able to get the job but I’m afraid if I mention school or 20 hours a week they won’t want to hire me. 

I can afford a little flexibility, like 5-10 extra hours a week on top of 20 hours a week but I’m afraid I won’t ever get hired.

This might be a dumb question, but I have social anxiety and overthink things. I recently applied for a position and the potential employer responded the same day saying that he was impressed with my resume and expressed interest in setting up an interview. He gave me a more detailed job description (I was recommended the position by someone else, but was only told the name of the position), and attached a list of interview questions but didn't say anything about it in the email. Should I fill it out and attach it in my response to him, ask him if I should fill it out, or just assume that I don't need to fill it out right now?

I want to respond as quickly as possible to demonstrate professionalism and know that filling out the list of questions would make delay my response significantly (again, I over think things, so it will take me a while to fill it out). It's also a PDF, so I would have to convert the document to complete it. Thanks for your help!"

I started a new job this week on contract through Aston Carter. The job itself seems great and it’s something I think I’ll like doing, but I feel like I’m kinda getting the run around by my Aston Carter Recruiter.

I can forgive the constantly blowing up my phone and being pushy initially but the first thing that’s really irritating is being told that I HAVE to get a Covid vaccine to start working at this new job and that my Covid vaccine card would be checked upon starting, but on my first day nobody checked with me and I found out that this company doesn’t require having a Covid vaccine to begin with. 

My bigger issue though, is that I’ve been told multiple times that I should be keeping track of my hours one Aston Carter’s timecard system. I’ve asked my recruiter multiple times to send over the timecard info so I can make sure my hours get submitted and I get paid on time because I’ll be on vacation next week and won’t be able to fix/submit my hours then, but my recruiter says the email will be sent to me when it’s time to submit my hours (after previously telling me that I should’ve already gotten the email to begin with). 

I would say forget it and try to find something else but the weekly pay is enticing and I really need the money tbh. Has anyone else experienced anything like this with Aston Carter or another agency?"

Then, the recruiter called me and said I was eligible for a better position with greater pay and if I was interested. I said yes. Today, we did the phone screening. She wanted to go through my 7 year history. I told her there was more from pre-covid and during my schooling. We went through it to the best of my ability, but I didn’t have it recorded that far back. She then found out I had been termed about 5 years ago after I ran out of pto from a health issue. Her manager said that was ok, but I have to include my full job history on my next app. They need me to apply again to the lab generalist position to give it to me.

My question: once I worked at Olive Garden for two weeks, and at a clinic as a desk associate for one week. I had valid reasons for leaving after such a short time, but I don’t think anyone cares.

So I am 27 and currently working as a medical receptionist (have been for 1.5 years). It's certainly not the job I ever saw myself in — I actually was in journalism, but several major chronic health issues resulted in me being unable to do the often fast-paced, stressful 10+ hour shifts. So, I got this job in order to give myself some sense of stability while looking for a more permanent career (believe it or not, I make $2,000/year more being a receptionist than I did a local journalist lol). 

I never expected to enjoy my job as much as I do, but I really do! I like the work, I really enjoy being able to help the patients that come in the door, I actually have holidays off, and it’s a job where I don’t have to think about work when I’m off the clock. 

Here’s the major issue: The pay. I am making just under $16/hour, and my health issues are only getting more expensive. Even without health expenses, I can barely squeak by on my own in the region I live. I’ve actually had to move back in with my parents after I found out the people that lived over me at my old apartment were making meth, and I haven’t found another place I can afford. 

So despite the love of my job, I’ve put my resume out there. And I’ve had two interviews for a marketing specialist position, and fingers crossed, I was left with the impression that I can expect an offer soon. This job uses the skills I gained at the news station but doesn’t have the terrible hours, and I would actually be using my college degree. Additionally, my salary would nearly double. It sounds silly saying $60,000 is life changing, but it honestly would be for me, someone who has never made more than $35,000. I have asked for raises in the past and have gotten a 30 cent one, but obviously I’ll never touch $60,000. And right now there’s no opportunity for growth at the hospital I work at.

So how do I prepare to quit a job that I do love? My coworkers have always praised me on my work, and said they love having me. And I’ve said I love working here to my boss. I know I don’t owe anything to my job, but I know quitting will catch everyone off guard and it’s going to feel like a betrayal."

To start off, here’s a little context:

I’m 23 and graduated from college about a year ago now with a Bachelor of Arts in Music and minor in Computer Science. Realizing what I’ve actually wanted to do with that degree has changed throughout the years. 

In short, I love both music and computers and want to do sound/audio engineering. This is, at least from my perspective, a really hard industry to get into and as such I’ve been applying for positions for over a year now with no success. 

At the same time, I got bills to pay, so I currently work two part-time computer support jobs. They make OK pay for my area, but it’s pretty much a paycheck-to-paycheck kind of lifestyle.

This has left me feeling pretty empty with things as they are good jobs with nice people, but not things that I can feel I guess PROUD of as things just feel missing. 

Any advice on how I might be able to look at this differently or at least get the most out of it for the time being? Because at the moment, it just feels like I’m letting time slip away.

Thanks in advance for any comments!"

Due to life changes, I'm looking to get off the road. I contacted a company I would love to work for and they are interested but not ready to hire yet and mentioned needing a few weeks. Obviously, this is no where near a done deal. They might not hire anyone, or go with someone else, etc. However, I'd really like to use these next few weeks to become the perfect candidate for the role. Best case scenario, it works and I get it! Worst case scenario, it doesn't but maybe it helps me get a job somewhere else.

It's a tech role. It would be an account manager. if you had several weeks to acquire as many qualifications for an account manager type role, what would you do?

I'm open to any other ideas for applying for any other positions or roles I might be a good fit in and whatever else I can gather up to land a good job. I'm looking for remote or hybrid (located near Chicago) roles, customer facing, possible sales adjacent roles."

Had the interview process changed? I expected to receive an email or phone call to schedule an interview through zoom or in person. Is it now the norm to receive emails to send an email to another person? 

I did that and then received a reply with a list of questions.  Am I being scammed here? I would think my application and resume would provide my information. 

I’ve always conducted interviews in person.

I lost my job last Friday and now I just found out it wasn’t a layoff like I was originally told. Now I can’t get unemployment. 

For a back story, I am immunocompromised -which I had disclosed, so I get sick easily. I got sick in September with bronchitis, Covid in February, and an upper respiratory infection in March. I also had scheduled surgery (I got approval for) in January to remove my tonsils to help with the issue.  Yeah, I know, I was sick A LOT. I was there only 9 months too. It is VERY frustrating knowing I have no control over this. I’ve been asking my supervisors if I should be worried because of my attendance and they seemed very understanding and kind. It was such a relief to me. 

Last month I had been relocated to a new office and was under the impression I was doing well. I was never on a PIP or anything. I was just told they needed to do more training with me and I needed gain more experience. None of my issues were l due to incompetence, I was just hired at an awkward time and had never gotten any formal training. 

Fast forward to last Thursday. I was notified that they were rehiring someone who had experience and was going to be taking some crap off my plate. This was great because it allowed me to do more of the stuff I’m good at (and what I had actually been hired for) rather than customer facing stuff. 

The next day I was busy working when my manager walked in and abruptly told me I was being “let go”. He was super kind and told me it wasn’t really my fault and that he felt like he failed me because he hadn’t had the time to really train me over the last month. I got the strong impression that they were consolidating and I was just not as experienced as the guy that was replacing me. My manager then wrote me an amazing recommendation letter, told me he’d help me find a new job, and told me to use him-not the owner as my reference. He also said he’d help me set up unemployment ASAP. In the recommendation letter it stated I wasn’t being let go due to performance. To be transparent, I am a good designer, but I am slow due to being newer and again I just never getting any damn training so I was teaching myself.

I took the weekend to get my bearings and attempt to celebrate my birthday.  Today I contacted my former manager today to help start the unemployment process. He texted me back apologizing profusely that he was incorrect and due to the reason of me being let go, I was not going to qualify for unemployment… I was fired and not laid off. I was double shocked and asked him to, in detail, explain the owner’s reason for firing. 

My manager told me three reasons: one was attendance -which is what I was afraid of. Performance (ffs), and lastly that the owner of this small business saw my updated indeed resume and assumed I was looking for a new job -which I wasn’t. My boss told me the latter reason was what instigated me being let go… IMO I was pretty much fired instead of laid off out of spite because my owner was thought I had been looking for a new job. 

It’s incredibly unfair and poorly timed and while I just want to whine and sulk, I legit have no income all of a sudden and am frantically looking for a job.

My question is, is there ANYTHING that I can do to get unemployment or disability or something? Any advice/CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is appreciated."

I have been working at my current job for two and a half months now. It’s my second ever full-time job after graduating from school and there are many different facets and details to learn about my position. 

I make small, fixable mistakes on a semi-frequent basis. Some have been repeat mistakes. Some have just been misunderstandings. They have put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders right away. I also have ADHD and it really impacts my memory, causes brain fog, and effects my ability to catch small details. I’ve shared this with my boss.

I personally don’t think that getting fired is the worst thing that could happen. If a job isn’t the right fit for you then you shouldn’t stay there. The natural flow will be to find a new job that fits better. My family puts a huge amount of stress and expectation on my shoulders though. They think that getting fired is the worst thing that could possibly happen. They’re old fashioned.

The fear of getting fired is eating me up inside. Is this a valid fear, or are mistakes expected in the first three months of a job, especially when I am so young?"

Honestly the constant calls, and being in a room by myself for hours can get draining. 

I’m 25 and I wasn’t to start working on my career and being with a company I can grow with. 

There is potential for growth with progressive if I can survive the year of calls but I’m not sure if I really care for the insurance industry. I worked in sales mostly prior cosmetics, and also finance. I loved them both and working  in finance I get to always learn which I love. I’m just not sure of what type of growth I will have working in wireless sales etc.

I need to be making more then 50k plus I feel by next year atleast 60-70k I might can do that with progressive but not so sure how promotions are in wireless industry. I would go back to finance but like I need something I can easily just up in go as I will be moving in a few months as I’m not sure where I wanna live permanently.

I think stay at progressive would be best but not sure if I can take it with all the calls, and not sure if I care for the industry like that. I just know I can move faster with a fully remote position. And the pay is good. Not sure how much I would make in wireless sal"

After a year of doing that, I got laid off because the contract expired. I then focused on college classes for a semester while collecting, and I stopped getting benefits. I started to seriously look for a job around march, but I couldn’t find anything and kept getting rejected at interviews or qualifications were not met from the moment I applied. That was until I got a chance at a Panda Express as a regular associate, and the pay was gonna be $15. The indeed posting said that the pay was 16-19, but since I thought that since it was already on the paper, I couldn’t really do anything, so I signed it. Now my parents are giving me a hard time because I shouldn’t settle for $15 when I was at a job that was going to give me $20/hr for being at the previous job (the decom one) for a year. I get the whole know my worth shtick, but I got the job already, and they want me to find a job that pays $20/hr, even though in my opinion, I don’t have much asking power. So am I supposed to look for another job, even though I *just* got hired at this job?

I’m struggling on how to go about bringing up things to my director at my job. 
In short, I’m miserable. My manager is constantly micromanaging, is barely present, makes us as employees look bad, and is just down right horrible. 


A couple of the things they have done recently that has really set me off include: 

- leaving work for two hours for beauty reasons and leaves us to do their work 

- had me present at a major meeting in front of over 100 people and while I was presenting, stepped in front of me and advanced the PowerPoint even though I was on the correct slides. (They literally stepped in front of me as I was standing at the podium and reached over me..) 

- every time my coworkers and I submit things for their approval such as presentations, emails, etc, they wait until the last minute to respond if they respond at all. If no response is given and something is submitted, they get mad at us. If they do respond, it is last minute and want everything changed or they will delete things. 

- submits group presentation slides to leadership last minute even if they have been finished for days 

- disrupts virtual meetings by speaking loudly or chatting with their SO who also works at the same business. We had to apologize during a meeting because everyone could hear them yelling behind us. Mind you, they were supposed to be attending this meeting as well and showed up in the last 5 minutes. 

- originally told me I could work around my internship schedule but now I must do it outside of my work schedule. Then continued to email me demanding me for all of my meeting invites with my preceptor even though it does not concern them. 

- does not pay attention to any meetings we have 

- does other things during 1:1s such as text people 

- if they decide to edit any work, such as emails or messages, everything will b scrapped except for “hello” and “thank you”.  

- says they want us to be able to “network” but forces us to send meeting invites so they can tag along and be nosy. 

- snoops in other peoples work and try’s to correct them and make them look Bad 

- does not listen to anything anyone has to say. You could tell them one thing and they will ask about the same thing three times the same day and throughout the week. Even if an email is sent. 

I’m sorry this is so long. I’m just stuck on what to do. My internship is the most important part of this company as I’m not sure I’d be able to do it if I wasn’t already an employee. It’s in a different department and with a different team. If I didn’t have to do an internship, I would leave without a doubt. 

I have the option to go to my director, but I’m worried it may make things worse. I don’t want my manager to have a vengeance against me but this is getting emotionally draining."

I interned here last year (before the financial downturn) and liked my time here so I joined full time but now I’m worried. I found out that even some of my 401k and bonus benefits got slashed, which sucks because I wouldn’t of initially accepted the position otherwise! I also just reconnected with my old manager who was amazing and found out they took a voluntary severance package too - so this really freaked me out!

my first week was training and i had 4 shifts (a standard shift is roughly 5 hours.) the next week i had two, and the next week i had 4 again. the next week i had 3, then 3 again, and then 4 but i got really sick (respiratory infection) and had to call out of 3 of those. after that i took my weekling timeoff i had informed them about when i was hired. i got back from that on the 16th, and since then i’ve worked 5 shifts, in the coming week i have 4 shifts, and then from may 3-may 9 i am scheduled for ONE SHIFT.

technically 4 shifts a week should be able 20 hours, but they have consistently scheduled me to START at 9 or 9:30 for 2 of those, and 8 or 7:30 for the others. those 9:30 weekdays hurttt because as i said we are a brunch place so i’m often heading home around 1. i

have repeatedly asked to be brought in earlier (my coworker who’s also a host consistently gets brought on at 7 even though she’s told them to bring her in later). i’ve also asked them to put me on the schedule more. every time they’re like “oh okay, i’ll keep that in mind sorry!” but after getting my schedule today with only one shift on it i’m at the end of my rope.

i have 100% availability. i am available any time, any day of the week. t am a hard worker, very friendly, i put in so much effort, i’m efficient… i don’t see what i’m doing wrong. i’ve never been in any trouble or had anything said to me. i am dedicated to working, i don’t have a car and i walk in the early morning rain and cold sometimes to get there! here’s like 5 of us hosts total and there always has to be at least 2 on duty, but i’m still never getting hours, and they just started training ANOTHER host!!

this is my only source of income and i’m already struggling to pay rent with 3 or 4 shifts a week, so i’m devastated seeing 1 on the schedule. my sister suggested they might be “ghosting” me off the schedule because they don’t like me, which if true i wouldn’t take personally, but i’m confused on what the issue is, especially because no one has said anything to me about if/what i’ve done wrong. it’s just so frustrating, my coworkers talk about how much they love working here and how nice management is… many of them have been working here for 2 years or more. but i’m just not feeling that love?

how can i talk to my boss about this in a more effective way? i really can’t accept only being on the schedule for 1 shift a week. do i just ask nicely again? threaten to quit? ask if there’s an issue? i appreciate any advice, i’m really struggling to make ends meet and it’s hard because everyone else in this place is at least 3 years older than me and been working here a while, so i don’t know if i fully understand their expectations and norms in matters like this."

I am a tech savvy geek, decently physically capable, willing to learn anything and do anything (except excessively fast paced factory work because the toll it takes affects my studies).

I left that job to go work at an accounting job for a casino that owns many properties. 

With the sales job I made 46k a year with a 70% discount in my phone bill. Working 28 hours a week. Had health insurance even tho it was the lowest kind of health care coverage. My coworkers are cool as hell and my age. Selling wouldn’t be hard at all just Customers are pretty rough and take anger out on you. So that and wanting to put my finance degree to use is why I left. 

With the accounting manager job I make 53k a year salaried. Work 50-55hours because we can’t leave until the books are balanced or until your deadlines are due. Like there are some days I may pull a 12 hour shift just crunching numbers and revising my team members work. Im also in front of a computer. My coworkers are all 35+. I’m 26 years old which I have nothing against but there isn’t much talking going on through out the day. Overall they are all nice, But I do miss socializing. The casino takes care of all health benefits and cost. Nothing out of pocket. Now as far as the learning process goes for this job it’s a lot more complicated because they are so behind on their work from pervious months. I know within 2 months I’ll be able to learn everything no issues. 


But idk what to do should I go back to my old job? Almost feels like I’m working more hours for almost the same money. I’m having a lot of pride towards thinking about going back to the old job because once im done with something im usually done. Btw I left on good terms. My old boss was happy to have me on his team."

Part of my job responsibilities involve modification of data files for presentation or for upload into databases. I process e-commerce activity by modifying CSV files for upload into NetSuite. This is a tasks that would take a full time worker to do by hand, however, I can modify files in excel and do transformations on them to prepare them within minutes.

I'm very good with excel, pivot tables, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, XLOOKUP, data transformation, and I have some experience building macros in excel. I know a lot of these tasks can be done with PYTHON, but I don't have any experience with it.

I am just a month over the legal working age where I'm from, which happens to be pretty young, so I doubt I'll get easily be hired since people in college struggle just as much. I also look fairly young which may affect it too (I'm not too much taller than 183 cm/5'0"" ft). Based on my age, I can work 8 hours a day/40 hours a week, 3 hours max on school days. Summer is almost here though, so I soon won't have the 3 hour max limit.

I would love to work remote, but most places I searched had things like ""15+ years of experience in x"" so I'm not sure it's an option.

I heard that movie theaters hire young, so I thought about looking there, but I didn't see any available in my area. I may try again soon. I haven't gone into different places and asked if they're hiring yet because I'd prefer to do it online, but I may start doing that.

I enjoy drawing/art in general and graphic design, but will gladly take minimum wage jobs at fast food places and such.

I don't need anything fancy, just enough that I can earn some extra money. My family isn't struggling, but I'd really like to earn some money to give to my mom, save up for college, and buy some things that are a combination of wants/needs. In my area, it seems that a minimum wage job (8hr days) pays 640/week. That is more than enough for me.

Things where I'd go to someone's house such as babysitting are completely out as well.

Also, I'm not looking to be told to just 'enjoy my childhood' either and will disregard any comments that say such since what I'm providing here is just a sliver of my life that you don't know.

I'd also like to mention that I am queer and trans, just because I don't want to be put in a dangerous situation and I'm looking for companies that will prioritize my safety over their customer satisfaction. I know that might be rare, but I see it sometimes. I assume I may be less likely to get the job if I use my usual pronouns (he/they), so I may just put myself down as he/him on applications. I'd love to use my typical pronouns though, so queer supporting businesses are heavily preferred.

I hope any of my rambling made sense, and I appreciate all/any help and suggestions! I will happily answer any questions in the comments. I also apologize for any grammatical errors. I will edit this as more comments populate.

Also, if anyone else is in a similar situation reading this: You might see jobs below that say stuff such as ""Netflix Tagger"", ""Amazon Product Reviewer"", etc. They are scams and all use the same cookie cutter template. Don't fall for them and always look up a website that has anything to do with money purchase or exchanges to see if it's a scam.

Thank you!

TLDR; Minor in search of job ideas, minimum wage fine."
0,2023-04-27,"I might have been reading this wrong, but after getting laid-off, a manager may have told me my time with the organization was a write-off, and implied to not put it in my resume but rather rely on experience from an industry I haven't worked in almost a decade",u/PeasThatTasteGross,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/130b955/i_might_have_been_reading_this_wrong_but_after/,jobs,"TL:DR, probably the post title

Some background: around March last year (2022), I took a medical leave from work after having been at the company since around late August to early September of 2021.  I had some performance issues that seemed acceptable at first after I went off probation, but in late February 2022 I made a mistake that seemed to have made my direct manager lose complete faith in me.  It made them put me back on probation, and basically said that if things didn't improve, I would be asked to leave.  They didn't put a formal PiP in, but said it wouldn't be that black and white for the threshold of being let go, and there would be a lot of in-between leeway.  

When I took my medical leave, it was a bit of a busy time and they really needed more people.  Around this time last year when it looked like I would be gone for longer than it seemed, I went to turn in my work electronics to my manager and we had a talk.  They said the exact same scenario happened last year at around the same time, someone (who had been there for a few years at that point) went on leave after getting put on probation again, and they were left short staffed (and never came back as far as I know).  They also went into how they felt things my entire time there hadn't worked out, some what implying even when I did get things right prior to my big mistake didn't really matter any more.  I pointed out in the three weeks after I made the mistake and we worked up a plan, they seemed to think I did okay when I asked for feedback at the time, but when I was talking to them that particular day they seemed to reign back on that, saying that I was a little slow.  I promised to them when I got better I would go back and prove myself that I am competent.  

During January and February of this year, I went to physiotherapy for two months which the insurance company mandated for return to work.  Initially, it seemed like I was going back soon, and the insurance company got the idea I would be starting again at the end of February.  Work didn't like the back to work schedule so they tried to rework which days of the week I would work with my physiotherapist, so that got put off.  

It wasn't until the beginning of April did I hear word from the insurance company and they said I would be returning at the beginning of May, having been unable to come up with a back to work schedule with my employer.  The insurance company told me in lieu of that, they would give me the rest of April to re-adjust my lifestyle for back to work and work out a pay check plan to get paid out in the mean time.  What they didn't know because my employer didn't say to them directly was the reason they couldn't get a back to work plan was because my position had been eliminated and I had been laid off, which I found out from HR last week.  

This put me in shock because I realized that plan for me to go back and prove I could be a decent worker was now no longer possible, and the only thing my manager would remember me by was ""not panning out"".  I reached out to them one last time, and both them and the manager above said this was a decision made well outside their reach, and came to them out of no where also.  I discussed my disappointment about my performance prior to my leave, and my manager reiterated it kind of sucked I wasn't around when they needed the manpower to get the work done the previous spring.  Everything was cordial and my manager said it was all professional and there was no hard feelings.  

However, they then suggested something along the lines of not bothering to put this experience on my resume, and rather to fall back on my previous work experience as an earth scientist.  I found this a nuts suggestion especially if they had truly read my resume, as it has been nine years since I last worked that field of work.  In addition, and this is something I never told them and they never seemed to have found out, was that the reason I left that field of work was I had far worst performance issues and may have been blacklisted by word of mouth.  I spent the middle of last decade working low-end to minimum wage jobs just to get by, only to go back to school during the last few years of the decade to get into my current field.  

I feel I cannot exclude this previous job from my resume, as it would create a massive gap when combined with the medical leave I took.  More importantly is without it, I have no relevant work experience in my current field and a two-year gap from my graduation from my second post-secondary experience to this job I was recently laid off from, being four years of no relevant work.  Well, maybe not quite, I had an unpaid internship in the summer of 2021 that was loosely related to my field, but I don't think I can fall back on that especially with the two-year gap excluding this recent job from my resume would create.  

I then discussed two further things with my manager, and the first was the possibility of using them as a work reference.  I predicted and feared it would happen, but they said while I could put them down, they didn't really have much to say.  They seemed to imply they wouldn't say anything negative about me, but they felt being there for less than half-a-year before my leave, they felt I wasn't around long enough to have anything to say.  Okay, I some what accepted that because that was better than being told they wouldn't be a reference because they felt you weren't up to snuff.  

It was the second question that broke me a little.  In my line of work, it is optional to be indentured into a trade related to it, I would just need my hours signed off on it.  Once again, it was something I feared but rationalized it as being needless worry, but my manager said they didn't feel comfortable signing off on my hours I worked there because they felt I didn't perform well enough to warrant it.  I could be wrong, but my understanding was part of the hours signed off would be learning from someone.  While my manager felt closer to the end I needed to be almost totally retrained on everything because the mistake just ruined any confidence they had in me, I was able to do my work alone without issues sometimes, and there is the mandatory paper work I filled out to prove it.  In other words, it almost seems like this is another way for my manager to say once again, your time here was a total waste.  

It's why I really wanted to come back and prove my worth, because now without that opportunity, I feel my manager's thoughts on me are what I failed at.  I'm still probably going to put this job on my resume but not put my manager as a reference despite him giving the technical okay.  I should be fine as long as the any potential future employers don't go out of their way to contact them, which is why I am thinking about telling them if they hear from someone asking about me, I have not given authorization for them to do so.  

The final talk kind of proved my biggest fear true, that despite my medical issue, my manager still only saw the worst that happened to me.  I remember my parents telling me this was all worry that would probably not happen. but some parts of those worries have come true (at least I know my managers didn't go out of there way to can me, or so I think).  I now wonder if my co-workers who I think would give me a good reference will either ignore me or reject my requests to be a reference.  This isn't because I think there maybe a link between them and my manager necessarily, but after this past week or so of being let down with unfortunate news every now and then, I don't know if there will be any good in the horizon."

I need some tips on how to deal with constant anger and overwhelming feelings at my job. I have managed to manage it but now it just makes me crazy.

Please refrain from saying ""find a new job"" as I am doing this, but it is a very difficult process atm and it is taking some time. 

I work as a graphic designer with very tight deadlines and general chaos on an organisational level (on the companies side) . I constantly ask people to send me the documents and information with enough time so I can organise myself as it is very busy and on top of everything I get constant last time stuff from Direction that trumps my job schedule everyday, making me not able to meet deadlines. I also work part time and they don't want to up my hours (no budget) so I have to do some extra hours (unpaid) here and there. 

 I am the only graphic designer in the whole company  and I work in two levels: on an inside levels (managing design requests from our 7 departments)  and on a second level managing requests from 35 quite active clients. 

I am tired of explaining to people how my workflow is structured and how much time I need. When a coworker comes up and tells me there is something I have to do I tell them that the deadline is too tight and that it is difficut to make it but they just  tell me that ""they're sorry"" and that ""I should prioritise their request"". Saying NO most of the times is impossible or I get a condescening pat on the back. As a result, I get anger bouts and anxiety and it's painful. I feel disrespected. I try not to care and to shrug it off but I can't.

There is no way I can ask for help because I have no direct bosses and management does not care as long as the work is done. I am kind of a free spirit but also when there is a last moment thing the department that needs the last minute thing takes over my persona and manages me.

I might even need to consider changing careers but do any of you guys have any tips?"

In fact, I will be changing teams every six months for two years as part of the programme I joined. Thing is, compared to my previous team, my current one is chaotic and I can barely cope with the amount of unexpected tasks. Previously, I was able to actually enjoy my work and take time to reflect on tasks, we had  scheduled status meetings, used kanban boards, respected work hours, etc. Now, it's become a standard that my boss or coworkers call me outside of work hours, I'm often expected to work late or start my day before work hours. On top of that I was never properly thought the way of work as my boss believes in learning as you work. I used to be organized and could predict length of certain tasks but now I feel like everything is drowning in chaos. Some days I don't eat much before 2-3pm because I feel like there is no time and everything is so overwhelming. 

I talked with my programme supervisor and she says it's okay to spend some time in am environment like this because I will enjoy different teams more in the future. Problem is I feel no connection with the job anymore. I don't believe in the company policy bs, or fake ""we are one big family"" claim that is mindlessly repeated literally everywhere. 

This situation leaves me extremely drained and unmotivated to do anything else but binge tv series after work. I strongly want to change it but I feel like I'd need to get a whole new career path and not merely swap companies.

What should I do?"

This doesn't sound professional at all but this morning my boss stuck a bunch of giant notes to his door that said: ""If the company isn't growing, maybe it's time to leave."" My colleagues & I were like ""wtf"" & ""wait, so it's not growing?"" 🤨 it's quite sudden tbh

& today I was reminded about the ""mid-year review"" which I'm 100% aware of but only because ""you should do better & be careful, just in case"" by a colleague who leads a particular task (yeah I did make a few mistakes on a task, accidentally sent a few of the same notifications to the same segments of users & i cancelled them later but it's not favorable because it doesn't always work).

It would be great for career development but I’m unsure.

My current company is fab. I’m quite happy and work remotely, I slack off sometimes but always get my work done on time. However I find myself getting bored and feel I am not getting the full support I need. There are some great benefits though! We’re quite a small company, which means everyone knows each other, the company culture is fun and we’re going down to a four day week.

This new job seems good as well! However it’s very corporate and I feel like I’m not necessarily ready for it. It would be remote working three days out of five and same amount of hours as my current job. The pay is much higher and the managers I spoke to both seem very friendly. I’m just scared I’ll find the content boring and go from slacking to working hard. Also I’m scared my mistakes will reflect massively on us as an organisation and il get fired.

7,2023-04-27,Leaving my job (update),u/stevester90,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/130gta2/leaving_my_job_update/,jobs,"So I mentioned here earlier that I was denied a promotion by my supervisor and I have started applying for other jobs. Since that time, my supervisor recently turned in their resignation letter and is leaving the company. I talked to his boss last week explaining how I was unhappy with my previous supervisor and how I never would have started applying to other jobs had my previous supervisor treated me well. I’m happy to share I have finally been given an offer where I will be paid 20k more than what I currently make and plan on accepting the position. 

My boss is unaware of this and has mentioned to promote me but has been dragging their feet. The client we work with does not like me and I think conspired with my previous supervisor, which is why I don’t feel comfortable staying where I currently work. Additionally, many of my current coworkers have expressed displeasure with our previous supervisor and will likely be leaving soon. So there will be some high turnover in the next few months and I don’t want to be caught picking up slack for disgruntled people leaving the company."

1,2023-04-27,Potentially difficult supervisor,u/ladyofnasrin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/130h4sp/potentially_difficult_supervisor/,jobs,"I recently interviewed for a staff position at a higher education institution (which I have some experience in) and while the first interview was extremely entry level (I’m trying to get out of my two jobs situation so I applied for anything) they hired another candidate and they were kind enough to tell me that it was because I was overqualified for the position that they went someone else. They said they liked me and referred me to another department who is looking for someone like me. I was thrilled for another and potentially better opportunity.

Fast forward a few days later and I received an email from the departments liaison and she debriefed me on who I would be speaking to and explained that the position that they were hiring for was a temp position that could lead to a permanent position. Again, trying to get out of my current situation, I accepted to move forward. She couldn’t tell me much about the position because there was no official job title and the position hadn’t even been posted to the job posting. She said that the professor would be telling me more about it.

Anyways, the next day I had a phone interview with a professor and we got into talking about my resume fairly quickly and I’m used to the typical interview format, you know like, telling them about my myself, highlighting good qualities about myself and new skills that I’ve acquired, yada yada.

Well this professor GRILLED me right off the bat and was quizzing me about what I knew about the position which I had little to no information, and he was upset that I didn’t know. Asked me about a position I worked in from 7 years ago that is relevant to the current position (makes sense) but then was interested in the minutia of my day-to-day like how many calls did I make a day and how did I acquire such records and other dumb shit tbh. He got frustrated with me many times during the call because he wouldn’t frame his questions succinctly or directly and I would do my best in understanding his questions, give him an answer, but he was never satisfied with them. He would be very condescending and interrupt me and say that I didn’t understand or after jabbing me with differently worded questions he would say something like, “NOW you FINALLY got it. That’s I wanted from you from the beginning” but in a very smug way. 

When I tell you I almost hung up on this man, I really almost did. But out of courtesy, the little I had left, I finished the interview.


CRAZILY ENOUGH, the man offered me a job at the end (even though I thought I blew it for his standards) and he even fought for me to get paid more than what the initial pay was, and it was significantly more—I’ll be making more that I’ve ever made before with one job albeit, tbd on how long.


But I find out that he is going to be my direct supervisor and I think his attitude is very much a red flag but I also don’t wanna give up this opportunity. 

What do you think?


TLDR: 

I was practically berated by my interviewer who still gave me a job and I found out that he is going to be my direct supervisor. Idk how I’m gonna handle that everyday."

I had contacted the credentialing specialist expressing concern regarding the references on Monday. She just reached back to me on Wednesday saying that she had to discuss my concerns with her supervisors, and they all agreed that a peer and my district manager would probably be appropriate.

This firm makes a big deal of blind interviewing. They don't know your age, race, gender or company before you interview. HR redacts all information that might lead to bias. I love this. And it would be in my favour when interviewing for the more senior role. I'm thinking if I explained my reasons to the recruiter, referencing to their blind interview process, they might understand and just change my interviewee. Do you think there's any harm in this?"

Last week I went on an interview for a job much closer to home with a higher salary AND I get to keep my 100% employer paid insurance benefit I have at my current job.  

I felt the interview went very well, she asked if I would have availability to possibly speak with HER boss.  I told her I'd send her an email with my availability before the end of the day.  I sent the email and used the opportunity to also make it a ""thank you"" and she responded that she'd definitely get back to me very soon.

Yesterday, I had a recruiter that I'd worked with while I was unemployed reach out to me with a direct hire opportunity.  This position is an even higher salary than the position I interviewed for last week, I still would have 100% employer paid insurance, but the commute is similar to my current commute of 40 minutes.

I'd rather have that job I interviewed for last week, just due to the commute and what I feel would be a great company culture.  It would make my home life so much easier to just be 15 minutes away vs 40.  

Would it be tacky to reach out to the interviewer and inquire as to where she's at in the hiring process?"

A warehouse guy who also looks after the marketing side of things, long story short I've stopped giving a shit. Over working for an absolute knob in a heavily family based business (not mine) with an ego and just flat out rude. Not looking to improve things, not speaking to anyone, just rocking up 9 to 5 doing my thing and that's it.

I'm looking and once I find something - I still gotta try and keep my apartment going - I'm leaving that company in the dust. Don't want a reference from the owner even though I've been there for nearly 2 years.

I've stopped caring about a career either, just looking for jobs with a bump in salary, yet at the same time just want something easy and straightforward. I do have a Bachelor's degree but it's technically an Arts degree and I don't have any plans for another one.

My working background is either in hospitality, warehousing or marketing. Ideally I just want a chill vibe yet on the rare interview I always get questioned on why I want to do this or why have I changed a lot recently (thanks COVID). I have a base level of design but I've struggled nor really desired learning something brand new for nearly a decade. 

Am I bitter? Probably, but the mood is in the title. While I'll be giving up a no staying late, short commute job warning just over A$60k a year, I really want a higher paying job. Shocker, like everyone else. But I can't quit before I have a job ready and with my job history I have arms tied behind the back. ""Career"" changes are certainly common, but how hard is it really?"

I'm a third year student studying a dual bachelor degree of finance and chemistry. I wanted to ask, what is the most lucrative job I can attain with my degree?

I know the average salaries for finance vary a lot.

And generally, with a chemistry degree you need to do a PhD to do research (which generally is not very lucrative, and i'm fairly opposed to at this point).

I've been exposed to representatives from a few industry types, accounting, quant trading, investment banking, consulting, sales, etc. However, I'm trying to find my right fit having a chemistry mind with a strong ability to problem-solve in a complex and highly theoretical environment but also an understanding of business and stock market fundamentals, corporate structures, micro and macro economics, etc. 

I only ask because I feel wildly inferior by my fellow peers who studying software engineering, computer science, math, and physics and seem to have literally identical job prospects but with a higher starting salary (and more room for growth).

Any advice would be much appreciated!"

I currently work as a manager and have been looking to take a step up in responsibilities as I have topped out my ability to grow in my current organization without moving states (I am open to this but local would be preferred). So I interviewed at a company for a manager level role with more direct and indirect reports. 

I get a call back after the final interview, saying they did not think I was ""ready"" for the role but they would like to offer me a supervisor position. I immediately declined on the phone. 

About a month goes by and I get an email from the companies HR rep saying they were still interested in me and they had a ""new"" role they would like to talk to me about. Other than the offer of the supervisor position I liked the company and what they were doing. 

So I have the call with the HR rep and they proceed to offer me the same supervisor role again! I think the rep heard me laugh on the phone. I just couldn't actually believe they tried again. 

Anyways would love to send a nasty email but I won't so just figured I'd put it on Reddit instead."

I felt super low and down on myself. Even though my company had the courtesy to tell me and not just lock me out right away, I still felt it was super abrupt. They told me it wasn’t performance based, but since we were a small company, they had to eliminate my role after bringing someone else on full time who had been part time. Since I was aware of that factor, it felt like I didn’t perform well enough for them. This job wasn’t my dream job by any means (it wasn’t my desired industry), but I liked the work I was doing (enough), my team, and the salary was decent and a big step up from my prior job. I was planning to stay at least another 6 months to a year while looking for my dream job. 

I took a few days to assess where I wanted to go next. I started a very active job search applying for jobs in my new desired field, looking for anything having to do with music, film, or tv (mostly marketing roles or assistant/coordinator roles). I know entertainment is a hard industry to break into, but I applied for a lot of roles where I had relevant experience from past jobs/schooling. I was getting interviews left and right. A friend referred me for a position that she was leaving and sounded interesting to me. They wanted to meet me right away. I had two interviews with this company, clicked super well with them, then was completely ghosted. I kept doing interviews literally 3-4 times a week with other companies and it all just seemed to lead to nothing. Some were large, well-known companies, some were small, unknown, and didn’t pay a lot, and some were not even in the industry I wanted just because I needed a job. I was feeling super burnt out and still down on myself and my skillset. The feedback I would get (if not ghosted) was like, “we loved meeting you and you were a strong candidate, but sorry, we’re going with someone else.”

Finally, yesterday, after almost three months and so many interviews and rejections, I received two really incredible job offers from two big, well known companies! One offer was time sensitive so I had to decide yesterday, and I am so happy with my choice. It felt so weird to pass on the other offer based on the company, though. I was just shocked at how many “no name” places rejected me just to have these companies both want me a few months later. It finally feels like the break in my career I’ve always wanted. So, if you’re in a tough search, KEEP GOING! If anything else came out of this, I did get super comfortable/good at interviewing😅"

I would greatly appreciate any tips, advice, or resources you can share to help me prepare for this interview.

Thank you in advance for your support and guidance! I'm looking forward to hearing from you all and acing (hopefully lol) this interview.

The problem I am having is that I am not quite sure what I should be applying for. I have a B.S. in Industrial Technology, I love engineering, I love working with my hands, and ""figuring things out"". The problem is because of my personality, I was encouraged to seek out sales positions. I love helping people, but I hate having to meet sales quotas and cold calling. So, after about 10 years of inside sales, outside sales at various jobs, I decided I wanted to own my own business. I opened my own brick and mortar flooring store in south Louisiana. My wife took care of the books, but I did everything else. I subcontracted the installation labor, but I was the salesman, estimator, IT, mechanic, warehouse manager, loading and unloading, marketing, receptionist, purchasing, etc. Like any new business, the beginning was slow going, but steadily business grew and got better. I sold it to move to Utah to be closer to family. When I sold it, I was doing quite well, the business was still growing, and after 9 years, last year was my best so far. 

Now, I am looking to work for someone else, mainly due to the stress and my wife wants me home more. I don't know what jobs to look for, it seems like I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I would prefer to get back to my engineering roots, but I have no on the book experience for that. I feel that I have the ability to be a supervisor or manager, but I have no experience managing anyone other than my subcontractors. I have applied to dozens of jobs ranging from Production Manager to Engineering Technician, to Warehouse Manager. So many of these jobs want experience that seems so specific, that there can't be more than 3-4 people that qualify. I know I don't want to work in sales anymore, I am 47, so starting at the bottom and working my way up really is not an option. I feel that I have skills that any company would look at and say, ""Well he does not check off all the boxes, but if anyone will be able to learn and do it, it will be him.""

I guess I am asking if anyone here can shed a little light on which direction in the job seeking world I should be aiming to have a better chance of hitting a target, or if taking 2+ months and zero interviews is normal."

The gist I got is that he mentioned to them that he is considering going back to school for firefighting but that depends on whether he can get Lasix and he has a consultation this Friday. They basically told him to call them on Friday and let them know whether he'll be going back to school or committing to them.

Here's the thing, even if he does get Lasix he may not be in time for him to be eligible to enroll this September. 

I was hanging out with his girlfriend that night and she said she told him to just take the job and if he leaves for school in semptember oh well. I expressed my concern that him lying and quitting in semptember could reflect really badly on me because I recommended him. She didn't even really acknowledge what I said.

If he goes next year in semptember that's one thing but lying and leaving 4 months later is another.

I suspect this guy either didn't understand what my previous job was like, or something? What I asked for was right in the middle of their salary range, not outrageous at all especially given that my qualifications should have made me not just a good candidate but the ideal candidate..

So, the other night I was at work      
(I work 2 separate jobs for personal reasons. 1st one is cleaning offices at the hospital from 5:30pm-9:30pm. 2nd one is cleaning offices at a commercial building 10:00pm-2:30am/3:00am.).      
Around 2am when I was finishing up, I got a frantic call from my best friends sister in law asking if I knew where she was (best friend lives with me). I said no because I’m at work.     
Without going into too much detail. My best friend has a history of mental issues and 1 suicide attempt (about 10 months ago). My best friends sister-in-law tells me that my best friend called her brother and sounded frantic/hysterical and this is exactly what happened the last time she attempted suicide.    
Naturally, I called my boyfriend who also lives with me and asked if my best friend was home. He said no, she had left the house about a half hour ago.     
Long story short.. it was another suicide attempt and I raced home (I work about a half hour drive from where we live).     
Here’s where things get messy….      

I messaged my boss at my 2nd job and explained the situation I was currently dealing with. She said that she understands that I’m dealing with an emergency situation and that she would either have someone cover for me for the rest of the week or she would even do it herself if she had to. She’s always been a very nice lady.      

My 1st job however.. It was 2:30/3:00am and I don’t have my head boss’s cell phone number or anyway to get ahold of him at that time of night. So instead.. I called my supervisor (my boss’s son). I explained everything to him and I told him that I wouldn’t be in the next night. He said he understands and hopes my friend is alright.      

The next day.. I was exhausted when I got home from the hospital and I fell asleep. I woke up around 8pm to a text from my supervisor’s “co-supervisor”. She asked if I was coming in? I said.     
“No, I called *** last night and told him I wouldn’t be in tonight. He didn’t tell you?” She said.     
 “Yes, but he told you to call the office today. Any days you can't come in you have to talk to the office/the main boss. Not just *** or myself. The main boss was expecting a call from you.”      

I didn’t tell her but, he never mentioned to me when I was on the phone with him to call the main boss. But whatever, I didn’t want to argue so I just told her..       

“My apologies! My service in the waiting room at the hospital was a little spotty, and I was in a panic. Thank you for understanding! I'll call the main boss in the morning. I will definitely be in tomorrow night.”
She said..        
“I understand, I know it wasn't a good night / day for you and I can see how things could get confused. And great, thank you very much. I hope you are doing okay, and I'll see you tomorrow.”      

Today.. I went to the hospital first thing in the morning to check on my best friend. Then, I went to go pick up my check from my first job and also apologize to the main boss for the misunderstanding. Our official pay day is Wednesday but I was asleep and never went to go pick it up.       
I get there and immediately go upstairs to see my boss and apologize..       

This f***ing a****** tells me ….      
“Oh you didn’t screw me over. You screwed your coworkers over.”        
And..
“We will let it go for now because you’re a good worker but in the future.. you need to follow the rules.”       
Again.. I don’t feel like arguing or dealing with confrontation so I just ask for my check.      

Guess what?      

“We don’t have your check. We were expecting you to come in last night so we had *** bring it to your account that you clean so you can just pick it up tonight and deposit it tomorrow morning.”      

A couple of things here..      
1. I was dealing with an emergency situation and I did what I thought was best. i.e. calling the only person I could get in touch with at 3 o’clock in the morning to let them know what was going on and that I wouldn’t be in the next night.      
2. I understand that I could have called the office to confirm that my boss spoke with his son but again, I was in a panic and wasn’t thinking clearly. Obviously, my boss DID speak with his son if he was expecting a call from me.       
3. My boss couldn’t pick up the phone to call me and ask me what was going on? To see if I’m alright? To ask if I was feeling up to coming in later that night? Apparently not.      
4. The fact that I called *** to let him know that I wouldn't be in. Yet, they still brought my check the account that I clean because ""they thought I was coming in”.      


So yea. My boss says I’m the one in the wrong but.. I just don’t think so."

The person currently in my desired role is at or past retirement age, and could leave at any moment.
I met with an internal career counselor and expressed my wish to apply for that job when it becomes vacant. She said I'm perfectly qualified for the position, and her big suggestion was for me to approach the person in the role and ask if I can help her with her duties, if she has any projects I could be a part of. 
This seemed odd to me, I don't know this person well and she could possibly take offense to the idea - like I'm rushing her out. I also wouldn't want management to think I'm not busy enough in my current role.
But I do wonder if engaging with her in some way could help me because she will likely have some sway in the hiring process.

I haven't responded because I don't have the information you need. I didn't forget, there's just nothing to relate at this moment. When there is, I will tell you.  Something came up, a particular task took longer than expected, the information or deliverable you need slid down the priority list, it could be any number of reasons why that information is late. Is that what you want to hear?

This is my own fault because I'm a project manager/consultant.  I manage teams who create things for clients. I try not to micromanage, so I'm usually following up on a client who is supposed to give us feedback and is late. I absolutely hate doing it, but sometimes clients demand a project schedule so tight that a one-day delay can throw the whole thing out. I have to make all of us miserable because of it.

Probably about 30-40% of the email I send and receive is ""following up"" and I do it because my bosses and teams make me. It's done to me because the client/contractor's boss is making them do it.

Can't we all give each other a little grace in this world? Can't we assume some positive intent when someone doesn't get back to us before the exact minute we're expecting them to? We're adults here, we know what's on our plates. I hate how we've signed ourselves up to be volunteer schedule cops."

For context, I was just recently certified by my state and local University while working with one of Walmart's subsidiaries that specialized in pack-and-pick robotics. But, unfortunately, my position was terminated due to the field testing phase ending as they go into starting their live service. Since then, I've been looking for a job where I can join into being an Automation Technician, as it's a field becoming more and more in demand due to the rise in labor shortages.  


The problem is that I thought it would be significantly easier to find a job with my adopted skillset and find a lot of companies willing to take a chance on someone with less experience in exchange for longer-lasting opportunities. But I've applied to positions all over the country on online job boards like Indeed or LinkedIn, and nothing. I'm contemplating starting to apply to stuff outside of the country, but I wouldn't be sure how to go about that.   


I guess my question is, how do I make myself more appealing to automation companies, or companies that just require a lot of automation, like heavy manufacturing or oil/gas? I'm honestly just grasping at straws as my bank account is starting to run dry, so any advice would be welcome."

They’ll be upset that I didn’t do something in a certain way that’s obvious to them even though I don’t think they explicitly stated it. It makes me feel very stupid and incompetent and it’s causing conflict when I’m not trying to.

For instance, I’m working on a project where making website edits is a big task. My manager previously had me publish smaller edits to the live website. He arranged a meeting somewhat last minute to go over larger additions different pages we’d worked on, and I didn’t realize until he told me twenty minutes before the meeting that he never wanted me to publish the larger additions to the website, and instead wanted to go over them before they went live. He was mad at me, saying he “never implied he wanted them published” and thinking I would obviously know not to post them live before the meeting with everyone. I didn’t know to ask about that; it never occurred to me. We didn’t really have a discussion about what he expected for the meeting prior.

It just feels like I keep having these instances of not meeting expectations I never knew were there in the first place, and like I’m falling into these invisible pitfalls, so I don’t really know what to do. I am mildly autistic so that might be a contributing factor.

I don’t say I was the most qualified for the position and don’t feel offended by not having been contacted but are those Ngo'’s looking for a sheep with 5 legs or those positions don’t actually exist?

 It's very confusing...

I noticed this is often ( but not always) the same Ngo'’s doing that.

Also, a lot of these positions seems similar to each of them in their requirements. I can understand a specific set of skills is demanded and it's even normal to see some repetitions but it really seems to me they actually don't know what they want or don't know what they are looking for and decided to copy /paste what the ngo competitor is looking for to match it.

That is just an assumption but because I have been looking and applying for a few months , I can clearly see a pattern with all those positions relisted that I cannot logically explain.

Any insights will be very appreciated."

Supervisor seems chill, but org seems disorganized. Good PTO, other benefits seem average. Position itself more senior than Offer B, but likely with less room for upward mobility in the org. $76k. 

Offer B: Less demanding job with more room to explore and experiment, culture seems solid, less vacation time in first year (but jumps to match Offer A in year two), but better benefits otherwise (7% 401K match, for instance, and time between Xmas and NYE company-wide reset week). $65k.

When I reapplied they rejected me. Wtf???",u/TheITMan52,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1313cgo/a_company_that_i_interviewed_with_raved_about_how/,jobs,"I was interviewed last month for a graphic design position. It started out with a phone interview with the hiring manager. They raved about how great my work was and loved the way I designed my resume. They went on and on about how they had so many applicants but I stood out and did all the right things to grab their attention. Since I live local (about 10 minutes away), that was a big plus too. We moved forward to schedule an in person interview with the social media manager. During the interview, they told me I had all the right experience for the position and loved my portfolio. We also found out we live around the same area. They wanted someone local which was a perfect fit. There were some technical questions they were asking me but they were pretty basic (ex: do you know how to use Microsoft Teams?). When the interview ended, they told me that they definitely wanted to bring me back for a second interview to meet with some of the hire ups.

After two weeks, I didn’t hear back so I followed up with them. They responded and told me that I was still in the running but they had to take a break from interviewing but would start up again that week. I didn’t give it another thought and after about a month, I figured they hired someone else. 

I found out by accident that the company posted the same job ad again about a week ago, except this time they posted it on a different job site. They posted on Ziprecruiter first and now they decided to try Indeed. I followed up again with the social media manager to find out if they were still looking for applicants. Obviously they didn’t respond but I figured I would give it a shot. I almost didn’t bother reapplying but I got a notification from indeed (It had the hiring managers name in it) saying that I should apply for their position because I have the right qualifications. I ended up reapplying just to see what would happen. Sure enough, I got a rejection letter saying they will not be moving forward with me. 

I’m pretty confused by this entire experience. I would understand if they felt I wasn’t a strong candidate but why tell me how great I am, just to reject me later? Another thing I want to explain is that the salary range was pretty large. It was a $30,000 difference which I did find odd. Usually, the salary range that companies post are within a $10,000 range. 

Here are my own thoughts as to why they passed on me: 
- I could have asked for too much money even though I gave them a salary range I was looking for from the beginning which they said was reasonable. 
- They are trying to find someone for as cheap as possible.
- Someone hire up didn’t like me for some reason even though they didn’t meet me yet. 
- They are trying to see if they can find someone better.

I really don’t get it at all. This process has been so frustrating. I was wondering if anyone else had any other insight to this that I haven’t thought of yet."

1,2023-04-27,Need Help. Do I become an estate agent or pursue something bigger like a financial analyst or sales director?,u/beatboxbrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1315g6r/need_help_do_i_become_an_estate_agent_or_pursue/,jobs,"Okay, so here goes. I live in London and will be getting an economics degree soon. I haven't started university yet and am still in college, but I still need a little career advice.

Growing up, my parents bought properties, and I basically watched them work their asses off to move from a lower-class family living in a flat in Camden to owning three houses. We now live very comfortably, but not to the extent of being classified as upper class.

So, in short, I've always had a fondness for selling. I've run a few businesses and am currently working on a few businesses at 16 years old right now. I am pursuing a career in some sort of financial analyst or something that pays well. I need a high salary because by 23-26 years old, I'm going to establish my business. Depending on how well the businesses I'm working on now go, while I'm working, I'm going to work on the business in my free time. Therefore, I'll need to find a job that pays well and has excellent hours so I get lots of free time to invest into the business. I'll quit once it's established and making me money or whatever circumstances.

This is the main motive for an economics degree. With it, I'll be getting a very above-average salary with hours that won't absolutely kill me. Thus, I'll avoid careers like investment banking or ""climbing the corporate ladder"" jobs. I'll mainly just work for a few years with a good salary as an analyst, actuary, director or something in order to fit everything perfectly.

But the problem is, I really have a huge interest in being a real estate agent. As much as they are scum of the earth, something about just selling and meeting new people every day really interests me. The businesses I've run where I've had to sell products or services to clients have really made me enjoy just being generally extroverted and doing what I was born to do: sell. I would definitely enjoy it more as I literally just drive around and show off houses. It also attracts me because you get a commission depending on how much you sell or a base salary. Since most agencies don't really provide a commission AND a salary, it's iffy for me, as the average salary is about £20,000, which isn't great for London and is TERRIBLE for someone who has an economics degree. Economists alone on average get paid about 40k as starting and upwards to 90-100k after a few years of experience, at least based on my research. Remember, I am still 16.

I have been seeing lots of freelance estate agents on Indeed under a company not running your own, and this would be perfect for me as I could work as a sales director, analyst, or whatever high-paying jobs are in the market while being my dream job, an estate agent.

I also don't want to hear the casual ""pursue what you want, pursue your dreams"" because I am. I am going to become a full-time business owner to the point where I won't have to work anymore. It's very circumstantial as the websites, services, and product businesses I am working on right now may blow up and ensure I won't have to even go to school anymore. Yet it's difficult to be getting A\*s and work on the business, thus I need to prioritize different things at different times of year.

So, the general question is, do I become an estate agent with my economics degree? Or do I pursue a better job which I will probably enjoy less?"

The pros: the people I work with are great, I get paid hourly (at 40 hrs per week I make 64k a year) so I get OT if I work over 40 hrs a week, I have a great supervisor, great team, WFH 3 days a week, great benefits, easy commute, lots of time off, lots of flexibility if I need to WFH or take time off for dr appointments etc., I have my own office. The cons: no room from growth despite the fact that I’ve taken on more responsibilities outside of my primary job functions, the pay isn’t great, I only get a 3-5% raise each year despite stellar performance reviews, I don’t feel like my work is appreciated in terms of compensation or growth opportunities.

The offer: Salaried position at a rival law firm as a Sr. Marketing Specialist. I would be making 100k a year salary but I am not sure how many hours I’d be working each week (I was told that “it depends but that work life balance is very important to my supervisor and to the team”), WFH 2 days a week but they told me I can do 3 since that is what I’m doing now. The benefits are not as good - health insurance has a higher deductible to meet, 401k is about the same. I still get plenty of time off but I’d be getting 4 less days than I currently get. Commute is the same (3 blocks from where I currently work). The team I’d be working with seems fine but more introverted (I’m very much an extrovert) but I have not met them yet. The person that would be my supervisor seems great and is extroverted like I am.  I’m not sure how flexible she is with dr. appointments and stuff but I could see her being understanding. I would basically be working with the same programs that I’m working with now so not much of a learning curve. Honestly this job would likely be easier than my current position because of how much I’ve taken on outside of my primary job functions in my current role. Seems like there could be room for growth and to supervise in the future. The firm I would be working for has been rated as a “top workplace” in my area for the 7th consecutive year and on Glassdoor they are rated higher than my current firm (4.2 vs 3.3 for my current firm)."

A little about me - I have a BA in Studio Art because that's what I did well enough at the time to be able to graduate and get decent grades. I have no certs. Guess I sorta fell into the trap of ""go to school and get any degree and your chances will be much better out there."" I graduated back in 2016, and my lack of success with my last degree is prob the #1 reason I've not returned to any kind of school since. I left my last degree-related job almost 1.5 yrs ago, and haven't worked anything stable since. It was a near minimum wage job, which is a theme in that industry.

My resume is all over the place and kinda just shows I've worked odd jobs. Decent experience, but pretty random and mostly just customer service type stuff.

I'm so done working dead end jobs that don't pay a livable wage. It's time I build a sustainable long term career, where I can develop skills that are in high demand. I've allowed these jobs to trick me into thinking I'm going anywhere for too long now.

I've been interviewing for entry level jobs that mostly have a customer service element to them, because otherwise I don't qualify for anything, but I know I don't want to do that in the long term. Either way, I get no offers lol. The closest I am to an offer is a Temp Clerk position with a healthcare company and it's like 17/hr 😂  I'm aware it's a tough job market, whatever that means.

Is it a good time to learn a trade? Do I work just any job while getting training/certification in something? Do I need to be working on a new degree? Is there some boot camp everyone's been doing that flew right over my head?

I just don't know what to do or where to go. I'm an educated 30 yr old and I've never had a permanent job that pays more than 17/hr. I think there's something wrong there. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

So I left the office to walk around another part of San Francisco and I saw a ton of people walking, jogging, or cycling for fun and most of the people looked like young adult age. I am really jealous of their lives and jealous of this wonderful day I have off.  Where do people get the time to jog on the weekdays? San Francisco was still full of these people at 7:00 AM. When I am at work, my Eufy camera (at my grandparents' house where I live) keep going off. because somebody is walking by and triggers the motion detection. Some of the people walking on my block every morning do not look old enough for retirement. In fact the young guy next door to me in his early 20s walks his dog during the weekday, because he works in his father's construction business where they do the labor from home and he will be taking over his father's job when he retires, making him self employed.

Now I am home writing on Reddit and applying for remote jobs so I can have a better life and I even dream of opening a small vegan farm in a cheaper state on the East Coast and live in a semi-rural area. My job in immigration law is something I like to do, but I am incredibly overworked and drained due to everyone else in my team besides me and one woman being either dumb or not wanting to do a good portion of work. It is very soul sucking to be in that office all day and the commute from the East Bay to San Francisco every day is not the best. I am really jealous of all the people enjoying their lives today in SF even in the morning. I can't imagine where they get the time. The American Dream of working of a white collared job 9 to 5 (actually 7 to 5 for me due to unpaid labor i have to do to get caught up) is not for everyone, so I think owning a farm would be great for me as long as it is not too back breaking."

I’m beginning the process of searching for rentals/properties to buy. I would like to have a job before I leave but,  timetables being what they are, I may wind up living off savings for a while. Unless, of course, that effects the rental/sale process. 

I have worked in a few different industries and have great references to back them up. I’ve done food processing maintenance (including welding fabrication, plumbing, high and low voltage install and diagnosis). I’ve been doing carpentry professionally and for pleasure for 20 years. I’ve made custom furniture, hung crown and T&G ceilings, and run a 6-axis CNC machine. I worked in health care as a telemetry technician. I have worked in management and I currently work in sales, selling building materials. I wouldn’t mind working in a kitchen or as a bar tender. I don’t think anything is beneath me. Coffee barista sounds fun. I’d happily work a couple jobs until my dream job came along.  

Sorry for the long explanation… all this considered, what would you do if you somehow had secured a condo near 5 points, didn’t have a job lined up but had various skills to rely on, and openly acknowledge this move is partly in efforts to “find yourself” so the mystery is both the excitement and the point. 

What’s would you do? Is there a place you would start that you know you could get onboarded quickly? I have about 6 months  “safety net” after first/last/security (if renting). Would that change your intentions? Would you dabble in trades to find a perfect fit? Spend time networking?

I took a contract job last year with the verbal understanding that budget had been approved to convert the position. This was not the case and they hired contractors solely because they didn't have budget approval. I was strung along with false hope until near the end of the project when my supervisor bomshelled me by telling me they never had any intention of converting me. Needless to say, I was (and still am) pissed about the situation.

I kept my head up and didn't let my work output decrease at all and took the highroad. My supervisor threw me virtual goodbye parties (I didn't care and didn't want them). Even though externally I was happy, internally I was mad upset and felt cheated. To top it all off, they worked me especially hard till the end of my contract and even had me training their full time employees. I did not burn any bridges on the way out though and even sent a ""thanks for letting me work here"" e-mail.

Now that I am out though, I feel overwhelmingly negative about the whole experience, given that i'm now unemployed after a 7 month contract job. To make matters worse, I was laid off last year too, so this is two job losses within 12 months.

Since losing my job, I have done some certifications, yet my ex coworkers insist on liking everything I post on LinkedIn. It really annoys me. I don't like them. I don't want to interact with them. I want to just totally pretend this whole experience never happened (yet can't publicly say that). I wish I could just block them and never see them again.

Is it really that bad to block folks on LinkedIn or burn bridges with people you don't give an f about?"

I get a request within our CRM software from another department to make changes to a customers account, I make those changes, and I move on to the next request. 

Now, obviously there are a lot of rules to follow to figure out if the changes can be done in the first place and different types of requests require totally different steps to make the changes. I might do things like create invoices or credit memos, process payments or refunds, and generate orders for fulfillment as well as make the actual changes behind the scenes to the customers account. 

I really like the actual nature of the job — it’s very straightforward, processing work and I don’t have to talk to any customers or do much multitasking. But the trouble is my current company has zero growth potential within my department and I really need to start making more money. Prior to this I was in Admin Assistant roles and that did NOT suit me at all. 

My question is what other job titles or roles have this same kind of concept as my current job? My company calls me a ‘Billing Specialist’ but any time I look that up I get medical billing or more financial type roles."

I have been looking to move jobs and about a month ago put in some calls to my surrounding business network. One of the people I contacted was very helpful and said to message them should I need anything and their network is my network sort of thing. They also mentioned I should speak to one member of their team and actually wanted to hold off on introducing me to people at other companies until we had spoken. 

Did the call with their colleague who told me they were hiring and spent the majority of the call selling the company to me, how they work and are flexible to people’s goals etc. I come from a part of the industry adjacent to theirs and possess a lot of expert knowledge they don’t have but would be helpful as they grow their team. They said speaking to me was really interesting and gave them a lot to think about, and asked me if I wouldn’t mind pitching to them the following week to see how I would handle that part of the job. I said of course. Pitch came around and they said they were pleasantly surprised with how well I did etc. Of course had some notes which was expected but was generally complimentary and impressed. Asked me to send the pitch through on email and that they would follow up with feedback and next steps in email. 

This is where I’m now a bit worried. There was a long weekend but I didn’t hear for 2 business days after that to my email with the pitch, so followed up just checking that they received it. They then replied to that and said they had no service over the weekend, reiterated the feedback I had in the pitch in the email and then asked for a call to “discuss the feedback in more detail.” 

What does this mean!!! Am I getting rejected and the phone call is just a courtesy because of our pre-existing relationship? Or can I expect an offer and assume that the whole pitch and initial call were really just formalities and they were interested in hiring me all along? Sorry for reading so much into this I just really would love the offer and waiting until after the weekend (our call is scheduled almost a week away) feels weird to me. If they wanted to offer me the job wouldn’t they want to speak ASAP?!"

1,2023-04-27,I’m hesitant to work at a place that has a ton of red flags but I’m desperate for an income. Any advice?,u/-tiredeyes-,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/131eqpy/im_hesitant_to_work_at_a_place_that_has_a_ton_of/,jobs,"(Sorry if this is really long or isn’t allowed here.)

For some background, I’ve been searching for a job for about 5 months now and haven’t had a lot of luck. I’ve done some interviews but no offers.

Last week I applied for an administrative assistant position at a cabinet warehouse. Literally like 20 mins after I applied online I got a phone call from the hiring manager asking to have an in person interview the following week and I agreed. After the call I took the time check out Glassdoor and indeed to see what former employees had to say. The reviews were not good. There were lots of complaints about the owner and how he tries to put down and intimidate his employees. Employees who design or install get paid by commission and hardly make a living. Benefits are only offered to office staff and full time employees. The biggest upsides I saw were that the schedule is super flexible and the work is easy. 

I had the interview 2 days ago and it was the worst interview I’ve ever had. I was interviewed by the hiring manger first and she was generally nice. But when I asked her how PTO and benefits worked there she wasn’t even totally sure what benefits I would get. Then I was interviewed by the owner and that was when I really didn’t feel like I want this job.

The owner was super hostile and I could clearly tell he was trying to intimidate me by his tone and acting like he was uninterested in talking to me. When he sat down he immediately asked me why I was wearing a face mask. I told him it was because I have immune compromise family members and I try to keep myself safe for them as best as I can. He scoffed but was like “I don’t judge”. Then he was quick to tell me that my time as a contractor wasn’t a real job. His tone during the interview was so condescending and it felt like he was trying to talk to me like I was a little kid. He asked me what I wanted to be when I’m a grown up as if I’m not a whole grown up right now. I wouldn’t have had an issue with the question if he didn’t talk to me like I was a child or if he asked me where I saw myself in five years or something. 

The kicker was when I asked him what his relationship with his employees is like as he is the owner. I could tell he didn’t like this question because he just stared at me for a good 10 seconds with a “you’ve got to be kidding me” expression. Like he was upset I had the audacity to ask him that. All he said was that he respects employees if they respect him and that he’s not much of a yeller, but that he will get on top of people who aren’t doing something right. That might not sound so bad, but considering so many former employees have said the owner is abusive and makes working there draining it just raised so many red flags. Then he said they would give me a call by Friday (tomorrow) with a potential offer. 

I walked out of that interview so annoyed and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like I just walked through a field of red flags but my dilemma is that I really need money. I’m trying to move out as soon as I can and live independently but I’m not sure if I’m totally willing to work there at the expense of my own mental well-being. I know it’s not even a for sure thing yet but I’m just going into this assuming they’ll hire me because so many people have quit there in the past few months.

I’ve never had a traditional, base salary job and I’m well aware that not all jobs will be great and they’re just temporary, but I don’t know how long I would last there and I would preferably want to have a new job lined up after if I do quit. But considering the job market isn’t looking too great right now, I probably wouldn’t have a job lined up for a long while. 

Any advice on how I should go about  this? I’m happy to answer any other questions as welll. Thanks in advance!

EDIT UPDATE:

Thank you for the advice! Turns out he hated me so much that I didn’t get the offer, so that saves me the trouble of having to decide if I’m willing to work somewhere that would mentally drain me or not. But I’m still unemployed so I still lose."

However, in the first interview, the recruiter mentioned that he wanted someone to enjoy doing the work and doesn’t want a lazy person who just clocks in and clocks out and treats it as a 9-5 job.

Should I just withdraw from the job posting rather than getting a rejection email? In my opinion, I felt disrespected and insulted because of this… Although I can take plenty of hits, the job workplace culture seemed toxic, especially because it’s just 2 employees the head of the department and a regular security analyst."

1,2023-04-27,Former boss lying to prospective employers and costing me job opportunities.,u/spookyhabzar,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/131gdnt/former_boss_lying_to_prospective_employers_and/,jobs,"Up until about a week ago I had a great relationship with my recent employer. It was a small company with no HR (only the boss). About a month ago I let them know I was going to apply for new jobs as that position lacked the hours I needed. That position could be adjusted to where I could still work for him around the new job schedule. The boss gave me his blessing and was happy for me. I have proof of him praising my job performance and how happy he was with me as an employee. 

However, about a week ago I had to end an unrelated arrangement with this boss  when I learned that he was asking me to commit fraud with funding from the SBA. He fired me from my position in his company which honestly I was fine with. Needless to say, he is very angry with me. 

Unfortunately now the jobs I applied for a month ago are now calling him for references and he has been flat out lying to these companies about me and my work performance. He’s doing this via “implying” that “I’m not saying that OP does this but I wouldn’t hire a person who…” I know for a fact that he has cost me at least two job offers.  I found out when I had a friend call pretending to be an employer. I live in a VERY rural area without a lot of opportunities. I know he’s basically gotten me blackballed from one of the few places I could work in my field (county hospital). 

I’ve been selected for a position with a state agency and I have no idea if they have contacted my former boss yet. I’m terrified he will cost me this position too. Should I send the HR rep an email to get ahead of this? Also what on Earth can I do about my former employer? 

Obviously I haven’t used my old boss as a reference for newer applications but there aren’t a lot of job opportunities around here."

Or is it just a bad plan altogether?

It was pretty chill and more relaxed than I was expecting other than 1 or 2 generic interview questions.

I think it went relatively well but I still haven’t heard anything back. In the first round the manager said that she’d come back to me asap whether I got the job or not, and after a couple days she did. However this time it’s been a week and heard nothing either way.

I took them through step by step an aspect of my role and then clarified at the end of the interview. 

I've been perpetually unemployed since I've worked mainly contracts and I'm sick and tired of this job hunting business. I feel like I'll never get work, and my family is struggling financially so much as am I. I'm getting to the point where I won't be able to afford my bills. And yes I am trying for both contract and permanent roles. Applying for almost 15 roles a day. Every career coach and mentor I speak to seems impressed and says I'm doing nothing wrong. It doesn't help. 

I think I need to lower my expectations and just take a salary hit or another job like admin instead of change/project manager. I thought it'd be easy since I smashed targets in one of last roles by 60%+. Boy was I wrong.

I'm unsure of what type of job to search for as the same type of title seems to just vary wildly in what the actual role and responsibilities are.

I am currently a Business Tech Consultant, I've previously worked as a Business Analyst and Operations Analyst.

To quickly sum up my current role, I do requirements gathering and write user stories, I write functional specs, I log defects for our clients, then I can make configuration changes to the software and test my own fixes.  Code fixes go to the devs, I am not a dev, but I do my own code review when debugging to help with reporting it.

I just find that searching for my current or past titles gives jobs that are just way, way different from what I have done.  For example, Business Analyst jobs are more focused on BI tools, but I have never previously used them even in my BA position.  I figure I should be looking at some type of consultant / analyst position but I am unsure on how to further narrow it down.  Any advice?"

I started a new role on Monday after searching for a job for a while. I accepted my offer, and the following week I received a first stage interview (my notice was 4 weeks). I didn’t hear anything from the second interview until today, where they have offered me a face to face interview. 

I’m not worried so much about the ‘ethics’ of taking the interview and potentially the role should I be successful, the job is a dream for me and it’s something I would love to do after a few unhappy roles. My worry is how to conduct myself in the interview having only been in my current role for a week. 

Do I talk as if my current employer is the role I’ve just left, or do I tell the truth and say I’ve started this role this week. Do I say I accepted as I didn’t think I was successful during my interview, do I say I’d accepted before I interviewed or do I just not mention it?

I'm currently working from home in a hybrid mode, which allows me the flexibility to take days off when I'm not feeling up to going to the office. While this arrangement has been beneficial in many ways, I've found myself missing out on office celebrations and get-togethers. It's a strange mix of emotions - on one hand, I appreciate the chance to rest and take care of myself, but on the other hand, I can't help but feel lonely and disconnected from my colleagues.

I also deal with clinical anxiety & other issues for which I'm on meds, my psychiatrist recently advised me to take a week off to focus on my well-being and visit the gym, but the reality of being away from work and social interactions has left me feeling isolated. I'm torn between needing time for self-care and wanting to be a part of the office camaraderie, 

It's just tough to find the right balance between taking care of myself and staying connected to my colleagues. I can't help but wonder if I'm making the right choices, or if I'm just missing out on important moments that could strengthen my relationships at work.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice on how to cope with these feelings, I'd really appreciate hearing from you.

I mentioned in my previous post that I have been laid off. I have spent time thinking about stuff, and I think I want to have a career change - from market research to software development. I am prepared to spend several months learning new skills and equipping myself for a job in software engineering. (I know that would be something that would demand a lot of my time and energy, and I am prepared to dedicate myself to that kind of work. I know it’s not just a question of signing up to a bootcamp and then suddenly understanding stuff - I am prepared to learn).  The qualifications I have from uni - I *have* them, but I don’t feel like I *own* them. They just don’t interest me, I don’t want to work in those fields.

In all honesty, I’ve been looking to start doing this for a while. I would think to myself, “I really want to learn how to code, I want to challenge myself and have more fun”. But I never had the… reason? The push? But now I do have it. And I want to get started.

How long of an employment gap is too long in this case, if you’ve spent it learning new stuff and making yourself more employable? How would you explain it, and how would you avoid just being filtered out?"

For a bit of context - I did my undergrad in finance and have an MBA. I was, unfortunately, impacted by all of the recent tech layoffs and am now getting back into the job search after taking some time off.

After taking that time off and starting job apps again, I've started to realize that most of my corporate jobs up to this point have been ""not real jobs."" I've always been a high performer in any of my jobs and got great reviews, but I don't think any of them actually created any value. It's always one of the following:

1. Performing analyses to tell higher-ups things they already know
2. Making pretty charts and presentations to try and push initiatives that I know will just get lost in committees and abandoned a few months later
3. Writing endless emails to tell one department what another department is doing (or more likely not doing)
4. Attending pointless meetings where everyone just says lots of words without actually saying anything - in an effort to ""keep the conversation moving""

It's like I'm just playing games. People tell me I'm doing a great job, but what am I ACTUALLY doing? I feel like my last few jobs (strategy/partnerships etc.) were completely pointless, and I don't understand why companies even insist on creating these positions.

Now that I'm back on the job hunt, I just want to shut my computer and throw it across the room every time I read a job description that fits my resume. Everything I'm qualified for just looks like more of the same. I know that I eventually want to start my own business down the road, but I need income in the meantime. 

I recognize that this is very ""first-world problems"" and that I'm in a privileged position, but I still feel like I need to rant. TBH I'm not sure what I'm even asking here - I guess I just wanted to see if any others have had similar experience."

Now there is another one, they were like ""if anyone can't make it, say something now"". I didn't say anything... They want to eat together, activities like laser tag, etc. I'm just not interested in any of these activities to begin with. I am on the extreme end of anti-social.

What do you guys do in these situations, I can't say what I'm really doing because I'm building a startup that takes all my time. And obviously very odd if you can't make it to a single event.

I have great references, but I just don't know what the ethics of this is. My thought is that if someone can do the job without heavy supervision, I don't see why there needs to be heavy supervision as a requirement for taking the job.

I interviewed last Thursday, and had not heard back on my follow ups. I received an offer for this position about an hour ago and I am very excited! The pay is the same as my last position that I was let go from, and benefits are less costly, all while getting to help these people! Don’t be afraid to look outside of your normal career path, you might find something that excites you even more!"

It's been seven years of medical tests (including two bone marrow biopsies- ouch!) and basically keeping away from people to ensure I didn't catch anything that could make me seriously ill or kill me. ***Finally***, I'm doing better. Not perfect, but better. 

After years of living off my mother's kindness (didn't qualify for any kind of disability), I decided it with guidance from my doctor) that I would be ok to go back to work.

So I made my first application the other day to Target. Before I was diagnosed, I had extensive experience in customer service. Huge amounts. Like every job I ever did. Even though I haven't worked for several years, I still consider myself extremely capable and a fast learner. 

But nope, Target rejected me. I didn't even get an interview.There was no reason given for why I was rejected, which is frustrating too because I'm not sure what I did wrong. I can only assume it's due to the gap in employment. I am so frustrated right now, and afraid to even bother applying anywhere else. 

How do I get past the fact that I haven't worked in years, especially when there was no opportunity for me to explain why in the application?

I want to cry right now. I know I can do a job and be good at it. Hell, I didn't even want full time. I wanted to start out part time. I even listed my availability for weekends, as I figured that's when I would be needed most. 

And I can't even get a job at Target. Fucking Target. How am I ever supposed to get back on my feet if I can't get anyone to give me a chance????

Just trying to satiate my curiosity here, but consultants and contractees of Reddit - what's your billable rate to pay ratio like?

I was reviewing some project timeline for our quarters, and while I typically ignore PM documentation and accounting, and focus purely on the engineering -  I did catch a glimpse of my billable rate to the customer and internal projects. It's seems absurdly high - IE, near 5x my TC. Wow. Like it's nearly an 80% margin.

Is this typical? Am I underpaid? Is my company overcharging?

I do work a very niche and specialized type of Engineering, but still, seems bonkers to me. So I wanted to get some perspective.

I saw a job post for a creative director for a computational biology company. Really, really niche. They wanted someone with 15+ years experience who had built a department at a startup.

Great timing! I was a creative director with 30 years of experience. I had just finished building internal creative departments from scratch at TWO different startups. I checked every single box on their job posting... PLUS!... I have worked in science labs before. I knew their target audience. I had done advertising for many bio tech clients including some of the biggest names in the industry... PLUS!... my brother and sister-in-law both had master's degrees in computational biology and work for a computational biology company!  I likely had more experience than anyone in the country.

Did I waste my time? Absolutely not. During my months of job hunting, I practiced and honed the skills that impressed the recruiter when it mattered. 

I had to respond to that initial message on LinkedIn, and all the practice emailing potential employers helped me feel very comfortable. Then, they asked me to introduce myself to their recruiting department, so that's when my practice with cover letters came in handy. They then requested another short essay from me, explaining why I'm a great fit for their company. More cover letter and email writing experience came to the rescue. A phone interview? Done that. A really tough skills test? Good thing I had taken a bunch of those recently. A final Zoom call? Not the first time I had done one of those either.

But I think the most important thing I gained from this job hunting experience was self-confidence.

I had to think of of so many ways to express how great I am to potential employers. Of all the things I have done, can do, and can offer employers. It wasn't until I started really digging in that I realized what a great catch I am.

And you know what? All of us are great catches. You! You reading this right now, you're a fantastic employee. And when you learn how to communicate that effectively, you will land the job you want.

So every time you fill out an application that asks for your top five skills or your long-term career goals, or asks a tough question that makes you work hard to answer and sound good, save that shit. Open up a Word file, copy down that wonderful thing you wrote before you finish the application, and keep it for future reference.

You will end up with a great list of skills, qualifications, experiences, and personal attributes that you can brag about and showcase. And when that big interview comes around, even if you're nervous to the core, you'll still know what a great employee you will be. And it will show. 

Good luck everyone!"

All of them require training videos during onboarding which could be anywhere from 10-30 hours. Every place I’ve worked at either has us watch them on site, which we are obviously paid for hourly until they are completed, or at home, which we are also paid for. My other company had me watch 28 hours of video and I was paid 28 hours. This new company had me watch a bunch of training videos on my own time at home, which came to an “estimated time” of 26 hours and 5 mins. Granted, I probably didn’t spend exactly 26 hours on them, but it still took me several days to complete. So I get my first direct deposit today, and can tell right away that I wasn’t compensated for the hours spent on training videos. I reach out to HR and she notifies me that the company only pays for 4 hours for the training videos. Is this illegal? Like I said it probably was not 26 hours, but it was WAY more than 4.

Email is very vague and I cannot gauge whether or not I’m the one receiving the offer or if I’m the second choice. “Early next week” comes and goes again (second time the given deadline passes) and after a week of waiting I emailed asking for an update. His response being

220,2023-04-28,I got the job!,u/OpportunityGlum,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13274t8/i_got_the_job/,jobs,"I had recently posted here a really embarrassing interview experience. The link: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12lcme7/interview_embarassment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

19 days later, I got the job! I could not believe it! I'm grateful for everyone who commented there with their stories and supportive comments, some of them really got me tearin' up. I tend to be quite hard on myself sometimes and when you guys said that I did good and that you're proud of me, it really meant a lot. I hope all of you are blessed with amazing opportunities in the future.

Lessons I learned:
1. Never be afraid to shoot your shot. Even if the job description says you require a certain number of years as experience, if you think you could do the tasks in the job description, apply for it. Prepare the best way you can and go for it.
2. Never stop applying. I was quite over-confident when I started getting calls for interviews, and never really thought of rejection as a scenario. I guess I was a naive 24 year old entering the job market, but never let any interview no matter how good they might be, get to your head. I gave the best interview prior to this one for an internship and when they rejected me, it broke me. It took 3 days to begin my applications again.
3. Smile and look more approachable. If you get called for the interview, you have gotten your foot through the door. Don't think you might be a filler candidate because they've called you even with you not satisfying all those qualifications and requirements they've stated in the job description. If they call you, do your best, dress your best and keep grinding.
4. The Companies Expert channel on youtube really helped me prepare and learn for some general interview questions. I also had chatgpt for help since I use it to make my cover letter and resume for every job I apply to.

Since, I never really had much hopes for this, I had followed up with the HR two weeks later to know the status, and they told me that they had moved on to another candidate. I proceeded with my applications once again, when the head HR called me one fine morning 5 days later and left me a voicemail with the update. The head HR apparently was shocked to know that his colleague had told me that they had moved on. This also kind of gives me an ego boost I guess, to know that I was their first choice.

Hello Reddit! Probably a common question here, but the ones I've read about don't really apply for my case and I'm getting rather desperate so hope you all don't mind me shooting my shot. Just graduated from HighSchool and took a gap year, moved to a new country and finally got a working permit that'll allow me to find a job. However, when writing my resume and seeing the entry level jobs that are fit for my language level in the country require work experience for simple jobs like cleaning dishes or service has been giving me a tough time looking for a job that could even suit me. Don't know what to write on my resume for a guy simply looking for a summer job before I start university and am pretty stumped when writing something for the ""experience"" sector in my resume. Any help would be appreciated!"

1,2023-04-28,Manager assigned work that is way too difficult for me. How do I handle this?,u/perkyplums,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1327wc6/manager_assigned_work_that_is_way_too_difficult/,jobs,"Hello,

I am in a rotational program (basically a post-grad full-time intern) for a large company. I just started less than 3 weeks ago and its my first job ever. Because of the nature of the program, I was placed in an area that I have almost ZERO knowledge about and I literally have no clue what people are talking about or doing at the moment, which I chuck up to being brand new and coming in with no base knowledge. I haven’t gotten much work besides shadowing meetings and small tasks - which is fine.

However, last week my manager really seemed to want to give me work and she gave me a task that, at first seemed easy, but ended up being VERY difficult. The task is very hard to do without much knowledge of the business or even knowledge of what to look for. I have asked a few coworkers on my team and they all seemed to agree the task she gave me is a hard one, even for them. They are trying to help me and reassure me that it is a very difficult task and I shouldn’t feel bad, but its hard and I can barely understand them when they are trying to help me.

It’s my first job ever and I really want to succeed and be a good employee, but this first task has been so difficult for me and I have cried multiple times very stressed I won’t be able to complete what she is looking for. She also asked me to present what I did to a lot of VPs in our org and that’s putting the cherry on top of my stress sundae. She had acknowledged its a hard task and she doesn’t expect me to be an expert - but I can’t even seem to grasp the assignment enough to even talk about it correctly. She has been off most of this week so I havent been able to get time with her and the little time I did have to try and clarify what she wanted she was still pretty broad and had the “idk whats useful info, thats why I asked you to do it” attitude.

I considered bringing this up to my program manager (my manager who is in charge of my experience in the rotational program) but I don’t want to come off as complaining.

Any advice? I’m so down and feeling very defeated at this point. She wants it done in 3 days and I’m not anywhere close.

Tl;dr My manager gave me my first work assifnment and it’s way too difficult for me as a new graduate intern with no background experience. Even seasoned coworkers admit it would be hard even for them. I’m expected to present to VPs in our org. I’m so stressed and scared to fail. How do I navigate this?"

We were supposed to find a place for our On Job Training, I had found a dealership where I liked everyone that worked there, the work to do, and enjoyed the company’s dedication to producing well manufactured cars. They were busy at the time expanding their shop and when I sent them an email to follow up, they missed it and I took that as they didn’t want me.

Months later I was forced to find another place for my OJT, found one, all is good right? Well the service manager from the first dealership emailed me the first day after first day of OJT asking me where I was and how they never recieved anything from the school yet about me. I had told them that I gave his card to my teacher and told my teacher over and over again to call them. He did not call them leaving both them and I in the dark. After a few email and getting on the same page as eachother he said something to me and that’s what I’m asking:

“Once you are on the market for a job do reach out to me”

Getting that email made me so happy, because I was so upset I never got to do my OJT there. However, does it sound like genuine interest or just politely saying no? I have a really hard time understanding wether things people say are literal or only polite. I have 2 weeks left to my on job training at the second dealership and plan on emailing the service manager to the first dealership when I go back to school to see if they have any advice or guidance for me when I take my block. I will be taking it on June 13th. Am I anxious for no reason?"

I have been happily employed since August 2009 after graduating with a bachelors of chemistry. I have worked in my technical laboratory field for almost 14 years now. In this time I have gotten an MBA and am considered an expert in my field. Things have unfortunately gotten stagnant and there are not many promotion opportunities as I am at the top of my department in terms of pay grade and even authority during management audits and walkabout between linked departments. Management has stopped listening to my requests for promotions and career improvements. I am always passed over each promotion wave. 

Lately I have been getting scrutinised and felt lots of hostility. In July last year, I was accused of not following company rules and was given a first warning because I followed an instruction to stop overtime attendances of employees. My manager was removed from her position since it was her decision which led to my issue last year. A new manager was brought in with not that much experience and it’s been a night mare since then to explain and update her on work. She doesn’t have much patience and loses her temper a lot.

Fast forward to December 2022 and I have given a low performance rating to an employee who is regularly late and absent. He raised a grievience because he felt the rating was not fair and was granted that approval because I didn’t take him to HR for counselling. However I have sent him emails and also mentioned it in his review, and verbally discussed many times. This week I was given a warning for failure to comply with company policies.   This is because I have given an unfair rating. 

I am in the process of submitting an appeal but I’m not sure if it will succeed. 

I appreciate any advice because I am not happy at work anymore. One more thing is that I am a minority group and not married, I have no big connections and reached where I am due to high educational qualifications and extremely strong work ethics and achievements. Other employees have caused millions in losses, just  two weeks ago wrong production data affected operations in another department which has 4 supervisors and 29 employees. Not a single warning was given. In my case I have zero supervisors and I also work in two site locations with 30 employees. I am pretty much a one man show. I have never had a disciplinary issue until last year. Now I worry they are targeting me and are trying to force me out.

Just to add, I have applied with no luck to many jobs since last year. However I was accepted to study a masters in artificial intelligence full time for one year which can boost my career options. Not sure whether to accept it but I’m interested."

I feel like there must be some secret answers they must be looking for - does anyone have a guide or know how on which answers are the best? I was rejected from the Target position (they just said something vague like we have no positions that match your preference) and I'm nervous about how to answer the USPS one now. The questions seem almost identical so it makes me wonder if someone has already ""cracked the code"" on how you're supposed to answer them."

She wishes she would have started looking when she was placed on a PIP but thought that she could work through it with her ex boss.

What can she say to prospective employers about her departure from that job other than ""I was terminated"". She can't really say that she was laid off because lay offs of that nature would be well known in the local healthcare community.

My wife and I go out for dinner and I come back to some meanness in the comments. So...in response to the overly cynical and impatient person in the comments. I guess in this person's view, healthcare is immune to interpersonal conflicts and inappropriate behavior of management.

\#1 My wife worked for this hospital for 4 years and had no issues until the end of last summer when she (a sexual assault survivor) finally got up the courage to tell her touchy feely boss that she didn't like to be constantly touched, hugged, and sometimes forcibly hugged because her boss felt like she needed it. If her boss was a man, it would have been an open and shut case of sexual harassment and hostile work environment. She thought it was unreasonable to even address it with her boss until I pointed out that if it was a man that we'd be having an entirely different conversation. 

\#2 Nothing in her PIP or write ups had anything to do with her clinical skills or the nursing care that she provided. So your statement about how a nurse in her situation should never be providing care to patients is just downright ignorant and hateful.

\#3 Her write ups mainly consisted of things like a patient who literally complained about every single staff member but somehow my wife was the only one that was written up miraculously. If you work in healthcare, you know the kind of patients I'm talking about. Most of the time, the complaints were refuted by other employees, charge nurses and house supervisors but that didn't stop her boss from writing her up.

\#4 The best write up was when she was in the room with a patient in restraints and had removed the restraints prior to the time they were due to be checked and charted on, wrote a detailed narrative note during the patient interaction and then was written up for finalizing her note 6 minutes after the restraints were due to be charted on. Now for those of you who don't work in healthcare, restraints are something that require a lot of documentation, and that documentation needs to be timely. But my wife documented all of the times and checks appropriately in her narrative note, and then was written up because she saved the note 8:06pm and not at 8:00pm."

Tell me if this is the same at your company, but everywhere I worked managers hardly ever work. They’re there mostly for strategic decisions, they do not do any actual work, they leave work early and hardly check their emails. I work as a data analyst and my manager doesn’t write a single line of code! 

From where I’m standing, front-end employees do all the work, stay overtime and are way more stressed and exhausted. Managers just clock in, give orders and leave. 

I know they’re valuable and their experience gives them the advantage of knowing the strategic decisions to take, but they do not “work” (as in, open the laptop and work and make deliverables) I would muchhhhh rather be a manager because it will give me free time to actually live my life than slave away as a front end worker

That same Monday, about 2 hours later, I had an interview with another company for a similar role. Got along GREAT with the owners, really liked them, they liked me. I did not mention the firing because I didn’t have enough time to process things. I made it seem I was still working there. 

Company invited me back for a 2nd round for next week. This time it is with who would be my my direct boss. After that I’d probably be hired if he liked me too. 

This is a very small company, probably about a dozen employees. I do not really think they are going to run a background check on me, especially for the job I’m being hired for (it’s a basic driving job). 

What do I do? Do I mention the firing? Do I just continue on like I’m working there still?

Any advice appreciated."

So 2 months ago I was let go from a startup company. Upon being let I was able to become self employed and make a good living. I planned to then move out of the city at the end of month. About 3 weeks after I was let go I went to a coffee shop next to my office and as I walked out I ran into my old co worker. I smiled, said hi, asked how she is liking her role and then went about my day. The whole interaction lasted about 2 minutes. The next day she blocked me on all social media and I received an email from my direct manager (my manager works remotely) saying that he heard I was moving to a new city and it was the city he lived and and asked to meet up with me for coffee. I ignored this email as I did not leave in good terms with him and I felt uncomfortable that he found out where I was moving too when I never disclosed that information to him. 

Fast forward 2 months later I had moved out of the city and I returned for a weekend to the old city I used to work at to hang out with my friends in the city. I went to the same coffee shop nearby my office and got a drink and left. I did not see any co workers. About 1 hour later I got a call from the CEO of the company on my personal cell stating that he got reports from my co workers that I have been coming to the office and make the employees uncomfortable. He said he gave the police my information for harassment to arrest me if I am seen nearby the office.

I was very angry as they have been reaching out to me via email and phone and they do not own the city or the stores around it. On top of that I no longer live in that city so when that call was given to me. I want to take legal action for false accusations but I am unsure as to how to move forward regarding this."

I’ve been working at my management job about 7 years since one of my good friends, who is one of two partners owning the company, hired me from outside the industry to fill her assistant role and to do me a favor because I had been down on my luck hopping between shitty jobs for a while before that. 

In that time I’ve grown from her assistant to a senior manager in the company with assistants of my own. I’ve never had a career before and I really have to thank her for putting me in this path. 

The downside is that this company is a small business who has always slightly underpaid me for the role. Especially since I’ve been making big title changes but the salary increases have not been commensurate. I’m getting by, but I’m not saving or building a future for myself. At an age where I should already be well on my way. 

That being said she’s still my friend and she gives me a lot of work life balance to deal with my chronic medical issues. Our friendship isn’t as strong as years ago but we still go on vacation together etc. 

My dilemma is I’ve just been offered at 25% pay increase to work at a competitor. One who has poached other managers from her before. 

I don’t get along with the other partner and I am pretty sure I’m going to take he new job. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to best address this with my friend and boss? I’m not naive enough to think this won’t affect our relationship but I want to earn what I know I’m worth."

0,2023-04-28,Please tell me why my bosses are assigning me trivial busy work that has nothing to do w my job and insist I stay 8 hours. Are they trying to make me quit?,u/HomocidalTaco,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/132dbs5/please_tell_me_why_my_bosses_are_assigning_me/,jobs,"I’ve worked at my job over a year. Approaching a year and a half. A year ago when working here, I’d get sent to job sites and be assigned actual tasks related to my job. I work at an IICRC company. 

But for the past I don’t even know how many months, my bosses, but mainly my project manager, no longer assigns me actual tasks related to the job and no longer sends me out into the field. He makes me stay at the main building and tells me to do utter pointless tasks like picking up trash in the grass outside, wiping down tables (that only takes like 5 minutes tops), cleaning the bathrooms, organizing chemicals on the shelf?? (What a fucking waste of time), and so on. I don’t complain and just do it. At first I didn’t think too much of it but at this point, it’s been a good 4 months that this has been going on, and I’m convinced that he is trying to drive me to quit. This is no where on my job description and I feel like I’m just being assigned trivial “busy work”, meanwhile he is sending basically everyone else, including new ass people, out to jobs. I’m the only one who is not given anything LONG TERM. 

I asked him why I don’t get sent out places anymore and he said “we have enough people to do them”. 

I’m still making the same amount of money doing this trivial stuff versus the more labor intensive stuff. So I guess I should be grateful for that? But I can’t help but feel like they’re either trying to find a reason to fire me, or trying to drive me to quit. 

I almost forgot to mention that a good 30-40% of the time when I show up to work and ask what my assignment is, I get told to just do whatever I want, or get told “you know what to do, you know what needs to be done. Do whatever you need to do.” I just get brushed off. I feel useless and unimportant working here these days. 

Also need to mention that my bosses always urge me to stay a full 8 hours. When I tell them I’m running out of stuff to do, they continue to press on me to think of things. I have no idea why they insist that I stay a full 8 hours basically doing nothing. I’m seriously considering quitting if things don’t change. The only reason I can think of why they are doing this is because I don’t get along with the coworkers that well so they might be trying to isolate me and drive me to quit. 

Can anyone help me make sense of this? Do you think they’re trying to drive me to quit? Should I quit? The company has treated me very well in the past aside from this shit. Giving me free things, paying for a doctor appointment for me when the insurance switched and we didn’t have the insurance yet, they even let me borrow a vehicle for 2 whole weeks when my old car was fucked up. But that was in the past, back when I was actually getting assigned jobs. Idk. Since the company has treated me respectfully before, I’m trying to resist impulsively quitting. If I quit, I wanna be very sure on my decision."

It challenges my math skills and precision accuracy on stuff. Coworkers, culture, benefits, everything is great, besides my boss. He is very thick skulled. Just for an example, we are running a job in my machine and before, it was ran in my boss's (both machines are pretty much the same). We shared programs, and was told not to touch anything in it. We had a couple parts end up being bad, and he was dumbfounded as to why, and asked why they were bad, and stated they ran fine when he ran them.

Anyway, yesterday, he approached me, and talked with me about a mistake in one of the parts. It was a simple mistake and my trainer/coworker looked at my setup and said what I had set up for it was perfect, and had no clue how it happened. 

He started off addressing it, then said that this mistake is ""f***ing inexcusable"" for how long I've been at the company, and ""every job we've ran you f***ed something stupid up, and I'm tired of this s**t."" I kinda just stood there, taken aback, and nodded my head. My trainer saw us have the convo, but was not within earshot. I was shocked to say the least. I've never had a higher up speak to me that way, only had 1 coworker at a past job act that way.

I talked with my dad and he said I should talk with HR, bit I'm just afraid of the aftermath, I have a gut feeling my life at work will be hell if I put a complaint in. I have messed up some parts in the past, but everyone does it.

I updated my resume last night and found some job postings that I do like, just hesitant on whether or not to jump ship."

I have $50k in savings and am currently going back to school for a career change, but my degree is still 3 years away.

So around 3:35 I check my emails and it’s an email from this woman who scheduled the interview for 3 apologizing and providing me with an excuse as to why she was late. We agreed to reschedule for 4pm same day. She calls my cell phone literally like 3 minutes after I responded with the agreement to reschedule for 4 email. So like at 3:45ish. Does this at all sound like a red flag to any of y’all? I want to think it was a genuine delay for genuine reasons. I have in the past once had this experience where a call was scheduled, and the interviewer didn’t call at the agreed time, but waited for me to call after the scheduled time as a way to gauge how desperate I was for the job by reaching out to them when i didn’t hear from them. I’d like to think this isn’t the case here, but it’s still weird behavior in my personal opinion. We ended up chatting for about 35 minutes. Very nice woman overall but still strange.

So... I have been working on getting out of customer service and putting my degree to work in a “real” job. For the past few months I’ve been on the job hunt grind and have managed to schedule a few interviews. Generally I feel prepared for the interview portions, but it’s what’s next that has me anxious.

I’ve only worked part-time or temp positions and have never had to navigate salary negotiations and having benefits (besides a 401k).

I’ve been working at new job for about a month 

They didn’t let me take a shift which was weird they said I needed more training but the manager would be the one training and she hadn’t done that? 

And they Recently hired a new girl that they trained for that shift.. 
she’s prettier than me and white , I’m Asian. 

The manager recently has been cutting my hours saying it’s bc more workers are coming from college or whatever so I believed her but I looked at the schedule and the new girl is scheduled 5 days a week for the past 2 weeks we also both have full time availability. 
So they’re choosing her but idk why I haven’t done anything wrong 



So they said since they have less hours for me here they suggested I work at this partner restraunt they said it’s bc I’m enthusiastic and want more hours that they can’t give ( they do have hours they gave them to new girl) but the thing I’d it’s an Asian restraunt and im Asian. It just feels… weird to me that for some reason they don’t seem to like me, I can’t think of anything having to do w my actual work experience 

They’re all white and kind of mean very clique like not all but some of them.

Am I crazy?? Or is there like something here 

They seeming to not like me for no reason except maybe I’m not as pretty as the others 
They cut my hours saying it’s only bc  they have too many ppl and not enough hours and no one’s getting over 2 shifts a week which they are atleadt the newer girl. 
Idk what i did wrong for them to favor the newer girl.. 

It seems like they’re pushing me away from this restraunt and then saying I should go to a restraunt that happens to be very Asian.  They’re owned by the same person but still"

This company is a direct competitor to the company I currently work for and I'd report to him.

Now I would absolutely love a remote position (I can do my current job now from home but my boss is pretty against remote work so I only get 1 day a week) and I think it would also come with a lot more flexibility than I have now which would be really great also. However, this coworker did not leave on good terms. He is married to someone else in a different department in the company I work for now and was having an affair with someone else in our department who is also married. He left to cut off ties with the woman he was having an affair with to reconcile with his wife.

My current boss is not always professional and has spent quite a bit of time complaining to me about him and how relieved she is he's gone and how awful the details about the affair are (everyone in the department knows, she has watched them meet up on camera in the office, etc). As it's a corporate environment I have tried to remain as PC and neutral as possible but I agree that the affair is terrible. 

My husband and a few friends I've mentioned this to all say who cares? They say it's just business and if it's a better position I should take it. And with it being remote I won't even see him. My husband really thinks this is a great opportunity for me and that I shouldn't hesitate at all to pursue it.

Is it bad I'm entertaining this new position? And how in the world would I ever tell my boss now I'm leaving to go work for him? She will not be happy at all and I think her opinion of me would really change to a negative one once she finds out I'm talking to him about the position, let alone willing to work for him.

As expected, he didn’t budge nor even offer me a number to try and keep me. Instead, he told me that he hasn’t even started writing down the job responsibilities for my promotion and hasn’t even submitted the proposal to his higher ups which will take weeks if not more than a couple months for approval.

So I am leaving my current department and currently have two different departments fighting to hire me. One will send me an offer on Monday but another department will try to offer me something by next week before the 48 hour time frame expires. I feel really good about the position I am in and just want to say, if you don’t feel like you are being valued or treated well in your current position, don’t be afraid to start looking for other jobs. 

I started applying in March and already got one offer now so I’m pretty happy with how things went for me. 

Last but not least, don’t work for supervisors that lack the training and organizational skills to build a team. There is going to be a mass exodus in my current department and I don’t want to be around when that happens."

We usually receive very few calls in night, but yesterday I got a call which took me 9 mins to handle, and during that time another customer was desperately calling which resulted in 5 missed calls.

So the other day I got a mail from my TL where he explained that the call shouldn't have took this long and missed calls are not justified in this case. He explained this in very polite tone in mail and tagged the whole team and warned them as well to not take this much time.

After this, he also texted me personally and said ""everyone has very high expectations from you"" or ""Take this mail positively"" I apologized on mail and explained my part on why this happened and owned up to my mistake. He said no problem be careful next time.

The thing is I am the top performer in my firm, last month I got the highest increment among my colleagues, and I get praises all the time about my fine work. But this ONE SINGLE mistake is making me feel like shit. Infact nobody is talking about the mail or taunting me, it feels like everything is normal. But i am still not able to get over the fact that I made a mistake and received a mail for it. 

Also, I am slated to be the next supervisor, does this mistake will hinder it?

I did not enjoy my current role due to the poor nature with which they treat employees, but I'm genuinely leaving because a better opportunity came my way. I fully intended to continue working my hardest and take the high road on my way out. 

Some members of senior management have treated me incredibly poorly and unprofessionally since I resigned. Again, I can live with that and just move on and forget it once I leave. However, they now have made a comment suggesting that I am being unprofessional. I have continued to not only do my job but take initiative to improve things for the team I supervise. I have done nothing unprofessional. The only thing they could say is I was not full on smiles after weeks of being treated poorly, but I never said or did anything in response. 

I did not plan to say much in my exit interview since I know nothing will change, and it's not to me benefit. However, I feel that they have now disparaged my character by suggesting I'm unprofessional when I know there's nothing further from the truth. On one hand, anything I say I feel will be taken poorly, but on the other, if I say nothing, I'm afraid that's the narrative that will be left about me.

What would you do in this situation? Would you report their lack of respect and false claims made about your character or say nothing?

I have a very unique name and no criminal record so doubt there will be any confusion there. However the company I worked at two years ago hires everyone under the same title “client services associate” bc they don’t want their competitors to know which of their employees are staffed on specific segment (for example putting your exact department in your LinkedIn job title is a big no no.)

Now for my resume I put my more explicit title bc client service associate feels too general. But will this be an issue in the  background check?? If they call my employer they’ll most like say I was a “client services associate”.  I’m hoping this won’t cause any issues for me. 

Does anyone know exactly how the Sterling Talent process works?

I’m a recent graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Business Admin-concentration in supply chain and operations management (mouthful) but I haven’t been able to escape accounting positions. My first job was as the “Chief Financial Officer” of a small landscaping company doing all AR/AP, payroll, general ledger and budgeting. I currently work as an “AR specialist” at a career college doing much of the same work as before. 

One of the benefits of working at this college is after one year of service I can complete the requisite accounting coursework to sit for the CPA exam for the cost of books and course fees. It’s worth noting that I very much enjoy this job, the expectations are quite low and I’m largely unsupervised most of the week, and can work as much overtime as I want. The company culture is good, they love promoting internally and I get a raise every 6 months.

However, one of the jobs I applied for while hunting that I was very interested in is open again- a buyer/planner position as a medical technology company. The base compensation is about 20% greater. I feel that I interviewed for this position very well and have a good chance at snagging it if they see my name pop up again. 

Were I even a bit unsatisfied at my current job and without the obvious benefit of a clear path forward to becoming a CPA, this wouldn’t even be a question. I don’t want to escape accounting per se, but I went into operations management for a reason. What’s the outlook for each career path? Should I apply and see what happens, or stay the course and acquiesce to the economy’s demands that I become an accountant? Thanks."

I already got a solo with a reputable gallery, and show/sold works worldwide. It's a huge feat, esp. at my age, and I'm insanely lucky.

However, despite that, in the arts, it costs money to make money. Even the most successful artists have had day jobs here and there. I need a remote and lowkey job that pays well so that I can keep making art, and I'm angling towards remote personal assistant.

Every listing lists skills that I have just running the studio/small business. Emailing people, tracking calendars, GSuite, excel-- sure, I didn't learn it in school but I had to when I have deadlines to ship stuff out for art fairs, for example.

If I get the jobs I apply for, will it really be a dream come true? I have so much I want to do in the next year... and if I could get a job like this it would literally be the best thing ever... Do companies care if I am not actively looking for a career with them (as long as I get the job done)/ and they know my true career is in the arts?"

Now there’s a year until I graduate and I have no clue what I’m going to do with my life, or at least after graduation. I need a good career that I could get started in with the degree I will be receiving, but all I know about the job market is negativity and a lack of availability.

I really like jobs where I get to interact with people, be friendly, be convincing. I also like jobs with less interaction and with repetitive or semi-repetitive tasks. In person or work-from-home.

Some job ideas I have would be: bartending, customer service representative, furniture sales associate. 

Jobs I’ve had…that’s the issue, being a full time student has made getting and keeping a job very difficult. I’ve made pizzas, worked a laundromat, worked at a bath & body works and hated the instability, and I’m currently an usher at my local performing arts center.

I don't know what to do, if I move to this role and hate it then I would be letting down these great co-workers. But if I leave I could be going into another job/team that has a different set of issues.

1,2023-04-29,What should I do?,u/Weird-Illustrator870,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1333chf/what_should_i_do/,jobs,"So, some background first.

Im an undergrad student, 21. I love my course, its amazing. 2 years down, 2 to go. In my last few weeks now. I live in the countryside with no public transport, so I have to stay with relatives in a nearby town to commute to college. I also work on the weekend, I get given a weekly allowance by my parents but its just enough to cover the essentials, I basically work for all my hobbies, outgoings, savings, etc. I also stay with my relatives for work as its in the same town. 

I hate the job. Its easy work, its just one day a week, I don't dislike any staff, but its not good for me. I've been there over a year now and I absolutely dread going in. I suffer from depression and anxiety and it isn't a good match. I don't mesh well with small town culture. When I'm up in college, I'm almost too loud, love chatting to people, so on so fourth. At work, I'm nothing like that. Very quiet, never have anything to say, I can have a little banter with the person I'm on with maybe but especially in group settings I just go mute. 

I've applied for some other jobs and internships for the summer, but I've had no luck. I think getting work in the same town wouldn't do me any favors either. My location and the fact I don't drive really limits me. If I were to work, my plan is to save up and get my license, so I can have a car by some time next year. If I leave, I might be able to negotiate with my parents to give me an allowance but it won't really be enough for all that. 

I know it still sounds like I'll be better off leaving, but the other thing that really gets me down is when I'm off college and stuck at home. I was fairly introverted during school but especially throughout covid I became much, much more outgoing. But, I live in the countryside, and my friends live far away now and are spread across the country, I need to rely on my parents to drop me anywhere I want to go which is really limiting. If I left work, I'm worried about the state I'd be in losing the little bit of flexibility the job gives me. Ideally I'd spend the free time working on my hobbies and doing some additional learning for my course, but I might lose any productivity I have, I dont't really know for sure. I'm just the kind of person who needs to be working, going out daily, etc or I fall apart. For example, on my easter break I had a whole study plan made out, yet ended up barely doing an hours work a day if even.

Either way, once I'm done my course I'll be moving onto a much more enjoyable profession and be able to start aiming towards moving out. I just don't know whats the best option for me until then. Was hoping to hear some opinions to help guide me, thanks."

Looking for some advice, honestly. I've been working at this dealership for about three months now after leaving another due to a less than ideal work environment. When I first started this new job, I was excited because it was a step up from where I was before, and I'm now making around 47k a year which I have now realized is.... not enough. Not only to live my life normally, but also for the work that I do. I am doing a job typically required by two people for the compensation of one. Someone had been hired to take on one of the two roles I play, but they left within a week for reasons unknown to me. 

In interviewing for this job, I thought that taking on this role wouldn't be too overwhelming of a task because this was a newly acquired store for this dealer group, and they weren't anticipating a ton of business. 90 days later, and this store is doing significantly more business than anyone has anticipated. However, they still will not hire someone to assist me with tasks. They have hired new people for every position except the ones that I'm taking on single handedly. Honestly, with the way management operates, and the weird way my direct supervisor handles things (ie, I was trained to do something a certain way, she's watched me do it this way, has shown me to do it this way, then came to me three months later to ask me why I'm doing things that way. When told she was the one who told me to do things that way, she gets aggressive. This has happened at least five times that I can think of off the top of my head), I'm thinking that it's time to switch industries all together.

My associates degree is in accounting, and I've been doing back office dealership work since I got my degree three years ago. I've been working on tailoring my resume, but I really don't know where I want to go from here. I want to remain in accounting because it's a field that interests me, but with the limited experience that automotive accounting has given me, it seems like it's going to be a hard switch without a bachelor's. I have no intention to going back to get my bachelor's right now because school is a major trigger for me, I barely managed to get my associates (not that my grades weren't good, my mental health takes a major toll).

What kind of roles should I be looking for? Any tips on negotiating salary? Are there any potential certifications that I can get to spruce up my resume and background more?  What other steps can I take to better myself and have more luck in my job search?"
2,2023-04-29,Career question,u/InformationMountain4,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1335c5s/career_question/,jobs,"Hello everyone. I have a question regarding if i should continue perusing software dev or go into cyber security

I have been unemployed since last November. For the last 2 years I have been trying to get into software development. I even joined a tech apprenticeship program in hopes I would get a softwire dev job. Despite several hundred of applications, 2 interviews (one through apprenticeship), and monthly check ins with my apprenticeship, I got nothing.

Recently an apprenticeship opportunity came up for a cyber security position. I'm aware cyber security and softwire dev are two separate fields. While my passion is in programming and I could get paid more there, cyber security is in more demand. Not to mention the whole ChatGPT will cut software dev jobs.

Also the apprenticeship place may have at least 2, possibly 3 more programming apprenticeships coming soon in the summer.

Unfortunately my unemployment benefits will run out next week and All I have left is my life savings which will last me a couple of months at most, but not throughout the summer. Also My apprenticeships have been in constant delays too

My skills include knowledge in many different programming languages(C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL), problem solving, data structures and algorithms, and database design. I also used to be a field tech for 3 years, tech support for 4 years, and I have a good for life compTIA A+.  I also have a programming essentials certificate from an accredited university and completed several computer science courses.

Should I continue perusing software dev or should I take a shot at cybersecurity? Like I mentioned before I love programming but I also need a job fast and cyber security is in more demand

Thank you for your time."

2313,2023-04-29,Very uncomfortable at a new job after involving hookers in a business trip.,u/Amproto,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1336nxm/very_uncomfortable_at_a_new_job_after_involving/,jobs,"So I got hired in a company after moving to a new city.

First few weeks were ok so far. Coworkers, despite their blunt way of communicating sometimes, are professional, ""to the point"" and do their job.

As this company is in semiconductors industry, frequent business trips to Asia are to be expected and are part of my job. 

So a few days ago I came back from my first trip in Asia with some of my new coworkers, and I admit to be baffled by what happened here.

The first days of the trip was pretty usual: we dealt with the client, endless meetings and negotiations. Things then went well and objectives were pretty much met. So we decided to relax, go visit the city and eat at a restaurant. That's where things started to get weird: while we were drinking beer, my coworkers decided to hire local hookers for the night and blow some celebration.  

I was quite surprised, cause they all are married with kids. But hey, its their private life, they do they and none of my business. I still felt it was gross, lame and cringey. But, again, as long as no one is hurt, they are free men.

However, they started to peer pressure me to go with them and participate in this prostitute party thing. Scrolling pictures of girls on hooker websites, showing them to me ""Which one would be for you? This one! You think she'll be able to fit you in?"" while laughing.

I mean, I am in a relationship too and they know it. I refused and frankly started to get pissed because they insisted, mocked me etc. Then, one of them a bit drunk angrily said that basically my attitude won't help me integrate the company and become part of the ""pack"" (ie the team).

I immediately left the bar and took leave for my hotel. Next day we took the plane back to home, I was alone, felt really ostracized, didn't talk to them during the fly while they were exchaning words and talked job things.

Supposed to go back to office this Monday, at one hand not so sure I want to go back there, on the other hand I blame myself for not handling the situation well and not having proper social skills to navigate through these tough situations. Maybe I should've bought a hooker without really consuming her? Just to bamboozle them into thinking I did as them?"

If I send an email asking them to confirm, would that make me seem unreliable? I don't want to give the wrong impression, but it is making me nervous wondering if I messed up or not.

What’s the point? And no I will not work in a cafe or retail, I don’t have the confidence, bubbly personality for that. I have nothing, no friend no energy and no future. 

I have two pieces of expensive degree certificates. But that’s about it. What’s the point of anything? When it’s another rejection email or ghosting. When really you think back to high school and you were kind of a no body and things just went down hill from there and you are probably at rock bottom with no body around anymore well down from having like 5 people maybe 6. 

The one ‘proper’ job was the worst 16 months of life oh and it was paid like nothing but oh wait everything was your fault but you were ‘just’ someone who just finished High school but had a 4 year bachelors degree and a masters but nothing to do with this job. So nothing mattered, opinions on anything- nope you don’t know what you are talking about you don’t know the publishing industry which ‘I’ ( ie the boss) has worked in for 20+ years. But oh wait this person stopped doing their job can you do that stuff too but for the same amount of salary and oh I also respect you less even though you are helping out way more, and shout at you for making mistakes while helping out and going well beyond the work you don’t care I do or see.  - as you can see although I have left that place for a year now, it still is scaring and maybe that doesn’t help with my confidence and although it was ‘experience’ probably did more harm than good for me 

Spent 5 years and on paper I guess I am the right person for the job in my industry but come the interview and obviously not. 

And now getting forwarded job applications 24/7 from my parents. Every hour of the day, even for the same job advert, or one I have or had an interview for. data entry, air traffic control, travel agent, senior positions, apprenticeships for jobs I have the said degree for and they say - ‘I know you don’t qualify but they may if you beg’, ‘ you got to think - Something ‘outside’ the box’ 

I applied for a job to literally print travel itineraries and put them in a pack - GHoSTED. 

I can’t anymore, what is the point of anything."

1,2023-04-30,Staffing agency trying to change job offer info on me?,u/nowhelovetallwomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/133gje1/staffing_agency_trying_to_change_job_offer_info/,jobs,"I contacted a staffing agency given to me by a colleague of my mother. I met with a recruiting manager from the staffing agency and he ended up finding me a temp to perm position as a law firm assistant. I interviewed with the law firm and it went great, an hour after the interview my staffing agency recruiter offered me the position. He changed the hours from the position description he had originally sent (originally 9-5 changed to 8-5). Me being fresh out of college and desperate to work for this law firm verbally accepted the conditional position (i have yet to complete the conditions for reasons listed below). He then went on to send me all on boarding documents. I come to find out that he wanted to onboard me to the staffing agency and not the law firm (I did not know this is what staffing agencies did until this point, please dont destroy me in the comments for that). In these documents there was no written job offer or job order. 

I interviewed for the law firm on Friday and received the offer and on boarding documents Friday afternoon. I was told my deadline was the following Monday which is also my scheduled first day. I checked the law firms website and they have a ""no recruiters please"" request under the available job positions. The HR manager from the law firm thought I had been in contact with the law firms recruiting manager and not a third party recruiter. 

As I have learned all of this over the weekend and read the documents sent to me I am beginning to worry. There is no talk of overtime for the 9 hour days I would work, A lunch waiver agreeing to either take an unpaid 30 min lunch or no lunch, and many other things that seem very questionable to me/ are different from the job description and interview convo. The law firm and I have had not direct contact without going through the staffing agency for anything other than the interview. After finding all of this out and noticing all the changes the staffing agency has made to the job I cannot agree to this. I emailed the law firm HR manager whom I interviewed with that I would not be working for the staffing agency however I am still interested in working for the firm and ask to discuss it if she was open to it. However I sent this email today (Saturday) and I dont think she'll see it until Monday when Im supposed to go in for my first day. I don't want the law firm to think I'm irresponsible (incase they may wanna hire me themselves) for not showing up or what not but I don't think I can go in on Monday until all these documents are signed. I have no idea what the staffing agency has told the law firm about accepting the job, signing documents, etc. All I know is that the law firm sent me a visitors pass for Monday (I'm assuming under the assumption that I formally and unconditionally accept the job).

Please offer me any advice on what you think I should do. Should I go in on Monday or no? Even on the off chance they are able to hire me directly (would that put them in hot water w/ staffing agency? Idek) I would need time to review their formal job offer, complete on boarding documents, and have standard time between offer acceptance and my first day. In a perfect world I would be able to have a phone conversation with the HR manager and work this out and have more than a weekends notice to review the conditions of the job and prepare for my first day. I am stressed out of my mind about this. Let me know what you think is my best plan of action. Thank you."

1,2023-04-30,Did I Ruin My Interview In One Question?,u/whatasmallbird,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/133i4bi/did_i_ruin_my_interview_in_one_question/,jobs,"Recently I interviewed with my local fish and wildlife department (California, USA), to work with a permitting crew. I have a degree in biology, passed the environmental scientist exam with a 95% but one question in my interview stumped me. 


The prompt was something along the lines of “Explain a time you had to balance multiple projects. How do you handle having multiple projects at one time?” Background info on me is that I’m a completely neutral person. When asked how I feel on projects, my thought is that it didn’t matter because it will need to be done regardless of my opinion. I don’t think or feel about my assignments. I simply do them. I know my due dates and what’s needed and I get it done. My response was “Yes, last summer I had four simultaneous projects which I completed all prior to due dates. Project 1 took place on Mon/Fri, project 2 &3 was thurs wed, and project 4 was sat sun and mon morning. Otherwise I would be sleeping and resting a lot. This won’t impress you but my method is that I just do what needs to be done. I’m told my due dates, what data and forms are expected and I complete it. When not working, I sleep and rest A LOT.” That was my honest answer and I feel like I just cost myself the job. I legitimately didn’t understand what they were asking because my brain just doesn’t get overwhelmed with assignments; I instinctually know what I can and cannot handle. I don’t accept projects I can’t do. But I didn’t explain it properly since I was nervous for the interview. 


Afterwards I asked what people struggle with in the position, which they said was work life balance and being efficient in their work. At that moment I knew I messed up. Friends have said I’m fine because of my explanation but I feel I just ruined it. 


What’s your opinion? Did I just ruin things?


EDIT: it might help to know context of the work I was doing. I’m a wildlife biologist. So I was hiking a lot, surveying, collecting data. My Mon/Fri project was 12-15 hour days of surveying for a certain protected spps in the mountains by hiking to baited camera stations, refreshing bait, and checking for data. Wed/thurs were two different predawn surveys for protected nesting birds, hiking through forests, making sure any listed species were accounted for and that logging wouldn’t occur near nests. Sat, sun, Mon were predawn surveys for an endangered bird species; requiring living in the woods and backpacking. Along with the field work, I was organizing data forms and data bases, identifying species on our camera/audio recordings. The projects were physically and mentally demanding."

Basically, I click on their link and go to Taleo or ADP or whatever...go through the pain of uploading my resume and then pasting everything from my resume and more to complete their ""Profile"" and adding ""Skills""....and never hear back from these companies. 
I've only ever heard back from those one click apply companies, even if it's an rejection.

[The academic jobs I get interviews for](https://imgur.com/a/U4jVgKr)

&#x200B;

I've  redone my CV to the point where I can't improve and make it anymore  simpler to read through in my field. I even use ChatGPT-4 to re-write  bits and pieces in my cover letters because repeatedly tailoring it to  match different job requirements takes more than a single day or hour,  and is slowly killing me. 

I seem to only be getting interviews for  academic roles where the laboratory manager or member of the lab is  stated as the vacancy poster - as opposed to some HR person or  recruiter. These academic jobs are posted much less often than  non-academic jobs, Despite doing well in interviews, I can never land an  actual offer.

I'm nearing 60 sent  applications, have had \~20 interviews. I've had really good interviews in the past 4 months for extremely relevant technical positions with decent companies and universities, only to be dropped for someone with more experience or because of my location. I get feedback and I get emails about application outcomes more often than not.

For whatever reason, I can't get interviews for simple positions that I'm  more than qualified for. These are usually smaller companies and  start-ups that're hiring for technicians to do basic housecleaning,  assistance, and maintenance stuff.

Where in the world am I going wrong with my apps?"

I'm so excited to share this news with you all. I just got an offer from Reddit to join their data science team as a full-time employee! This is a dream come true for me, as I've always been fascinated by Reddit and its communities. I've been a long-time lurker and occasional poster on r/jobs, and I've learned a lot from the advice and stories shared here.

But what really helped me land this job was something I did as a personal project: I created a bot that analyzes r/jobs posts and comments using R and Python.The bot, which I named JobBot, scrapes r/jobs every day and performs various tasks, such as:

\- Classifying posts by flair (e.g., resume advice, interview tips, venting, etc.)

\- Extracting keywords and topics from posts and comments (e.g., skills, industries, locations, etc.)

\- Sentiment analysis of posts and comments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral, etc.)

\- Generating summaries and insights from the data (e.g., most popular flairs, most discussed topics, most upvoted posts, etc.)

I started this project as a way to practice my coding and data analysis skills, as well as to learn more about the job market and the challenges faced by job seekers. I also thought it would be fun and interesting to see what kind of patterns and trends emerge from the data.

I posted some of the results on a jobs server on slack and on a data analysis  and they got some attention and feedback. But what I didn't expect was that one of  Reddits executives saw my posts and reached out to me via DM. They said they were impressed by my work and asked me if I was interested in working for Reddit as a data scientist. They said they were looking for someone who could help them analyze user behavior and engagement across different subreddits and platforms.

I was stunned and thrilled by this opportunity. I agreed to do an interview with them, which consisted of some technical questions, a coding challenge, and a presentation of my project. They also asked me about my background, my goals, and my motivation for working at Reddit.The interview went well, and they offered me the job on the spot. They said they liked my skills, my creativity, and my passion for Reddit. They also said they were impressed by how I used Reddit as a source of data and inspiration for my project.

I started a new job three months ago. I work for a small family business where the father is the owner and his sons are management so nepotism is prevalent from day one. 

My first week on the job, I had a feeling that my supervisor who was training me was on some sort of amphetamine. His behavior was erratic during the afternoon time and this isn’t the first time I’ve seen someone high so I had my suspicions. It wasn’t until one of my coworker decided to leave did she started discreetly airing the company’s drug use. There have been times where I could hear management snort lines in their offices because the walls were so thin. Eventually after my coworker left, my supervisor started offering me drugs as a company perk at my 90 days. 

I don’t know how to feel about this. A part of me says it’s not my problem and I’m only there to work and I can decline their offers. Another says that this sort of behavior is problematic and should be addressed. The pay is good but the benefits aren’t great. The main reason why I don't want to leave this job yet is that I’ve only started this job not so long ago. I don’t want to be hopping from job to job and I would prefer to stay at this place for at least a year before I jump ship. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation? Or can give any advice?"

I arrived in Montreal in April 23 to study French for one year in ILSC, but I'm also looking for a job in the software developer area.

I'm 24 and I have a Computer Science Bachelor Degree in a federal university in Brazil, named UTFPR, but I don't have a work permit. I did my bachelor from 2017 to 2021 and I have two years of experience developing softwares. My experiences were mainly with Kotlin (for an Android App) and Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, REST pattern and SQL for a backend API), but I'm a fast learner and I really really love everything about the developer area, so I can easily learn any language and technology.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for a job opportunity, but I would be grateful if someone could give me an opportunity or even an advice of how can I search better.

Currently I'm sending applications in LinkedIn and Indeed, but I didn't have any positive response yet.

Also, my French is at the very beginning, so I can communicate in English and Portuguese."

2,2023-04-30,When Do You Reach Out To Management When You Need Help?,u/Space-Matter,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1340g8k/when_do_you_reach_out_to_management_when_you_need/,jobs,"If you need help with a task or a project, when is the best time to reach out to management for help? Usually I ask for help when I have either a) run out of options or b) I need to use a program that I don't have access to/not trained on. However, when I've reached this point management seems to have been upset with me for not letting them know sooner that I needed help, despite me having somewhat of an idea of what to do. 

For example, I was expecting an expedited package today. I received a notification that it had been received, but I had not received it. I asked my coworkers if they had received it on my behalf (no), checked all the docks on all of the buildings on my campus (no), contacted security (no), contacted units on public, main floors (no), before calling my company's employee help desk number. I was asked to check one more unit and I was given a customer service number that the company used for communicating with the delivery company. I still hadn't found the package and I had run out of who to ask for help, so I called my manager. They said that I had done everything that they would have done and that I didn't give them any room for them to help me. They offered to call the delivery company back just in case they would receive a different answer (no) but that next time I should leave options for people to help me if I needed help. In the end, a different unit down the hall found and delivered the package to me.

Maybe it was because it was the weekend and my manager was a little upset with me for calling them on my day off and maybe I'm overreacting because I'm tired, but I'm curious as to know when everyone else asks management for help?"

Never had a spouse to comingle incomes with. I am applying to jobs I can do, in an office. I can't do physical labor. I need $30/hour, at a minimum, but the jobs I see pay less. I'm in TN at the moment which is difficult, because I'm not from here, but ended up here post Covid pandemic. 

Its all family-centric work places, filled with people who discuss their religious beliefs. If I could ""just move,"" I would. Moving is expensive. I have to hide who I am and keep to myself since I don't have a generational family tree to depend on, or discuss. Down here, its what people put as first priority.

Some State agencies contacted me for upcoming interviews. The wages are what I made in the 90s. I have a multi-industry background and advanced degrees (degrees not relevant to this post, I am trained with transferable skills). 

Wages for the 2 jobs I was contacted for:
* $3,150 low end .. $2,686/net per mo

* $3,942 mid .. $3,324/net per month

* $4,733 high .. $3,958/net per month

minus health, dental, vision to buy and use benefits 

minus mandatory 7% pension deduction 

minus an apt I need to qualify to rent, car, phone, food, living expenses

I think people here take State jobs in their 20s and stay until retirement. So  they start everyone at the bottom. But I have multi-industry skills developed in, insurance, banking, human resources, so my ""skills in analysis, research, writing, investigations, client relations, business development, technology etc..."" are current. 

I can't afford the lowest. I can't qualify for an apt in TN unless my net pay covers $1,500 rent plus utilities. And that is low income rent. 

The people here say, ""some job is better than no job, some income is better than none....even if it doesn't cover a place to live..."" But we all need a place to live. If they offer me the job at the LOW end (and I've been there before with that, I need housing, car, and living costs). I can't cover living costs on $2,686 net -7% mandatory pension deduction and benefits, nor on $3,324 net -7% mandatory pension deduction.

So if they start out in the interview, ""This job pays $3,150/gross a month ($2,686/mo net) are you okay with that?"" 😔

Hours 8:00 a.m. -4:30 p.m. one hour commute each way. I am in bed by 9:30 p.m. or 10pm and up at 5am."

I really like the department (we’ll refer to this as #1) and they liked me. They were fully staffed but created another position and offered it to me. I accepted. I went to shadow another department(we’ll refer to this as #2) to help me pass my boards and I fell in love with this new department. On top of really liking it more it also does not require that I take call. I have small children so taking call will be a struggle but not impossible. Anyway, I signed a two year contract and I reached out to HR for specifics regarding switching departments and they said as long as I work for the hospital it doesn’t matter. The manager at department #2 told me that if I ever wanted to switch over to reach out and they would be happy to have me. So it sounds clear and obvious that I should switch departments before I start in a few months. BUT I would have to call department #2 and ask them to transfer and since they only have nursing positions open(I’m not a nurse but my title is equivalent in this field) he would have to tell his manager to switch it to my title. That manager is the same one who hired me at department #1. Should I start at department #1 work there for a year and then transfer or tell them now and possibly risk losing both?"

My resume is fill with customer service and warehouse type jobs. One thing I never included was the fact that I create min. 5 websites, really solid websites by the way, for myself. Created many social media pages, linking them, getting them to all work together. They were for the most part ecommerce stores, some were not. They ran well, I learned how to manage and operate the backend of the site, learned how to create graphic designs over the past ten years for myself, BUT all this has nothing to do with coding. I did it all through Wix, which is a plug-in site that has a lot of things ready to plug-in. However, its not just as easy as press start and go, theres still a lot of maintenance, moving things around, like you really need to understand your way around building and keeping these sites even though its not coding per say. So what kind of position can i look for, where i can tailor my resume to state that I can run a website in a sense? you see what Im asking here? I have skills to build and maintain websites, create emails, create social media pages and maintain them, I know what apps can bring more traffic etc, but dont know what to look for in order to update my resumes that correlates with a job like this."

1,2023-04-30,Career Planning: Should I go to Industry or Grad School?,u/parkdrew,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1341ug5/career_planning_should_i_go_to_industry_or_grad/,jobs,"Hi, I'm a 24-year-old senior at an undergraduate university in the US majoring in Computer Science. I'm not sure whether to work in the industry right after I graduate (as a Software Engineer) or go to grad school to get a Master's degree in CS (AI, ML, and Data Science). 

The reason why I'm conflicted is that I want to eventually change my job to commercial piloting. I've always been interested in flying a plane even before college but I couldn't pursue it due to the enormous financial obstacle. Now, my personal goal is to save up to around $100k for a pilot program by age 30. 

As many of you already know, the CS job market these days is discouraging, rejection after rejection. I graduate at the end of May 2023, and I'm not confident that I will find a job by that time (as I'm not the brightest CS mind out there). If I had a job, I'd definitely be in favor of working immediately so that I can start saving up as soon as possible. Since that is not the case, however, I applied and got accepted to a low-tier grad school (just in case I don't get hired) for their Master's in AI, ML, and Data Science track. Honestly, AI and Data Science are something I've been quite interested in the CS as well. The caveat here is that the tuition is around $70k in total... Having to spend extra 2 years in academia while paying this much money feels contradictory.

A few more reasons why working immediately is beneficial is because I can get personal pilot lessons on the weekends. This is beneficial because 1) I can gain flying experience and get a private pilot license, and 2) I can decide if piloting is actually right for me. If I'm attending grad school, I won't have the time and money to do this. 

However, attending grad school has its own benefits as well. First, I'm learning specialized fields in CS that I have an interest in. Second, I can safely assume higher salary opportunities as a Master's student. And what if I end up not liking piloting? In that case, I would probably want to keep learning and developing my CS skills. And I believe this grad school can help me do that. 

Right now, I'm in an interview process with a couple of CS companies with salaries of around $50k, which isn't high given that it's a CS position. The results will come out around mid-June, but I need to confirm my admission to grad school by May 10th.

I'd appreciate any advice or opinion. Feel free to ask me anything you're curious about. Thank you!"

Hey Reddit,

I could really use some advice right now and thank you in advance. I have a degree in Marketing (2013) and due to circumstances of that time, I ended up taking a position as a Consumer Banker at a big national bank. I did well. I became an assistant bank manager. Then a bank manager. And then left retail banking for Escrow Loan Processing. Also excelled there but due to mortgage rates going up, work dried out. The company was kind enough to give a generous buyout and I took it. I started a side hustle and took some much needed time off.

I took a Digital Marketing bootcamp during this time and graduated with a B+. I started applying a month ago and feel like I have no direction. I want to get out of sales for sure but the Digital Marketing positions I am applying for tell me I have no experience in the field even though they love my work history. Even had an interviewer tell me he loved me and had no doubt I could do the job but they couldn't take that chance on me.

I am getting rejection emails and only getting call backs from loan companies, sales or MLM's (AGH)! It is evident that I have to change something and was considering starting Coursera's Google Data Analysis Cert to give me an edge. But is it worth it?

Any retail bank workers here who were able to break into another field? Where do I go from here? I feel so defeated but won't give up. It feels like all my consumer, lending and management experience is worth nothing. Every job has husbands of applicants. Is there any field where this financial retail experience can transfer out too?

Thank you all for hearing me out. I know the market is tough and I am not alone in this. But I am finally disheartened enough to ask Reddit for advice. Is it because I am changing industries? Is it because my work experience isn't as valuable as I thought?

Thank you guys so much."
