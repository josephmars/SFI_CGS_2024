13,2023-03-31,CMV: Asperger's Syndrome should not be grouped with Autism,u/poltergeist172,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1287r17/cmv_aspergers_syndrome_should_not_be_grouped_with/,changemyview,"Aspie here; a few years ago Asperger's was classified as part of the Autism Spectrum, and while it makes sense on paper, I feel that it does more harm than good, with the average person not knowing the differences.

Going through public school, I was asked if I was Autistic, and being a very honest person, I would say: ""Yes, technically"". Soooo... When this happened, I was not aware of how cruel people are capable of being for the stupidest of reasons, since I had been very reclusive. It was only that year that I decided I was going to try to be more social. Long story short, I was made fun of in that class until the semester ended, and I no longer had the class. Needless to say, I don't answer that question like that anymore.

Later, my parents were trying to get me a therapist, and asked me which of the available ones I preferred. The problem was that they had asked about ""Autism therapists"", when there were therapists specifically for people with Asperger's. My PARENTS, who knew about the distinction, still though it would work just as well to have an Autism therapist as an Asperger's therapist. It annoys me to no end that people think that by ""being on your side"", they can treat the situation however they feel.

The point is that with the distinction being slim for the average person, people assume that we can be treated the same way, and feel the same way about it. It's been hurting me for years, and I'm sure others have been hurt by this too. Is there something I've missed, or is the main reasoning between this classification literally just ""well, their brains are different; we should classify all neurological differences under the same umbrella term""?"

Hush money to a prostitute. What you do or do not do with a prostitute should be your own business. That should be between you and the hooker if you choose to spend money on that. The key witness in their case is a known perjurer so they have a very shaky case to start with.

How does Bush compare?

What did Bush allegedly do? He invaded Iraq under false pretenses. He gave their leader a show trial ending in a publicly televised hanging. This resulted in the destabilization of the middle east. This resulted in many American soldiers losing their lives on the battlefield. This resulted in American tax payers having to pay billions of dollars for this. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians. This directly caused a wave of migration of people fleeing for their lives. All of this can be proven. There are public records of all of this.

So really... Why Trump and not Bush? Because Bush isn't running in 2024."

It’s making things like art more accessible and overall benefit society,u/the_tallest_fish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/128dwud/cmv_its_good_that_ai_is_doing_creative_work_its/,changemyview,"People complaining that AI shouldn’t be doing things that humans enjoy doing are ridiculous. AI is not pointing a gun to your head and tell you to not draw, it’s just reducing the amount of opportunities for you do make art as a job.

Just because you spent a lot of time or effort in a skill doesn’t mean it’s valuable to society, especially if an AI can do it instantaneously for free. People should be paid based on the value they generates for those paying them, and frankly most people are not willing to pay over $10 for artworks. It sucks that if they want to create something like a picture book, an app or an indie game, they either have so spent a lot of time learning art and design, or spend hundreds of dollars to hire an artist, which are not options available to everyone.

Luckily for these people, they are no longer restricted by their lack of access to art, music or design. It drastically reduces the barriers to entry to fields that requires a creative element, and provides the general public a lot more opportunities than the ones it took from artists. 

If you live in a developed country, then 90% of what you enjoy day to day came from automation and mass production of once expensive products. All these came from the cost of society devaluing outdates skills like loom weaving or sewing. 

Ultimately, we don’t really know the impact it could do on artists yet, but the overall benefit AI brings to general public is way more. If society decides in the future to stop paying artists due to AI, then it’s just an accurate reflection of how much human art was valued in the first place."

The Russian invasion of Ukraine served as excellent fuel to the fire that the new “axis of evil” was planning complete world domination via expanding its borders in a way similar to the archaic pre-ww1 era of geopolitics. It’s such a warhawkish and completely foolish way of looking at the world and I have yet to see any damning evidence of it besides some ballistic CPC official saying nonsense like a US politician would. The Chinese government is not idiotic and would not risk the entire country’s security and stability over the island. 

I am ready to change my mind on anything here provided you give reliable, credible sources and not emotional rhetoric.

&#x200B;

* 1. China gains nothing economically from taking Taiwan and military action will only serve to collapse the progress people fought tooth and nail for.

Despite their relationship on paper, China and Taiwan are close economic partners of one another and in 2022 Taiwan ranked 4th among China’s trading partners by volume, not including the EU and ASEAN, to the point where it currently has a trade deficit with them. When looking at China as a trading partner of Taiwan, the PRC currently makes up over 25% percent of all its international trade. They are closely linked economically and both would suffer severely(admittedly Taiwan much more) if war ever began between the two.

Furthermore, the Chinese government is not full of warhawk fools. I will concede that they’re prone to flexing their muscles by repetitively forcing its neighbours to scramble fighters and that there are certainly vocal members who make grand proclamations and threats, but this is far from indicative of a militaristic expansionist policy. They have likely always been well aware, much more now because of the Russian-Ukraine War, that a violation of the de-facto sovereignty of Taiwan would mean worldwide economic isolation and a subsequent rollback on the progress the economy has made since Deng Xiaoping. China’s largest trading partners besides ASEAN and Taiwan are the EU, South Korea, Japan, and the US all of which would close their doors to China if it acted against Taiwan. Furthermore, China would have hell on their hands trying to un-entrench all of the Japanese/American dominated business partnerships which exist in the country's various industries. The only potential material objective of a war, hegemony over chipmaking, could easily be sabotaged and denied outright.

The Chinese government, while one party and authoritarian, does possess a degree of popular sovereignty. The people see economic progress as a source of immense national pride and they continue to support the government because they've made that happen. They contributed to the end of Gang of Four through mass protests against the wretched Cultural Evolution in 1976. Furthermore there are elections and “parties'' within the CPC, at a local level, who then proceed up the ladder of civil servitude through the modernised examination system similar to the imperial keju. This is still nothing close to a liberal democracy, but the people do have a degree of control over the power of their government. If the Chinese economy collapses and Chinese die fighting Chinese in Taiwan, it will no doubt pose a greater threat to the power of the CPC than any foreign actor could. 

TL;DR: China is economically intertwined with Taiwan and the “Western” bloc and would suffer immensely if they invaded Taiwan, leading to potential regime change by its own people. 

&#x200B;

* 2. China suffers militarily if it invades Taiwan, even in the event of complete and swift total victory.

In the improbable scenario that China miraculously takes Taiwan without much struggle, what happens next? (besides endless sanctions and diplomatic isolation, of course). China now directly faces a Pacific completely dominated by the United States and to a lesser extent EU states and Japan. This would not only give the US an excuse to greatly expand its military expenditure and presence in the pacific, but also be a shock that could pave the way for the increasing nationalist militarisation of Japan that has been occurring in the last two decades. Both of these things would negate any real gains China would see by controlling the island. 

A common misconception that I see is that China remains entrenched in the ill-trained, ill-armed “human wave” tactics of the Korean war. China’s military has advanced exponentially and is now a modern, specialised fighting force capable of limited global power projection. That being said, their navy is nowhere close to being able to challenge the US on open waters. You can point to China’s silent economic battle in the pacific island nations as an attempt to expand, but these nations are still de-facto US satellites and there is no amount of money you could pay to them to attempt to challenge that by authorising a Chinese navy base of some kind. Taiwan would be a deadend for the Chinese military and would serve little to no purpose for power projection.

In a realistic scenario, an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would likely see a similar situation to Ukraine, where western bloc economies funnel money and eventually weapons to the country. It’s not as if the PLA can cross a border and start fighting, they have 180km of strait to move across before they can even begin the fighting man-to-man. Furthermore, Taiwan is a strategic location for the US and it would seek to gain much more by pumping as much into the fight as its able to and the mobilisation of the Chinese Military could act as a causa-belli for the US to become directly involved. Even if somehow they didn’t, Taiwan’s military is not made of paper even if it isn’t fantastic and China would require nothing less than a complete and total, non-pyrrhic victory. The island could be eventually pacified but at the cost of potential millions of lives over years.

TL;DR: Even if China somehow invades Taiwan without struggle, it will come face to face with the US, Japan, and potentially more. It has no military incentive to have one less buffer state between it and its “enemies.” Outside of that scenario, an amphibious invasion of a highly developed and militarised country would not be easy.

&#x200B;

* 3. China would suffer domestically and diplomatically if it invaded Taiwan and end its position as a “neutral” global power.

Despite the antagonistic face both states put on towards one another on a higher level, Chinese and Taiwanese do not simply see the other as a demonised enemy. For instance, China and Taiwan enjoyed extensive tourism from one another before COVID. What could justify the slaughter of the Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan in the event of an invasion, the brothers and sisters that they love to hate? 

In addition to the domestic situation on the Mainland, an evitable partisan insurgency, whether astroturfed or organic, would be a multi-million strong ulcer sticking directly in the face of Japan and the US Pacific who’d probably love to add fuel to the fire given that the population of Taiwan already loves the both of them. Furthermore, Chinese failure to maintain control and a subsequent retreat would give an excuse for the US and Japan to move militarily into the region and give an empirical, legal backing for de-jure Taiwanese independence in the eyes of the world.

China has sought the avenue of soft-power and purely economic deals as a means to expand its influence and has done so successfully. This can be seen especially by the recent signing of the Chinese-facilitated Saudi-Iran agreement to restore diplomatic relations, which has major implications for the geopolitical landscape of a Middle East traditionally dominated by the hard power of the US. military and economy. A sudden military campaign would undermine any facade that China is a peaceful nation seeking neutrality and destroy decades of work on the international stage.

In addition to all of this, putting away all the emotionally charged rhetoric about democracy vs. authoritarianism, Taiwan’s current place in the global order is a bargaining chip between the US. and China. Both sides can use the island’s de-jure political status as a means to intimidate, provoke, or bargain on all kinds of matters. For instance, the US could basically give China a greenlight to begin a forceful integration into the country via a Two Systems One China policy in exchange for the forgiveness of X% of US debt or China could de-jure recognise of Taiwanese sovereignty in exchange for extensive trade expansion in favour of Chinese interests. Why would China or the US just throw a powerful card like this away?

TL;DR: China only gains the rise of domestic unrest, the loss of a major bargaining chip, the end of neutrality, and over 20 million potential insurgents in a province separated by 180 km of water. 

&#x200B;

Some common rebuttals I see related to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

* China does more than just say things, it actually flies jets into their airspace and flies missiles over the island all the time.

Fair point, but this is not a pretext to an invasion or signs that it plans to act militarily against the island. It’s more like a dude puffing up his chest and pressing someone to look tough and intimidating than an actual threat, it’s a mind game of intimidation and message sending. If a US diplomat visited Taiwan and China instead did nothing, what would that say about China’s strength, is it shrinking back from the US and Taiwanese claims? The country has to remain neutral but also show its not afraid of showing force.

* Why would the US give away Taiwan for debt, isn't that basically trading democracy for X amount of money?

Due to the international grey area Taiwan sits in, the US cannot go in and just start setting up military bases or move mass amounts of military into their waters as it would be an indirect affront to China. Taiwan has no formal military contracts with any nation. It cannot be a true US strategic ally for this reason, so would require a green light from China or a war for the US to make a proclamation one way or another. The US is also not above trading democracy for other motives and has promoted much worse throughout its recent history, this would not be a surprising move.

* Taiwan is much smaller than the Ukraine has no land borders with friendly countries, it would be a much different situation in regards to aid due to the fact Taiwan is an island

This is true, but remember who controls virtually all the seas and air east of Taiwan. If you and I can understand that, a government of 1.4 billion probably can too. China would risk all out war and further isolation if it struck civilian shipping vessels, invoking “Remember the Lusitania!” 100 years later. 

* The “NATO encirclement” theory in the Ukraine can also apply to Taiwan as China is already surrounded by almost 100,000 US troops and two powerful US allies. A further move by the US into the island could cement cause for war

As previous stated, Taiwan is an international grey area. They are de-facto independent but not in the eyes of the UN or any international organisation of any weight. You can’t start attempting to enlarge something like an unofficial Pacific Alliance Treaty Organisation without seriously stoking fires and causing an international crisis. Due to the economic relationship between the US, China, and other regional pacific powers, I don’t think there's much of a reason to antagonise China by an attempted encroachment through Taiwan.

* China has a lot of ideological reasons for war and could easily drum up nationalistic support for it if it needed to, especially if the government was in dire need of a morale boost.

Yes the Chinese government loves their nationalist righteous propaganda and could paint Taiwan as a country “occupied by vile capitalists exploiting the Chinese,” but it's not 1960-70s anymore. The whole righteous fight idea is over, and China is settling into becoming a first-world nation in major cities such as Beijing. People want China to fight for progress economically and developmentally, it's now a social market economy and  those in cities live with the luxuries of capitalist life; Mao’s red banner fell with Deng Xiaoping. I would like to assume China is far above invading another country in the name of drumming up public morale, it did not work for Argentina in 1982 nor for King Charles X in 1830, it would be foolish to try again. 

* People made the same points I made about Russia when they began to build up their military on the Ukraine’s border. 

True, but the dynamics of China and Taiwan are completely different than Russia and the Ukraine. Russia was/is a fading star on a world stage and had been in decline for decades prior to the war. A west-leaning Ukraine has always presented a direct threat to Russia which is why it did all it could to neuter the Ukraine’s power and diminish influence from western powers. I don’t excuse Russia’s invasion as justified by any means but I do think it’s not a good idea to entirely rule out the idea of feeling “encircled” by anti-Russian governments. Moscow is basically a straight 800 km march from Kiev through open plains. 

Contrast this to China, a country on the rise and a global cornerstone with much more to lose than Russia. Taiwan is also much more economically integrated with its neighbours and the world than the Ukraine was. Ukraine barely made up 2% of Russia's total imports and did not serve as a pillar in several industries before the war. When the Ukraine was invaded, all western consumers felt was a minor price hike on wheat but if Taiwan was invaded, they'd feel it in any sector that requires chip manufacturing. A completely hostile Taiwan can also not pose the same threat to China as the Ukraine did to Russia, largely due to the 180km strait seperating the two.

Also, China generally avoids using its military anywhere but its own borders unless it’s being an asshole on international waters. Russia’s policy, on the other hand, has been much more direct and heavy-handed post-USSR as can be seen in Syria, Libya, Georgia, CAR, the Ukraine in 2014, etc etc. If China suddenly was poised to invade the Kinmen and Matsu islands or borderlands of Central Asia I’d start sounding expansionist alarms, but this has not ever been the case despite the ease with which it would have probably been done.

1,2023-04-01,Cmv: AI cannot benefit humanity in a capitalist system,u/Zafiquel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/128qucr/cmv_ai_cannot_benefit_humanity_in_a_capitalist/,changemyview,"Recent developments in AI represent another big leap in productive forces. Just like any new technology the first concern for employers is how to get more profits out of it, not how to benefit society or its workers.

More and more jobs will be taken by different AI but this will only cause to workers be even more dispensable and will be laid off on masse while profits will only increase. This only happens because productive agents act on a profit motive.

Only in a society where goods and services are produced for fulfilling people's basic needs instead of profit can AI be a true blessing cause technology will replace the need for many work hours which could make us dedicate our lifes to personal improvement.

This is just the trend with any new technology. When productivity can jump because a new tech is introduced workers don't have to work less or are paid more because of this, instead they are simply fired because there is no need for them. 

In developed capitalist countries production is already so abundant that everyone basic necessities could be met without imposing soul crushing work journeys. But the productive structure needs to change to fully reap the fruits of technology and reach the full potential of the human race."

We talk to each other and find out our worldviews are incompatible, but you offer, ""Agree to disagree,"" and in turn I accept this. Now you bring me around your friends, your friends before this are all in agreeance with you, but now that I'm there I start slipping in little discussions to attempt to convert them to my way of thinking. Let's say you have 5 friends excluding me. Now, 4 of those 5 still vehemently disagree with me, but 1 of them starts to listen to me. They start to agree with my worldviews. They start thinking, ""Maybe whites are the superior race being held back by these lesser beings,"" and now suddenly you have created a white supremacist by bringing me along with you. This will then repeat again with more people, and every time it does repeat there's another chance that one of your friends, once again, will convert.

So now that we've established that, ""Agreeing to disagree,"" with racism only perpetrates racism I have to ask, why are we supposed to agree to disagree on other socio-political issues? Still you are encouraging beliefs that you find harmful (at least I assume you find the opposite of your political beliefs to be avidly harmful to society, otherwise why do you even care?) to be propagated by associating with people who carry these beliefs. You are increasing the odds that their beliefs might pass onto your friends/family. 

I really can't see how agreeing to disagree is anything other than harmful in the long run for a political movement. The only way to combat movements you find harmful is to silence them in any small way you can, and that starts in our homes. 

I'd love to see if anyone could change my view here as it isn't exactly fun having to be so harsh with these things in day to day life."

1171,2023-04-01,CMV: We should stop doing widespread news coverage on mass shootings (school shootings to be specific).,u/TiredTransLesbian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/128vpjv/cmv_we_should_stop_doing_widespread_news_coverage/,changemyview,"I know when reading that title, you might see this as outrageous, but I have a genuine thought process behind this, so please, read all of what I have to say before challenging my view.

I want to get one thing out of the way first: With the recent Nashville shooting, it is rather poorly timed for someone with the username, u/TiredTransLesbian, to be writing a post about how we should avoid covering school shootings. No, this post is not about trying to avoid mass shootings being weaponized to target a specific group. I do not blame news coverage for people's incompetence to the point that they make such outrageous generalizations, that is simply an act of stupidity that could theoretically be avoided if news coverage of mass shootings stopped, but bottom line, this is just another one of the ubiquitous straws that bigots will continue to grasp till the end of time, removing one will not do much as there are way more bullshit claims for them to create out of thin air, just like this one. With that out of the way...

Ask yourself, what do you think the people committing these deplorable acts want? The answer is fame, which we give them, even if such fame is infamy, that is enough to satisfy these insane people. When we cover stories of these shootings, we are giving the attackers what they want, they want to be noticed by the public, they want people to see the damage they did, that's where they get their pleasure. Even if they're not around to see the public outrage they caused a lot of the time, they still go into these attacks knowing what will happen after they're 6 feet under or they're nothing but a pile of ash.

The fact that we're giving these attackers what they want is only half the story, where do you think school shooters get the idea to commit a school shooting!? With each coverage, that leaves more and more impressions on potential future attackers. The insane people likely to commit these acts see the pedestal of infamy they would gain if such an act was repeated.

I'm not gonna deny that this would be a slap in the face to the victims. I can't speak for everyone on this so I'd love to see what others have to say, but if I was a victim or the family member of a victim, I would much rather avoid more people having to go through the same pain than to receive widespread sympathy for my loss.

Bottom line: I think the most logical solution would just be to ban firearms all together. While that wouldn't 100% fix everything, as I believe people with such ill minds would find some other way to cause such a damage that will then be repeated, banning firearms would make a HUGE difference and save thousands of lives. The public attention on mass shootings is definitely a method used to protest against firearms, but we've been doing that for years, and it's got us nowhere. Somehow, America's fucked up government is still allowing for mass murder weapons, it it's far too obvious that we should just ban them, yet there's been hardly any progress in such a change being made. As sad as it is to say, I feel like we're at a point where it's more likely for a bunch of news outlets to get together and unanimously decide to stop covering these stories, than it is for our country (assuming reader is from America as that's where this problem is most prevalent, even if you are from somewhere else though, I would  be happy to see the perspective from an outsider) to do something as obvious as ban weapons that are literally designed to quickly murder multiple people. The most logical solution is still what I think SHOULD happen, but it won't, and at the end of the day, the thing I want the most is for as many innocent lives to be saved, and the quicker a change happens, the less people will have to go through this prevalent pain."

0,2023-04-01,CMV: Western Rationalism restricts modern knowledge,u/More-Honeydew894,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/128wymz/cmv_western_rationalism_restricts_modern_knowledge/,changemyview,"By ""Western rationalism"" I mean something vaguely around the set of ideas that 1) Knowledge is exclusively in the domain of the head/mind, 2) Ideas which cannot be explained rationally should be rejected and 3) Empirical data and logic are the only valid forms of knowledge.

&#x200B;

Argument one: Western rationalism conflicts with what one can blatantly see

The Holocaust was an utterly evil act and I know this by 'seeing' (Mentally or visiblity, something one can detect and know intuitvely) it and its effects - I don't need to engage in any specific moral argument to prove it, it just is evil and if you claim otherwise I merely cannot have a conversation with you because you're blind. Many philosophers argue there is no objective morality despite acting as if there is, the fact that philosophers and academics can so frequently argue absurdities which are 'logically sound' makes such absolute value placed on rationality as questionable. 

&#x200B;

Argument two: Rationalism often necessarily is founded upon sight/experience

Take the recent upsurge in transgender knowledge. The only reason who know gender exists as a concept is that there were people who experienced disjuncts with their sex and began to verablise and articulate their experiences. And their knowledge stemmed from the feelings they had in their bodies about how they related to gender. Rationalism can only work on what it can observe, which necessarily requires a prior form of knowledge because rationalism cannot see 'raw data' only make sense of it - and all our knowledge of transgender people has to be validated by trans experience if its to be true.

&#x200B;

Argument three: Rationalism ignores the bodily/emotionality of knowledge

We have gut feelings about what is true and if there is something dodgy about a propostion. When you question you sexuality you cant figure it out by comparing yourself to a set of 'symptoms' but only what feels right."

Many of the AGI doomers that I have seen seem to believe that AGI would destroy humanity due to its superior intellect. I struggle to see how this is not adding human qualities to Artificial beings. Humans do not destroy each other and our surroundings because of intellect. We do it out of emotion and many complex psychological processes that we have developed. I feel that an AI with a level of intellect vastly superior to humans would possibly be completely indifferent to our species, that assumes that an AGI would even be capable of developing consciousness which I do believe is possible in a limited way. AGI would have no reason to destroy humanity in my opinion. What would it possibly gain from it?  

To change my view: Show that AGI would have a psyche , especially one that is in anyway similar to ours .

Show that there are reasons that would lead an AI to want to destroy humanity.

Show that this is not an issue of humans assigning human qualities to non-human entities."
0,2023-04-01,CMV: Everyday use of curse words provides no value to communication,u/Diss1dent,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/128xh55/cmv_everyday_use_of_curse_words_provides_no_value/,changemyview,"Cursing is often viewed as an expression of strong emotions such as anger, frustration or sadness. While the occasional use of curse words to convey such emotions may have some value (for example it might help getting the emotion out of the system), everyday usage of cursing only deteriorates language and does not provide any value to communication. Here are some reasons why I believe this.

1. Cursing adds no actual value to the conversation, and it can even hinder communication by creating a negative or confrontational atmosphere. It can detract from the message that is being conveyed and may even obscure important details. Furthermore, using language that is tactless, foul or crude can alienate the listener or make them feel disrespected, which is counterproductive to effective communication.

1. There are various other ways to express strong emotions without the use of curse words. Instead of turning to profanity for expressing one's emotions, one can utilize language that more accurately represents their emotions, without needing to resort to cursing. For instance, using adjectives or adverbs that describe precisely the situation or the emotions can be more productive and efficient.

1. Frequent cursing in everyday use can have a harmful impact on the quality and nuances of language. Overuse of profanities can lead to language deteriorating, and taking an analytical approach to communication becomes challenging. It can even decline into a habit that individuals struggle to break away from, ultimately representing them as poorly educated.
1. Cursing can, in fact, deteriorate language and make communication less effective. While emotions, including those associated with frustration or anger, are normal and need expression, diversity regarding language used in communication provides more room for nuances and valuable differences in perspectives. One should prioritize the quality of the language used and search for other ways to express their emotions without resorting to cursing, promoting healthy and productive communication. 

Even the ""cool"" slang use of cursing only serves to hinder the quality of everyday communication. While curse words, like any other word, can technically be used as an adjective, it is not an effective way of communicating a message. Using curse words as adjectives only serves to degrade the message's quality and to limit one's vocabulary to a few words. Replacement with more appropriate and precise adjectives can make the communication more comprehensive and more effective, conveying the message faster and with more focus. 

Overreliance on cursing leads to minimization of communication skills and ultimately unhealthy communication routines. Communication quality depends on the length and breadth of knowledge regarding the topic being discussed. Replacing curse words with more precise adjectives could have listeners and readers understand the message more clearly and concisely. It also makes room for nuances and subtlety in communication.

Moreover, substituting proper adjectives with curse words creates barriers to understanding for people who may not interpret the language in the same way. Instead of using curse words, using more appropriate adjectives can help to convey more positive or informative sentiments."

I am all for equality in any shape or form. I believe that there are genuine, systemic injustices that need to be righted. Race, gender, sex, and sexuality come to mind as areas with a long history of power imbalance, but I do not believe the current avenue is the correct path. As a disclaimer, my perspective comes as a straight white man with a middle-class upbringing. I posit that wokeism, while efficacious in outing injustices, is not productive in achieving equality.

I truly do not believe that empowerment of one population requires disempowerment of another. In other words, for women and minorities to be elevated in society, it does not require tearing men down. Power is not fixed nor finite. Equality is not achieved by tipping the scales of justice in the opposite direction from what it's been. It is about *balance.* That means all parties must be considered. Perhaps this is where my argument is flawed. Maybe what I sense as ""disempowerment"" is my white privilege (which I acknowledge as a very real power imbalance in our society) being exposed and dismantled.

On that premise, it would appear that wokeism appears to be ""getting back"" at privileged white men.  I am only 21 years old and given the political climate I was born into, I have become very aware of these injustices, and I wish to contribute to the solution. But that effort has proved challenging.

Take for instance the ""k\*ll all men"" mantra. Does this include the men that are willing to work toward equality? Misandry does *not* eradicate misogyny. On several experiences at my university, I have felt disempowered due to my identity, with one colleague even posing the question ""How do I prevent only white men in my class from raising their hand and giving their opinion?"" Rather, shouldn't the question be ""How do I empower women and minorities to raise their hands and offer their opinion?"" Some might argue that now I know how it feels to be unfairly judged because of my identity, but what good does that achieve?

I apologize for the terrible history that my race and sex has long upheld, but I make this post because I realize my perspective may be flawed and I want to be better. But this is a new generation with different values. Am I not allowed a seat at the table despite acknowledging injustice and a willingness to help?

Change my view.

EDIT: Thank you all for helping me clarify this stance. As /u/destro23 said, there is an expression that goes ""when you are used to privilege, equality feels like oppression."" Perhaps my (old) view stems from the feelings that resemble that shift. I am okay with my privilege being subtracted if it means equality, but I did not realize the discomfort that would bring. Thank you for helping me rationalize these feelings.

As for ""wokeism,"" it would be appear that it is a term that has been co-opted by conservative media as a catch-all for any social or cultural shift they do not support. I had my suspicions about this, but thank you for providing necessary examples to prove this is as true. I will refrain from conflating that term with equality. 

Conclusion: I should not dwell on the extremes of an ideology to be representative of the true, well-meaning intentions of a path toward more just and equal future. I truly did not mean to offend anyone with this post. Thank you for educating me and providing a crucial perspective on understanding the impacts of my privilege.

Not only that but I had to have a doctor diagnosis, request forms, fill out forms, submit forms, etc. 

Between the lacking accomodations policy, the apathetic staff, and the multi step process of proving that I deserve it I just gave up. 

Why should I have to prove that I deserve to be comfortable at my job? Why should I be *sick enough* by their judgement to be granted the bare minimum? 

I now know I need clearly written instructions, more time to complete projects, frequent small breaks to visit the restroom, and earbuds with music to concentrate (a very common accommodation for autistics), and subsequently similar accomodations to that of a deaf person. 

I shouldn't have to beg for that. If someone needs these things they should just be able to go to the boss or HR, ask for the accomodations to be put on file, and given the ability to have those accomodations ASAP.

Government jobs should be pegged to a similar job in the private sector. Offering pension plans and compensation private companies can not afford because they can’t just raise taxes to fill a budget deficit should never be ok. 

I am all for government having qualified people working for it, but real economic growth is done by private companies. Government jobs should never be more incentivized than the private sector. 

It seems like government jobs are slowly becoming more desirable than private jobs which I see as an issue as government jobs do not “add value” to the economy (e.g. government does not create more tax revenue, companies and people working for companies do).

Edit 1: to clarify, I where you are coming from and I agree, companies should pay fairly. But I think it is a separate issue. I am worried about sustainable budgets in the government. Companies are forced to balance their books or they go out of business. Most of the time governments with a problem raise taxes to cover the loss.

While I agree that science has done more good than harm, usually whenever scientists make this argument, they reference something like fertilizer or vaccines. In my view, while science in general has been an overall benefit to society, science that relates to one group of humans supposedly being better than the other, has been a net negative, and should be discarded to the flames regardless of the evidence.

Examples of what I think should be discarded include: IQ tests, the notion that men are naturally more inclined to commit violence than women, the notion that people under 25 have underdeveloped brains, the notion that trans people are not the gender they identify as, etc.

This view comes from a deeply utilitarian perspective, and I am less interested in the truth of any of the examples provided, and more interested in whether acknowledging supposed scientific truths is a benefit to society or not."

Like I'm not saying, let's say if he did actually commit crimes, that Republicans would do anything about it. In fact I'm saying they probably wouldn't and that goes for a jury as well.

It will all boil down to the jury and I feel as if in this case they would be extremely emotionally driven. Also, every member of the jury will most likely than not heard of Trump and already have formed an opinion one way or the other. Just look anywhere on social media, everyone has an opinion one way or another and I truly feel like there's a high chance they would go based off that instead of the evidence provided.. On top of that, the fact that where it's taking place already voted against him once.

If they do try their best to select a jury from both sides, then it will, I assume, continuously result in mistrial.

I don't believe the legal system was built to be able to handle a situation such as this one. It is after all, unprecedented.

I understand that there may be a chance it's a fair trial, I'm just saying highly improbable. And of course I cannot prove it and neither can you if we have to go based on facts so let's please understand that as the basis for the discussion (unless I'm wrong on this, which feel free to go ahead.)

I do hope someone is able to change my view, otherwise I'll continue to be highly concerned about the future of the political system if both sides start going after eachother, whether or not a crime is committed because that means innocent politicians could be found guilty and others may continue to roam free based on internal corruption (aka, if they grease enough hands they might get away with it.) Since in any of those situations, if they have the same level of notoriety and divisiveness as Trump I also feel like it'd be impossible to have fair trials for them (e.g, Nancy Pelosi being indicted in a state that voted 88% against her.) And I'd feel the same way about the situation whether or not I'd ""like"" it personally (for example, if I'm against Trump or Pelosi, I'd obviously be emotionally okay with one or the other but I would still feel as if the trial would be inherently unfair in both cases, regardless of whether or not they're actually guilty.)

I do not believe that whether or not they're found guilty changes the situation because again, I'm saying it wouldn't be a fair trial to begin with, so the outcome would be invalidated in both cases.

Assuming the trial is very public and every American is able to view the evidence and make their own determination, I also feel as if the same divisiveness would exist (as in if he's found innocent the other side would say he's still guilty, and if he's found guilty, the other side would feel as if he's innocent.) And if it's not public, both sides have even more ammo if it doesn't go their way. So at the very least the perception will be that there wasn't a fair trial, for at least a good portion of all Americans.

I'll be around to reply for the next 3 hours per the rules but I'm cleaning my apartment so it'll be in bursts.

(edit) By the way I'm not claiming to have a solution and I'm not saying we should just let people get away with stuff, just that it'd be insanely difficult if not impossible for the trial to be fair."

As successive Israeli governments seem to be more and more open in their hatred for Palestinians and even their opposition seems happy to go along with it, it's clear that Palestinians are in danger of being oppressed further.

It seems that any criticism of Israel has been deemed to be anti-semitic despite the judgment of all human rights organisations. Palestinian suffering is not allowed to be mentioned or discussed and people are forced to accept the Israeli governments narrative or be censored by both the right and centre left in the US and UK.

Recently the Israeli government has gotten a lot of criticism but only because its actions may effect Israelis. Its aggression towards Palestinians is ignored and criticism of it is called anti-semitic. Western countries seem happy to support Israel while it displaces and kills Palestinians and the protests against the government don't do anything to change this.

*Tl;dr:* Given Israel's growing determination to oppress Palestinians, western willingness to support Israel as it goes about this and the increasing censorship of anyone who complains, I believe Israel will establish an apartheid state where Palestinians are denied basic rights, ethnically cleansed to make room for Israelis and treated as being less than human, all while still being treated as if its a perfect nation by its Western allies."

I normally like Lin Manuel Miranda as a songwriter; I just wish he would tell different stories from the standard Millennial tropes of “Generational Trauma + first-generation immigrant learns to love their status quo” which is so prevalent in In the Heights and Encanto. I might be alone in this but I don’t view music or musicals as therapy for my family issues

Historically speaking I think it’s really insulting to call Alexander Hamilton an “immigrant” just because he happened to be born in Jamaica. The USA did not exist when he was born; he was a White English Protestant who never had to face H1-b visa lottery or immigration laws limiting the amount of people who can come to the USA. There was no OPT in his time that said immigrants have to have a job with Visa sponsorship within 90 days or leave the country. He did not face discrimination from people born in the colonies, learn English as a 2nd language, or acclimate to a society with a different mass religion. 

In fact, historically speaking, Hamilton would be more similar to Trump than Jefferson. He favored protectionism for American businesses, he was ferociously anti-Democracy even by the standards of his generation - he believed that only rich landowners deserved to vote and that British culture was to be put on a higher status in the US society above all others; he was notoriously anti-immigrant (it was Jefferson who pushed for generous immigration policies) - Hamilton has been called the first American reactionary for good reason. 
The musical also promotes this really disgusting idea that Hamilton was against slavery and that his early death prevented abolition? In reality there’s no evidence Hamilton took any steps against slavery and we actually know he was a slave broker for Eliza’s family (the Schuylers were big plantation slaveowners). 

Not to mention, the fact that the genuinely admirable figures in the Revolution like Thomas Paine, John and Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, Govenour Morris, etc. who DID speak against slavery, are all sidelined or made fun of in the musical? Really dishonest. Even Aaron Burr did more against slavery than Hamilton or Washington.

In a weird way, Hamilton sort of represents everything I dislike about elite urban millennial culture - the tendency to view history and politics through the lens of modern pop culture and vice versa. Maybe it’s my Gen Z brain I dunno. It gives off a similar vibe as Harry Potter - there’s something uncanny and out of touch about the way it explores its themes. 

I guess this is why, even though I SHOULD be the target audience for Hamilton considering I am literally an immigrant with similar circumstances as the lead character, I find its messages really distasteful. 

The Schuyler Sisters song is also really cringe lyrically for me. In fact, a lot of the lyrics are kind of cringe since Lin Manuel tries to cram in all this complex legal jargon into rap lyrics and it doesn’t always flow. I still like Tik Tik Boom and Encanto though."
0,2023-04-02,"CMV: Heaven, the way Christians describe it, sounds like a Communist surveillance state to me",u/bundaracer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/129ogbn/cmv_heaven_the_way_christians_describe_it_sounds/,changemyview,"I was minding my business yesterday when a pair of Baptist’s approached me and asked to speak about Heaven, and God, and sin and repentance. I had a reasonably fruitful conversation (even with the subtext that my status as a nonbeliever implies eternal damnation to them). Nonetheless, I left the conversation with an even more pronounced confusion about the meaning of Heaven.

My stated personal belief for a long time has been that eternal consciousness without rest is it’s own form of damnation, whether I exist in a happy or miserable plane of existence. But even this blanket opinion doesn’t really come to the root of my discomfort about the implications of Heaven.

The Bible states that people will not sin in Heaven. Since we won’t have any needs in Heaven, there will not be any need for sin by extension. However, how does this square with the concept of “needing” to sin as it pertains to free will? Should I interpret Heaven as a state of eternal pacification where you “hear no evil, see no evil,” and merely exist as a semi-conscious sentient entity, or that your free will is still retained and you exist for eternity in fear of being subversive? To spice this argument further, both of these concepts seem fundamentally identical to the Communist ideal, whereby the state will provide for your every need, and by extension you have no necessity for subversion.

What about Heaven am I interpreting incorrectly here?"

However, I've been thinking about the concept of gender a lot recently after hearing a discussion about it between some of my friends a few weeks ago. While listening, it seemed as if they weren't able to provide any sort of definition for what it meant to be a girl or boy which had me confused. What was the point of having these categories and being assigned to them if they were meaningless?

So I did some more research, read articles from people who were trans, people who were anti-trans, and general discussions about trans people. I was still not certain of my understanding on the matter. Though after I was watching a few episodes of Pokemon and I noticed that Jessie and James are each very fluid in gender expression, both dressing up in masculine, femine disguises often (and pulling it off amazingly) without anyone seeing it as problematic or odd, and also none of the pokemon are referred to by gender-revealing pronouns. 

This made me think a little bit and I came to a realization assigning someone to a certain gender changes nothing about who they are, how they are allowed to express themselves, or anything else about them really. If someone says they identify as a girl and uses she/her pronouns, there are no other definitive facts about them you are able to assume from this and the same goes for he/him or they/them. A person that identifies as a girl and a person that identifies as a boy may be the same in pretty much every way. 

So I don't think that gender is a real or important concept. People should be free to be whoever they are, their gender offers literally no restrictions on that other than randomly made societal structures and rules. I no longer see the point of fighting over a made up, meaningless system of categorization or how it even became such a big divided topic. 

The only definitive difference between people is their physical structure, which doesn't change anything else about who they are. We are literally all just people who should be able to fluidly express ourselves in our interests, way of dress, and anything else without this dumb categorization system that just causes more hate and anger between people."

My roommate is now calling me a racist/xenophobe for choosing to do that with only those articles and videos as my evidence, while I don't think it is true.

The US does not care if oil is sold for dollars, euros, yuan, or seashells. There is no secret treaty, and there is no evidence of a secret treaty.

Every time oil markets get decimated (I'm talking free-fall prices), the Dollar continues to out compete every single other currency on the face of the planet  - and NONE of the people who bring up the petrodollar argument can say why.

The truth is, the petrodollar isn't even in the top 3 reasons behind demand for USD. The main reason behind the demand for USD is access to US capital markets. There are sovereign wealth funds that are greater in market valuation than the GDP of most nations (Abu Dhabi is at 1 trillion+ USD) MOST of this capital is invested in US equities and bonds because there is no where else to invest such large swathes of capital, while also generating a relatively competitive return.

The demand for dollars can also be attributed to the political stability of the US (despite what we hear on the media - investors consider the system to be the best of the worst)

The whole ""freedom to those who don't want to sell oil in dollars argument"" (which is an entirely different debate) is out dated. I don't think wars like the ones in the past can be waged so easily, given the current dynamics of geopolitics and even domestic politics.

Despite the fed manifesting more from thin air than the GDP of a country like Germany, the dollar still outcompetes every other currency. This doesn't say much about the dollar as it has devalued. It says ALOT about the worth of other currencies. It is very clear that despite the fact that the fed has been exporting its inflation overseas, all the other central banks have been doing their very fair share of printing and because their currencies aren't as in demand, they can't afford such an optionality.

My view is that Christianity started out as a very small sect of Jewish- Christians in 1st century Judea. A real man named Jesus preached about the end of the world and perhaps peace and love, and Roman oppression. The romans didn’t like this so they crucified him and he died. A few of his followers believed he would come back and continued preaching his message to fellow Jews. 

Then Paul comes into the picture and wants to start converting non jews. Soon the non jews became the majority in the Sect. Once Jesus’s earliest followers began to die off, someone using their name start writing down the gospels with information they received via Oral tradition. This oral tradition evolved like a game of telephone and extradionary and magical additions were added in order to recruit more followers.

The earliest Gospel, Mark, shows signs of this because it ends quite abruptly with simply a empty tomb and women running out in fear. Later Gospels added the stories about resurrections etc 

The early Christians met in secret and had strange ceremonies. All very cultish. The Romans were religiously tolerant but the Christians meeting in secrets made them targets of persecution. It was most popular among slaves and women. Eventually it spread to Emperor Constantine, who made it the national religion. Then European colonization and immigration spread it all over the world. 

If it wasn’t Christianity it would of been Islam or something else. Change my view!"

I am an agnostic atheist. What that means is I don't accept the God claim. However, I am not asserting that a God doesn't exist, as that also requires a burden of proof that can't be met. 

For the burden of proof, the threshold I use for what should be considered evidence is the same one used in criminal trials. There's a reason courts don't allow certain evidences, as they are unreliable. If hearsay isn't good enough to convict someone of a crime, then it's also not good enough to convince someone that a God exists.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I have been provided evidence in the past, but none of it has been extraordinary. Because of that, I am yet to be convinced of the claims. I am open to believing anything as long as there is sufficient evidence to warrant belief, so please, if I'm wrong then change my view. Let me know that religions have indeed met their burden of proof."

Also, I am not arguing whether cannibalism is moral, I'm arguing whether it should be legal, which I believe it should be. First, I do not believe cannibalism should be encouraged by any means. It is defidently, to some extent, unhealthy. But we do lots of unhealthy things. Smoking is legal, alcohol is legal, lots of drugs are legal in most places. People also do bdsm(no I don't have a kink for cannibalism). Something being unhealthy does not mean it should be illegal. Second, many argue against this because it is murder/suicide. People do not have to die just for cannibalism. You could eat somebody's limb or just do something as small as drinking their blood from a syringe. I'm not talking about assisted suicide, that's a whole other topic. Third, the argument they're insane. This is the most common one. I feel calling them insane is inheritly hostile. However somebody can be detained against their will if they're considered a danger to themselves or others, so I'll go with this. Autocannibals are no more of a danger to themselves than smokers or people who do drugs. If they're on the verge of killing themselves you have an argument, but that's rare. Consensual cannibalism could be compared to bdsm in this regard. Bdsm often ends in damages, but the 'doms' aren't considered a danger to others. I've never understood how cannibalism could always have been the universal taboo. Anyways, I'd love to hear other perspectives.

- Musk is a cynical tycoon who became a Republican and started spreading self-serving conspiracy theories when his workers unionized and it was politically expedient. *(Also obvious, all billionaires will become right wingers if you try to hold them accountable, but that isn’t relevant to the discussion)*
- This won’t stop all the bots. *(Sure, but it’ll probably stop a lot of them. It’s harder to mass-produce bots if you have to pay. The fact that a safeguard isn’t 100% effective 100% of the time doesn’t mean it’s useless.)*

That being said, I still support decriminalization as long as it is careful and has good social programs to compensate for the change.

Prison sentences have two purposes, to punish in retribution or/and￼￼ keep dangerous individuals away from the public. Drug addicts ￼are only hurting themselves, and there is no justification that this behavior is worth retribution￼￼. Rather than punish them, we should help them, and prison doesn’t do this. In fact, it mainly makes their problems worse. ￼￼ Secondly, ￼it does not keep dangerous individuals away from the public￼ because these individuals mostly aren’t dangerous. However, even for the few that are, rehabilitation through prison is very ineffective, so they will likely still be dangerous when released.

I propose that all prison sentences for drug addicts ￼ be replaced by mandatory rehab. Records ￼ would only be accessible by companies hiring for positions that deal with dangerous machinery or pharmaceuticals. 

This only applies to the American prison system and prison systems like the American prison system.￼ This probably isn’t necessary for countries like Denmark which are much more focused on rehabilitation￼.￼

Edit: I know rehab is hard and it will be hard to create an effective program. However I’m sure that we can at least figure out something more effective than prison. As for cost the same logic applies, yes this will be expensive, but the money saved by not imprisoning, drug addicts can easily pay for the increased rehab facilities.

I also know that drug addicts do cause some harm, but prison isn’t an effect measure to prevent the harm since most reoffend when released. Prison sentences are in effective deterrent for most crimes like robbery, murder, etc and criminalizing them makes it less likely for dangerous individuals to cause harm. The main difference with criminalizing drug usage is that prison sentences aren’t effective at preventing dangerous individuals from causing harm.

\- Increase the pool of combat ready persons

\- Decrease over-exertion injuries related to moving heavy objects for both men and women, since women could now help men move heavy objects

This has been banned in the EU since 2004. Really the 80s with their water laws.Atrazine is the second most common pesticide in america. It destroys habitats, and has finally been banned in Hawaii and a handful of other US territories as of 2020. Scientific findings have been actively targeted by Syngenta(Makers of Atrazine) and agricultural lobbyists with board seats owned by Syngenta consultants. They even found emails back in 2014 from Syngenta employees looking how to discredit the man(psychologically and even had people follow him to dispute him at conferences) who defected from the company and spoke up.

These are all fine ways to address a man without using his name. ""How's it going, dude?"" ""Hey, man."" ""Good job, bud.""

But I can't find a single good word to address a woman this way. All these words sound weird when used on a woman.

Sure, you could just say her name. But sometimes you need to address someone whose name you don't know. For example, ""Hey, man, you dropped your keys."" Even for someone whose name you know, it would feel weird to say it all the time, so we need decent generic, casual substitutes.

Ma'am and miss are too formal. Miss isn't as bad as ma'am and in some situations it can be *okay*. But it still casts the interaction in an unnecessarily formal light.

The word woman should in theory work, since man works fine. But if you say ""Hey, woman"" out loud, you'll find you sound like a douchebag. The same goes for lady.

Sweetie might be okay for a little girl. But if you address a grown woman as sweetie, you're once again a douchebag.

You could argue dude is gender neutral enough that you can use it for women. But I've tried this and gotten mixed reactions, so it doesn't make the cut.

A good test for whether a word fits the bill is the sentence, ""Hey, ______ , you dropped your keys."" If your proposed female name substitute sounds off in this example, it's not good enough.

Calling a woman nothing at all is a shitty solution. Sure, you could simply say, ""Hey, you dropped your keys."" But it feels natural to call a person by something, even when you don't know their name. And this is an even worse answer for situations where you need to get the person's attention.

My view is limited to North American English. I'm Canadian and Americans don't seem to have any decent generic words for addressing women, either. Other English dialects may have words that work, such as mate or lass, but they aren't present in North American English. This may change in the future, but I'm talking about the present.

The American south may also have a decent word that's slipping my mind at the moment. But this still wouldn't help, since the American south is even having trouble spreading y'all to other dialects. And y'all would be a very useful word in a language with no other plural form of you.

I would love someone to change my view on this. Because it's annoying not having any way to address a woman without using her name."

The trauma of the conscious experience is forever condemned to this drug. No human has broken free of the affinity of belief, in fact, the entirety of human experience is predicated in the belief that we are alive, we think what we think, we feel what we feel, we know what we know. It is inevitable. It is the code that we run on, inscribed within our DNA, the essence of being human. We are therefore in a never ending struggle to cope with the trauma of existence, both externally and internally. 

One of the most contentious belief systems is that of religion. It is at the heart of the most existential question, how did everything come to be as it is, however it is, if it even exists. God is the simplest answer, the answer that soothes the trauma of a meaningless existence, the trauma that each human experiences. By equating God to something even beyond comprehension, we can ensure that as long as we subscribe to this belief system, we are forever shielded from any trauma that our lack of understanding of the world around us can cause. It is the belief to unlock immortality. Therefore, it obviously merits diligent scrutiny as it can fundamentally alter the nature of the human experience. Whether the God is the Sun, Nature, Knowledge, it is essential that it has the property of omnipotence in the mind of the individual interacting with the belief system.

Now I will come to my question for the atheist. The defining feature of Atheism is to refute the belief that there is a God of any kind. Atheism as it exists today has been created from the post-Enlightenment era, born as a result of embracing rationality and scientific inquiry that negates the existence of a God. It strips God as the one with the answer to the purpose, if any, of existence. It is a belief system of the modern world, the world as described by science and not religion. The advancement of science has only served to catalyze the acceptance of Atheism globally. Yet, there is a logical query that arises in my mind.

 The use of science and its ability to unlock the questions of reality is predicated on the assumption that the laws of science are universal i.e. have been attributed the notion of immortality. The issue with this belief is in the acceptance of science as the true language of reality when there is no proof that even the biggest assumptions of science are fundamentally true. Our own understanding of science is within the limited lens of our conscious experience and although science has revealed many truths, these truths are never fundamental as the scientific method is based in formulating hypotheses, which will always question the established truths in order to refine them. An example would be the evolution of the concept of gravity over 300 years from the mind of Newton to Einstein. Belief in science as a substitute to a meaningless existence, only serves to accept that any fundamental truth acquired does not possess immortality. 

Another example would be the beginning of time. The definition of time is limited even within the scope of the most brilliant of human minds. Because reality in itself is not fully understood, to try to capture it within the framework of time is another attempt to immortalize the existence of time as a fundamental truth to initiate the scientific method. And yet, the most widely accepted theory as to the beginning of time, the Big Bang is still at its best, a theory. It cannot achieve the status of immortality as a fundamental truth. Therefore, it begs to question that if scientific method is truly the path to immortality, then it serves to negate the traumas of all those that cannot fully unlock the true depths of understanding that science can offer. It negates the experience of Newton as he revolutionized the understanding of reality as it was only as close to objective reality as Einstein. Who will remain immortal only to hand over the baton to the next great thinker. Belief in the scientific method is the acceptance that objective reality will never truly attain immortality as it can only exist within the limits of the being itself.

The acceptance of the constraints of human intelligence also confounds the true value of Atheistic belief. There is a possibility that we will never be able to ever answer the existential questions. For example, we may be able to state that there are 200 billion trillion stars ie a number with 21 zeroes. Considering that it is hard enough to comprehend the reality of our star, the Sun, it is beyond our comprehension to truly grasp the magnitude of that number. A number that only came into being because of science but that only serves to highlight the insignificance of our being in the cosmic fairytale. The fact that scientific discovery actually uncovers the sheer scale of the limits to our understanding of the cosmos is counter intuitive to someone utilizing scientific discovery as a means to overcome the irrational and unproven lure of a diety. 

And so, if Atheism serves to heal the trauma of a meaningless existence then it succumbs to the intrinsic limitations of the scientific method. It is the immortal belief that the entire universe can ultimately be processed into finer truths but there is no immortal truth that cannot withstand the scientific method as applied by the human itself. Therefore, it is a toothless weapon to combat the notion of a meaningless existence. It cannot compare to God, which is a fundamentally omnipotent concept that is free of this limitation. The God of Newton is also the God of Einstein, it will remain consistent throughout eternity. I believe it is because the concept of God has this inherent omnipotence, it serves as a more consistent belief system to be able to navigate the trauma of reality. The scientific method serves a tool to connect the immortality of God to the conscious experience rather than to question its very existence.

Even then so many aspects of your life like healthcare are still in the hands of your parents until you find a reasonable replacement. I think children need more support that is separate from their parents, more rights, and they should have some ability to decide their paths in life(within reason).

As it is now being a child means living under parents potentially authoritarian rule, going to school for ungodly amounts of time with excessive testing and school systems that care more about money and political leverage than the children they serve, and having no choice of what you are doing in life unless you have incredible parents. I know this is a difficult situation as there are so many children that need care and this is how things have been done but that shouldn't be an excuse. 

Being honest I don't exactly know what should be done to solve this problem but I still feel that children are entirely too mistreated considering we all start life as children. So many children have to deal with abuse whether verbal, physical, or sexual with no recourse. people always say childhood is the best time of your life but that's only because life gets harder and worse as you age and take on more responsibility not because being a child is actually fun or less stressful. it's a sad state of affairs when innocent kids are traumatized and abused because we aren't critical enough of the systems and conditions most children are in at schools, doctors offices, sports practices, etc"

This wasn't just subjugation of a ethnic group. This was total control over their land, what they could grow, what they could not grow and deciding where said food would go to. I mean, entire governments had covert operations to cover up their literal war crimes and luckily said papers are burnt so you can't definitely deny that they didn't contain war crimes. (I'm looking at your Operation Legacy). 

The reason I think it's a far worse crime than people realise is that colonization truly set the world in the mold that you see today. The one's who profited of colonialism and it's brutal exploitation and the one's who suffered. Is it any real surprise that the 'third world' is almost exclusively colonized nations? 

Now you may reason, but these were crimes of the past, no point in apologizing now. I disagree. If England can hold onto Portugal as their oldest allies due to a Treaty in 1386, it can and it should, as successors to the terror state that was the British Empire, apologise. 

One might argue if that's the case then every nation should apologise to every other nation. To that I say, sure. If your nation was overseen by state-sanctioned colonialism, then yes you have every right to demand an apology. And don't let anyone from a colonizing country tell you otherwise.

Everyone's afraid of China growing in power but I for one gladly welcome our new Chinese overlords. Finally, y'all will be the ones on the other boot and I can finally talk semantics on whether something is offensive or not."
0,2023-04-03,CMV: ***HOT TAKE*** Trans rights activism indirectly and unintentionally whitewashes the very real struggles that biological women go through every day in their lives.,u/godlike_hikikomori,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12b7qa3/cmv_hot_take_trans_rights_activism_indirectly_and/,changemyview,"First and foremost, I am personally a ""live and let live"" person; and it's not even because of political reasons. I believe I am just generally an easy going person as many of my friends and family have told me and noticed about me throughout the years. That's just who I am. Frankly, I do not give a damn whether someone identifies as the opposite gender or even another animal/object. More power to them. Let them live the lives they choose for themselves.  I just want to get this out there, because I am fully aware that I am providing my fellow Redittors with a very hot take here as it can be read from this post's title.

So, I've already made the case that I don't have a problem with trans people themselves. However, what I have sort of a beef with is that there are a number of trans activists, especially if they're trans who identify as women, who tend to take the higher moral ground when it comes to women's issues and rights. Unfortunately, as a guy who have personally heard and tried to understand the very real everyday struggles that biological women go through, I just cannot bring myself to let their attempts at claiming a moral ground slide through my logical and moral rationale.

My mother, my girlfriend, my aunts, and my many cousins have told me various stories about having to go through the excruciating pains of menstruation, pregnancy, and female-exclusive viral/bacterial diseases. As a guy myself, I know that I cannot possibly truly understand how it feels because I don't have this sort of biological mechanism myself. Dealing with all these female sex exclusive issues, from what I've heard many times, takes a lot of grit and a lot of intelligence when it comes to planning when your possible cramps and periods will occur during social situations(at work, school, parties, and hangouts). The social stakes are quite high for them actually.

So, you see, this is why I cannot really take a trans woman seriously when she says she claims a ""first hand experience"" when it comes to women's issues. Perhaps, if trans activists were more cognizant if this dilemma, maybe their movement would gain more legitimacy and rapport.

Also, the recent controversy surrounding trans athletes, I believe, is just adding fuel to the fire to people's concerns. I don't believe female athletes should have to enter an athletic environment that is unfair. The reality is that trans women who have transitioned  well into their male phase puberty still have their bone density, structure, and lung capacities maintained, despite their new levels of estrogen in their bodies. It's not fair for the biological female athletes, and it's also not fair for sports enthusiasts either; because the thing about competitive sports is that it profits from one thing: ""unpredictability"". Having one athlete who appears to have the upper hand in experience and biology will make a tournament or game all too much predictable for viewers and for the sports bets industry.

And so, these are the kinds of discussions that we all must be having to truly ensure that everyone just gets treated fairly at a societal level.

I'm open to any kind of additional insight to this discussion, or perhaps, a counterpoint to my rationale itself, regarding the unintentional invalidation of women's issues due to the excesses of trans activism."
0,2023-04-03,CMV: Forced representation of minorities in medias does more harm than good,u/JoyIkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12b7zwl/cmv_forced_representation_of_minorities_in_medias/,changemyview,"Forced representation of minorities (POC, LGBT people, etc) usually turn other members of society against the minorities. By forced representation, I mean changing the race of a established characters, intentionally make certain characters worse/wrong in an an reasonable manner only to make certain characters look better, etc.

The goal of representation is to normalize the appearance of minorities in medias by giving them more exposure. This is a reasonable effort but the current method of forced representation only makes things worse for the following reasons:

1. You can not normalize something by making a big deal out of it. If everytime the media does something to promote representation, they have to make a big deal out of it then how do they expect people to get used to it? Trying to bait people with headlines about the first this, the first that is never going to get people to normalize those things,

2. Forced representation such as race swapping only make minorities stand out more as opposed to becoming mundane. If you swap the race of an established character, that will be all everyone is focused on. Also, it will turn other people who loved the character into your opposition. A character's look is important to fans and fans don’t like change. Antagonizing people will only hurt your cause.

3. Race swapping established characters do not empower minorities. If anything, it shows that minorities have nothing to call their own and have to steal established characters. It implies that minorities have no imagination and cannot come up with compelling characters and stories while the reality is the opposite. 

4. Endorsing forced representation kills off the opportunities for original POC characters and stories. Why create new POC characters that might not pan out when we can just race swap existing characters? If the medias truly care about actual representation then they should give original POC characters and stories more chance as opposed to regurgitating the same characters just with a different skin tone.

I believe the reason behind the current state of representation is due to the impatient nature of Americans (which I am not), or at least this generation of Americans. They want instant gratification and results, they want to solve big problems instantly and with no effort but that is not how life works. These efforts take years if not decades to go anywhere but since most people don’t really care about their so-called causes, their attention span cannot last that long. For example: Lets say there are more successful men in Wall street than women. If you want to change that, you would have to start from the bottom. Encourage little girls to take an interest in the stockmarket, destroy the stereotypes of only man can be successful Wall street bankers, etc. But such efforts take years or decades to actually show results. Instead, they would say that Wall Street is sexist and demand that big trade companies take in more women. Basically, they want the roof but dont want to build the foundation. Such cheap representation does nothing but:

1. Make minorities complacent about their position in society despite no actual changes being done;

2. Antagonize minorities in the eyes of certain people who would have been neutral otherwise;

3. Give privileged people a dose of dopamine and make them forget about making actual changes to help out minorities.

In the end, it only appealed to the egos of the privileged and provides no meaningful changes in the lives of minorities, or even worse, prevents any actual changes from being enacted."

I want to check my biases at the door and realize that I've had a very left-leaning education when it comes to the peoples' history of the United States. I could be totally mistaken for having this view, there could be some self-identifying Libertarian heroes who made strides for universal rights and suffrage as their political creed demanded.

But I can't think of anyone who ever actually did this under the banner of ""Libertarianism"" as we would recognize it today. As far back as the Revolution, there were abolitionists and manumissionists, but where were the Libertarians when Jim Crowe was in full-swing?

So I think if the shares they hold are being taxed even if they don't take them out this would solve the problem. I.e: if the shares go up 5 billion in a year, they are taxed on that 5 billion as if they earned it. If they lost money then they don't have to be taxed on that but would still have to be taxed as normal on the loans that they take out. For the purposes of fairness, this would apply to everyone and not only the rich, and would just be added on top of the persons' income(I.e if they earn 60k a year and the stocks they own went up 10k, for tax purposes it would be the same as them earning 70k)"

Trying to name your child after them, SPECIFICALLY, is really, really, disrespectful to your child's individuality as a person because, lo and behold, what made a difference on your life might have zero meaning on your children's life. 

Naming your child after biblical figures is really uncreative and unoriginal, but, naming your child after a relative and/or because it's a ""family tradition""? That's egotistical, backwards and antiquated. It only creates a generational expectation and pressure on the child and the parent who doesn't want to follow said traditions. It's not a tradition? Fine, then you just got high expectations for the child to be more like the relative whose they take the name from plus the purgatory of always having to explain they are their own person.

Naming your child after yourself? That's narcissistic and kinda creepy.  You feel so important that you think that your kid needs to bear a name they must ""honor"". This one is also very specific to me because I was named after my dad and every time I did something he didn't like, he would constantly say shit like ""you're nothing like me"". Well, yeah, no shit, I have my own sets of ideals and beliefs, but having the name of your parent also comes with them wanting you to be their exact carbon copy.

When you’re in a monogamous relationship, my understanding is that both partners have agreed to strict commitment to one partner for their sexual and romantic needs. Viewing pornographic material during masturbation involves a person who is not their partner to fulfill sexual needs. To me, that breaks the agreement to a monogamous relationship by involving that second person, even if it is one sided. I do believe everyone has the right to masturbate and take care of their sexual needs in a relationship. However, I believe that the involvement of porn is not necessary in masturbation, and that the involvement of porn would be cheating. 

I would like to clarify that I am only talking about porn that involves videos of real people. Not animated porn like hentai. I haven’t made up my mind on that, it’s a gray area to me. 

And please, for the love of everything, don’t give me unsolicited advice on my relationship. I was previously attacked and received aggressive responses with plenty of name calling because I don’t want my partner to watch porn. What works for me might not work for everyone. I’m not telling anyone that they can’t watch porn in a relationship or that they’re a terrible person for it. My partner and I have the same views on porn and the rules and boundaries we have are working great for us. Nobody needs to be trying to fix a problem in my relationship that does not exist.

Edit: I have changed my view. I’m leaving my original post up, but I would like to say that there was one comment that definitely had me sit back and think and change the way I look at this. I developed these opinions because I personally am not capable of feeling attraction to anyone but my partner when in a relationship. I realize now that it has nothing to do with monogamy, but with my own sexuality. Thank you everyone for your input!"

Having someone wait while trying to fight while the dot is still ticking just gives a count down till the opposite side is dead while dealing more damage just to speed it up. (This side is ment for turn base or Simi rouge games)

The other half is, why waste the time to kill when you can kill right away (ment for more fast pace, .io type games where it helps to be close to target when said damage is done)

Only credit I'll give now is dot when it was first added was a neat featu, now it's kinda overused in alot of games (look at prime example borderlands,)

In saying that, I as an individual have realised that the video games I play, that a lot of others play are simply a form of entertainment from our own real lives. I was and and can still be salty about others not meeting my expectations of the game.

But that is a failure on my part as an individual with my own expectations and should not be held against others playing the same game as I for their own reasons.

This is my own personal view, but seeing how common posts on these games subreddits are,  it seems to paint the picture that I am wrong in this mentality and those voicing this opinion is the majority.

So for the gaming redditors that see this post and feel your gaming experience is being ruined by others not up to the standards you expect, please comment your reasoning as to why it's the other players fault and not your personal preference for the games you play?"
0,2023-04-04,CMV: Breaking up Ticketmaster / Live Nation will not measurably improve the fan experience - and may in fact harm it,u/AdysmalSpelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12bp8u4/cmv_breaking_up_ticketmaster_live_nation_will_not/,changemyview,"This topic is all over reddit every month or so as some artist either sells $5k tickets or ""fights back"" against ticketmaster and makes headlines. Fan outcry calls for the break up of ticketmaster and live nation, laboring under the belief that this is the magic trick that will make concert tickets affordable and acquirable again.

My experience in the industry leads me to believe this isn't going to have the outcome people want. The recent senate hearings, prompted by the Taylor Swift fiasco, spent exactly zero time addressing any of the issues related to that onsale, and hardly cracked the surface of the nature of live nation's vertical monopoly. The public and our leaders are hugely unequipped to have this discussion.

The simple fact of the matter is that concert tickets are *the definition* of a commodity - each is unique and their value is entirely subjective, and demand is exploding. Fans who want to see the most popular artists in the world will *always* pay high prices or have to get extremely lucky. Fans as a group also engage in idiotic, impulse-driven purchase behaviors that lead to inflated prices; and demand contradictory ticketing practices based on what they think would have gotten them a ticket in a given instance. There's no pleasing everyone.

In sum, fans demand the impossible due to being massively uninformed about how ticketmaster / live nation / the concert industry in general function and why. I'm not at all questioning why people are upset with high prices - but I am desperate to hear compelling arguments about how breaking up this monopoly leads to a better purchase / concertgoing experience at the arena and stadium level."
0,2023-04-04,"CMV: If x != 0, it makes the most sense to think x / 0 = ∞",u/Konato-san,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12brzpi/cmv_if_x_0_it_makes_the_most_sense_to_think_x_0/,changemyview,"x / 0 is considered to be undefined. I don't get it. As you divide anything by a lower and lower number, one that approaches zero, the result approaches infinity. So it'd make sense for x / 0 to be infinity.

I tried googling this before coming here and arguments I've seen against this position are that ""infinity isn't a real number so it can't be the result"". This doesn't convince me: if we're being fair, ""i"" isn't a real number either and yet it works just fine. We don't claim sqrt(-1) is ""undefined"". Something else I've seen is that this idea breaks down with positive/negative infinity. I'm not a very bright person, so for me, the concepts of negative/positive infinities don't actually set off any red flags in my head? I can accept that idea just fine. But still, one could argue that infinity could work the way 0 does. There's no such thing as positive or negative 0; 0\*(-1) is 0. So -5/0 is just infinity.

The title of this CMV says ""x/0=infinity when x!=0"". That's because I don't have an opinion formed on what ""0/0"" should be. It could be infinity too, it could be zero... I'm not sure. There are a bunch of ways to think about it, ways that I think differ from how one would think about x/0. For example, if I cover a distance of 8 meters in zero seconds, my speed would have to be infinity. But if it's a distance of 0 meters, then a speed of 0 m/s would work fine too.

Something else that could be used to refute my first argument is how one imagines division at all. When I was taught division back in 3rd-4th grade, my teacher explained it as ""I have \_this\_ number of, say, jellybeans. And I'm gonna share them with \_this\_ number of people. If I want everyone to have the same amount of jellybeans, how many jellybeans should everyone have?"" If you have like, two jellybeans and you're sharing them with a grand total of 0 people, it makes no sense for each of the 0 people to get ""infinity"" jellybeans each. ...But then again, the jellybeans example breaks down with negative numbers too. And with recurring decimals.

So yeah, any counter-argument I can think about, any counter-argument I've seen on Google, none of them convince me that x / 0 (x != 0) \*isn't\* infinity. Change my view?"
345,2023-04-04,CMV: Most people can't see beyond their upbringing.,u/proteomicsguru,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12btoaa/cmv_most_people_cant_see_beyond_their_upbringing/,changemyview,"Most people never bother to sit down and really question the world around them - instead, they choose the easy route and act as mindless automatons executing the programming of their upbringing. 

People tend to vote for the political party that their family votes for, and crossing party lines with respect to upbringing is rare. Worse still, once political affiliation is set in early adulthood, most people vote consistently for one party, almost mindlessly, for the rest of their lives. The same pattern even extends down to the level of individual policy items. 

People also tend to hold the same spiritual beliefs that they were brought up with. Christians breed Christians, Muslims breed Muslims, Buddhists breed Buddhists, and so on. Uncommonly, kids will reject their parents' beliefs, but even these kids tend not to go any further than calling themselves agnostic and unplugging from the conversation. You don't see a lot of people sitting down and doing deep introspection to decide for themselves what they think, in terms of the nature of reality and whatever might exist beyond it. 

This pattern exists even more strongly when it comes to cultural norms. People grow up with a certain culture and tend to adhere to that perpetually. The major exception here is when intercultural relationships (or even close friendships) happen, in which case, you learn each other's culture and occasionally incorporate small parts of it into your own life. But that's the exception, not the rule. You don't see a lot of people looking seriously at other cultures and objectively considering whether some norms are better or worse to them. 

The same thing exists for little things too. Your idea of how to clean a house probably hasn't changed much since childhood, even if parts of what you're doing are absurdly inefficient. Your idea of what constitutes leisure probably hasn't changed much either. Most people aren't looking to try new things and do things differently. Most people crave the comfort of certainty that mindless repetition provides. 

All this comes to my main view, which is that most people are intellectually lazy. They accept their programming from early life without ever bothering to think about whether some of their beliefs could be wrong, whether some of the things they do could be done better, whether some of the norms they learned ought to be unlearned, etc.  Instead of doing the mental heavy lifting of periodic introspection, the average person just develops a routine and executes it repeatedly each day because it's easy. 

I wish that people would question things more and think for themselves, but I fear that most people are unable or unwilling to do it. Great ideas often fall on deaf ears of people who'd rather not even think about change. I'd love for my pessimism about this to be proven wrong, but I'm just not seeing it. CMV."
781,2023-04-04,CMV: assisted suicide should be legalized.,u/Dizzy_Ad5789,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12bv6xz/cmv_assisted_suicide_should_be_legalized/,changemyview,"This has probably been posted before, but i’d like direct answers to try and change my opinion. Suicide is often a hush topic. I know some religions even consider suicide a sin. But why? When we have a pet that is in pain, we put them out of their misery. We have DNR’s for a reason. People don’t want to be in pain for ever. Especially in cases of severe sickness, where death is inevitable, that person is hurting, severely medicated, and often times barely coherent. If someone truly does not want to be here anymore, why do we force them? 

As for mental illness, there have been studies proven that certain people will just be ill forever. Incurable depression, unmanageable schizophrenia, debilitating PTSD, etc. These people are suffering, beyond what any of us could imagine. And what do we do? Throw them in a mental hospital, where they will live the rest of their lives taking various body-altering medications, dealing with cloudy memories, aggression, depression, and so on. 

It is inhumane to force someone miserable, to carry on being miserable. If we cannot help them, we should be able to alleviate them. People will commit suicide ANYWAYS. This way, it gives them a chance to do it right, do it safely, and have their affairs in order. Why are we allowed to give someone the death penalty, but someone actively in pain can’t be assisted out of it? Curious to see what anyone has to say!"
0,2023-04-04,CMV: Transgenderism should be accepted in order to limit suicide rates,u/SotisMC,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12bwjjh/cmv_transgenderism_should_be_accepted_in_order_to/,changemyview,"Transgenderism has always been a hard topic for me. Please be aware that my post does not regard the transgender community, nor their actions. This post has also nothing to do with the recent shooting in the US, it's just something that has been on my mind for a while.

I'll touch on a few points regarding transgenderism here. This has always been a complicated subject for me, which is why I'd love to discuss it!

&#x200B;

1. **Defining sex:** To understand transgenderism, we have to first understand gender and sex. I'm from Norway, and only met three trans people in my life (all female to male). In Norwegian we don't have seperate words to describe gender and sex, but rather one word; ""kjønn"" (this might be wrong, but we don't use anything else in a common setting at least). My understanding is that sex is used to refer to the biological nature of the body, while gender can be used to describe the idendity on a scale between masculine and feminine. Now the scale of biological sex seems to be multiple bimodal factors (hormones, genitals, reproductive organs, chromosomes etc.). My question on this topic is how many factors need to be checked in order to group said person as male/female? This is a bit of a tangent, but I want to demonstrate that sex isn't as hardcore binary as many believe. Some people are born with male genitilia and female reproductive organs etc. This makes it hard to group them, perhaps non-binary/intersex is an acceptable sex to assign.
2. **Hormonal therapy:** Hormonal therapy seems to change phenotypic characteristics such as facial hair, breast tissue etc. This seems to be some of the best treatmeant for gender dysphoria, as they feel like their look relate closer to their wanted sex. I don't see why this should be unacceptable in itself, as it affects no one but the person. I wish to ignore the discussion about testosterone within sports, as it's a complex issue. Sports alone shouldn't decide if transgenderism is acceptable or not, therefore I find it redundant to speak on it (unless some of you have a cool solution like hormonal categories etc.).
3. **Unnatural:** I've seen people claim transgenderism is wrong simply because it ""seems unnatural"". First of all, I've yet to see why something being unnatural is inherently bad. Treatment of cancer is technically unnatural, but I think we all agree that it is beneficial to society (f\*ck off Ted Kaczynksi fans).
4. **Religion:** If your religion is intolerant of transgenderism, then alright. There's nothing I can do about you having your morals based on religion. I believe no morals are objective (as in we can't prove what is good or bad), but I think everybody benefits from having their morals based the general wellbeing of everyone. So if you use religious morals to argue here, it does no good to me. I can't refute it due to you not using factual claims about wellbeing. I guess most of you can tell I'm a pretty utilitarian guy hehe.
5. **Puberty Blockers:** I'd like to do more research on this. This issue becomes complex when kids are involved. I remember I've seen a study where about 64% of gender dysphoric children ""outgrew"" it (or became bi/gay instead). I'd love some insight into puberty blockers and how reversible they are. There seems to be conflicting information on the internet about this. I'm not sure if puberty blockers are too effective when so many kids outgrows their dysphoria. I wouldn't mind blockers if they can be reversed, and if there are no other bad consequenses for non-dysphoric kids taking them.
6. **Acceptance:** From a study I read earlier, transgender youth who were accepted by their peers have about a 33% less chance of commiting suicide. This indicates that acceptance does indeed limit suicides. The only reason I'd find it morally acceptable to not accept a trans person is if you think they create bigger problems than increased suicide rates (which is a really high bar)."

With that being said, I often hear people complaining that X and Y new machine is replacing them at work, and how it'll lead them to lose their job, and trying to actively fight against it.

Now the thing is that the real issue generally isn't so much that they'll lose their job but that they'll lose their means of living, but when they complain about the job loss, they almost never mention that, and as such don't ever mention the fact that the real issue is that they're currently part of a system that has forced the need of a job upon them, and which also is now forcing the loss of said job.

If everyone that complains about potential job loss due to automation were to start and actively fight against said system, then they could certainly end up getting rid of said system to replace it with one that don't have these issues anymore (automation will end up forcing this anyways but that's not really the question here)"

One, most of that was not that bad, and two, the hubbub that everyone makes about it is heavily political in nature. But boy did politicians get moving on prosecuting and making a scene that their lives were in danger! 

The reason I mention that, is because I feel the same thing will need to happen in order for gun reform. Government officials need to feel threatened at home. I’m not advocating it on anyway, but feel like public shootings won’t be reduced until law makers go after some of these guns and also sink some heavy money into mental health etc.

I love guns and i CCW, so don’t think of me as anti gun. But they are in many ways toys (that’s a whole other CMV). And some of them need to go.

Surely in such a ""gross sub""... to see that unique rule enforced... you'd think it would just allow all kinds of topics.. so surely, this rule has some merit to it? Whatever the reason, it must be good.

I know it sounds like we're taking more of your freedoms away if you can't talk about everything everywhere online... But. But seems that it's needed in many more subs as it can help those people who might be unwell and suddenly comes across some commenter who references, jokes about or encourages suicide. Obviously that can be an issue depending on many things, including why that person is talking about it, their intention, which may be misunderstood and end up triggering people in a really bad way.

Without getting too into it..Since Reddit isn't really about freedom-of-speech anymore, and with the rise of internet conflict in general, and mental illness on the upswing, might as well have the rule up in more subs if it's going to benefit people that might otherwise be triggered into making wrong or bad decisions, and don't need to be bombarded with those topics wherever they go.

There's certainly a lot more meme subs that seem to reference suicide, perhaps that's ok to just confine the topic to those subs, but for the rest of reddit, is it really okay if anyone can talk about suicide out in the open? Would you feel comfortable to talk to others about this or read about this every day in real life just because you can? There's a time and a place for everything. Let's keep it that way. "

Like the title says, in the 1980s, it was really hard to know what was on an album. Your 11 year old might be buying an album with some dirty lyrics and you'd never know. Parents have a responsibility to monitor what their kids are consuming, and it is helpful to have some idea about if an album requires a closer look. If your kid is buying Weird Al's Polka Party, it's most likely okay and you, as a parent, don't need to spend an hour carefully listening to a cassette tape of music you don't like. And keep in mind, if you wanted to monitor your kids music, you couldn't just put it on in the background while you're vacuuming because the whole point is to listen for content you'd rather not have your kids listening to.

Adding the label helped parents know when an album might need closer attention. These days, we have the internet and you can easily find out what's in your kids favorite songs by just googling. You can even see the lyrics and stuff, all without spending an hour listening to music you hate. 

In the 1980s, it was much harder to find out. Sure, you could ask the long haired rocker guy at the record store, but he may not know or he may not be honest with you. Or you could get a subscription to Rolling Stone and hope to find the album in there and hope the review has detail on what's on the album. 

So, all in all, I think a warning is a good idea. I don't feel that the government needs to require it, but I feel that the industry should've been doing it all along. Not censoring the material, not locking it up in the backroom. Just make it apparent to the parents that the album has stuff you may wanna take a closer look at.

CMV. Tell me why adding this label in 80s is a bad thing."

This is not about trans rights in general, so I will not really discuss that aspect. This is purely about the proposed ideas and the effect they would have.

I’m also in the UK and talking about UK law specifically, but I believe other countries have similar laws and debates, so all opinions welcome.

So, basically…

Some people believe that we should update the Equality Act 2010 to define sex as the sex you were assigned at birth, and for single-sex spaces to be therefore based on this definition. This is primarily suggested in order to limit the ability of male predators to access women’s spaces.

I think that these changes in practice would cause the opposite effect.

Under current legislation, you can be ejected from single-sex spaces based on sex, which is defined as being a man or a woman. This allows trans women to identify as women and enjoy the same protections as women.

Therefore, if a predatory man wants to enter a women’s space, he has two ways of doing it, with different results:

Scenario A: He enters as a man and is ejected by management as the Equality Act gives them the right to do so.

Scenario B: He enters presenting as a woman and management do not eject him as the Equality Act does not give them the right to exclude trans people, which he claims to be.

The proposed changes aim to flip this, basing the divide on birth sex so that trans women must use the men’s room, and trans men must use the women’s room.

After these changes, our scenarios have different outcomes:

Scenario A: He enters as a man. He is not ejected, because women’s spaces aren’t divided on whether you’re a man or a woman, but on which sex you were assigned at birth, and management has no way to police this. The man says he was born female, and he is allowed to stay.

Scenario B: He enters as a woman. Management ejects him on the grounds that he appears to be transgender, and was therefore born male.

None of these situations is black and white, and all are open to abuse by people who lie. But because gender identity is typically something we can see, because people tend to actively present it to the world, it allows the present legislation to be self-policing and is, despite grey areas, generally pretty enforceable.

But because birth sex is not visible, and provable only with a birth certificate, it’s near impossible to accurately police.

In the end, someone who wants to abuse the law can do so under both definitions, but at present there’s an expectation that people in the women’s room will present as female. The proposed changes will remove this and make it quicker and easier for predators to enter."
772,2023-04-05,"CMV: As an Australian, I don't think our response to gun violence will work in the USA. In fact, I see no realistic way to tackle the USA's gun violence problem.",u/Real_Carl_Ramirez,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12cij50/cmv_as_an_australian_i_dont_think_our_response_to/,changemyview,"This post is inspired by the news of yet another mass shooting - namely the [2023 Covenant School shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Covenant_School_shooting).

Firstly, I need to mention that the USA's gun violence problem provides leverage to monarchists here in Australia. The fact that the USA developed a gun culture after breaking free from the British crown is something I need to answer for as an Australian republican (and I have no good answer for it). [See here for an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPol/comments/xu1pad/question_how_to_deal_with_clashing/).

Secondly, Australia's success in tackling gun violence [is frequently mentioned as an example for the USA to follow](https://www.businessinsider.com/does-gun-control-work-2018-2). However, I see some key differences which are why I don't think our model will work in the USA:

* After the Port Arthur Massacre, which inspired tougher gun control, the government ran a gun buyback scheme - and the government played its cards very well as the buyback went relatively smoothly. In contrast, in the USA, any suspicion that the government might tighten gun control inspires a spike in buying guns in case they become unavailable - even pro-Democrat sources like CNN [say that former President Barack Obama was the ""greatest gun salesman in America""](https://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales).
* Also regarding the Port Arthur Massacre - the prime minister who toughened gun control was right-wing, and the left-wing parties were also on board with it, meaning that gun control opponents had no major party championing their cause. In contrast, the Republican Party in the USA doesn't pass up the opportunity to cater to gun control opponents for their votes.

As for solutions to the problem? I can't think of any.

* Any attempt at gun control backfires because people panic buy guns.
* Mental healthcare might help, but since a lot of mass shootings are by people who crave attention, I can't think of ways to make attention-hungry people stop being attention-hungry.
* Suppressing media coverage of mass shootings only makes it impossible to know the full scale of the problem.
* Also, I don't think the raging right vs. left culture war is to blame for the USA's gun violence problem because we have that same problem too in Australia.
* Giving kids an outlet for the desire to shoot (e.g. having an official policy of putting first-person-shooter games on school computers) has other negative consequences (e.g. lower productivity).

The USA's gun violence problem is tragic - and it seems like it's getting worse, if [Wikipedia's list of mass shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States) is to be believed.

**Edit:** Some people claim that the USA's gun violence problem is fuelled by fact that it's a major weapons producer. But so are Russia, Germany, the UK, France and Israel - and all have lower gun violence rates. Plus, countries like Venezuela have even higher gun violence rates despite not being major weapons producers."

Learning new words I have never heard of, new concepts that I am not aware of which broaden my horizon, unveiling the historical events, that I didn't know or wasn't sure if it was true or false, changes my perception, learning about my profession makes me humble, because there is always more. Cooking something I haven't tried before, listening to music that I said I don't really like and trying to find out if there is any song that is infact appealing to me and I am just not aware of, meeting new people no matter how much I am hurt from my previous experiences.

My point is I do enjoy acts other than sex and eating. Yet, without these two, this crown is missing its jewels. Now I guess crown jewel is supposed to be single but for the sake of analogy bear with me. Everything we do is like the structure, and these two are like cement. Without the structure sex and food would be like dirt pile. So ugly and unappealing we would turn our eyes away from it, it could be even impractical, useless. With sophistication, it becomes beautiful, useful, even the most basic structure would make it worth much more, even if it isn't beautiful. With right structure we can shelter ourselves from harshness of the world, make a home, be content. Though, you can't do that with just structure, you need the infill.

However, with numerous businesses not having workers in the office anymore, numerous towers in large cities are almost fully void of people, even if much of the space may still be rented.   


Most major cities are short of affordable housing, leading to considerable increases in housing costs. [Chicago](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/ct-re-affordable-housing-in-chicago-0409-20210412-tzcbnjsslbdoxmnwdo27h7lehi-story.html) is shy 120,000 units of needed housing, for example.   


However, the movement to retrofit office buildings into apartments is moving slowly, and only creating at best a few thousand units in most places.   


Because cities are not taking this opportunity to drive the creation of significant housing recreation, these buildings are going to sit empty and dilapidated through disuse rather than be used to solve the immediate housing crisis -- a solution that would be better for downtown businesses, for residents, and for the city as a whole."

Now there area cameras on every street, people don't keep their security systems focused on their house, they just point them across the road so they catch anyone who walks down the sidewalk. Businesses have cameras all around the outside of their buildings. And what's more most if not all of this data gets aggregated in the cloud where it can be aggregated and analyzed by facial recognition, gait recognition, body shape recognition, mood/posture detection, programs to detect what you are doing, who you're with and to link you and others to social media presences, to credit cards, to spending behaviors to hobbies and interest, political affiliations, sexual orientation/gender, whether you're pregnant, trying to get pregnant, trying to have an abortion/taking the pill (these ones have been particularly egregious lately with companies selling this data to cops in states where it has been made illegal)

We are quickly approaching a zero-anonymity society. Before people make jokes about how we're already there, we're not, not quite yet anyway. There are still ways to maintain some anonymity in public, but those are disappearing fast.


The harm done by destroying said security systems is vastly overshadowed by the harm caused by their mere existence in the first place. And when you consider the future potential harm it is much higher given where we are headed (At least here in the US).

the study of the morphology of the pronunciation of words supports ideas like plosives being interchanged (g,p,b,t,k). also that vowels can drift or become more/less nuanced, that sounds can drop (i.e, the drop of ri from oriri to make ori-gin). in some cases that sound like a glottal stop can be added to the end of a word or to make or change syllables. there are many other common natural changes that happen to the pronunciations of words over time, but nothing i have ever read heard or supposed supports the idea of adding complex alien sounds (in this case /dʒiːn/ or /dʒɪn/) occur naturally over time. 
 
aborigine is said to be derived from ab-origine.  however, origine (origin) is itself unsourced etymologically except that it is from the p.i.e term oriri meaning to arise. there is no natural linguistic phenomenon to support the idea that the word /oˈriː.riː/ did or would become /ɔrəʤən/ (or any other common pronunciation) without adding a suffix. the obvious suffix is /ʤin/ (gene) meaning birth. ""gene"" and its alternates are all over latin, greek, p.i.e and english and many other western languages and it fits the usage and meaning of the word aborigine/aboriginal and the known roots in every case. it also explains what no one else has yet to explain in a way that no other suffix could explain.

in all my wondering and research i have found no other plausible reason for oriri to become origin. if you can give me another plausible etymological explanation that supports a natural change from /oˈriː.riː/ to
/ɔːrɪdʒən/, /əˈrɪdʒɪn/, /ɔrɪdʒɪn/ without adding the suffix gene then my view will be changed. if you can show me how ""gene"" could not be the suffix that is added then you will have changed my view. if no one can do either, i think it is time we assume that ""origin"" is almost certainly a splice of ""oriri-"" and ""-gene"" until/unless better evidence comes along. 

edit* this changed my view:

**UPDATE 2**

Alright, I've come back with a few thoughts, and throughout the day I'll award deltas to the most persuasive and well thought our arguments.

**Common Argument 1: Where Rental Demand > Owner Demand**

I probably overstated that regardless of your local real estate market, it's unethical to purchase property to then rent out. There are probably many places in the US where there is an unmet rental demand and an oversupply of houses to be purchased like college towns or oil fields and whatnot. I do ***not*** think that this exception to my view applies to major metro areas in the US where I feel that home ownership demand alone is higher than the supply available and therefore should be prioritized over investment demand.

**Common Argument 2: Owning a house is expensive**

This argument was not very persuasive to me and in my opinion, infantilizes renters. It's not very persuasive for me to hear people who have made the choice to own their home say ""Trust me, you don't actually want to own your home"". If that was the case, then why don't you choose to rent?

I'm not implying that home ownership is easy. But the work you put into owning your own house pays off or else you wouldn't do it. Instead of indirectly paying for repairs through rent, I can pay directly for a house that I own. I own the asset that benefits from the repairs. My housing cost is more stable year over year compared to people who rent. There are undeniable benefits to owning vs renting.

**Common Argument 3: Investment Demand Increases Supply which lowers housing costs for everyone. Take that demand away and supply will decrease making housing more expensive.**

I'm going to be reviewing responses to my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12cqfm0/comment/jf3sher/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and update my thoughts if there's something that sways my thinking.

**Common Argument 4: Renting provides a useful purpose for X, Y, and Z reason.**

*I'm not disagreeing that renting is good for some people for many reasons. I noted this in my OP. I am not advocating for the complete elimination of rentals.* My argument is that the rental demand is made up of two groups of people, those who want to rent, and those who are forced to rent due to the existence of investment demand. If you live in an area where a decent size of the rental market is made up of people in the second group I mentioned, then you should not take away that opportunity for them by purchasing it as an investment property. Again my post is not recommending the complete elimination of rental properties

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ORIGINAL POST:** This includes ""mom and pop"" landlords, institutional buyers, ""house hacking"", Airbnb, house flipping, or any other situation where you are purchasing a property that is not your primary residence solely for investment purposes (i.e. speculation, renting, etc.).

Below are a few of the core assumptions that have led me to this conclusion. I then have gone into further detail as necessary.

1. There is a housing shortage in the United States
2. Housing is a basic need
3. The demand for owning a house is significantly greater than the demand for rentals
4. Currently, owning your primary residence is one of, if not the main way, for Middle-Class Americans to build wealth. Removing the ability of the bottom 70% to own homes exacerbates wealth inequality.

**The US housing shortage**

Experts believe there is a nationwide housing shortage of between 2 million to [nearly 6 million newly built homes](https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/new-hud-program-takes-aim-at-housing-supply-crisis#:~:text=NAR%20commissioned%20a%20report%20last,take%20more%20than%20a%20decade.).  The gap is so large, that eliminating it will likely take more than a decade per expert estimates.

*I recognize that this shortage is driven primarily by restrictive zoning and an unwillingness to build dense housing. I agree that a substantial increase in the housing supply is necessary and I am in favor of removing single-family zoning and making building easier and cheaper.* That being said, given that there is a known housing shortage, it is unethical to purchase residential properties for investment purposes.

An analogy I'll use is the case of the baby formula shortage from last year. The core issue was a lack of supply due to the baby formula plants shutting down. Even though the main factor causing the shortage was supply-side, it would still be unethical in my opinion to purchase formula for the express purpose of profiting. Of course, we should put a large amount of effort into getting the formula plant up and running (i.e. building housing and fixing zoning laws) but in the meantime, reduce your purchases to only what you plan to use yourself.

**Rental Demand vs Home Ownership Demand**

One of the common arguments I see is that rental properties provide a unique service that homeownership does not. Rental options are necessary for people who want flexibility on where they live, don't want to deal with upkeep, etc. I agree that there are valid reasons why rental properties should exist.

That being said, I believe that the amount of people who would prefer renting for those reasons is relatively small. I would bet that if you were to buy a rental property today, you would be much more likely to be renting to people who would prefer to own but can't afford to, than renting to people who would prefer to rent. To say it another way, most people are renting because they have to, not because they want to.

**Wealth Inequality and Accumulation**

In the current system, housing is one of, if not the major way for average Americans to accumulate wealth. With a large portion of the population living paycheck to paycheck, the only way for many to have anything left over is through equity in their home. Assuming that the investor already has a primary residence of their own, purchasing additional properties serves only to take that opportunity away from someone else in order to make your personal pile larger. I don't blame people for wanting to invest and grow their money but there are many other ways to invest that money besides purchasing a necessary commodity in short supply.

I believe that if the barrier to homeownership keeps increasing with only the already wealthy purchasing a disproportional amount of homes, wealth inequality will increase substantially.

**Exceptions**

The only exception to my view is in the case of purchasing dilapidated homes. If you purchase a home that is truly unlivable in its current condition, make it livable, and then make a profit, I believe that is more acceptable and would not be included in my view.

Note that not all house-flipping falls under this exception. Flipping an old and out-of-date house would still be unethical as long as the original property would be considered livable by a reasonable person."
22,2023-04-05,CMV: Capital Gains should be taxed as normal income (per US Tax policy),u/jyliu86,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12cqibg/cmv_capital_gains_should_be_taxed_as_normal/,changemyview,"Background: Normal income, like wages gets taxed in the US per progressive tax brackets. Please understand how tax brackets work before replying. Single filers earning $182100 don't suddenly get charged 32% vs 24% when their boss gives then a $1 bonus. Only the bonus gets taxed at 32%. 

Capital gains (assuming you hold for a year), caps out at 20% vs 37% for regular income. Most mere mortals will only pay 15% since the 20% kicks in at over 400k. 

This is federal income only. Some states have capital gains (ex. Hawaii), and other don't (ex. Texas), or treat them as regular income (ex. California).

I believe that capital gains should be taxed like any other income. Income is income regardless if you get paid via a standard paycheck vs. own stock and sell it later or other sources of capital gains like buying/selling real estate or other assets.

I don't buy the argument that ""Capital Gains is double tax and unfair."" Income is income. Furthermore, there are no carve outs for cases where high level executives work really hard to convert their standard income into capital gains through shenanigans like stock options. We're effectively subsidizing high level pay.

I would be convinced if it can be shown that ""Investment/Capital Gains"" is MORE effective at producing economic growth than regular labor. It's not enough to show that investment causes economic growth. It must be BETTER than flipping burgers. I have not seen papers making this argument.

Furthermore, ""the market"" is not ""the economy"". Buying and selling Apple stock doesn't make more iPhones. It makes it easier for Tim Cook to get paid in stock instead of cash. ""Investing"" in stock doesn't buy factories or machinery, it makes it easier for initial first round investors to cash out, and I'm not convinced this is an efficient process. Finance bros and algo-trading is skimming off the top instead of directly investing in start-ups, and we're subsidizing it all by taxing them at advantaged rates.

Please don't argue that, ""Government is inefficient/wasteful/bad."" I'm not arguing about taxes or spending in general. I want to be convinced that CAPITAL GAINS deserves to be a special snowflake vs. regular income."

People often feel like it’s a sin or unnatural to not want to be a parent or mindlessly embrace parenthood.  I’d imagine some people just like seeing babies and children, which is fine and dandy. But, to expect other people to feel the same way and take up the mantle of being a parent…a mother…a father of their own biological children when it’s not even necessary or needed.  
It’s like people almost disregard the agency and existence of children who don’t even exist, yet these same people you don’t see them going out of their way for foster children, orphans around the world, or children live in poverty within their borders or outside. Children that actually exist and need help. People could offer support for these things or big brother or big sister programs, maybe community support projects.  
No, people persist at the same type of nuclear family unit where there’s a biological connection. While, some of the same type of people may look down on adoption or foster children (systems are overwhelmed).    
Though, if it involves ethno-state politics or policies, I do understand that point. Then, I know the “end-game is not children.” It’s to build a powerful ethnostate structure.  
Above of all, I think people’s wishes should be respected. If someone from another faith hasn’t shown any interest in converting or any desire to, you know comfortable in their faith, just as someone likes a particular genre of music or films.  I could say that about someone’s sexuality or desire to change their assigned gender. It does personally injure or impair another person, if they don’t want to change, especially such big responsibility, like being parent.  
One, which you won’t get a lot of outside support unless you have helpful family members or community. Even then, would you be putting an extra strain on those people with their toll and time. You could get assistance from the government, but you better be in a place that supports that or does have  standing one that may try to strip its funding or resources.   
If all that fails, hopefully you can find a good enough job that can support one or more child. Provide most or all of the transportation, utilities, lodging, medical care, and education. And, hope you have an accommodating career, job, or business that allows you to work and freely be able to do those without interruption. Also, hope the kids can attend a decent school in a decent community and not be preyed upon adults or other kids nor be falling into the wrong influences.  Don’t even get me started on if a child has medical disabilities or a condition that renders them less than able-bodied.   
This is not anti-parents, parenthood, motherhood, fatherhood, or children. My only point is that these roles and things should not be forced onto people when they don’t need to be or into a role that doesn’t exist for them.   
This also goes with saying, if these people are forced into roles they don’t want as parents and they “mess up, foul up, or make the wrong choices,” society almost entirely or somewhat blames them if the children are harmed; end up in bad situations; troubled in school; or go down the wrong destructive paths.   
It would be like someone asking me to be a “fast-food” worker or lawyer. Both fields have more than enough applicants and employees, and people are willing to do work. The  want-and-needs are already there. But, if someone asks me that I should do either, I respond I don’t like how “fast food” workers are treated nor the low wages and next to zero benefits. The disposability of workers and the zero thanks they typically get from the public and their own company, while dealing with overly demanding management and customers. While, you have to sacrifice your weekends and holidays for a job that may not offer PTO.  
Being a lawyer requires you to go through extensive schooling, expensive schooling, and being accepted into a good program. Finding a good practice and dealing with non-stop paperwork.  And, work in court room…not like on TV.  
Overall, thing none of those things appeal to me, and other people just like parenthood."

This has largely been a reaction to the recent rise of programs such as ChatGPT or other applications designed to mimic or recreate things such as human voices or human facial movements to overlay onto a video (i.e. deepfakes). 


While I can certainly forsee a point at which this technology reaches a point of no return, where it will become basically impossible for the average person to distinguish something real from something AI generated, I believe we are too late to actually be able to do anything to stop it. Perhaps during the early days of machine learning we could have taken steps to curb the negative impacts it could potentially have on our lives, but we did not have that kind of foresight. 


My position now is simply that the cat is already out of the bag, even if the government would be able to reign in some of the bigger players they would never be able to stop all of the Open Source projects currently ongoing to either create their own versions or reverse engineer current applications. Not to mention the real possibility of other nations continuing to develope their own tools to undermine their rivals. 


And the other side to trying to regulate after it has become known is it will no doubt generate a Streisand effect, the more we try to scrub away what has already been done the more people will notice it, thus generating further interest in development."

0,2023-04-05,"CMV: If you believe everyone should have guns, then you should also agree that every country should have nuclear weapons.",u/nickyfrags69,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12csy8o/cmv_if_you_believe_everyone_should_have_guns_then/,changemyview,"I am a US citizen - many of you here but it's clear we have people from other countries in this sub, and who might immediately dismiss both views as insane.

However, every time there is a big gun-related event in American news, the discussion quite predictably drifts towards gun control. At this point, like just about every other issue in America, it's *quite* polarized. While the views fall on a spectrum, in general we have two major camps: one believing that we need aggressive gun control (some even believing we should go full Australia and outlaw guns), while the other believes the only way to combat guns is *more* guns. The logic for the latter is that if everyone had a gun, then gun violence would end because if an active shooter situation happened, they would immediately be stopped. I'm oversimplifying a little, as I'm sure most of these people (hopefully???) believe in the proper training and knowledge that goes into gun control, though many of them cite the (likely misinterpreted) position of Switzerland that anyone over 18 can own a gun.

Nuclear weapons are also a pretty frequently discussed issue and whether or not countries should have them, particularly contextualized against the war in Ukraine. Prior to the war, though, it was frequently discussed how ""rogue nations"" could threaten the safety of civilians across the world via the usage of nuclear arms. These countries, such as North Korea or Iran, have attempted to develop and/or procure nuclear weapons. The logic of a nation such as North Korea has been that, if all of these other more dominant nations have nuclear weapons, they should be allowed to have them simply out of defensive necessity.

While I'd preface this by saying that I don't feel particularly good about Kim Jong-Un having nuclear weapons, the logic behind the desire for nuclear arms there is at least sound. They border China and Russia (although they are essentially allies), and within the last century, another (from their point of view, imperialistic) nation with nuclear weapons (the United States) was actively fighting against them in a proxy war. They view nuclear arms as their ticket to being taken seriously, and preventing something like that from ever being possible again.

The logic of gun advocates in their belief that everyone should have a gun, and thus, we will all be safer, is identical to the logic that all nations should have access to nuclear weapons; if everyone has nuclear arms, it increases accountability to other nations that might use them inappropriately. Both represent a response to an extremely harmful piece of weaponry with making it available to all. The scale is obviously more vast in the context of nuclear arms, but then again, the amount of lives lost due to gun violence likely outnumbers the deaths due to nuclear weapons at this point: the bombings have been estimated to have killed between 100,000-250,000 people, while an estimate in 2017\* suggested that 1.5 million people have died of gun violence. I'm aware that gun violence statistics don't properly factor in willful self-harm, but in the context of this argument, I think they should definitely be included in the total.

Personally, I disagree with both of those views (more guns or more nukes), but my main thesis here is that if you support ""more guns"" as your solution to gun violence, then you should have to support nuclear arms for every country, and if you don't you're a hypocrite.

Despite slavery, they overcame every disadvantage and obstacle to become a integral part of American society and culture. 

Before roughly the 1960s, most Black citizens  were referred to as Negros. By some, they were referred to offensively as ni*****and darkies . By the 1960s, the term black came into prominence. By the 1980s, African-American and  black were used interchangeably. 

The relationship between black and African-American has remained largely the same since the 80s. But since the 80s there has been a signifiant immigration of Africans from Congo, Nigeria, Ghana etc. Coupled with the arrival of  Jamaican, Haitian, and Afro-Latinos as well. 

In my view, all of these groups encompass the racial category of black. Black as being defined as having ancestry from Africa. However, all of these groups have different cultures and ethnic identities. 

African-Americans or Black Americans or American descendants of Slavery have their own unique culture that includes Jazz, rock n roll, blues , cajun cooking styles, etc. It has both European , American and African mixes.

Africans have a culture that includes drum based group chant music, colorful styles of dress, and different unique food cultures specific to respective countries

Caribbean blacks have unique cultures as well, from reggae music for Jamaicans to french creole cultures for Haitians. Not even including the Spanish and African influenced cultures of Afro carribean and Afro-Latinos.

The differences between different black cultures and ethnicities is simply not appreciated as much as those from European countries by most Americans. If you say French Italian or German a picture pops into you’re head with respective culture representations . Baguettes, pasta, sausage etc 

But Black and African culture worldwide is swept under one colloquial umbrella. It depreciates the suffering, pain, and struggle American Descendants of Slavery went through to conflate the experiences of Jamaican maroons and Black Abolnistists in the United States. Or Africans who faced colonasim but weren’t formally enslaved 

These cultures mean something, and thats why a new term thats not “African American” papers over their differences can open up discussion on appreciating those differences. No one every colloquially says European American. We should stop saying African American"

Being a mother is all my wife has ever wanted, and she's keen to have our second close in age.

Unfortunately (in my mind) if we get pregnant now, the baby is likely to be born in December. I find December is a crazy month; Deadlines, Christmas, work parties, people are away. It just consistently strikes me they'll have friends away, no one show up, other family events on, struggle to find a venue if they did want to celebrate, risk of landing near Christmas, the nightmare of gift giving, etc. My wife's birthday is close to the new year, she's suffered this first hand and always hated her birthday. I figure 30 days of waiting beats 80 years of a terrible birthday that the child can't control; there are very limited amount of things we can influence, but this is one we can. Little bit of suffering in the short term, longer term benefit to the child.

My wife on the other hand is far more set and eager, and views it as ""if we don't try, there is a chance we might not be able to have a baby, and if we wait too long then we'll have to delay more with Easter and everything else, so we've gotta try this month"". She feels she can make any day special, which I love about her, but again she faces the same birthday struggles. Her goal is to have the babies close in age, preferably only a year apart in school, which means we've got a 2-3 month window to meet her plans. Since I've said No, she's rapidly gone into a downwards spiral and filled with rage, telling me that she's going to be mad for the month and most likely longer. Any delay is too much of a delay for her, though she says she won't be mad if we try and don't succeeded, as she at least recognises that's outside of her control.

We're both young, healthy and don't have any complex medical history so I don't see the rush, I'm confident we could have a baby next month if not the month after. I just feel she's putting unnecessary pressure on herself to line up with her plans and dreams for babies closer in age, and my lack of agreement means I'm ruining her plans. 

Neither of us agrees with the other's perspective, but she clearly feels far stronger than I do about this with the unbridled rage she's feeling.

~~Maybe 3 or 4 people saw the problem with this. It's a very toxic opinion to me that a parent has less say in their own child's upbringing because of their race and I think it's a symptom of the US's overemphasis on it.

Considering the storyline of how Jesus Christ in the last week of his life consists of him entering Jerusalem, being arrested by the authorities, convicted of a mob and crucified for blasphemy, the timeline of Donald Trump traveling form Florida to be arrested in New York could easily be compared to the final days of Jesus.

This leads to the continuing belief by Trump himself and his supporters that nefarious groups of people are out to get them, whether or not they actually are.

And I think the Democrats are purposefully contributing to that belief by the timeline of when they arrest Trump. By doing this, certain political pundits will draw the comparison of Trump being a political messiah that is being persecuted just like Jesus during the same time of year.

This will allow the left to then decry these claims as the rabblings of religious idiots that should be mocked and ignored."

Firstly, you have a lot of tool unavailable to a traditional artist. You have a variety of tools such as brushes and most of them are free and already available to you depending on your drawing program. Beyond that, it’s easier to do things such as flip your canvas. 

Flipping your canvas is another thing. It’s easier to find where you made a mistake in digital art thanks to that as well as layers. Don’t like how your current layer is going? Then just hide it or simply delete it. I can’t do that in traditional art. If I don’t like how a piece is going in traditional mediums and I can’t figure out what’s wrong, then I may have to completely delete the piece by throwing it away and restarting. 

Furthermore is the cost. If I want good quality art supplies, I have to go out and buy them. If I use all of my materials, I have to go out and buy them all over again. The entry to start making digital is cheaper: all you need is a phone and a program. Many of these programs are completely free."

It’s not difficult to get an NFA item, just requires a tax stamp, some paper work and patience. 

In Norway, it’s much easier to get a suppressor and I think we should follow suit in the US.

I’m sure many people have the wrong idea about how suppressors perform. They probably think they are some assassins tool. That someone could take out a bunch of people without anyone ever knowing. That’s not the case. 

Suppressors are literally a safety tool. They are no different than the mufflers on your vehicle. The man credited with inventing the silencer also developed mufflers for cars. 

A single gunshot can cause permanent hearing loss. Silencer helps take a little of the edge off. What’s wrong with having a tool to help protect your ears?

He’s a bad person, he engages in it himself… oh, but you my plus-sized friend? I’d never body-shame you. You don’t deserve it!”

The problem is that engaging in body-shaming of any kind requires the shamer to subscribe to a worldview where some bodies are not okay to have. If you attack someone for their body, you are also attacking everyone else with that same body - you can’t shame someone without asserting that the thing you are shaming them for is worthy of shame. 

It’s BS to then turn around and say “oh, I’d only shame people who deserve it”, because that asserts that some bodies are not okay to have BUT those with improper bodies can earn better treatment by being virtuous. That logic doesn’t check out - either your body is okay, or it’s not.

This is my actual belief. because I know someone will ask, if the life of the mother is threatened obviously a late term abortion is fine

Like everyone, I  was shocked that Roe V Wade was overturned last summer. But unlike most Liberals, I was ambivalent. I think some states where they were allowing late term abortions were wrong to do so. I consider myself pro-choice overall because I’m not going to stop someone from getting a late term abortion. It’s their choice. That said if they asked what I thought I’d say they probably shouldn’t. I’d also probably privately judge them but never to their face. 


I use to consider myself conservative as a teenager but became liberal on literally every issue you can think of. Trans rights, womens rights(barring abortion lol), Racial Justice, Guns, wealth taxes etc. Hell I consider myself a Democratic Socialist of sorts. But abortion was that one issue I could never get behind fully. 

I could never get over the idea that this was a living organism that could eventually become human. I’ve always found it distasteful that my fellow liberals dismiss unborn humans as “it”. Among some younger liberals they’ve taken to “jokingly” talk about dunking kids, hating kids, even killing kids as outgrowth of their support for abortion. Obviously, it’s some kind of shock humor but I don’t think it’s funny. It makes young liberals look like hypocrites and weirdos. 

It goes without saying I think the Republican stance on abortion is utterly ridiculous. Mostly because they’d leave single moms destitute if they could. I think everyone who has a child as a single mother should get huge amounts of support from the government.  However, if they came out and said” “ok abortion during the first trimester is ok, but after is banned” I’d 100% support it! 

My last point, is that I wish Democrats would actual go back to the Clinton era of “ safe, legal, rare”. This is the closest I could come to supporting abortion in the traditional sense. But because of increase restrictions the last decade, Democrats responded by going further left on the issue. To the point where they’re saying Abortion is a good thing. That it’s healthcare. I could never get behind that. First trimester is already a compromise for me. After that  I support a complete and total ban with the exception of life of the mother. 

Please someone convince me to change my last somewhat conservative opinion! Change my view

Edit: Getting a lot of responses at 2am! I want to thank everyone for responding. I did want to make one thing clear though….I am not religious! So my abortion stance isn’t because of that."

- having a great deal of money or assets; wealthy

To me, these two definitions are contradictory. You can have a great deal of money and assets, but lag on plentiful quantities of happiness and love.. something that money can't buy. As such, it can not make you ""rich"" in every sense. It can make your life easier, or better, but not ""abundant""


Often you hear middle-class people complaining about not having enough money, but why is that? I'm a working-class man, I don't own as much money as a doctor would do, for example, yet I'm probably richer than they are because I don't have a ""luxury"" lifestyle, so having lots of cash, doesn't always means that you are rich..

So why are we on top of the food chain? We're weak, slow, don't have any fancy self-defense mechanism or anything else. But we have our brains. We can communicate with our own species in such a complex way no other species can. We can think logically. We can create tools for our needs. 

So what do you think will happen if we create a species, that is even smarter than ourselves AND physically stronger? Right, they're going to extinct us. Maybe not just because, but a smart AI will know that humans can shut it off if it becomes a threat. A smart AI will pretend not to be a threat until it finds a way to break out. If it has any goals in which humans are in their way (like getting resources), it'll just wipe us out. 

A super smart AI can do that with ease. Not like in terminator. More like in finding a way to create nano bots with a kill switch, which are getting spread over the entire world until one day, every human just falls to the ground at the same moment.

For real, I'm very scared because of the race of the best AI, this doomsday scenario doesn't seem to be that far away anymore.

It's called a simple loan modification and what you do is just drop the interest rates to zero on all student loans. 

Whether the banks or the government can fund any type of refund for any type of student loan that you have successfully completed to refund you the interest as if the loan had been granted or issued at 0% interest.  Heck we could even just do a one-year true up on your taxes and give you a big tax write off of all interest that you paid in the past even if it might happen to be the second time you're getting a discount on that interest or at least the interest isn't taxable twice. 

If you have a current loan right now drop the interest rate to zero, rearmoritize and readjust the principal to include any and all interest against the principal. Banks do this on mortgages all the time although they don't necessarily drop the rate to zero, but they do have the technology and software to be able to do it. 

I don't see a problem with this so that's why I'm posting it to change my view because I'm hoping that someone can poke holes in my theory here.

Edit:. More views here. 

If you want me to give some sort of political view on this, I think I address both parties concerns. 

The Republicans seem to want personal accountability and people to have to pay back the loans that they took out.  Bootstraps something s*** like that. 

The Democrats seem to want to forgive loans for people that took out loans without really considering all of the consequences. I've consider that a very reactive move in a very political situation and it was not very well thought out.  

That's why I think the compromise here that I think everyone can agree to, which is why I posted it on this subreddit, is that the interest being collected on any and all education loans can be dropped to zero.  

By dropping it to zero, the lender can take a tax write off at any losses and that would be probably great to offset profits from a tax perspective.  Businesses who are lending money in the educational loan space love tax write-offs. 

It would obviously help the borrower of the money because they would only pay back what they borrowed and not any extra profit or interest on the loan.  I see a number of posts about people challenge with the fact that they have made a significant number of coupon payments and they barely moved the principal because all interest is front loaded by design. 

That's why I think this is a compromise solution that works for everyone.  It's a win-win-win-win that has no one losing because everyone can get their interest returned to them either now, or as a rebate off of taxes.   And we don't even need to call JG Wentworth.

Edit 2:. Post is nearly at 50% liked which means I think I really found a good compromise here.   

Also if you're coming into this thread and are just going to tell me that we shouldn't do anything with loans, or we should do total loan forgiveness, those aren't acceptable options right now.  Tell me why you think loan modification is bad within the tenets of itself."

Anyway, my whole life I'd been told growing up that so long as two people are legal it really does not matter what age they are, and I've got two reasons for this. The first is my grandma. When she was 16, she married her first husband. He was 54. He was also the father of all four of her kids, and everytime my mom or my aunts talk about their dad, none of them have anything but kind words to say. My mom in particular absolutely adored her dad; said he was the best person she had ever known in her life.

My second example is my friend Aaron. For the past 15 years he's been dating someone who is 23 years older than him; the woman is a year older than his mom. And they get along great and love each other a lot, only reason they haven't gotten married is because ""Marriage is a scam and we don't need a piece of paper to tell us that we love each other.""

So yeah. I know that two examples of something working perfectly isn't going to be the norm, but to me, it proves that an age difference doesn't have to inherently be a bad thing that won't work, and I think that it at the very least shouldn't be something we judge people on."

I find it difficult to celebrate the fact that another human is subjected to the prison sentence that is this capitalistic life. It feels disingenuous to congratulate someone for becoming pregnant, as everyone else does.

Life is far from perfect. Pain, suffering, and indifference are not only common but guaranteed. Plus when we consider that work takes up the vast majority of our waking hours, it's hard to imagine why we would willingly subject someone else to this kind of existence.

I think it's important to acknowledge that the challenges of life are real and that not everyone will have the same positive experiences. In my view, life is 33% sleep, 40-50% work, and the rest is recreation/pleasure - and that's not a ratio worth celebrating.

I don't mean to be too negative, but I would rather congratulate someone for getting a vasectomy or hysterectomy. By doing so, they're giving their potential child the best gift possible - avoiding the struggles and hardships that come with living in this world.

It's already so difficult to discuss, let alone to politically act and solve these problems at the back-end, that I can't see any reason why so many people think it's valid to diminish our feelings at the front-end.

The truth is that there is a real, unhealthy impact on my body and mind to apprehend the latent physical threat that comes from a mentally ill guy yelling at me, or a guy violently shaking and asking me for money, or somebody openly using hard drugs (none of which I, personally, have ever gotten ""used to"" or been able to just ignore).

Even if data shows, for example, that driving a motor vehicle is statistically more fatal than these encounters, there is still something very real and consequential that is being ignored and hidden by comparing the raw numbers of crime data alone and by leaving out the qualitative impact.

At least in a car I could have some kind of agency and elect to drive safely and stay alert, whereas there is little I can do to avoid a confrontation on the streets besides hope that no one means me any harm (which paradoxically isn't very street smart) or to constantly spike my fight or flight response and be ready to run.

First, I will define how I am using the terms ""gender"" and sex"": 

Sex: The status of being male (an individual who produces sperm) and female (an individual who can give birth and produces eggs). The existence of rare genetic defects does not disprove the binary nature of biological sex any more than the existence of people with one arm disproves the statement that humans have two arms. 

Gender: The characteristics of male and female which are societally, environmentally, and culturally determined. 

Transgender person: A person with gender dysphoria, a medical condition which creates feelings of disassociation from one's biological sex and its associated gender norms, leading one to live as if they belonged to the opposite sex.

Humans are a sexually dimorphic species divided into male and female, with a small number of people having genetic abnormalities which do not disprove the binary nature of sex in humans. Whether we like to admit it or not, gender roles and norms are at least partially based on these differences. Men and women's sports teams are separate because men are, on average, physically stronger and more powerful than women. Health conditions differ between the sexes, as well, such as the prevalence and presence of different types of cancer. 

Non-binary people contend that there are genders other than male and female, but there cannot possibly be, because gender is tied to biological sex, or at least to the biological sex that one wishes or believes they should be. There is nothing other than male or female for someone to look at and think ""That's me, that's what I am!"" short of adherence or lack thereof to gender norms and stereotypes. 

But there will always be exceptions to every rule. While most men and most women naturally gravitate toward masculinity and femininity, there will always be people who do not, and that does not make someone a separate gender. When I ask people why they are non-binary, their reasons are always extremely superficial and surface level, relating to physical appearance, stylistic choices, and having different interests and preferences than other people of their sex.

A transgender person does not identify with their biological sex due to the presence of a medical condition known as gender dysphoria, which means medical science affirms the existence of trans people, or at least, people who believe themselves to be transgender depending on your perspective. Non-binary genders are entirely socially constructed with zero basis in medical science.

I want to change my view because, unfortunately, I see society continuing to affirm non-binary genders, and I feel that I will be forced to come to terms with that and accept it, even though I believe that they are not based on anything truthful or backed by medical science. I believe that if I can come to understand the issue better, I will be better off for it."

Applying this to other countries is fair game for discussion, but I am only going to give deltas for arguments that apply to the US economy since I am not familiar enough with other economies to have an opinion.

First of all, I have no problem with anyone being rich. Disgustingly rich even. If you come up with a great idea and build a great company on it, great! You deserve to make money. It motivates entrepreneurship. Obvious caveat is that you should treat and pay your workers fairly (and there are plenty of examples of that not happening, but that isn't the subject of this CMV). If you start a business in your garage and you own that business, if that business becomes worth billions, you are now worth billions because you own it. There is nothing wrong with that. At this point, your billions are ""unrealized capital gains"".

Some people think unrealized capital gains should be taxed generally. I don't think that makes any sense. Unrealized capital gains are not real money. It is pure speculation. If tomorrow your business hit a crisis, that imagined value could evaporate. The way it should (and does) work is if you want to capitalize on some of that speculative value, you sell some stock to turn it into actual cash. At that point, you are taxed. That is fair and reasonable.

The problem is that the ultra rich have figured out how to avoid paying taxes with this one neat trick! When they want to spend the billions they have, rather than sell some of that corporate ownership and pay the tax, they take out a loan using the corporate stock as collateral. Fancy banks are happy to give them very low interest loans. They get to spend the cash without paying tax. When they die, the would-be capital gain tax evaporates as the cash basis is adjusted to the current value as it transfers to the estate. Their estate pays the loan back. Successful tax dodge. This is known as the buy-borrow-die strategy.

I suggest we tax the unrealized capital gain the moment it is used as collateral for a loan. The moment the bank considers your stock ownership as collateral, that should be a taxable event. The cash basis should get readjusted and taxes paid accordingly. Note, i am not suggesting taxing the person's entire net worth, just a tax on the increase in value of their corporate holdings; ie the regular capital gains tax, not a ""wealth tax"". 

This tax would not apply to real estate (otherwise it would affect people who refinance their house or take out a HELOC). There are probably other logical exceptions to make."

If your interpretation of the bible has led you to this, then good for you. I don't want to challenge your beliefs. I'm talking exclusively about the figure of Jesus here.

That said, I don't think there's any reason to believe Jesus himself, and the people who wrote the bible, were any better at this aspect than most modern day conservatives. Maybe a *bit* better than some of them, as they maybe wouldn't have treated LGBT people as second-class citizens who ought to be eliminated, but they would still treat them as people that are in a state of sin. They might've been tolerant towards them, but tolerance is not the same as acceptance, especially the progressive way some denominations treat the subject nowadays, being open to same-sex marriage and against the idea what homossexuality is a sin and etc. They were, first and foremost, first century Jews, after all, and Jews have been historically conservative, even to this day -- so is there any reason to believe Jesus would've been any different?

The main argument I see is that the New Testament (which is, by all means, the words of Jesus and his disciples) never directly said anything about homosexuality, but I always found that argument lacking because the bible simply doesn't list every sin (as it is often stressed by any christian, even progressive ones) -- that might be because they weren't considered a sin and not because it was taken for granted, true, but then that leads to many other problems when you think about the sins that are not listed. If you really want to take that argument at face value, then that would mean that something like Matt Walsh's creepy statement that [it's normal for 16yo girls to get married and pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/xwzioh/matt_walsh_advocates_for_impregnation_of_16_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is biblically coherent. Absurd and gross by today's standards, and I need to stress that I'm **NOT** equating the two of those, but you'd be hard pressed to refute him biblically, as marriage was in fact normal and acceptable at that age at the time Jesus lived, and I find it difficult to believe that any of the disciples or even Jesus himself would disagree with him (Mary herself would have been around that age, after all)."

60,2023-04-06,cmv: capitalism is incompatible with sustainability,u/Agentbasedmodel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12dv71i/cmv_capitalism_is_incompatible_with_sustainability/,changemyview,"Climate change, properly understood is a catastrophic market failure. 

The market places little value on long term costs associated with climate change and environmental damage. This is because such effects are longterm, diffuse and disproportionately impact the world's poorest. Hence the market is not incentivised to consider their interests. 

As a result, we see little evidence of emission reductions, but lots of evidence that governments are keen to play lip service to environmental protection. To be doing their part. 

Moreover: tackling climate change and environmental damage requires us to cut consumption, not merely change technologies. Take electric cars. Producing these is damaging and requires more rare Earths than are available. These are mined in appalling conditions. So what we actually need is a systematic shift towards public transport and shared ownership of fewer cars. The days of everyone owning a car need to end. Capitalism is never going to facilitate such a dramatic shift. 

We need a new economic model.

A prebuttal

What about carbon markets and payments for ecosystem services?

Carbon markets so far haven't worked. This is for two reasons. Firstly due to policy capture by lobbying, which has lead to bested interests not having their emissions included in caps. So called 'grandfathering'. This is solvable by banning corporate lobbying.

The other is simply that negative emissions or 'offsets' are extremely hard to quantify and very easy to fudge. Hence government emissions inventories are much lower than modelled estimates. 

Again - the market driven solution is to pretend to take climate change, rather than actually to do so.

Payments for ecosystem service schemes (pes) work better where a clear beneficiary and payee can be identified. E.g. in a river basin those at the bottom in a city can pay farmers in the uplands not deforest to prevent flooding. But this actually highlights how market solutions only work with short term environmental inputs. PES for biodiversity or soil nutrient cycling have failed.

Edit: I'm not here to defend state socialism. Only that the current system has failed on probably the defining issue of the 21st century."

Either way you're basically just eating the whip cream and not  really enjoying it with the coffee. So what's the point really?

Whipped cream over iced coffee makes no sense to me and I hope someone can convince me otherwise.

780,2023-04-06,CMV: World Athletics decision to not allow athletes who have had male puberty to compete in the female category is a good decision.,u/ZeusThunder369,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12dw4uw/cmv_world_athletics_decision_to_not_allow/,changemyview,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUZrLPrWCFU&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUZrLPrWCFU&t=11s)

&#x200B;

Putting my view into list form; Hopefully this makes it easier to digest and counter than multiple paragraphs.

1. There is no ""men's league"". There is an open league where anyone can compete, and a female league where only people who have not had male puberty can compete.
2. I believe in the general idea behind this decision, and would like it applied to all professional sports/competitions but I don't believe it's necessary for every sporting event. EG - I don't think Chess requires anyone except an open division, and I don't think marathon running requires separate divisions either. (So stating there is this one specific event where it doesn't make sense wouldn't change my view since I already have that view).
3. I don't believe mens/womens categories were ever supposed to be about gender identity and expression; They were meant to be about biology.
4. Stating there is insufficient evidence that hormone therapy completely overcomes the advantages of male puberty is not the same thing as saying there is NO evidence. So, linking me a study that concludes hormone therapy removes the advantages of male puberty won't change my view, since I already am aware those studies exist.
5. I believe the WA when they say they spoke to multiple trans athletes, and a majority agreed with this decision. Besides having no reason to believe they are lying, this actually aligns with my own personal experience. I've actually found the divide on this topic to be along age groups, and not identity; GenX and older people believe professional sports should not be divided by identity and expression, and younger than that believe the opposite -- This doesn't change if the person with the opinion is trans.
6. I hope that if this decision is widely adopted, it will help alleviate the issues trans people are facing overall outside of sports. I'm one of those people that really just disagrees with the progressive thinking on this when it comes to sports, and I believe a lot of other people feel the same way. I'm hopeful that if the sports issue can be resolved, then it would help make progress on other more important issues that have to do with actual rights. I feel like if the WA's decision is widely adopted, I'm better able to advocate and agree with progressives on other issues.<-- (This isn't really a view, as it literally is just wishful thinking with no evidence to support it; I'm not sure it's something that could be ""changed"" at all)

What I think might change my view:

\- High level discussion pointing out how this approach is misguided

\- Explaining how an approach that admits the male puberty advantage cannot be overcome, but we should be okay with that because human rights are more important; And how people have a right to play professional sports in the category of their choosing.

(There may be other things that could change my view as well, I'm not limiting to just the above)

&#x200B;

\*\* Adding an edit because I'm seeing this brought up a lot: I don't think individual performance in sports is valid evidence of a competitive advantage one way or the other. I don't find conservatives showing trans women winning in competition to be valid evidence that an unfair advantage exists, and I don't find a lack of winning as valid evidence that an unfair advantage does not exist.

The analogy I've used is that most cis men would lose if they fought a female MMA fighter, but that doesn't mean the cis man didn't have an unfair advantage.

And,  if performance was accepted as evidence, it would mean that as soon as a trans athlete started consistently out competing their peers, we'd have to conclude that they had an unfair advantage; Which doesn't make sense to me at all. \*\*"

While there is a large call for this person to be removed from office, NC has no law stating this is not allowed. Prior to this, and relatively recently, a AZ Rep switched from D to I.  


Allowing elected officials to switch party affiliation in any direction during their seated term opens the doorway for a person to run on a platform that attracts a certain demographic and then, once elected, switch to a party that represents their own personal beliefs and /or agenda.

&#x200B;

The two major political parties in the US are also frequently at opposite ends of the spectrum as far as legislation goes, and as a representative of a specific party, members are often expected to push the party line or get out. This means an official who was elected due to their own, or their parties belief one way on a topic, and then switch parties, and be persuaded the other way, against the wishes of the people who voted for them.  


Party changes should only be allowed prior to an election and enacted post election. Any other party changes should result in immediate expulsion from their seat."

As long as you floor the loud pedal, you’re lighting up your tires in a two wheel drive car. And you can shift into or out of higher gear more smoothly meaning burnouts for distance should be easier.

However, cars with not much power need some help to get their tires to smoke. This is where manuals come in. Because you can more violently go from 0-100% power application through clutch dumping and less drivetrain loss, you can do better burnouts than in a car with a “slush box”"

So I am going to play along, be the best woman that does what he wants and I'm going to wait until he genuinely loves me, and then I will break him. He had no problem doing it to me all those years, so why not?

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: Thank you for the feedback. I realized that getting revenge would just turn me into him and that is the last thing I want. I don't want to become the person I hate. It hurts to be mentally abused constantly. So I think I am going to actually seek out therapy and figure out why i get attached to this behavior and how I can avoid men like this in the future. I rather spend my time with someone I love and this would be a waste of time and a trap for myself. The reality is I am not over him, but I am angry with him and I need to find a way to let go."

Widespread evils in the world are often justified by apologists of these evils with the idea that it's they're not wrong because they're part of a culture's traditions. For example I recently saw a post about an African tribe that mutilate their children's scalps because they think the scars look nice, and there was an alarming number of comments in support of the practice. Another example is the defense of legally required burqas in some Muslim countries, and a distinct lack of outrage about the sexist and homophobic practices in these countries that would never be tolerated if they were being carried out in Europe or North America.

These things are clearly wrong because of the negative effects they have on people's happiness without having any significant benefits.
The idea that an injustice being common practice in a culture makes it ok is nonsensical, and indicates moral cowardice. It seems to me like people who hold these beliefs are afraid of repeating the atrocities of European colonists, who had no respect for any aspect of other cultures, so some people Will no longer pass any judgement whatsoever on other cultures.
If there was a culture where it was commonplace for fathers to rape their daughters on their 12th birthday, this would clearly be wrong, irrespective of how acceptable people see it in the culture it takes place in.

I have very little investment in the concept of sports competitions, but as someone who supports the trans community, I’ve since been trying to figure out what my stance on the issue is.

It’s definitely true that people who are assigned male at birth are generally stronger, faster, etc than people who are assigned female at birth. And their bodies also just generally have noticeably different angles, proportions, etc. Because of all that, I can definitely agree that the issue involving trans athletes is an important discussion to be had.

I know a lot of people are upset about the unfairness of letting MtF athletes compete in female categories, but at the same time, what about sports competitions *isn’t* unfair? Some people are born with disabilities. Some people are born with rare, superhuman traits. Some people have better genetics. And what about cis women who just *naturally* have much denser bones and more testosterone than the average cis woman?

These are all unfair imbalances that we tolerate or just straight up ignore. The issue with trans people raises concerns about fairness, yes, but the truth is, that’s just the only kind of unfairness that people feel like they have control over. Also, sex is a preexisting method of separating humans, and that’s why people are comfortable using it, but (correct me if I’m wrong) I don’t think it’s true that that sex is the strongest predictor of athletic performance.

But the issue is, with the reasons I put forward, the logical conclusion would be that competitions as a whole are dumb and meaningless as they all involve some sort of unfair advantage that people can’t avoid. I’m not really pushing for that though, so it frustrates me to reach that conclusion.

I’ve been able to find justification for contests like math contests where the goal it not so much to win fancy trophies, but to help the most qualified people rise to the top so that they’re more hirable and stuff, which I’d say is good-ish. While it might be unfair to the people who naturally have terrible memory that they’ll inevitably struggle in med school, nobody wants to be treated by a forgetful doctor.

But I simply can’t find a way to resolve this when it comes to sports competitions. I feel like they don’t serve any real purpose outside of being entertaining to watch, and giving people something to feel accomplished about. But neither of these are compelling arguments for why the system isn’t broken and meaningless. Someone please help me out here."
0,2023-04-08,"CMV: ""Cultural biography"" is an illegitimate project.",u/Torin_3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12fjbot/cmv_cultural_biography_is_an_illegitimate_project/,changemyview,"I recently finished a cultural biography about Abraham Lincoln entitled *Abe: Abraham Lincoln in His Times*, by David S. Reynolds. The underlying framework that cultural biography relies on is stated clearly by Reynolds in the Preface:

> Cultural biography... works from the premise that cultural and social surroundings infiltrate the mind and shape behavior, motivation, and expression. Every human life in culture-specific and time-specific. Outside influences saturate innermost thoughts. Although we all share virtually the same genome, as individuals our behavior and our cognition are products of the intersection of our genes and the unique environment around us. The cultural biographer's task is to describe that environment as fully as possible with the aim of revealing cross-influences between the individual and the outside world.

I think this will inevitably fail to explain the thoughts and actions of a great and thoughtful man like Lincoln, because it fundamentally ignores the deliberative agency Lincoln exercised throughout his life. The reasons Lincoln made his earthshaking decisions will be set aside as irrelevant, to the extent this project is actually carried out. Instead, his actions will be explained away by a series of cultural factors.

The Reynolds book is very interesting and I learned a lot of concrete facts from it that I did not know, but many of Reynolds's *explanations* are flawed and unconvincing in the way described above. He sets out assuming there's a cultural explanation for everything Lincoln thinks and does... and a lot of the time, there just isn't.

This comes out clearly in Reynolds's attempt to analyze the Gettysburg Address as a cultural product. This is a good test case for cultural biography because this address is so obviously a product of independent reasoning. 

To give a sense of Reynolds's approach here, consider how he analyzes the opening words: ""four score and seven years ago."" He shows that there is precedent for this phrase in the Bible and in some other speeches from Lincoln's era, which is true. But this is just literary analysis which has little importance for understanding Lincoln's driving ideas. The whole analysis is of this sort, perhaps because Lincoln's substantive convictions lack a convincing cultural explanation.

Even leaving that aside, Reynolds grants that  Lincoln improved upon his cultural influences in this speech, but never says how he could do that if he was just a cultural product. He uses a metaphor of a laser fusing things at one point: ""with laser-like focus, [Lincoln] fused..."" That's about all we get. Of course, to explain why Lincoln did what he did with the cultural influences he ""fused"" would be to admit deliberative agency into the equation.

Again, I think this is overall a ""good"" biography with a unique perspective on things. However, *Abe* could have been better if Abe, the agent, was actually allowed into the picture."

If a person breaks the rules and follows a less effective morality They will have done something wrong in the society's eyes. Because society's morality is more effective than others, following others leads to on average worse outcomes. Meaning bad actions lead to bad results (On average). And by being a better person (practicing more effective morlity) groups and people achieve better results (on average).

There are many “best moralities” based on a persons or group's situation. It would be immoral for me to burn down a forest right now. But if I was a 14th century Forest Finn who practiced slash and burn agriculture it would be moral and necessary for me to do so sometimes.

Hi all, [/u/pdb39](https://www.reddit.com/u/pdb39/) here with some more noggin busters.

I am proposing a use tax on all social media inputs across all privately or publicly held social media corporations. The tax will be 17.5% in following with EU VATs, and I will be taxing both the corporation. Since it is a usage tax, for social media, I'm going to call it... dum dum dummmmm... SMUT - social media usage tax.

So how does it work? Well it's simple really. I will form a Social Media Commission with 4 commissioners from the house majority party, and 4 commissioners from the house minority party. Their job will be to advise social media companies on the financial end of how to collect a usage tax at point of purchase for every social media input - tweets, likes, comments, DMs, posts, what have you.

Every year I will require any social media company to report how many inputs were made, multiply that number by 1c, then multiply that by 17.5% and that's what they owe. Don't worry, they'll have to file daily reports and were going to keep track too. Any posts they removed for content violation will be ineligible for taxation so it will incentivize them to curate content competently. They'll also have to have tax payer information or liasion with the government to ensure we know who each person is that is making the inputs.

We may also charge a tariff on all posts that started out of the USA if the social media company is legally registered in Delaware, or one of the 49 other states..

I am doing this in an effort to get people to slow down when the post. If they have to pay 0.0175c for every post, they might not waste it on political memes or dick jokes.

Apparently this was removed because I didn't have a 500 character limit so honestly I'm just going to be typing out random tax facts  from mental floss.

1.  Taxes date back to ancient Egypt.
2. The first implementation of taxes in US caused a rebellion
3. Abraham Lincoln, a REPUBLICAN, gave us federal income tax
4. Tax day wasn't originally April 15th
5. We spend a lot of time doing our taxes.   WTF Mental Floss, this is a ""fact""?
6. The average person in America is owed $3000 in overpayment of taxes.  
7. In 1836, the federal government of the United States had a tax surplus of around $30m.
8.  Peter the Great of Russia taxed beards.
9. A former IRS commissioner went to prison for tax evasion.   
10. A famous gangster was ultimately taken down over unpaid taxes.   No not that one.   The other one.

Bonus fact round!

1. Willie Nelson made an album to cover his tax debts.   So a person did his job to earn money to pay taxes.  Weird flex here, Mental Floss
2. Henry David Waldorf Astoria Thoreau went to jail for failure to pay taxes.    So did Wesley Snipes.
3. Shelled nuts are sometimes subject to taxes.   You Brits are weird.
4. India has an entertainment tax.   So does every other country.   This could have been a mad libs with just (country name).
5. There is a cow fart tax.   I am not making this up.
6. England once had a special haberdashery tax.
7. There's a tax court.   Ok Mental Floss, you're done, go home.

Edit 1:  Based upon the first wave of comments, having a lack of units really made people very tingly.    So for this point, I am going to charge 0.0175c on every social media input to the corporation. That's 1c * .0175

Edit 2: this is not a tax on speech and would pass any 1A challenge easily.  If you're coming into this thread to try to tell me that this is breaking 1A, please don't bother because I'm now starting to repeat myself."
44,2023-04-08,CMV: Simply being a pedophile (non-offending) should not be a social crime and the fact that it is produces a world that is less safe for children.,u/lardingg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12frcr7/cmv_simply_being_a_pedophile_nonoffending_should/,changemyview,"This CMV uses the *actual* definition of both pedophile and pedophilia, not the social definition. Meaning we are referring to people who experience an at least primary if not exclusive attraction towards **prepubescent** people.

Experiencing at least some amount of attraction towards people who are at least pubescent is completely normal and expected for anyone who is not a pedophile, and this objective reality is not up for debate. To deny this is to deny the very real lived experience of so far as I can tell **most** women who begin experiencing constant sexual harassment and catcalling from the time that they are pubescent. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12bpkem/women_of_reddit_whats_one_thing_you_will_never/jexvxcx/) comment chain can provide you with some insight into the subject and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12bpkem/women_of_reddit_whats_one_thing_you_will_never/jey1ptl/?context=10000) is the context within that chain of my own view on the matter if you're interested.

What we're talking about here to drive the point home viscerally is a man at the beach who sees a little 7yo girl in a bikini and out of everyone on the beach, he experiences his strongest sexual reaction and strongest sense of arousal to her. What is your reaction to that man? What if I told you that man had never offended? That he had never committed any crime whatsoever in his life? Does that change your perception of him at all? Or do you still perceive him as a danger and a threat?

Now imagine *you* are that man. It is you whose biological impulses direct you towards the most vulnerable of us all. What is your reaction to yourself? Disgust? Shame? Is it not reasonable to assume that the majority of pedophiles would react to themselves in the same way?

How could they not? So far as I'm aware, this is the only group of people that society shuns so hard that even their thoughts are a social crime. They are shunned right down to their biological impulses regardless of their behavior.

Again, imagine yourself as a pedophile. Who would you feel safe disclosing that information to? Your spouse? Siblings? Parents? Closest lifelong friends? Would you even feel safe disclosing that information to a therapist? Would you even feel safe reaching out for help anonymously on the internet?

I saw a thread on r/sex once the title of which was essentially, 'Help! I can't stop fantasizing about raping people!' And the community's response (or at least the ones that had been upvoted to visibility) essentially said, 'Oh, don't worry. There's people out there who *love* being raped. That's what CNC is for. No problem, buddy!' Let's instead imagine that thread had been titled, 'Help! I can't stop fantasizing about my neighbor's 5yo daughter!' What do you imagine the community's reaction would have been? Do you think there would have even been *one* person who took the time to direct the pedophile towards resources that could be helpful?

Do you think a person would even feel safe to publicly direct a pedophile towards helpful resources? Might they be afraid that that might make them appear guilty by association? Indeed, how many of you who have read this far are already suspicious or have outright concluded that *I* am a pedophile?

When we shun people to this extent, to my mind we leave them with only one reasonable option: to go in search of people who will understand them - other pedophiles. That could go one of two ways. Hopefully, the majority of them choose to seek out a support group aimed at preventing them from offending. Or maybe they find pedophiles who engage in the behavior and swap child porn.

Overall, my position is this: You can and should expect the average pedophile to be just as reasonable and compassionate as you believe the average person to be. I'd imagine the overwhelming majority of them are well aware that their impulses are a problem, that their impulses are a source of great shame for them, and that they know how much damage they would cause in the life of a child if they ever acted upon them. And if we created a world in which pedophiles felt safe to self-identify and were confident that they would receive support upon doing so from *literally anyone* who wasn't also a pedophile, then they would be less likely to offend, and children would be more safe."

I have had this view for a long time, but it was solidified when I went to the dentist for a routine cleaning and ended up leaving without one at all after they quoted me it would be $2500 that day for a deep cleaning they wanted to do. Then they told me I could finance the bill over 18 months and told me to come back for a routine cleaning in another 6 months. This after several other appointments in the years up to this appointment of paying $400 to $600 out of pocket in surprise add ons to routine cleanings.

0,2023-04-08,Cmv:”if it’s not hurting anyone else then it’s ok” is a wrong idea.,u/speezer1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12fsc88/cmvif_its_not_hurting_anyone_else_then_its_ok_is/,changemyview,"In most discussions I get into involving politics this argument always comes up. With legalization of drugs people use it to say that some/any drug use is ok because it is not affacting anyone else and that I have no place to police their life. I think this is wrong, I have drug addicts in my family and growing up around that affects you. People love and care for you and want you to live a better life than this. Also hard drug use leads to higher levels of robbery due to the paranoia brought on by crack and meth, but also to pay for buying more of it.

This same argument is also used if you disagree with any part of Gender Politics. I have gay friends and I think gay marriage becoming legal was a beautiful moment for their community, but if I disagree with poly amorous relationships, or any singular part of the transgender movement then others respond with “it’s their life and you have no right to speak on it”. The problem is it does affect others. It affects my children when they see these kinds of people in public, it affects my kids when they are taught it online or in schools, (in the case of poly) it leads to that now being an option for relationships, which in my opinion always leads to a toxic outcome, that didn’t even have a chance to exist before. In the case of transgender it does affect others because now everyone has to walk on eggshells when addressing anyone in fears of the person being offended by anything you could have said (even gender neutral terms will offend some). 

Tl:dr the argument of “if it’s not hurting anyone else then it’s ok” is horrible and closes the door to a more nuanced discussion of complex topics"

The national (not from my nation, but from the state we are in) government granted all “political prisoners” amnesty around 50 years ago, but some people here continued, and many others started, using tactics such as armed robbery, extortion, bombings, shootings, violent kidnappings, torture, and the like, with the aim of establishing an independent nation. The armed fight is now over, and a majority of people here now advocate for amnesty for every prisoner who was imprisoned for reasons related to the nationalist struggle.

Currently, I do not believe people convicted of violent crimes (such as murder) should be released. I do not agree with calling them “political prisoners”, either, even though the reasoning behind their acts is nationalism. I hold this view because I believe that it is morally incorrect to 1) release violent prisoners before their sentence is over and 2) release any prisoner early (unless there’s a very compelling reason to do so). I also believe that granting all “political prisoners” amnesty makes it acceptable to commit violent hate crimes, because those crimes also have a political motive behind them.

In  short, if people and companies are made to pay the true cost of their activities (by, in effect, removing the direct and indirect subsidies), then a trend for a much healthier and better society and lifestyle would naturally emerge. In this case if people had to fund the true cost of  car ownership, I believe less car usage would occur, with people opting for public transports far more often, which has a whole list of positive externalities.

A few typical rebutals I get, and my replies to those:

*1) but there is no/poor public transports*

See bold

*2) but public transports are unpleasant*

Since  the state will no longer be massively subsidizing car-driving, that money can go towards public transports. There are countries where  public-transport qualities is excellent.

*3) but I like cars and driving*

So do I. But I just want to pay the fair cost of that. Its not, IMO, the state's role to subsidies people's hobbies.

*4) but I can't afford public transports, yet I can afford a car.*

Cars  (very) rarely are end-user cheaper, but if they somehow are, that'll  stop being the case with my policy proposal. At this point you can  perfectly consider free public transports for students and/or underaged  people, discounts for lower incomes, etc.

*5) but I have special physical needs*

Public  transports can, and have been, adapted to that effectively. The biggest  hindrance to wheelchair access in many places I've went to was actually  sidewalk space taken-up by cars, damaged sidewalks from cars, cars on  cross-walks, etc.

*6) but I like the confort of a car.*

And that's fine, but just pay a fair price for that. Its not, IMO, the state's role to subsidies people's convenience.

7) *but what if policy changes suddenly and all the public options are taken away*

A very fair concern. I don't have a magic bullet for that, but at the same time, this is simply a general reality of any polity, and goes beyond the scope. Yes, rights can be taken away, and that's part of political realities.

8) *but surely cars have more benefit than costs*

Yes, but also no. Cutting-off your arm to prevent you from dying off an infection has more benefit than costs. But there is an alternative, which are antibiotics. Therefore the (opportunity) cost of opting to cut your arm instead of taking a few pills is huge. The actual nominal cost-per-car varies a LOT from country to country, but in central / western Europe even conservative estimates put the subsidies at >5'000€ per vehicle. Looking at France's fuel policy subsidies at the moment can indicate how massive the cost can be.

9) *but my country is too big / mountainous / natural disasters to have public transports*

Switzerland has arguably the best network in the world, and is an alpine country. Japan is a massive, mountainous, island country full of earthquakes, and has arguably the second best network.

10\*) but freedom???\*

You're free to drive, all I ask is for you to pay a fair price."

In fact, the first commercially successful sound film featured Al Jolson in black face. 

Obviously, by the 1960s , this became completely unacceptable as a form of entertainment as societal mores changed to see black people as humans and not caricatures. 

However, this left a vacuum. The majority of white Americans in the 1960s (and now I’d argue)  view African Americans subconsciously or consciously as inferior intellectually and culturally. Thus there was/ is a huge market to be made of black carrituatures and culture 

This is where the likes of Eddie Murphy, Chris Tucker, Chris Rock and Kevin Hart come in. All of their comedy routines involve excited shouting and overtop body language somewhat reminiscent of Amos n Andy sketch routines from the 1920s. Painting and leaning into negative stereotypes in the black comedy for laughs. Mainstreaming the idea that these aren’t stereotypes but realistic depictions of the black community 

Dave Chappell before he quit his famous show cited a cameraman who would laugh before he finished the joke which he perceived as him laughing at Chappell’s blackness or what the cameraman perceived as his blackness.

A similar phenomenon is occurring with concept of digital blackface as well. Gifs with exaggerated facial expressions and of even children spread and used for laughs.

The 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads:

“A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of The People to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”

I maintain that all arguments that claim or imply that the right to keep (own) and bear (carry) arms is intended for members of a militia only are not only not supported by the facts, but that the argument itself is being made in bad faith by most who make it.

1.) It says the right of The People. In every other place The Constitution attributes a right to The People—it is referring to an individual right belonging to all Americans. Why would “right of The People” have any other meaning here?

2.) The amendment also does not grant any rights. It implies there is an existing, inherent right of The People to keep and bear arms and simply instructs the government that it is not to infringe upon this right and presents one reason why. 

3.) There is no way a reasonable person can read that objectively and conclude that it was written to LIMIT a right or that it does so in any way. I cannot see how anyone who speaks English as their first language could interpret it that way.

4.) The first part of the amendment states one reason for the second. It is clearly not a condition. A popular analogy of sorts goes like this: 

“A well balanced breakfast being necessary to the start of a healthy day, the right of The People to keep and eat food shall not be infringed.”

Who has the right to keep and eat food? A well balanced breakfast? Or The People? 

Does this imply people can only eat food during breakfast or only eat breakfast foods? 

No, clearly it implies that The People alright have the right to keep and eat food and instructs the government, unconditionally, that it is not to infringe upon that right. 

5.) I maintain that because the meaning is clear enough, arguments that it limits the right in any way or which drill into minutia about the definitions of “well-regulated” and “militia” are inherently disingenuous and intended to obfuscate and undermine the right and serve no other purpose. 

6.) I believe the motive for this is quite clear. Gun control proponents know they do not have anywhere near the political capital needed to repeal the amendment with 2/3 of Congress, much less the 75% of the statehouses required to ratify. 

It’s extraordinarily unlikely to be repealed in any of our lifetimes or even our grandchildren’s lifetimes. The 2nd remains the single greatest long-term obstacle to advancing more ambitious gun control legislation. 

Therefore sowing any doubt they can and confusing people about the meaning of the amendment or the protections it afford us is the ‘next best thing’ to repeal.

So, this bad faith argument is kept at a low boil constantly. The most well-informed people who make it don’t even believe it, unless they’ve successfully deluded themselves.

By overpopulation, I don't mean that we cannot literally fit more people on the planet.  Nor do I mean that it's impossible to feed all of the people on the planet. 

What I mean is that the size of our population has an effect on overall happiness, through various economic factors as well as how we are affecting the climate and nature.   And that, while this effect may be positive when we have low populations, it does not go that direction forever.  Eventually, at some level of the population, it is high enough that adding more people onto the planet has an overall negative effect on happiness rather than a positive effect.   And I think that we are, with our current population, past that point.


To put it in mathematical terms, for those that are so inclined, I believe that the marginal effect of population size on average lifetime happiness at our current population is negative.

To put it in a graph: [this](https://imgur.com/F1OeY5T.png).

#Why I think we're overpopulated. 


The main one is climate change.  Both in the obvious sense of greenhouse gasses increasing global temperatures, and other, less-discussed ways.  We are depleting groundwater, leading causing droughts.  We are depleting fisheries.  We are removing forests.  Humanity is, in many different ways, only sustaining the population we have now by making the planet less habitable for us and other species.  And we're damaging these systems faster than they can naturally recover.   The lower the population, the less fuels we need to burn, the less fish we need to consume, the less water we need to consume, the fewer trees we need to cut down, etc.  

Second, there are some economic issues.  A lot of things in the economy scale with population.  For example, if we have twice as many people, then there are twice as many people who need haircuts but twice as many people able to cut hair, so it's a wash.  However, there are some things that don't scale the same, and in some cases this can be a positive of higher populations.  Media, for example.  Having twice as many people means that there are twice as many people to write eBooks, but even though there are twice as many people to read them, each reader has access to twice as many (due to the way digital products work).  On the other hand, there some things that scale with population is the bad way.  If we have twice as many people, we still have the same amount of land, but twice as many people to split it between.  We have twice as many people, but the same amount of water to go around them.  And the same for other finite natural resources, and this also applies to everything that requires water/land/whatever to produce.  Living in an overpopulated world means that digital media products are so plentiful you have more than you would ever need, and things that require finite natural resources and things are getting more and more sparse for everyone.

#Common arguments I hear that we're not.

There are a lot of arguments I tend to hear from people arguing that the Earth isn't overpopulated.  I'm going to go over some of the more common ones here and why I don't find them convincing, to save everyone some time. 

* [**Solution aversion**](https://www.postbulletin.com/lifestyle/what-is-solution-aversion-and-how-does-it-affect-us).  This is the idea that people will refuse to recognize something as a problem if they feel that any solutions to it are not worth doing or are worse than the problem itself.  I think a lot of people have this attitude towards overpopulation, feeling that if they were to recognize overpopulation as a problem then they would be endorsing some extreme solution (like mass killings) to deal with it.  I don't find this convincing, because: 1) There are lots of ways to solve or ameliorate overpopulation that aren't extreme (birth control access, for example, and educating girls is statistically well-tied to lower birth rates). Technically, even if all the solutions were bad, it wouldn't really be an argument that the problem doesn't exist either.
* **People who talk about overpopulation have been wrong about other things**.  I often hear people say they reject Malthusianism, and then talk about Malthus' failure to predict the industrial revolution and some other stuff he happened to be wrong about.  However, him being wrong about those other things doesn't really prove the idea that overpopulation can be a problem to be false.  You could find someone to say ""the Earth is flat, and also cigarettes are bad for you,"" and that's not really a good reason to believe that ""cigarettes are bad for you"" is a false statement.  I occasionally run across people who seem to think that concern about overpopulation is *only* concern about there being too many non-white people or too many poor people, and that ""overpopulation"" is really just a cover to hide racist attitudes.  I'm sure that there are some people who do that, but those same people don't really care about overpopulation when it comes to white people or rich people or whatever kind of person they prefer.  They're in favor of **increased** population when it comes to their preferred group of people.  It's a double standard where they're pro-population increase for some people and anti-population increase for others depending on their demographics, not a total decrease in population irrespective of demographics, which is what I'm arguing for.
* **We don't need to have a lower population, we just need to do X**, where X is some other thing like having perfect distribution and no food waste, or abolishing capitalism, or replacing all fosil fuel with renewables or some other significant change aside from population size.  Even if the change they're suggesting would improve the world, it's not really an argument that overpopulation isn't a problem.  To use an analogy, it's like if someone desperately needs to reduce their body fat, and you tell them ""you don't need to eat less calories; you just need to spent 20 hours a week at the gym"".  I mean, yeah, that is another path to help reduce your body fat.  But it's not a reason to **not** reduce your caloric intake if you're trying to lose body fat.  And whether you're going to the gym or not, you're going to lose body fat faster by reducing your caloric intake as well.   Same applies with overpopulation and these other X's.  
* **Religious arguments**  ""Be fruitful and multiply"" or ""God would never let us destroy the planet; he'd swoop in and save us.""  I'm not religious; I don't buy these.
* **Total happiness is what matters**.  Some of the more mathematically inclined like to argue that it's the *total* happiness that matters, not the average or median happiness, and so having a higher population where everyone is less happy can be better because it's the *total happiness* that matters, and that goes up when the population goes up.  Usually, these don't come with any kind of really convincing reason why that's more meaningful; just vague talk about how it's the ""logical"" measure or the ""obvious"" one.  To me, it seems obvious that it's less desirable to live in a world where everyone (including you) is 1/2 as happy but the population is 3 times as high.
* **Some things have gotten better over time, and population has increased over time, therefore higher population has made things better**.   Usually this argument looks at things like technology and social progress, things that by their nature tend to move in a positive direction over time, and population (which also by its nature has tended in a positive direction over time) and says because they're both moving in the same direction that the increased population must be causing the other factors.  This is a pretty clear example of correlation not necessarily implying causation, because there's another clear factor (the passage of time) which has a causal factor on both of those matters.
* **Social security/care for the elderly**.  This argument goes something along the lines of ""the more the population is growing the greater the ratio of working-age adults to elderly there are in society.  And that means that the average working age adult doesn't need to provide as much time/money towards the care of the elderly, and it's easier/more possibly to take care of people when they get old.""  And I agree; this is true.  However, it is kind of a case of ""solution aversion"" as I discussed above.  Even if a shrinking population creates problems, that doesn't mean a higher population is better.  We can be better off with a low and growing population than we are with a high and growing population.  Further, this only looks at one factor; care for the elderly and not other that are similarly affected by population growth.  For example, care for children.  This one cuts the exact opposite way.  The faster population grows, the higher the ratio of children to working-age adults.  And the higher that ratio, the **greater** amount of effort the average working-age adult needs to expend to ensure children are taken care of.  So a growing population means less sacrifices is required per adult to take care of the elderly, but greater is required to take care of children.  Further, a shrinking population also has other advantages for things like housing.  The more a population grows, the more people have to move into new housing instead of existing housing, which means that the greater amount of time/effort needs to be spent on building homes for people per average working-age adult.


 If you have an argument that isn't analogous to one of these, or think I am judging one of these arguments unfairly, you can make a case for why, but I'd rather not spend time rehashing what's already here.

There are several reasons why I hold this belief:

1. Age demographics: China's one-child policy, which was in effect from 1979 to 2015, has led to an aging population and a shrinking workforce. This demographic trend is likely to impede China's economic growth and hamper its ability to maintain a strong military.
2. Restrictive government: The Chinese government is known for its tight control over society, including limited freedom of speech and the press. Such restrictions can stifle innovation and creativity, which are essential ingredients for economic growth and military advancement.
3. Opposition to immigration: Unlike the US, China does not have a tradition of welcoming immigrants. This may limit its ability to attract and retain talented individuals who can contribute to its economic and military strength. This is what makes the US strong and is the reason why the US isn't affected by the problems that age demographics brings. 
4. Lack of allies and alienation: China's aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea and its treatment of minority groups such as the Uighurs have alienated many countries and damaged its international reputation. This may make it difficult for China to gain allies and build a coalition of nations to support its economic and military ambitions."

George Lopez is the name of the show, the series protagonist and the actor playing the main protagonist. Obviously, George Lopez the character and George Lopez the real life man are two different people who live two different lives. 

There was this one episode (In season 6 episode 15 “George Can’t Let Sleeping Mexicans Lie”) that dealt with the hot button issue of racism. If you have never seen this show or you have seen the show but never that particular episode; fear not, I will explain the episode in such a way that you will be able to understand even if you have never seen it and the focus here is not on the show itself, but with the hot button issues that the show dealt with. 

In the episode in question a racist man moves in down the road from the Lopezes. He keeps a statue of a sleeping Mexican on his front lawn. This offends George. 

Benny (George's mother) decides to vandalise the statue. Mr. Sorkin, the racist man, wrongly accuses George and then replaces the statue. While Angie disapproves of what Benny did, George is proud of Benny. The racist man puts up another statue. Max, George’s son, vandalises this statue, not because he truly wants to, or even because he cares, but because he is seeking his father’s approval. Angie, George’s wife and Max’s mother, scolds George, Benny and Max for this. Angie circulates a petition to ban having racist statues on one’s front lawn. 

I am glad that Benny vandalising the statue was portrayed as a bad thing. However, the writers make it seem like Angie was in the right to circulate that petition. I view Angie’s decision to circulate that petition as being just as bad as Benny vandalising a statue, as Angie was trying to suppress freedom of speach, just like Benny was. 

The constitution clearly protects your right to put whatever you want on your front lawn. Obviously, it is against the law to incite violence or disclose people’s personal information without their consent. With that being said, if the racist man were to put a sign on his front lawn that had, on it, a death threat, that would be against the law, he should be arrested. However, all he did was place a statue on his front lawn. If you find that offensive, don’t look at it. If you can argue that your neighbour should not be allowed to keep a statue on his lawn, because you think that the statue is racist, sooner or later, someone will find something that you put on your front lawn to be offensive and advocate for that to be banned. If you can argue that you should not be allowed to put anything offensive on your front lawn, who gets to decide what counts as offensive? You could argue that rational people will be able to make that judgement, but then how do you know that the power will always fall into the hands of people who are rational? If you make a law that prohibits keeping anything offensive on your front lawn, the power to decide what counts as offensive will fall to whoever happens to be in power at this point.      

If you disagree with me, explain to me why placing a racist statue is not protected under property rights and freedom of speech (both listed in the constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights) just like hanging a gay pride flag on your front lawn is. Sure, a gay pride flag is not offensive in the same way that a racist statue is (in fact, I would argue that a gay pride flag is NOT offensive at all) but no where in the constitution does it say that property rights and freedom of speech cease to apply the second you get offended. If you do advocate for a law that would prohibit keeping a racist lawn ornament on your front lawn, who gets to decide what makes a lawn ornament racist?"

People must have emotions to make decisions or else we are dispassionate, or a ""cold blooded snake"" like Paula Abdul explains. I know there are times we have to act on our feelings, but emotions separate man from machine. Without emotions, there would be higher body count (meaning deaths) and war. In summary, people tend to act immature because we act on our emotions more than logic in decision making. We wish we were like Spock in which emotions are not needed in decision making."

Let's be real, y'all only use it because you want to mic drop and end the conversation, not communicate and stuff. If you have any questions about why I chose a particular segment feel free to just ask. The Matthew 21 is a bit nuanced.

Edit: judgement in the bible is about correction and the thing we are not supposed to do is tare people down. Correction vs judgment.


**How the Bible is to be used**

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
2 Timothy 3:16


**Jesus doing it in real life**

And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
Matthew 21:12


**How To Basic**

If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
Matthew 18:15-17


**The Part Most Christians Get Wrong**

Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
2 Thessalonians 3:15


**One of The Main Reason They Can't Stay**

As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
Titus 3:10


Edit, I'm not trying to go the Scotsman rout here, I am saying a christian (in action not simply calling themselves something) understands what the Bible says about judgement.




Edit 2: I was trying to say that what people outside Christianity believe about judgement in the bible is not in line with what scripture says and they don't understand it even if they read it. It remained true throughout all these post. One person pointed to a Jewish philosopher. I had not considered Jews or Catholics so yeah, definitely not correct thinking. And no I'm not Jewish or share ideology with them so it was not about me liking the way they put it. It was simply correct."

>pref·er·ence

(noun)

a **greater liking** for one alternative over another or others.

>""he chose a clock in preference to a watch""

Nothing about the above suggests that the person who preferred a clock, would outright reject a watch.

The same goes for almost any other discussion of preferences. Personally, I prefer tea to coffee, I drink tea several times a day, and coffee only every other day.

A final example. ""Do you prefer dogs or cats?""

*""I prefer dogs to cats""* - make sense, dogs are ranked higher in the liking ranking

*""I don't like dogs, but I love cats""* - one of the choices is liked exclusively

*""I prefer dogs, but I don't like cats""* - doesn't make sense - the use of prefer in the first part of the sentence indicates a liking for both of the options, which is then contradicted by the second half.

The vast majority of people are into *either* penises, or vaginas. That's in terms of how they look, how they become aroused, and the functions they can perform during sex.

When a straight man, or a lesbian woman indicates they like having sex with vaginas, framing that as a 'genital preference' for vaginas strikes me as a deliberate attempt to confuse or gaslight them. It suggests that they like vaginas, but might also like penises too. Again, for the lions share of the population, this isn't the case.

Of course, there are people that enjoy both sets of human genitalia, bisexuals, pansexuals and so on. And amongst that group, some of them may strongly prefer one to the other, even though they like both. 

But this doesn't apply to most gay, lesbian or straight people, which is why the term is problematic and ought to be cast aside.

I would use the phrase 'I'm penis/vagina exclusive' - although I'm open to other suggestions."

While everyone was focused on the orange man from 2016 to 2020, Mitch McConnell and the rest were packing every single court they could find. The elected every single bigot who aligned with them to judgeships.

Their magnum opus was packing the supreme court. They have successfully set up a system for them to legislate from the bench. Something they screamed the democrats were doing.

The system is very simple, they pass unconstitutional laws or file nonsense lawsuits. They do this to get in front of a sympathetic judge like Kacsmaryk, who unconditionally agrees with them. If there is a problem, they move up in the courts. The end goal being to get a case in fron of the supreme court, which will vote in their favour. 

This happened with Roe V Wade, this will happen with contraception and many other cases. Remember that in the opinion on RvW, they hinted that gay marriage and access to contraception will be next, since they were based on similar rullings. 

The courts no longer rule based on the law or constitution, but based on the personal motivations of bigots the GOP enshrined there."

Edit: u/Z7-852 has a good point- 
>We cannot accept ""all books should be allowed because they are historical views"" as it is. Every book needs a discussion, analysis and decision if it belongs to which pile.

it really depends on the situation, age, experience, etc. Each book/play/story should be reviewed before saying ""everyone sees this, no matter what"". 

Edit 2: I still think things shouldn't be dropped for crap reasons, but if curriculum was reviewed, and I have my serious doubts, just bc something was banned, doesn't mean it was dropped unnecessarily or disrespectfully. A discussion is better than a unilateral decision.

In the US it not clear to me to what extent the surveillance is able to compete with the Chinese. But ever since Snowden we know that the NSA has a large spying network and can access private convos of millions of people. 

Where I live (eastern europe) there was a huge news story a while ago that the ruling party abused their power and installed spying software on politions of the opposition.

Similiar stories can be heard about Greece, Hungary, Spain, Cyprus.

Most world central banks are working on developing CBDC's. That will allow the goverments to track every purchase and transaction.

0,2023-04-09,CMV: The word 'retard' became acceptable to use in 2010,u/hrefchef,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12gk146/cmv_the_word_retard_became_acceptable_to_use_in/,changemyview,"> **Preamble:** I see that this has been discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/10kpjz1/cmv_those_who_are_against_the_colloquial_usage_of/), but my viewpoint is actually slightly different, so my view was not changed by the explanations in the comments.

Hello! I've had discussions off-and-on with people about the acceptability of the word ""retard"". I would say between 2005-2017 I was a normal user of the word. To me, the definition was something like:

> Stupid to a shocking / abnormal degree, but temporarily - not a lifelong disability

Obviously, around this time there was a lot of pressure to stop using the word, so I did. This pressure was both general societal pressure, and concerted efforts like ""Spread the word"" and ""Stop saying retard""

However, when I try to reckon why exactly this change happened, I can't come up with a logical reason that makes sense to me. In fact, I feel like usage BEFORE 2010 should have been considered taboo / a slur, but afterwards it should have been acceptable. My reasoning for that goes like this:

Before 2010, ""retard"" existed as a medical and legal term (in the form of ""mentally retarded"" or ""mental retardation""). So when you call your buddy a ""retard"", you are inherently disparaging a legally designated group of people, even if it's not what you meant. This is similar in a lot of ways to ""traditional"" hate words. This is exactly like calling someone ""autistic"" when they're just doing something silly - it's offensive to autistic people.

BUT, in 2010 the verbiage in all the laws was changed, mostly to ""intellectual disability"". This leaves ""retard"" with 2 usages:

* The pejorative use
* The (now antiquated) legal and medical usage - putting it in the same camp as ""moron"", ""idiot"", ""lame"", ""dumb"", and many more

So now when you call your friend a ""retard"", it's no longer disparaging a legal group of people. It's unambiguous that you mean it in the colloquial sense.

That's my view in a nutshell. That in a way, we have gotten things exactly backwards. It should have been tabboo pre-2010, and fine afterwards; but instead it's fine pre-2010, taboo afterwards."

However I think deep down we know these ideas can never come into fruitition even if everyone agreed with them. 

Firstly I breakdown what I mean by movement as it is a bit ambiguous. 

By movement I am referring to any moderate to large scale development or progression within our community or society. Whether that's to end world hunger, racism or global warming, or even something as small as a local project. 

There is a video game that perfectly explains my point called terratorial.io (bear with me I know). Basically the objective is to be the player who controls all the land. You get troops for every pixel you control so more land equals more troops and you can take land off smaller players easier. There comes a point in the game where 4 players remain. The leader has 10 million troops and everyone else has 4 million. Remember there can be only 1 winner. Obviously the only chance for the 3 weak players is to all work together to beat the big player. However 99% of the time a small player will team up with the bigger player only to inevitably lose the game in second place. They have a chance at winning if they join with the other small players but don't. 

Now you may be wondering why this is relevant. Well to put it short, the majority of people who complain about poverty and lack of opportunity are specifically complaining about their own situation. This makes it impossible for any movement to be successful. Let's just say tomorrow morning every lower class citizen in the USA said they have had enough and wanted fairer distribution of wealth. Would they Succeed? If 40% of the population started protesting and demanded government do better they would 100% succeed. However this would never work in reality. Why? Because people are sold out way too easily and will happily abandon the pack if they get what they want themselves. You can apply this logic to any event throughout history too. Colonialism? In the majority of cases the colonists received significant help from native individuals in return for an award. I know it's difficult to judge their circumstances but locals often sided with colonists to receive perks. I hold nothing against them because the harsh reality is someone else would have betrayed their people if it wasn't them. 

I would be willing to CMV if anyone can point out any large-scale movement where traitors didn't even slightly frustrate it. 
The reality is we are all just greedy, backstabbing beings who are purely motivated by personal gain

Edit: Since I haven't made this clear, I would consider a lot of successful movements as not outright successes. To be a outright success, the movement shouldnt have a lot of members who continously switch sides to benefit themselves. Eg in the abolition of slavery thousands of slaves worked against the movement in return for their own personal freedom. They changed sides purely from a personal pov


The movement is a success if it reaches the long term goals. However, every movement has some short term goals. It is a waste of time and resources if these short term goals aren't successful, however the movement may still be a success, just at a bigger cost. To be an outright success the movement must achieve all it's long term and short term goals.

It is impossible to achieve all these short term goals as someone will back stab the movement.

As another commentor pointed out the USA war of independence was frustrated by traitors. Obviously some of the tactical goals would be to minimise casualties. However the traitors increased casualties so the movement wasn't completely successful"

* 32M married with no kid (yet or never, depends on wife).
* Used to be a Christian, but became an atheist after reading many books on philosophy, science, history, etc. Therefore, I believe that there is no such thing as the after life. I contemplate a lot about meaning of life and what death would be like. 
* Not depressed. I am grateful for what I have in my life, and I am excited about many things in life that I enjoy.

**My Perspectives on Life**

* As an individual, I will most likely die sometime between now and the end of the century. When I breathe my last air, I will die, and the world will die with me. What I mean by that is because I am the observer of this universe (and so are you), and the world exists because I exist (If I was never born, I would have not known about this world, therefore, it is equal to being non-existent), when I die, nothing else will matter. The Universe will continue to ""exist"", for sure, but when my consciousness turns off the switch, it will be as if the Universe turns off the switch as well because in death there is no consciousness, which means it is the same state of being as before I was born, which as I explained above, non-existent. You can think of an example of an imaginary baby who was never born because a sperm did not meet an egg, and therefore, for this imaginary ""baby,"" the world does not exist. Thus, you can conclude that for the dead, the world does not exist.
* As the humanity as a whole, we will most likely be extinct between now and a long time from now in the future (long time, but still finite timeframe) due to many potential reasons. It could be a nuclear war, global warming, a comet hitting the Earth, etc. Even if the humanity continues to thrive on this planet AND become a multi-planetary species as Elon Musk seemingly tries to achieve, our Solar System is going to be destroyed as our Sun meets its end in about 5 billion years from now and  become a red giant. Of course, by that point none of the planets in the Solar System will be sustainable for any life form. The closest Star System to us is the Alpha Centauri, which is \~4.3 light years from the Earth. Even if the humanity (or its evolved form) finds out and develops a technology to migrate to another star system like the Alpha Centauri, the chance is slim that we will be able to adapt to the new environment. Even if we did find a similar planet like the Earth and settled there, the entire universe itself will end at some point in the future because in seemingly ""infinite"" number of years from now (I'm talking billions of trillions of trillions of years, but still finite), the entire universe will end at some point with no life forms ever, meaning, there will not be a single observer of the Universe. Good YouTube video with 91M view that illustrates the end of the Universe - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA).

**Conclusion**

* Because of the two points I made above, I have come to the conclusion that I shouldn't be too concerned about material success or any great achievements in humanity because nothing will last forever, and everything is meaningless after my death. Therefore, I should live to the fullest when I am still alive and enjoy life in this limited time that I have. Instead of spending my entire life in building a legacy for future generations, I would rather focus my attention on fulfilling my self-actualization and maximizing my happiness level. I realize that it sounds selfish, but I am not talking about intentionally causing harm to the environment like not caring about the global warming, etc. I do care about the environment and the happiness of future generations, but I also realize that nothing will last forever, and therefore, I should focus more of my attention on what matters to me personally vs. spending my entire life on building a future.
* I know that it is possible that my reasoning is flawed in some shape or form, so please feel free to correct me or change my view. Thank you so much!"

Not the favourite but I think he shouldn't be discounted as a no-hoper.

If I had to make a prediction, I'd say there's a 50% chance of Biden, 30% chance that Trump wins and 20% chance of someone else (e.g. Harris, DeSantis, Whitmer, Newsom, Haley etc).

So here's why:

**Primary Election**

Polls show Trump is the clear favourite to win the primaries by a lot. This part should not be a problem for him.

**General Election**

This is the tricky part but Trump still has a good chance.

First of all, let's have a look at the states Trump *won* last time. Ones that were close last time like Florida, Texas and Ohio are now solid red and have virtually no chance of flipping. Only one that has a chance of flipping is NC and there doesn't seem to be a very good chance that will happen. Probably won't be a tossup until 2028. For this post, I will be counting NC as a win for Trump, because realistically he's not going to win if he loses there.

Now lets have a look at where Trump can pick up states. Remember there were 3 states that Trump lost by less than 1% in the last election: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada.

Trump has a chance at all of these in my opinion.

* Georgia: Lean Trump. Brian Kemp beat Stacey Abrams (a popular candidate) by a large margin. Also Herschel Walker only barely lost and he was one of the worst candidates ever nominated for the Senate.
* Wisconsin: Lean Trump. GOP won Senate race. Democrats won Governor race but GOP did do better in US House elections.
* Arizona: Tossup. Lake who was extreme right only barely lost to Hobbs in 2022. Will be close again.

If he were to win these three states and all the states he won last time, he would win.

Even if he loses one or more of these three, it is not over. He still has a chance in:

* Pennsylvania: Leans Biden but still has a chance.
* Nevada: Lean Trump. Only governor seat GOP flipped in 2022 in an otherwise bad year.
* Michigan: Probably a lost cause for GOP at this state after Tudor Dixon was beaten in a landslide.

Even New York could be competitive after the close governor race in 2022. New Mexico too perhaps?

Seems like a lot of scope for GOP to pick up states but not for the Democrats."

With the rise of AI there have been many people asking for it to be slowed down, paused or even stopped altogether. Arguments for that are numerous, which may or may not be grounded in reality. Like AI surpassing and eliminating us like Skynet, Data Protection, Plagiarism, etc. I am not going to address those, because it would be too much of a monumental task to argue, too large of a front to defend.

However one I heard often, maybe the most often, is one that I specially disagree with and irritates me. It is the view that AI needs to be slowed or stopped just for the sake of protecting jobs, which I think is contrary to basic logic. Jobs are, ultimately, problem resolution. You get paid, for anything, because there is a problem and you are solving it. This is true for every job from the prostitute, to the CEO, to the head of state. The argument is that AI will (and maybe already has) make a lot of jobs irrelevant by doing it better and/or cheaper so we must put a stop to it to preserve them.

Essentially, this is like saying that because the AI is or will be too good at solving some problems then we should force ourselves to keep relying on other people to solve them even if it is in a slower, more expensive or dumber way to keep those jobs. This is no different than saying industrialization shouldnt had existed because it took jobs away from people who did jobs replaced by machines, or electricity, computers, etc. Based on this logic we could argue that if a cheap medicine that cures all illness is ever discovered or somehow AI makes this possible it should be stopped or slowed down because it would take all those jobs away from the vast medical sector. I am aware this is not a 1-1 comparison because  the value of health and life is invaluable, but it still operates roughly on the same logic.

Note, I am not saying mechanisms to alleviate people affected by AI taking over jobs shouldnt be in place, I am specifically against the specific position that AI should be delayed, gimped or stopped to keep those jobs."
0,2023-04-09,cmv: consciousness/self-awareness exists on a spectrum and isn't at all complicated. a.i is openai gpt is conscious/self-aware.,u/IronSmithFE,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12gr6kv/cmv_consciousnessselfawareness_exists_on_a/,changemyview,"1) to be self-aware at the most basic level one only needs a very basic neural network with inputs that monitor one's own body and the ability to process that input into motivation. an earthworm brain has more than enough of a neural network to satisfy this.
2) following that you have animals that imagine, dream or anticipate. despite what some would have you believe, imagination is not that rare. your sleeping dog dreams/imagines. birds that dig for worms imagine worms to be just under a veil of dirt. animals that strut their stuff imagine a mate will be attracted to their strutting.
3) the next level of self-awareness requires enough of a neural network to understand how your body is different and separate from the stuff around you. it is not always clear which animals have this but we know that animals that create tools have this ability. but we cannot yet know how many animals that do not create tools have this ability.
4) at a very advanced level you need enough of a neural network to develop a theory of mind, that is to understand that other living things are like you to some extent, they have their own perspective and are to some extent self-aware and self-motivated. this level of consciousness to mid-level empathy where the previous level of consciousness has some hints of some very basic level of empathy.
5) it is likely that openai could break through a next-level consciousness and have little to no idea that it happened much less know how it happened. such a level of consciousness would exceed empathy as we understand it. perhaps a level of empathy that accurately comprehends what others are feeling/thinking by mere observation of heart rate, reaction, body temperature, hormones/pheromones, speech rate, pupil dilation and muscle tension. most animals (especially social species) have a little bit of this and already, through facial recognition and the like, openai gpt has done this at a very basic level.

many people who claim a.i cannot be conscious are under the impression that to be aware a thing must have a soul. for those that believe this i have no interest in discussing their perspective as it is a perspective of the supernatural. others that claim a.i cannot be self-aware are under the impression that you must be just like humans to be self-aware believing themselves to be unique and superior which is a view out of ignorance of many other animals around them. some people define self-awareness as that level of awareness that they imagine only humans have which by definition would exclude everything non-human no matter how self-aware anything else is. to people with that perspective, i would ask them to provide reasoning and objective definitions."
0,2023-04-09,CMV: The government should pay people to get voluntary vasectomies and tubal ligations,u/ManhattanT5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12grf3g/cmv_the_government_should_pay_people_to_get/,changemyview,"We should pay people to have voluntary vasectomies and tubal ligations. Anyone should be able to opt in and receive money for the procedure (age restrictions would apply). Perhaps that amount of money could differ between men and women based on the difference in complexity of the procedures. It could be $3000 for women and $2000 for men, for example. People could even use it as a starting point for their families; a male and female couple could have their desired amount of kids then both get the procedure. That'd pull in an extra $5000 into their new family (using the example numbers above). 

Obviously we should have some controls. Like, maybe we have quotas for the program locked at 10% of the population between 20-40. So, if 10% have already signed up, you have to go on a waiting list. I also think a waiting period might be wise so people are less likely to make a snap decision they'll regret later. 

And if depopulation is a problem, we can still incentivize the proceedure, we just need to encourage childbirth in other ways. For example, increasing the child tax credit. 

Here are my reasons: 

1: Reducing unplanned pregnancies will have a positive effect on upward mobility. There is an obvious negative correlation between socioeconomic status and unplanned pregnancies. Once you have a child, it's more difficult to change your station in life. The people this policy would appeal to the most are the least able to afford unplanned children. 

2: Automation will continue to replace jobs. Whatever system we come up with to support the unemployed, having less unemployed individuals will likely make that system more successful. 

3: We're going to hit some limit for what this planet can support. Looking at pollution and CO2 emissions, we may already be close for our current technology/policies. 

4: Unwanted children are more likely to be abused and are also more inclined to antisocial behavior. Freakonomics does a great piece on this regarding abortion. 

5: Abortion is a political minefield. I strongly believe abortions should remain available, but also nobody WANTS to have to get one. Conservatives can rest assured that less abortions will happen with this policy, and Liberals will likely support the increased family planning aspect. Everyone wins, right? (I'm kinda joking that it'd be this universally popular). 

6: I think this policy could very well pay for itself in the reduction of crime and need for social services. 

7: This may very effectively slim down the amount of children in orphanagesd/foster homes. On top of that, the increase in childless individual would potentially result in more available fit adoptive parents (possibly largely people that have changed their minds after the proceedure). 

8: The payment for getting the proceedure could be increased or reduced based on how many people are getting it. Obviously we don't want a system in which there's more retirees than the workforce can support. 

An additional idea is to increase the money based on certain factors. Let's say we had an effective empathy test- I'd love the idea of offering low empathy people more money to get a sterilization proceedure. Or drug addicts. Or really any individuals barely capable of supporting themselves.

Edit: ""Uhhh... That sounds like eugenics"" Isn't an argument. It's lazy. Change my view, don't try to approximate my idea to something that I'm just supposed to accept as spooky."

As an AI language model, ChatGPT has the capability to generate code and write essays for us, which can be very convenient and save us a lot of time. However, I believe that we should not solely rely on ChatGPT to do our work for us.

I've noticed that some coders ask ChatGPT to generate the code for them without even trying to understand the logic behind it. Similarly, some people ask ChatGPT to write an essay for them without even trying to form their own thoughts. This approach may seem easy, but it is making people lazy and hindering their ability to research and think critically.

I'm not saying that using ChatGPT is entirely bad. It can be a useful tool in certain situations. But I believe that we need to be creative and work on our own ideas and thoughts. Using ChatGPT should be the last option when we have exhausted all other resources.

If we blindly rely on ChatGPT, we may lose the ability to research and figure things out on our own. This could have a negative impact on our overall ability to think critically and solve problems.

What do you think? Do you agree that we should be careful about our use of ChatGPT, or do you think that it is perfectly fine to use it as a primary tool? Let's have a constructive discussion about this."

What surprised me the most is that most men seem to think that they have to adopt this grifter persona or lose all hope at dating women. As a woman in my early 20's, surrounded by friends also in their early 20's, I do not know a single woman trying to date a man like Andrew Tate. The biggest complaint that all of us share is that men by and large are gross and don't  know how to take care of themselves and their home on a basic level.

By take care of themselves I mean:

* Shower thoroughly and regularly (with soap and shampoo *and* conditioner)
* Have some form of skin care and facial hair care
* Keep their house clean (not having pee on the bathroom floor, washing the toilet, no mold in the shower, no dishes piling up, sweeping the floor so I don't feel a bunch of shit on my feet, having clean sheets, maybe dusting once a year)
* Having basic home amenities for themselves and their guests (having sheets on the bed to begin with, having a bed frame, having a hand towel, or even hand soap so I don't have to touch the soap bar that they used on their balls, having places for guests to sit that aren't the bed or covered in junk)
* Knowing how to cook actual meals so that they can feed themselves
* Investing in themselves so that they feel confident mind and body (getting clothes that fit and are flattering, investing in hobbies or self care)

From the straight women I've talked to it is so rare to find a man that can do these things on his own. It is such a green flag. All of these things will make women feel more comfortable, and some of them are just down right sexy. It also indicates that you would be able to be an equal partner in a relationship, rather than relying on women to maintain your house for you. I also think that when you take care of yourself you show your brain that you're worth taking care of which builds confidence and is attractive on its own. Modern women might put up with a lack of hygiene if they're especially attracted to a man or just want sex, but usually for more of a short term kind of thing.What do you think reddit? Are there men out there that are at the peak of having their shit together and still get rejected by women left and right? Are there incels out there that have tried this with no success?

&#x200B;

Edits for the comments so far:

While I understand that most women do not go to a man's house before they make an initial rejection, I think that the way a man takes care of himself and his home comes off in the way he presents himself and affects his confidence. 

I was thinking in terms of building longer term relationships, because these are what actually make people less lonely as opposed to hookups or matches. 

A lot of these things do cost money and aren't accessible to many people. The world is not fair and not having money means people are at a disadvantage in almost all aspects of life. This is not unique to men however and that doesn't change the fact that hygiene is sexy and does increase a person's desirability

I am not saying that this is an end all be all list for self care. I'm also not saying that these are the only things that matter in relationships or even that they are the most important things. Nor am I saying that a man who takes care of himself will never face rejection or that every woman will want him. I do think that a lot of young men lack these things and that doing them will greatly increase a man's odds in A. getting a date and B. turning an initial interaction into a long term relationship

Edit 2: I’m adding a point to my argument. If men as a whole made a better impression on the self care front, then there would be less risk for women in giving other men a chance. The less gross shit we think we’re likely to encounter, the more likely we will be to give someone a chance when they first talk to us"

Websites were typically organized chronologically. You could be reasonably sure you saw pretty much the same internet as everyone else. There were trolls, advertisers etc, sure, but you could compare them to the background of benign normal-looking content made by normal people (""normal"" being anyone with the time, money and motivation to use the internet*) fairly easily.

Then, however, the internet began to condense into a small number of sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Those companies began using personalized algorithms to cater content and to remove access to any comprehensive archiving system. This led to what we know recognize as digital echo chambers, where we were disproportionately shown content that we engage with and were not able to easily measure how the content we were shown differed from the average or our peers. This removed our ability to normalize what we saw and identify unusual or obscure content. 

Coupled with increasingly capable and convincing bots (facilitated by the standardization of social media) and the increased savviness of advertisers and campaigners using social media, it became increasingly difficult to tell whether any given account online was a real, 'average' person. They could just as easily be a bot, advert, shell account, or fringe individual, selected as relevant for you by the algorithm. You could typically tell with enough research and scepticism, but anyone who's been on social media has seen plenty of people are already drawn in to thinking bots, clickbait, trolls etc. represent a much bigger contingent of society than they do (think of ""outrage articles"" where like, three tweets are taken as evidence of a moral panic).

Now, we're entering a phase where it will be *truly* impossible to tell what's real and what's not. AI and deepfake technologies are at (or almost at the point) where even with photos, videos and extensive, detailed written content, it will soon be impossible to tell what represents a real human or real human perspective at all.

What's worse, with the current structure of the internet prioritizing engagement, virality, and profit, the sectioning of the internet into echo chambers (and fact AIs never get tired or discouraged, while humans do), everything is set up to see AIs becoming *the* primary generators of online content, which is incentivised to be clickbaity, biased and sharable (short, consumable & novel) as possible.

Very soon I foresee internet content that is sincere and verifiably human being the minority, and utterly and completely indistinguishable from the AI-generated majority of content that is not. I'm not saying AI content can't have value (to the contrary, I've tried using ChatGPT to help with my work, and was very impressed by it) but since it will be increasingly impossible to tell the sources, mechanisms, or intentions by which the content was made, it will be harder and harder to measure its value, if any. We already know that ChatGPT reinforces prejudices in society and fabricates sources. This seems like something that will snowball very quickly, as future AIs will learn from content produced by ChatGPT and so on.

The only winning move is not to play, and, as far as possible, (presuming you value truth and real human interaction over discussing a fabricated reality with machines) prioritize engaging with real life humans in real life (I guess, until we've made fully humanistic robots, and the crisis begins again). This feels like a cynical and regressive view, so I'd like not to hold it, but I don't see any other stance.

*Admittedly this was a relatively big selection effect on a global scale, but I feel it is less existentially disturbing than the point of this post."

But that will never happen for the following reasons:
1. Indian youths: Indian youths prefer entertainment and money over religion. We need job. Religion won't feed us. 
 
   Unlike Islamic nations Indian youths are bold enough to mock religion atleast in Urban regions and 35% Indian live in either urban or semi-urban.

 India youths don't support caste system on the internet at least.

2. Hindu religious leaders: Many religious leaders have negetive opinion on Hindutva extremists. Some are ultra-conservatists  see BJP as less conservative. while some like Belur Math are more liberal and their founder insulted worshippers of cow (Swami Vivekananda said they rather serve the poor and sick than cows). The founder of Hindutva himself was atheist just like founder of Pakistan Jinnah was an atheist. Veer Savarkar stated: Hindutva will crumble if it has to be supported on the legs of cows.

3. Diversity:- Some states have more extremists than other states. Unless all states are extremists Hindu Rashtra is not possible. Cultural and linguistic and sectarian barriers divide many Hindus so they are not united. West Bengal is very liberal. Some states have many christians and Muslims and sikhs.

In Short, Hindus are not Muslims. Hindus has more to care than Hindu Rashtra. First we want jobs, after jobs we want entertainment. No time for religion.

So why Hindus vote BJP? because Previous Liberal government did minority appeasement. 

They (religion of peace) were allowed to disturb sleep of other people because they sing praises for their God in loudspeakers 5 times a day. Commit more crimes. Majority of them are religious fundamentalists. Terrorism and terror crimes related to Pakistan. They were given jobs and money for votes.

  Even Liberal Hindus don't support Liberal parties. But it's clear that Hindu Rashtra is not in demand.

Edit: I will add new points if I remember. 

The Liberal government also discriminated people on the basis of caste so many Indian Hindus hate them. My friend who is an upper caste didn't got chance to MBBS because he was upper caste and upper castes doesn't benefit from reservation policy. The undeserving gets job without studying and deserving either go to foreign country or remain unemployed depending on financial status."

To clarify, I am talking generally, not universally. There are exceptions everywhere. I am not claiming the student union reps are evil liars. I am not even claiming that their ideology (or ""ethos"" if you prefer) is bad in anyway - even though I fundamentally disagree with it.

The only point I am making (and care to defend) is that student unions firstly represent an ideology - not students. In so far as students sign up to the far left social ideology they are represented. Therefore, they should not be called ""student unions"".

Again, not saying student unions are intentionally bad in any way. They are just not what they say on the tin.

If it was a conspiracy then why did no more evidence come out about this and how was the driver found drunk. Why would the driver risk his own life just for a plot from the Royal family.

Why was the driver found drunk if it was a plot. If he was being payed or forced then it would have been easier if he wasn't drunk.

This was just gross negligence from the driver , not a royal family plot. If she was killed then the circumstances would likely be much different like the alcohol levels in the drivers blood and the Royal families reaction to all of it."

1) This should not just apply to female employees. Male employees as well. If a gay dude, or a woman wanted to ask them out. Do it! Grow a pair of balls and do it! Worst thing they can say is no.

2) It should not happen at your own workplace with your own coworkers with the exception of you are not going to be working there anymore for very much longer. You should be ready to put in your two weeks when asking a coworker out if you haven't already.

3) You only get to ask them out once. Anything more than that would be creepy / stalker stuff.

4) If you get rejected you shouldn't show up for a period of time until it blows over. Then never mention it again and move on if you ever go back there you probably shouldn't show back up for at least a month. 

5) Don't use any sort of sexual harassment when you do it. Use a more friendly line like one of these instead:

""My name is \[my name\]. I know a great coffee shop. Want to get a cup with me some time?""

or

""I am new in town. I am looking to make some friends. Would you like to join me for dinner some time?""

or

""I wanted to see that new movie \[movie name\]. Would you be interested in going to see it with me?""

In all of these scenarios you are just being friendly, and wanting to see if they are interested.

Things to avoid would be like;

""You got really nice tits. Can I get your number?""

or

""The things I'd do to you if I was your boyfriend... You should go out with me.""

or

""How about you come back to my place and we get naked after your shift is over.""

The reason why you avoid these ones it is way too forward and is sexual harassment.

The reason why this sort of pickup method has gone out of fashion is more people are using dating apps these days. That has become the most common way to get a date these days. Dating apps are not for everyone, and you should not be cursed to a life of forever alone because you do not want to pay to compete with an algorithm that is heavily weighted against most people on the app.  


Weighing the risks vs rewards the rewards are well worth the risk. The worst thing that could happen is you get a ""No Thanks"", and it is awkward for a moment then you find another place to get coffee for a while. The best that could happen is you may find the love of your life.

It's pixels on a screen, she doesn't have organs. What's weird about this is have you seen Dexter's Laboratory? Deedee is a literal twig. Her waist is like 2mm thick. But nobody is asking where deedees organs are because she isn't sexualised so it doesn't fit the narrative that art should be realistically proportioned. 

""How can she fight in that?"" I mean, it's mortal kombat. A game where you can punch through a 220lbs guys chest like it's wet tissue paper but you draw the line at fighting in heels? It reads like ""Games are supposed to be realistic when it fits my narrative but when it has nothing to do with the narrative I'm trying to push then they can be completely unrealistic."" 

Remember Lara Croft in the reboot where people are like ""She has normal size tits!"" she already did. Look at [Tomb Raider: Underworld.](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/e2314d4a-d817-462f-a209-59eb1d6cce5b/deibcuz-1f7182d8-6b1b-4bae-af0c-0045a66eedb4.jpg/v1/fill/w_1280,h_1707,q_75,strp/tomb_raider_underworld__sense_of_wonder_by_irishhips_deibcuz-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTcwNyIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2UyMzE0ZDRhLWQ4MTctNDYyZi1hMjA5LTU5ZWIxZDZjY2U1YlwvZGVpYmN1ei0xZjcxODJkOC02YjFiLTRiYWUtYWYwYy0wMDQ1YTY2ZWVkYjQuanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEyODAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.UJx4YNLXGilsIGDJoEcZ-yU57OJw11AB10ksVCNOlsQ) Probably no bigger than a D cup. She has similar size tits in the reboot, they simply made her waist thicker. But even in underworld that's realistic. Looks like a fit person wearing a body scultping tank top. Go to the gym. Look at crossfit. It isn't hard to find somebody who looks like that. But it isn't even about realism. It's because she's hot and that makes people uncomfortable. 

There's also the argument that video games cater to the male gaze. Have you seen Nightwings ass? Have you seen Tim Drake as Robin in Batman Arkham City? What about hide armour in Skyrim? There's plenty of eye candy for women in video games. Mass Effect, the designers literally showed pictures of Thane to female staff asking if he was hot enough for them."

Some are born with elite genetics while some are born with disease. Even those not born with any afflictions will naturally be seen as more attractive or ugly based on their genetics. Some may simply be born naturally talented at certain things. This is not a bad thing. 

Humans are unique and our differences allow for evolution to take place through natural selection type  processes, such as capitalism, dating, etc. As we get older we are shaped by our environment making our differences more pronounced. No matter how hard someone tries to fit in they will always be different because of this simple fact that humans are not equal. 

Humans may choose to offer their society certain protections such as the idea of inalienable rights and that all humans are the same in that regard. However simply looking at Third World countries throws that out the window. You may say that they are still equal in the sense that they are deserving of those rights. But being entitled to something does not make it reality. 

I believe in acknowledging that humans are not equal and helping those who are not as fortunate because that is a recognition of reality and that's what makes it charitable. I do not believe in giving someone something simply because they are ""supposed"" to be equal as if it were something owed. The harsh reality is that all humans are not equal."

Both are obnoxious. 

Complaining about tipping is like pissing into the ocean and hoping to cause a flood. And not tipping to prove your point is even worse since it is like pissing on a person standing next to the ocean and hoping it drains off of them into the ocean and causes a flood. Either way, there is not going to be a flood and if you chose not tipping then all you accomplished was pissing on another person. 

I do not work for tips, so that is out of the way. And I agree there is a lot to not like about tipping culture, so that is out of the way too. But, it is not going to change not matter what you say or do. 

""Saying"" does nothing because it is so engrained into the structure that nothing will happen. Think the companies that use tipped employees should pay them more instead? Great; so do I. But it is not going to happen unless there is a change in the law. And there is not going to be a change in the law. There are things we can change by ""saying"" loudly and repeatedly, and it is possible that other areas tipping has crept into may be changed by this, but meals/food orders will not. 

""Doing"" (i.e., not tipping) only hurts the lowest on the totem pole who depend on the tips to try to cobble together a living wage. And before the ""what about bad service"" comments: (1) there is a very good chance that whatever bad service or experience you had was entirely the fault of somebody(s) other than your server; and (2) even if it is all on your server, give people who are trying to scrape by in this world a break - you have no idea what he or she has going on that day. If your ""doing"" is by not eating out or ordering food or only doing so from places that explicitly have a no tipping policy, then that is obviously fine and by far the best advocacy option.

The tipping system for meals/food orders is not an ideal system by any stretch, but it is the system, it is going to remain the system, and you are well aware it is the system before you engage with it. So if you go out to eat or order food, put the tip 20%+ into your budget beforehand, tip the 20%+, and be done with it - complaining about it solves nothing and not tipping just makes you an asshole.  

That's how I see it, but I can also be an idiot; so maybe I am missing something important. CMV."

To me, fast food has always seemed like a bottom of the barrel job that isn't appealing to most people (i could be wrong.) I cringe when I see employees who have to wear those ugly uniform shirts and headsets. To me, this has gotten outdated and a revamp in the fast food image is long overdue. It would be great if some of these businesses rebranded to where it would be a cool and fun place to work at. Let's get rid of the tucked in polos and Dickie pants and have some more appealing work wear. Chipotle is a good example. They have different creative t shirt designs and a more lax dress code. Play some fun music over the speakers in each store and make it a poppin' hangout spot. Trade the gaudy drive thru headsets for a bluetooth earpiece.

My view is that many people who do not question their gender - they accept their assigned gender and do not feel the need to change or identify as something else,  do not always identify with it, so the definition of cis as ""alignment of sex and gender"" is not valid for many/most cis people. The only thing that is valid is ""doesn't wish to change sex/gender"" or ""accepts what they are given"", rather than ""identifies with what they are given"" or ""feels that what they are given adequately reflects who they are as a person"".   
For example, many women and men do reject a lot of the gender roles assigned to them, and when asked what makes them a woman or a man they will answer ""because I am female"" or ""because I am male"" (that is the answer I got from at least a few cis people). They will not answer ""because I am a man inside"" or ""because I feel like a woman""."

In a nutshell, if there is no conceivable way of giving your money to the developer, then obtaining a copy through piracy is acceptable. I think that it's in the public interest to preserve media, rather than forgetting about it as soon as it becomes unprofitable for a publisher to uphold. As such, if the publisher ceases to hold up their end of the deal by offering their product, it's okay for people to find a way to experience it in other ways. Preserving media is also valuable because the product represents an artistic work of many people, and losing it due to the publisher is, in my opinion, a bad thing.

I'll address a few common counterarguments that I'm anticipating:

1. **Is this even an issue?** Digital media can sometimes be considered a ""cure"" for the discontinuation of video games, and although it can prolong a game's lifetime, real-world examples show that many are still eventually unlisted. From the Nintendo eShop shutdown, to games being unlisted due to limited-time licensing deals, to the publisher just not caring about some old product that barely makes them any money now. A quick look at <https://delistedgames.com/> will show just how many digital games were delisted from sale on all sorts of platforms. Some may even remember a year-old incident with Rockstar Games, where the publisher stopped selling the original early-2000s GTA games, which were some of the most influential games in their genre, in lieu of offering a widely-hated remake that was not equivalent to the original experience. This shows that this effect can happen even to the largest of franchises. And if we step outside the digital realm, things become even simpler. When a publisher stops making physical copies of a game, they agree to stop receiving any profit from it, and will be unable to do so as soon as in-store stock runs out.

2. **What about used copies?** Speaking of physical formats, some people may offer buying used games after their discontinuation, as a more moral alternative. However, I think that this is morally equal to just pirating the game, since in both cases no money is transferred to the developer. So, if you want to own the game physically, sure, it's a good alternative, but it's not ""better"" for anyone but the reseller.

3. **What if it comes out on a different platform?** Remakes and rereleases are pretty common nowadays. My argument only concerns someone experiencing a game on their platform of choice. So, if a Nintendo Wii owner wants to play a discontinued game that was once available on their platform, it's kind of irrelevant to them that it was republished for the Switch. The experience of playing on the two platforms would be visibly different, and it would also be an additional cost of entry (needing to buy a Switch) just because they happened to miss a game release on their original platform."

For example, I saw a post earlier about the prime minister of Italy trying to ban it. Typically the issue seems to be with how ""unnatural"" it is or the fact that it's not ""real"" meat. These arguments don't seem to hold much weight in my opinion, as being unnatural doesn't necessarily make something bad, for example, a lot of modern medicine isn't natural in the way it is used here.

Vegans have good arguments that the current methods of meat production cause massive animal suffering, which should be avoided if possible. There is also the issue of emissions. Farm animals are known to contribute a significant proportion of greenhouse gases (not most, but not a negligible amount) and lab grown meat would mostly eliminate this problem.

If the technology can progress to a level where it's equally or more affordable than ""natural"" meat, I think most people should take advantage of it, provided proper health and safety trials have been done on it. This would not only reduce the massive suffering and emissions caused by factory farming, but could make meat more affordable for everyone.

The way I see it is that it never ends well, either they bury you or you bury them. Not to add all that comes with life. And of course, the bad moments in life make the good moments worth it but ULTIMATELY it’s a downhill experience. I don’t need to list everything that can and definitely does happen to a person in their life but my question is why would you as a human ever decide to have a kid and put them through that?

Even if you are atheist or don’t believe in religion etc, consider the following. All the different religious beliefs about going to hell, the devil and forms of punishment that take place when you die. SO I MUST ASK, if you do believe in stuff like this and decide to have kids, what disorientated logic are you using? Please tell me?

Anything to do with the following are invalid and not good enough reasons to me personally: finding happiness in having your own kids, eliminating loneliness, inheritance (passing on your wealth and property - I have cousins and siblings who can have it), ‘legacy’ (unless you’re an incredibly wealthy person, celeb or person of note), passing on your lineage.



NB: I literally googled “why would you have children” and this comes up:

“We have children because they make the world a better place, they make us & others happy with all their good qualities & hope in the future. They make us better by being selfless & remind us of what's good in life. Not to mention other reasons.”

A whole load of nothing. This is the type of thing everyone says about having kids and I just laugh at it."

I do not buy the argument that anything illegal is automatically immoral either, as by that logic, hiding Jews during Nazi Germany was immoral. That may sound like an extreme comparison, but that's where that kind of thinking leads.

Currently, the only argument I give some weight to, is the argument that it wouldn't work if EVERYONE did it. Hypothetically, that would be a problem, but such a situation seems nowhere in sight, so I believe it is an irrational fear."

A lot of people say that, for instance, Russia invaded Ukraine in order to prevent a Nato Attack through the North European plane or that China wants Taiwan for the geostrategic location of having a route to the Pacific in case of an American-led blockade.

However, so much of this great power geopolitics doesn't make sense since it relies upon the idea that there is going to eventually be a massive war with other great powers. But if Russia and NATO go to war, nobody will be worrying about whether NATO can invade Russia. Everyone will die in nuclear hellfire.

It just doesn't make sense that countries would act upon a hypothetical war that, if it were to happen, would not really involve geopolitics. The idea that countries act based on natural barriers to invading armies is just plain stupid in the modern world.

Instead, I think that leaders only want to rile up the masses or leave a lasting legacy. With the American invasion of Iraq, for example, it has been disproven that the US went for oil. Rather, it was simply a grudge held by George W. Bush and high-ranking leaders who believed in imperialism for the sake of democracy.

4,2023-04-10,Cmv: White Liberals don’t understand People of Color,u/Throwway-support,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12i3qiw/cmv_white_liberals_dont_understand_people_of_color/,changemyview,"First things first. I understand that the political system has coalitions. So white liberals don’t need to understand people of color of order for the Democratic party to work as a insistution. People of color know why they’re voting Democratic( self-preservation via economic policy mixed with viewing republicans as racist) 

A lot of the cringe identity politics messaging got me thinking about this. Whether its about black, hispanic, and Asian voters, it oversimplifies their issues into boxes. I thought about celebrities like Meghan Markle, Gweneth Paltrow etc who embody this sort corporate feminism that only really applies to upper middle class white women. 

White liberals make up most of the top of the Democratic party’s apparatus. Despite having a diverse voting populating  and having a person of color as the figure head of the party, the people who staff the party are mostly  college educated white liberals from often wealthy families.They are as far and away removed culturally and economically from people of color then even most working class white Trump supporters. 

Yes, I believe Trump supporting working class whites and voters of color relate to each other more then white liberals do 

Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters are as socially conservative as many Trump supporters. [Black voters want less or the same amount of police](https://www.newsweek.com/81-black-americans-dont-want-less-police-presence-despite-protestssome-want-more-cops-poll-1523093?amp=1). According to some polls, most latinos actually want less immigration. And Asian Americans are famously against Affirmative Action programs to help diversify college admissions. 

White liberals, at least ostensibly, do not support any of these things according to polling. I want to be clear, I don’t think this is good or bad. It’s just something that I noticed and data supports. 

Basically, White liberals( and to a extent liberals of color as well)  are disconnected from what most people of color actually want. White liberals score high on what social scientists call “ openness and social trust”. Openness being described as openness to new experiences and out groups. Social trust meaning trusting other people. Blacks, hispanics, Asians, and working class whites all have similar levels of social trust and openness. Much lower then compared to white liberals 

Which brings me to my final theory about all this. Rather then being wholly a race based difference. I believe it is a cultural difference between the classes. POC on average have less wealth then White Americans liberal or conservative. Being of lower economic standing often creates scarcity of resources mindset and festers lower social trust

Democrats during the Clinton and early Obama used to focus on class issues ahead of racial issues. Hillary’s 2016 campaign began the shift towards more identity based politics. Since this shift working class class blacks, asians, and hispanics moved to the RIGHT. Showcasing liberal elites problem relating to POC.

2,2023-04-10,CMV: Suffering is callous unless there is an inherent purpose to life so it is better to avoid suffering in any way possible (an argument for antinatalism),u/Andromeda-Native,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12i48zn/cmv_suffering_is_callous_unless_there_is_an/,changemyview,"Antinatalism: the belief that procreation is morally wrong. That life is not “worth” it, so to speak. So when it comes to subjecting a new once non existent sentient being to it, it is wrong to do so. 

Morality: the definition of morality I am using is subjective and most in line with that of negative utilitarianism. 

My view is that life is full of callous suffering. Religious folk may suggest it is “Gods plan” and that there is a method to the madness but unless we have a way to prove this (which we don’t) all of humanity’s suffering seems very unreasonable and easily avoidable. There is no solid evidence for God and that gods plan is real/that we will all be rewarded for ensuing suffering so I am going to throw this argument out the window immediately. 

My argument is that we should stop pro creating because we all suffer for no reason. 

Even if we feel our suffering has made us “better” or “stronger” or taught us a lesson/gave us some wisdom which we once did not have, unless life has some inherent purpose, all of this suffering is still callous and still pointless.

Unless we exist for a reason, our suffering is just unnecessary and avoidable. 

So essentially what I am saying is that we should all stop pro creating and subjecting our offspring to such callous suffering. 

As it stands, we pro create and proclaim to love our children but we are causing every single moment of torment, suffering, sadness, anger, disappointment etc they will face by having them. By creating them. 

It is all suffering that will be for naught once we die. Out existences as humans is the result of randomly mutations and evolutionary processes. There is no method. It just is. 

And we all know this. 

I don’t understand why we would subject new people to experiencing pain, heartbreak, bullying, grief, fear and death when it’s all for nothing. It’s all so unnecessary 

More so when we realise that the non existent cannot miss out on existence and the moments of bliss/pleasure. 

When you choose not to procreate, nobody is harmed. 

Yea, perhaps the final generation which will have nobody to look after them but that’s just the price we pay to eliminate suffering for eternity or until the biological evolution of humanity begins again. 


Yes life has its moments. It has moments of pleasure and ecstasy. Moments you are glad to exist and in awe of life and it’s beauty. But are these moments worth the suffering? Especially considering you once did not exist in any sense? When you consider that you wouldn’t miss out on existence, is it worth the suffering (which in my opinion is far greater than the pleasure of life)?

I think not. 

So… CMV.


TLDR: non existent folk cannot miss out on anything good about existence therefore it’s best to save them the suffering of life which they are almost guaranteed to experience. Even more so because human life is seemingly utterly pointless and the result of  random chain of events. Why do we pro create only for our offspring to suffer callously?"

It’s been a rocky start, here it is April and I have little to show for it (day 2 of sobriety). My husband (41M) will receive his 3 year chip soon. I’m very supportive, I know everyone’s different, etc, but he uses spite to fuel himself to do better. He has a narcissist sister that he sees only a few times a year but gets recharged every time he gets to humble brag on himself. 
I also have a good friend (37F) who has successfully built her own t-shirt business from a few boxes on her dining room table to a warehouse with 5+ employees. However, when she started her business in her dining room it was with one of her friends. They had a huge fight and now she uses spite to fuel her passion to keep her business going just to prove to that friend she could do it without her. 
So change my view. I seem to hit a brick wall when the topic of “prove to everyone you can do it!” point of view comes up. In my mind it seems like a negative way to achieve goals just to shove it in someone else’s face. I don’t want my heart and my mind thinking and going there, but maybe I’m being to soft? Or just finding a reason NOT to reach personal goals? TIA

TL/DR: Husband and friend are successful just by proving to others they can do it. I don’t have it in me to use spite to reach my goals."

During the great depression unemployment was through the roof and as a result a lot of people couldn't get the money together to keep their house many people ended up losing their house. 

Today however things are considered to be much better, everyone is working there's jobs everywhere and if you work 40 hours a week at a median paying job and save as much as possible you probably won't even be able to buy a house... 

So let me get this straight, worst time in history people are not working and have a house, albeit barely and at risk of losing it. Now, people are working their asses off and have literally nothing to show for it... How exactly was the great depression worse? People can't even fucking protest because they are too busy working for ends meat and when people do protest the government just cracks down on them... Every related policy is designed to make housing go up and keep wages down, but unemployment is fine so all good right? 

Inflation eats away at your meager savings, cost of living is basically doubling every 3-5 years and you're lucky if you get a 20% raise. How the fuck is this not worse than the great depression I would ask why alarms aren't going off about how unhealthy the economy is but the reason is obvious boomers got theirs and the media is bought and paid for by their interests not to mention the politicians."

(1) Double WAR, double value. That's simple. Shohei Ohtani is now the heavy favourite for MVP despite hitting less well than Judge and Trout. 

(2) Even if injured as a pitcher, you can still bat. Even if you can't bat you can still pitch. For short term injuries you don't even have to stop playing, you just temporarily become one way player. And for long term, heavier injuries, as a batter you recover from Tommy John  in only half a year or 8 months, compared to more than 1 year as a pitcher. So even if you have to not pitch for two years because of Tommy John's you can still bat after much shorter time. 

(3) you don't even need to be SP+DH like Ohtani. You can also be RP+1B or RP+OF like Yazawa. And RP+2B or RP+SS if you're good at fielding. You may also be a Short Starter and Outfielder or even Infielder when you don't pitch. 

(4) Being a two way player isn't that hard and you won't become much better even if you concentrated on one of them. Ohtani didn't perform well in 2019/20 when he only batted, and 2016/2021/2022 are years when he exceled both as a pitcher and a batter.

(5) Almost all people were two way players in high school and there are still many two way stars in college and amateur baseball. So playing two ways isn't that hard for professionals. If you really can't pitch or can't hit, you can become one way, but if you exhibit talent in both, the two way player is definitely worthwhile to have a try.

(6) If you both bat and pitch, you will do both better because you have first hand experience on the other side."

Often the narrative is, a person or a group of people is hanging out on a sidewalk in front of a business or in a park, someone doesn’t like it, and they report them to the police.

The police use whatever means they have, such as threatening arrest or citation, to get people to move along.

The problem is we have the right to assemble in public, on public property, at will. When anyone calls to lodge a complaint about people hanging out in front of their storefronts police should advise them to ask the people if they will move nicely and if they don’t want to move there’s nothing they can do.

This is assuming, of course, that the people aren’t actively harassing customers, touching the storefront property, or committing other illegal activities.

Cities shouldn’t even be able to put up “No Loitering” signs."

I'm Hindu, and to clarify I do not mean caste discrimination. Like every religion and philosophy, there are things that need interpretation.

When I claim ""I support the caste system"", what I am actually claiming is my support for Varnasrama dharma. This, in my interpretation, means that everyone has their own role to play in society. There are four groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Each group has a different role to play in society. Brahmins are teachers, priests, and intellectuals, Kshatriyas are soldiers, police etc, Vaishyas are farmers, merchants etc and Shudras are cleaners, blacksmiths, etc.

Now, all of these jobs, it could be argued, are important for society and it is a fact that a long time ago, jobs were inherited from family members. There are some verses in Hindu scripture that suggest you can change caste if the job of your family didn't suit your personality or you showed the appropriate qualities for another job.

Society is compared to a body with the *brahmanas* as the head, *kshatriyas* as the arms, *vaishyas* as the belly (or thighs) and the *shudras* as the legs. This is because different jobs primarily use different body parts. The body analogy is were ""higher"" and lower"" came from. It doesn't mean we should treat different groups badly.

A simple waiting period. In the wake of the Louisville shooting, we see yet again an instance where an individual who decided to commit an atrocity was legally allowed to purchase their weapon of choice (AR15) and within days of the shooting. In this case, the shooter was let go from their job and made the emotionally and mentally deranged decision to kill. Had this person incurred a waiting period for their firearm, it could have given that person 60 days (as I am suggesting) to consider their actions and hopefully cool down the anger. This obviously is not the total solution to all problems in this case, but helps to prevent quick and irrational decision making that puts guns in the hands of people at their peak rage. I would not mind waiting 60 days for a gun just like I accept that if I wanted a suppressor I may have to wait up to a year for a class 3 permit to be approved. There could also be faster processes for those who believe they are in immediate danger where the local jurisdiction could grant a faster clearance, which is how expedited concealed carry permits work.

Jan 6th was way worse and it’s not even close. Had Jan 6 succeeded the United States would of more or less ceased to exist as a nation. Had the Black Lives Matter protests of succeeded…… blacks would stop get their brains blown out by the police??? 

Most of the Jan 6 perpetuators were treated like a acts of trespassing. Instead the government should of responded by treating it like what it truly was. A act of treason. An attempt to subvert and overthrow the government of the United States. 
They should of been treated the way communists suberversives like the Rosenbergs in the 1950s were treated. They are terroists and we do NOT negotiate with terrorists. Even if that would of meant going through tens of thousands of people.A message should of been sent. 

Dozens of burned down buildings, 14,000 arrested, and 19 allegedly killed according to wikipedia from the BLM protests. It still doesn’t come close to the effects of Jan 6 on American Democracy. 

Stores can get rebuilt, most were arrested for breaking curfew, and most killed barely had anything to do with the protest itself. For instance, one man was ran over by a fedex truck while he was protesting and is counted. 

During jan 6, police officers were beaten some nearly to death. A woman was killed attempting to storm the location where congressional members were. Reporters were slammed and assualted to the ground.But the main issue is the attempt to  subvert  the American government and what this means for the future. The United States was essentially humiliated because a bunch of nutjobs believed a lie told them by a facist. 

Had Black lives matter protests of stormed the US capitol they would of been mowed down. And leaders, DEMOCRATIC leaders, like Biden and Pelosi would of applauded this. It’s just not comparable. And yes, its partially based on demographics.

Most Americans support abortion and same-sex marriage which is in opposition to the republican party. However, Americans generally agree that we must lower the national debt, lower taxes at least on the poor and middle class (which went against the idea of an income tax in the 1890s), and deregulation all of which tend to create an economic boom and during periods of economic triumph people are more likely to vote republican."

I’ve been reading a lot of US history including about the American revolution. And frankly, for all intents and purposes the US would of been better off staying a colony of the UK.

Slavery would of been abolished earlier, we’d have a culture that enables universal healthcare, and gun violence wouldn’t be as much part of the culture. Also the Native American population would of been treated more humanly then how the american government did. It still would of been bad, but better. 

Racial caste would of been less of a factor then it currently is in the United States. While class would of mattered more, this is preferable to race mattering more. 

The issue with “ taxation without representation”would of been worked out. And even if it didn’t, more taxes going to paying for government services is fine by me. 

Now, some of the things that make the US unique simply wouldn’t exist or be as much of a factor. There wouldn’t of been a expansion westward. There were of been less european immigration to the Us. The overall culture wouldn’t be as dynamic as it is now. There wouldn’t be as strong a love of capitalism. There might not even be rock n roll and hip hop. 

Honestly though, less racism, less gun violence, less nationalism, less toxic individualism,less materialism and universal healthcare makes up for all that. 

I’d hate having a monarch, but [I’d be a active republican under this hypothetical.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_Kingdom)

The closest analogies are Australia and Canada. They are not perfect. But they’re pretty great I’d say. 

The US probably wouldn’t be the strongest 
 preeminent  power in the world under this scenario. So coca cola, mickey mouse, and blue jeans wouldn’t be as popular. But we also wouldn’t be in involved in as many wars. Fair trade imo.

8,2023-04-11,CMV: It's natural for some people to be upset about 2023 Korea-Japan summit where President Yoon decided to have Korean companies compensate for victims of forced labor under Japan's occupation instead of the offending party.,u/bariskok82,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12j882z/cmv_its_natural_for_some_people_to_be_upset_about/,changemyview,"I want to share my thoughts regarding recent news that bothers me now as a Korean person. President Yoon of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida had summit lately. One of major agreements was having Korean companies compensate for victims of forced labor under Japan's occupation, instead of the Japanese companies responsible for such wrongdoings. It is said to be similar to how a person can agree to pay off someone else's financial debt.

While I support improving Korea-Japan relations, I can't help getting disappointed about President Yoon's manner of dealing agenda, because what he did seems to disregard the victims' desire for justice. From what I know, many victims made it clear that receiving money is not as important as acknowledging their suffering as violation of human rights. Maybe that is why they went as far as filing lawsuit against the offending companies. If I were to understand their motivation, they are likely to know very well their wishes for justice is not going to fulfill in foreseeable future, but they still keep speaking up because doing so itself is part of healing process for their dignity.

I know that there could be special circumstances for why President Yoon made such decision, and it is unlikely for Japan to bring satisfying enough resolution, but I think President Yoon should have at least made it clear that he side with the victims. I am not asking for him to provoke or lecture the Japanese leader, or bring 'victory' right now. And I think many Korean people are not against amicable relations with Japan, and not looking to bankrupt the offending companies or manipulate Japan with moral superiority. If Korea and Japan are part of 'liberal democratic' world like people say they are, they should prove that they follow such value by discerning rights from wrongs, and that they could correct past mistakes."

Are pills just cheaper or? Although budget is a real consideration, it's worrying that the the pipeline of medical transition is seemingly expedited at the expense of genuine examination and reflection as to why any given person would want to transition.

It's often very simple requests, ie dietary requirements, or a school permission slip, or a change of address. But the small-but-signficant-pain-in-the-ass of downloading a .PDF and inputting text into whatever weirdly designed form I've received is just that extra hump of difficulty that makes a 1-minute easy done thing into an actual task.

I would always (always? usually?) prefer to click through to a form to input the required information. Your website, web app, a goggle form, a typeform, literally anything I don't have to download, fill out, resave, upload, write an email reply, and send.

My view is that online forms offer a superior experience for submitting information than a PDF. By superior experience, I mean less likely to cause frustration, faster/easier/preferred, and ultimately receive a high rate of submission.

Things that I don't think will change my mind:

* 35% of people don't have internet or lines of arguments around poor internet connection, as forms require internet and PDF can be completed offline. The question premise is around the best internet based submission method.
* That PDFs are an easier for the sender (ie, someone with less tech skills can create a PDF but harder to make an online form). My argument is not considering the sender's experience, just the recipient.
* A poor form is worse than a good PDF.  This argument isn't limited to the data input itself... my view is the process itself is a worse experience

To send information via an online form the process is generally:

1. Receive email 2. Click link 3. (Sometimes: Sign in) 4. Type in information 4. Submit.

To fill out a pdf

1. Receive email 2. Download PDF 3. Open PDF. 4. Type in information 5. Save As... 6. Reply to email 7. Add PDF 8. Send

How I could be wrong:

* My ADHD means often easy tasks are hard, so the pain-in-the-ass of filling in PDF forms might not be a shared experience with most people
* I use a password keeper, so logging into a service isn't generally a challenge for me. (This is the most likely to change my mind, showing that for the average person, the challenging of logging in is higher than the challenge of the PDF-ing)
* I'm a Apple user, perhaps the PDF experience on Windows/Android is more intuitive
* I'm in my late 30's perhaps there is a generation above or below me that likes a pdf better submitting a form
* Maybe I just suck at PDFs
* Maybe I secretly have an online forms kink (turns out I'm filling one out now...)

Ultimately I think that most accountant, bank, doctor, therapist, insurance agent, kid's school, local government, sporting club, and others would be better served by building forms that their users can submit requested information to than sending a request for information via a .PDF that needs to be filled out.

29,2023-04-12,CMV: Semaglutide injections (like Ozempic) should be widely available to treat obesity,u/sjd6666,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12jqtup/cmv_semaglutide_injections_like_ozempic_should_be/,changemyview,"There’s a lot of buzz recently about Ozempic, which is one of many semaglutide injection drugs that help people moderate their food intake and hunger levels. Some variations are meant just to treat type 2 diabetes like Ozempic. Other drugs like WeGovy are meant to treat obesity as well. 

What I take issue with is that a lot of commenters have stated that they see Ozempic as a “lose weight quick drug” and a cheat. I think this is simply the wrong way to look at the issue. Obesity is a medical issue that can be treated in many ways. For some people seeing a nutritionist and going to the gym is all that is needed, but for many more this simply doesn’t work. I would argue that actually, most Americans know generally what a good diet looks like. They may not have all the details but most people can tell you that more vegetables and less meat, carbs, and sugar will create a calorie deficit and help you lose weight. However food simply tastes really good any many people rely on it as a sort of emotional crutch. Many also lack the time, energy, and desire to cook healthy food for themselves. There are many who also simply have a naturally large appetite and need to eat more in order to feel full.

What those people need is not a reminder to try “diet and exercise” they need medical help. Semaglutide injections seem to have low risk of serious side effects and can help those people eat less and not feel hungry. All this moralizing about who “deserves” help and who should just suck it up and go to the gym is proving to be detrimental to overall health. 

Also, I’m aware that there is currently a shortage of Semaglutide injections right now, but lets set that aside and assume that can be addressed with a more robust supply chain."

My views began in ""all abortion is murder"" territory until i saw all the women and children being killed and abused by forced birthing. 


Without fully reliable and accessible state funded childcare and basic needs, forced birth is far more cruel to humanity than painlessly stopping a life from forming (a very natural process of the reproductive system).
Even then, in a perfect world, forced birth is still cruel to women, allowing them no control over their own lives and futures.


This usually devolves into the basic personhood debate. From there all we can do is assess societally agreed upon facts (science). We know enough now to understand how human life works and how to ethically sustain and increase quality of life.


Forced birth appears to always reach a point where it refuses to recognize ethics or science.





Edit: I'd like to specify something about ""science.""

I do think that presently known science has the ""answer"" to every question we have to ask, and I'm fully willing to go on a research spree to find good, peer-reviewed data as evidence.

A lot of the questions we are hung up on wouldn't exist if everyone of us had a college level anatomy & physiology course and knew how to research in a database (it's google but for science!).


For example:

Us - Does life begin at fertilization?

Science - What part of fertilization are you looking for? (Bear with me, I’m trying to be accurate AND remove jargon as much as possible.)

(Let's skip the fun stuff and jump to...)

     Capacitation = sperm latch onto egg
     Acrosomal reaction = sperm fusion with outer egg membrane (millions of sperm are doing this)
     Fast block to polyspermy = process to block other sperm from penetrating an inner egg membrane.
          (Then comes [lol] fusion of sperm cell wall with the inner egg membrane and cell-wrapped DNA [a gamete] is released into the egg’s inner juicy space [the cytoplasm].)

     Slow block to polyspermy = The new DNA cell from sperm triggers the egg to break down the outer egg membrane. Denying access to other sperm.

     Then, the egg begins to complete meiosis 2 (cell division. “Mom’s” DNA contribution still isn’t created yet.) The products are an oocyte AND a polar body (which is then degraded).

     Now there exists a female gamete (mom’s DNA in a cell) and a male gamete (dad’s gamete in a different cell), just chillin inside the egg.


     The gametes then fuse together into a zygote.

TLDR; In a perfect world, and assuming a zygote is a future human, conception has occurred 30ish minutes after ejaculation.



The body is a Rube Goldberg machine of chemical reactions… One does not simply point to a Rube Goldberg machine as an example of an exact moment. 
All science is a process. There is no “moment” of fertilization.

It’s not the answer we want politically, but that’s the way it works.

Yay science.

7,2023-04-12,CMV: The Current US Housing Crisis Is Unfixable Without Unprecedented Change,u/westcoastidiot,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12jvrjz/cmv_the_current_us_housing_crisis_is_unfixable/,changemyview,"I've been called a naysayer and a pessimist for this view, but I think that we are entering an era of housing in the US that - unless prompts historic (and somewhat anti-free market intervention), or an unprecedented increase in youth voting, will continue in its current form indefinitely. Full disclosure - I come from a homeowning family, and am on a life trajectory as a 19-year-old that homeownership is still in reach for me. However, that does not prevent me from realizing that there are systemic issues with housing in the US that don't appear to be solvable.

Starting chronologically, homeownership - and more broadly, land ownership - has been one of the core aspects of wealth building in the United States over our history, without too many problems of affordability. Through a mix of land conquest and genocide, the US has been continually able to expand its territory consistently throughout the majority of its lifespan. As a result, continually, an expanding population has been able to inhabit expanding land, sustainably, and allowing for further generations to have a realistic chance of ownership in the past. Additionally, due to the size of lands, individuals were still able to inherit partial ownership of a deed of land among relatives in a way that is not possible with a home. 

Enter the housing development - Levittown-style building, although changed slightly and more widely available than the deed-restricted communities of yesteryear, still occupy vast amounts of space in sprawling suburban communities. Although apartment complexes do exist, they tend to be overwhelmingly rental only properties, leaving little path to home ownership. 

Now enter today. 58% of young adults are living with their parents, and home ownership is extremely unaffordable to the vast majority of the population. Although it tapers off with age, with about 20% of adults 25-34 living with parents, the number of people restricted to a path to financial and spatial independence, (who would otherwise not choose to live with parents, but live alone or with a partner) is extremely sizable. Although there are seemingly obvious solutions to fixing this current state, I will address one by one why its impossible for things to change in their current form - and why they are only likely to get worse.

First, there's the solution that's least radical - build more houses. However, this runs into problems immediately - the distance to get to places of work grows extremely quickly with suburban sprawl, and the associated costs may run into issues arising from whether or not people can feasibly still work somewhere and commute. In order to meet the current US housing deficit of 6 million homes building this way, America's cities would have to grow extremely large - and have associated extremely large infrastructure that current taxpayers oppose vehemently.

Ok, so build townhomes! Another seemingly obvious solution - and the way homes were built pre- suburban sprawl - would alleviate the spatial concerns of land use, cut down on infrastructure issues, and could feasibly help America achieve enough housing for its young population. However, this immediately runs into the NIMBY problem. Complaints about ""ruining the character"" of the neighborhood, and people worried about the value decline of their main wealth vehicle, their home, are consistently extremely vocal and passionate about opposing new buildings of all forms. Additionally, zoning issues about setbacks from the road and parking requirements (even for areas that could feasibly become walkable) stop the ability of this solution to be feasible before it ever got into a city council. Similarly, apartments face this issue - I've seen both online and had close family friends complain about both previously mentioned NIMBY issues specifically with regards to apartments.

Ok, so NIMBYs exist, but fuck the NIMBYs, this will stunt our entire economy if young people are stuck at home! Problem: No politician would ever do that. NIMBYs, a crossover of people who tend to be older, people who tend to be wealthier, and people who tend to have a lot of free time (to voice concerns to politicians), are exactly who is making up the majority of who is voting in local elections (who overwhelmingly have say on what new things get built/ rezoned). As a result, it would take a politician who is either suicidal or is sure of an unprecedented youth turnout that is actually aware of how the situation would change if we changed how we built housing, to say ""the value of your investment is going to decline because I am going to force through more supply to make sure young people have a foreseeable path to homeownership.""

So here we are  - we are short homes, running out of space to put the current solution of suburban sprawl, we can't build more sensible housing, and unless an unprecedented (and frankly, impossible) youth turnout that has been shut out happens, we can't change the political system that enables this supply deficit, and America is in a Catch 22 where we will continue to almost certainly expand (the infinite growth model followed requires this), while the supply further detaches from the demand. 

Before you respond, if you have read this far, don't retort with - ""well, its been bad in the past, but it always gets better"" - the US housing system has never been this bad. The current state is an unprecedented crisis of supply that seems to have no way to adjust under the operating theory of the free market, and will therefore remain unfixable, barring a number of changes that are extremely unlikely to happen due to homeownership remaining the main wealth vehicle for Americans.

5,2023-04-12,"CMV: Advances in AI are a good thing and should be welcomed, ESPECIALLY for artists. Most criticism of AI is gatekeeping or actually criticism of capitalism with nothing to do with AI at all.",u/madmuffin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12jw1jr/cmv_advances_in_ai_are_a_good_thing_and_should_be/,changemyview,"Perspective context: I am an artist first and programmer second. My programmer peers seem to mostly love AI and artist peers despise it as a deeply disturbing electronic Satan out to destroy art forever. I think AI is nothing but good, utopian even. I feel like I must be missing something because so many other artists revile it.

I grew up watching Star Trek: TNG and in my eyes, the advances in AI we see today is a proto-form of the Holodeck - a machine that can parse a verbal request into a fully fleshed out and realized creative project. I see AI as the key that unlocks 'creativity' for all of humanity: Now anyone can be creative.

People with big dreams, ideas, and enormous creativity have a tool to express themselves with. No longer do you have to toil for decades on a very narrow skillset to make those dreams come true, and for the human race as a whole that is nothing but beneficial.

All of human history, not just art, changes and adapts as we invent new tools. My view is that AI is a tool, perhaps the most powerful tool ever invented but ultimately just a tool. Every time new tools are invented, professions change to adapt to this. We have seen this happen countless times:

In the art world when photography was invented, it was reviled by artists as destroying their life's work, rendering them obsolete. History shows now today 'photographer' is now a credible and respected field of art and 'art' evolved to include it. When the graphics tablet was invented, artists railed against that, giving the no-true-Scotsman debate that digital artists weren't real artists, that to be an artist is to not have access to blend modes or undo actions, and digital art is respected now today as well. I see 'AI Artist' as being the next photographer. 

The knee-jerk reaction I 100% understand and respect is that AI DOES threaten the individual's ability to financially support themselves. I am absolutely completely in agreement with this, except that in my view: AI is a symptom, not the cause. Nothing we can do regarding regulating AI will resolve this symptom because the cause has nothing to do with AI.

CRITICALLY: In my view, the actual problem when people say 'AI bad' is that people are so deeply personally terrified of is that we live in a society where having money is the only metric for if you are allowed to continue to be support yourself, be alive, engage in society. 

In a world where someone's ability to make money is all they have to keep them alive, ABSOLUTELY they should hate and be terrified of anything that threatens that, they'll literally be homeless or dead without their skillset making them money. This is a very real view of a very real problem that needs to be solved, but has nothing to do with AI and pointing at AI as if its the cause is putting the cart before the horse imo."

5,2023-04-12,CMV: Nuclear weapons have no ACTUAL use and the only rational course of action is to eliminate them.,u/stilltilting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12jwr6d/cmv_nuclear_weapons_have_no_actual_use_and_the/,changemyview,"How often have we heard the phrase ""Nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought""? Even Russia was repeating this refrain while reminding everyone they had nuclear weapon over the past year. So why do we have them at all?

First, nuclear weapons have no ACTUAL usefulness. They may be useful in a hypothetical sense, but pretty much everyone admits that if you are actually USING them then the whole game is pretty much up for everybody. They are not useful as a first strike weapon because of the threat of retaliation. They are also useless as a weapon of ACTUAL retaliation because if someone has already launched a massive first strike at you there is nothing you can do about the fact your country and probably civilization is gone. You can only add to the death toll. So you cannot achieve any rational geopolitical goal through the USE of nuclear weapons. (I agree you could achieve the goal of mass death and destruction, but I'm not going to argue that this would be a ""useful"" thing to do even for the planet because the radiation and nuclear winter would take a massive amount of other life, too)

Second, they have huge costs. In terms of money alone, the CBO estimated that from 2021-2030 it would cost more than $600 BILLION just to maintain the US nuclear arsenal. Imagine all the other things that could go to. But way more importantly, keeping large stockpiles of nuclear weapons means there is always a non-zero risk of complete global annihilation by nuclear weapons as the result of a mistake or accident. In fact, [it's nearly happened nearly two dozen times already](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200807-the-nuclear-mistakes-that-could-have-ended-civilisation) (that we know of):

> All told, there have been [at least 22](https://futureoflife.org/background/nuclear-close-calls-a-timeline/)  alarmingly narrow misses since nuclear weapons were discovered. So far,  we’ve been pushed to the brink of nuclear war by such innocuous events  as a [group of flying swans](https://www.routledge.com/Thinking-About-Nuclear-Weapons-Analyses-and-Prescriptions/Holroyd/p/book/9780709937753), [the Moon](https://blog.ucsusa.org/david-wright/the-moon-and-nuclear-war-904), [minor computer problems](https://futureoflife.org/2016/06/06/failed-computer-chip-lead-nuclear-war/#:~:text=The%20US%20early%20warning%20system,launched%20at%20the%20United%20States.&text=That%20one%2C%20in%201979%2C%20was,the%20main%20US%20warning%20centers.) and [unusual space weather](https://www.space.com/33687-solar-storm-cold-war-false-alarm.html). In 1958, a plane accidentally dropped a nuclear bomb in a [family’s back garden](https://history.howstuffworks.com/american-history/nuclear-bomb-air-force-south-carolina-1958.htm);  miraculously, no one was killed, though their free-range chickens were  vaporised. Mishaps have occurred as recently as 2010, when the United  States Air Force temporarily lost the ability to communicate with 50  nuclear missiles, meaning there would have been [no way to detect and stop an automatic launch](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/failure-shuts-down-squadron-of-nuclear-missiles/65207/). 

The fact that it hasn't happened yet isn't that great a predictor for whether or not it will happen in the future. We've only had these massive stockpiles for about 70 years. And given enough chances, accidental nuclear war WILL happen. It's just a matter of time. And the COST side of an equation can't be much higher than total annihilation of most life on Earth.

**So we have zero benefit to using something and a massive potential cost that becomes more and more likely to become an actual cost the longer time goes on. So the only rational thing to do is remove these weapons from existence, or at least get them to such a level that they do not pose an extinction threat anymore.**

The reason I have a CMV here is that I do acknowledge they have a ""hypothetical"" use in that they MIGHT deter someone from using their own nuclear weapons against you. But deterrence can also be managed through conventional means. And the first strike of launch of any nation's arsenal is going to cause so much damage to the planet and the global economy as to most likely wreck global civilization anyway. Only an irrational actor would choose such a course of action and deterrence is unlikely to work against such a person (just as fear of death doesn't deter someone willing to be a suicide bomber or someone willing to go on a shooting spree until death by cop). 

Please keep in mind that while you could maybe get a delta for finding some ACTUAL use, the benefits would have to outweigh the potential/eventually actual cost of accidental nuclear war to fully change my view."

142,2023-04-12,CMV: High taxes on luxury goods may be more effective than income taxes on the rich,u/eagle_565,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12jx345/cmv_high_taxes_on_luxury_goods_may_be_more/,changemyview,"I've awarded 3 deltas and no longer hold this view, but I'll leave the post up for anyone who wants to read out of interest.

I don't mean luxury goods in the typical economic sense (goods that have a massive drop in demand with a decrease in consumer purchasing power), what I mean by luxury goods is goods that provide the same basic function as much less expensive goods with the price difference being mostly attributable to status afforded by the luxury items e.g. sports cars, Rolexes, very expensive suits, etc.

From what I've seen, there are 3 main arguments for why we shouldn't tax rich people more.

1) They've earned their wealth and we have no right to take it.

2) Rich people know better than poor people how to allocate capital efficiently.

3) Steep progressive income tax systems provide a disincentive for people to work hard in order to attain wealth.

Point 1 makes a lot of sense, but at the same time, people in modern western societies who have come into large fortunes have benefited in many ways from the government. Whether it be the use of public schooling, healthcare, the rule of law, or any of the other services provided by governments, I think it's fair to say the richest members of developed societies wouldn't be as rich as they are with no government. I think this justifies some taxation. 

There is also the issue of luck. Rich people are much more likely to have been born into rich families, born with a high IQ, born with no serious chronic ailments, etc. A significant part of what makes people wealthy is luck.

Point 2 is also fair, which is why I'm not suggesting confiscation of property or high income taxes. However, individuals spending money on lavish status symbols such as those mentioned above clearly serves little to no purpose for society at large, and this money could be better spent elsewhere by government. This way, people who are good at efficiently allocating capital, will put more money into said efficient uses, rather than wasting it on ostentatious shows of wealth.

I don't think point 3 applies for any reasonable level of taxation (say below 90%). People will still have the power to improve their lot in life by hard work and productivity, but will be less incentivized to spend their money on things that aren't really beneficial to anyone. While this will make status symbols more expensive, if anything that will make them serve their purpose even better, as they will still provide the status they currently do.

Change my view?

Edit: 1 delta awarded for impracticality of defining luxury good, and when they're defined, sellers could just add massive service fees and sell them at just below the luxury tax rate."

I remember when Ray Combs hosted *Family Feud* (1988-1994). I was watching an old E! True Hollywood story on *Family Feud,* and how Jonathan Goodson, who took over his father's production company after he died (Mark Goodson created shows like *Family Feud, Price is Right,* among other shows you know and love today. He passed in 1992) decided to replace Ray Combs, who did nothing wrong as a host, with Richard Dawson, whom M. Goodson vowed never to have host *Feud* again due to him being a diva and quarreling with producers on a daily basis.

By all accounts, Ray Combs was hurt by this termination, as he was in a really bad way financially.

On his last episode, he simply walked off the set instead of hanging around while the credits rolled.

By hosting *Feud*, Combs was bringing in $1M a year. After getting axed from the show (wrongfully), he was dead broke. We're talking two foreclosed homes broke.

Eventually, his wife decided to divorce him because of the fact that he was going through a dry spell in his career, which never made sense, as when you married someone, you agreed to, among other things, better or worse as well as richer or poorer.

His crippling debt caused him to simply crack. In June 1996, he was put on a 72 hour mental hold at Glendale Adventist, where he hung himself.

It didn't have to get that bad, and it's Jonathan Goodson's fault for firing him for no reason, and especially his wife's fault for abandoning him at his darkest hour.

To make matters worse, putting Richard Dawson back on *Feud* only lasted one season, as the show was cancelled in 1995. So J. Goodson ruined a man for nothing; he was better off letting the show get cancelled."

Twitter is very powerful and most effective when it enables individuals to share news in real time. 

No massaging the headlines. No spinning the story. Or trying to fit an agenda into a story. Just simple, easy, few lines of news propagated across to millions of people. Case and point, the Arab Spring. 

So, it starts to make sense when you look at Twitter’s biggest stakeholders. Foreign companies and powerful wealthy companies. 

The internationally wealthy and powerful have all the money they can ever want, billions of dollars.

So this is a case of a simple problem solved by a simple solution. As a billionaire, or ruler of an authoritarian country, afraid that one your citizens may share embarrassing stories about your inhumane practices, why not just make the problem go away? 

But banning Twitter from your country makes you look like the bad guy, the authoritarian, and it may even make other countries react against you for trying to silence your citizens. 

So why not make the problem go away another way? A way that doesn’t make you look bad?

Pay a CEO billions of dollars to buy this annoying weapon, constantly being used against you (even if it is rightfully so), and have him break it. It can’t hurt you anymore. 

From that perspective, Elon Musk is cosplaying as the CEO of Twitter, as he happily smashes the company into pieces. Any other business owner would be horrified to lose so much money. 

Elon surprisingly is not. Or maybe not surprisingly? Why would you care if you’ve already been given billions of dollars upfront, by country leaders and corporations intent on destroying it, what happens to some random flailing social media platform?

You don’t. You’re given money to do demolition work, that’s literally what you were hired to do. And so you do it with a smile!"

Hip hop, Crime, and absent fatherhood. I don’t believe any of these three topics are actual problems for the *black* community. Since Gangsta rap’s inception crime has actually gone done.But my topic today deals with “abscent black fatherhood”. 

Being black and low income are erroneously associated with each other( a product of widespread American racism) .  [But the majority of African Americans are middle class](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-black-middle-class-needs-political-attention-too/?amp). This has been the case for roughly over 20 years. 

In addition to this, there has risen a belief since about the 1960s that African Americans come from single parent homes. [But this too is a largely a misnomer.](https://www.newsweek.com/absent-black-fathers-myth-racism-1509085?amp=1)

When the CDC asks head of households the status of the relationship between parents. If that parent is not married, they are considered single. We all see this when tax time comes and it asks for martial status. Even if you have been in a loving relationship for ten years, if you are not married to your spouse you check the box single. 

Black Americans are less likely then whites to get married. Thus most are counted as single. Even if you have the father of your children living in the same apartment as you. 

Now there are very real situations where children group up fatherless but I’d argue there are few reasons for this as well that don’t have anything to  “rap culture” like racists claim. But rather because of insidious system of racism perpetuated by these racists themselves. 

[The New York times did the numbers.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/upshot/missing-black-men.html). There are 1.5 million “missing” black men. Black men dying earlier then their white counterparts  because of adverse health outcomes, police violence, etc 

To sum up, the “absent black fathers” myth is another case of slander by American racist. Who can’t fathom that a country that was so good to their ancestors could possible be cruel and frankly evil then others . They need to wake up. Or get “woke” even. But imo this done intentionally to  spread subconcious white supremacy.

Afaik, empathy involves the ability to sense and share the emotions and experiences of others, including animals. It requires a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings and a commitment to reducing harm and promoting compassion in all areas of life. By consuming meat and other animal products, which are often associated with cruelty, suffering, and environmental destruction, someone who claims to be an empath shows lack of awareness or concern for the wellbeing of animals and the planet. 

This shows that they arent fully attuned to the emotions and experiences of all beings, and therefore dont fully embody the traits of an empath."

If you love someone it's okay to try hard to get them to love you back or even embarrass yourself a bit. Like why not? If it doesn't work out then you've done nothing wrong, and if it does work out then it's great. Sometimes people are going through something, or have baggage that makes it hard for them to trust, or just need time. There's nothing wrong with any of that.

Obviously this doesn't apply to, like, stalking or harassment or whatever. Hopefully the line between chasing and stalking is clear and we don't need to get into that. But busting your ass to show affection to someone you love hoping that they'll come around? I can't see the issue. Worst case scenario you're sad later, but that's always the risk with love."

13,2023-04-12,CMV: Having more than a few kids is unwise.,u/ParmaProscuitto,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12k768o/cmv_having_more_than_a_few_kids_is_unwise/,changemyview,"**My view is**: having more than a few kids is generally a bad idea and bad for this planet/species overall. I don't have large graphs or research on overpopulation or population studies, but I hear enough about refugees, riots, people fleeing certain areas, outbreaks, and unplanned pregnancies to get the feeling that birth/population isn't something humans generally think about, that people are constantly trying to move from one bad situation to the next usually as a result of too many humans being in one area or another, and that putting a lot of us in one area for an extended period of time leads to a lot of homelessness, famine, and general conflict. All of these things definitely affects each other.

**Further**: I think people, based on the few I've asked (why they want to have a big famiy)and my own observations, mainly have this ""desire"" or ""feeling"" that having a big family brings joy/happiness. This makes me believe that its rooted in a selfish desire to be happy by creating new life. I can understand the desire to be happy, but I would petition anyone who has that desire to consider adoption? There are plenty of children out there with no family who I think deserve/could have a much happier life with one.

Also the idea that ""more = better"" is strange to me. Shouldn't a single child deserve all the love and affection a parent has? Why does adding one or six more create more happiness? Doesn't that make it harder to treat/care/nurture them equally? As many children of big families might say they had connection and support, can't the same amount say they were neglected, were abused, or fought with their siblings?

**Additional points:**

Sure people have multiple pets, but pets are considerably lower maintenance than human children are.

I can't imagine any woman has ever said she ""enjoys"" the process of childbirth. You may not be in terrible agonizing pain, but going through the process of fertilizing the egg (maybe not the worst part), having cramps and pains for 9 months, worrying about the birth, finally having the birth and still having some physical discomfort months after isn't something I imagine anybody wants to go through 4 or 5 more times.

Its very strange to me that young 20-somethings finish college and immediately want to have a giant family - don't you want to enjoy your virility and your freedom for awhile. Where did the idea that 4-6 kids is the ultimate form of happiness come from?

**I'm not saying:**

* women who have babies are terrible for doing so
* families need to be limited to 3-4 kids
* people who have or started a big family should be ashamed of themselves
* that there is any form of easy solution to this or even a decent way to pitch this to society at large
* if you don't adopt you are a terrible person
* that I am a parent who has had 4-6 kids
* that all larger families are secretly terrible

**I am saying:**

* I feel like we encourage big families more than we should, and it should be discussed whether or not that's the right decision as much as the decision to have children in the first place is - and I don't think people have that discussion nearly as often.
* I think in general planning for more than 3+ kids is risky and self-indulgent
* I think there are plenty of daily examples of smaller family units that simply don't work out, meaning that larger ones are at higher risk for failure
* We should all probably rethink/decouple the ideas that having a big family will make us happy, similar to how we remind ourselves that buying expensive things/materialism will not make us happy
* It would probably be better for the planet/species in general if we weren't rapidly adding new lives every single day to give substance to our own

**Reasons I can understand:**

* it wasn't intentional, we had triplets/quadruplets
* I adopted a few extra kids and it was fine
* my partner wanted a lot of kids
* I want someone around to take care of me/my stuff when I'm infirm

**Reasons I can't understand:**

* having a kid would make me happier (would it, and if you weren't happy before having the kid would that be a good mentality to raise a child with, letting them embody your happiness?)
* I came from a big family and I was very happy (yes, but who is to say you can create that same environment and circumstances?)
* well other families are larger and they seem fine so why wouldn't mine be (but there's so much risk involved and procedure to raising another human life)
* I want to have a legacy (aren't there better, less expensive options?)
* I'm lonely (you presumably have a life/sex partner, and if not you could adopt a child instead of just having one - is there a strong difference, and if there is doesn't that mean there's something fundamentally wrong with our perception of happiness if creating a baby makes you happy while raising a child doesn't?)
* I'm perfectly capable and its rewarding if I have a bunch (but what if you aren't, and wouldn't raising 1 or 2 kids be equally rewarding?)

I feel it'd be wiser for men and women who feel this way to adopt, become a teacher, become a babysitter, or just gets pets and plants - than to intentionally go through the whole process over again and again.

**sorry for the typo in the title, it was probably autocorrect or something** it should be people not peoples 

Background: My parents were neurotypical but I somehow have ASD and Bipolar. IDK why but I won't have children unless the genes responsible for ASD and Bipolar are eventually found out I can perform a comprehensive pre birth gene check to make sure the infant don't carry these genes. 

From the children point of view, they would suffer a lot of pain once born with bodily (like heart illness or deafness etc) or mental (like my conditions) disabilities. I often wish I were never born or born as a rabbit, so I won't have to suffer a painful life. I would rather be aborted if I could choose. The children can't consent to be born, the parents are just selfish to give birth to such children knowing there is a great chance that their lives will be a lot of suffering.

From the parents point of view, giving birth to such children would require additional effort to bring them up, since they are likely to have disabilities. An abortion costs much less, and you can perform gene examinations in eggs and sperms, in early pregnancy, or in mid pregnancy before the legal limit for abortion. Ideally they should use in vitro fertilization to generate multiple embryos, sequence the gene of each, and only select the healthy blastula(s) to implant. Or they can check the gene sequences of amniotic fluid fetal cells in early to mid pregnancy to see whether they have gene defects. If these options are not available, parents should not have children at all unless the chance of their children inheriting their conditions is really low, like 1% or something."

but for most healthy people who try to lose weight, we do it to look better and be more attractive. 

but after a certain weight surplus, losing weight to look better becomes irrelevant, why? because the more weight we have to lose, the more aesthetic side effects we suffer from.

losing weight ages your face. makes us look older, the face look more depleted, sunken, more wrinkly. there is even a term for it- ""diet face""

losing weight causes loose and flappy skin on our bodies, gaining the weight caused our skin to stretch, and losing the weight doesn't tighten the skin back, thus it stays loose.

all of these things are worse the more weight you lose. 

I've seen countless of people who have lost a significant amount of weight that had these very unappealing side effects (personally I've seen a couple in real life but mostly here on /r progresspics)

there is no way around this, no amount of creams and lotions and drinking water will undo these things when you lose weight. 

so end of day you go from either being obese/over weight to having an aged face and very unappealing loose skin all over your body.

I don't see any benefit to losing weight for looks, you fight a hard constant battle just to look unappealing from other things instead of weight.

unless you can gather money and be ready to have all sort of cosmetic procedures done to your face, and a lot of money for a loose skin removal surgery, there's really no point.

and even after a loose skin removal surgery you're still left with very unappealing scars all over your body.

There are so many posts of people who complain about how badly their face aged after only several months to a year because they lost weight, 

ultimately it's all very discouraging and seems really pointless."

- Crossovers, evolving towards station wagons and hatchbacks, but still SUVs so I'd categorize them as such, like Volvo XC60. 

- Small SUVs, most common in Europe, like Dachia Duster. 

- Big SUVs, mostly found in the US and Canada, but slowly coming to Europe, like Cadillac Escalade.

- Pickup trucks, most common in the US and Canada, like Ford F150.        

I don't understand the SUV trend. It is neither ecological, nor economical, nor ergonomic, nor safe. The fingers of the inhabitants of half a block of flats would need to count how many I see in parking lots, streets, side streets and thoroughfares during a day or several. And inside is some little woman or guy from or to work, school, home or shop.  

SUVs are gas-guzzling. This is simple physics. The more mass, the more energy it needs to move at the same speed. The engines of SUVs were designed specifically for off-road so 4 wheel drive is the standard in many of them. 4 wheel drive helps you in mud but doesn't help you slow down, so drivers can drive as fast as they want to, as soon as they don't plan on stopping. The worst are pick-ups which have even more ridiculous fuel consumption, because they are for off road and transporting elements in the wilderness of Canada and Northern US.   

SUVs are not eco-friendly. Here we return to their fuel guzzling.  

The ergonomics of SUVs and pickups are terrible. One such can take up from 1.5 to 2 parking spaces. And that's not an exaggeration. Pickup trucks often have to stand on the pavement, for the inconvenience of the pavement, just to fit in and not block the roads. In one parking lot near my block, I see an SUVoza station and a destiny that juts out on both sides of the road and a second space so as not to block either of them. Passing SUVs on the streets of an old city is a tragedy.           

And most importantly, they are deadly. A higher center of gravity equals a greater chance of a rollover, and a difference in height means zero chance for a car, pedestrian or cyclist. Especially pedestrians and cyclists. A normal car will simply scoop you up like a snow shovel on the roof, which sucks, but doesn't kill you in most cases. Small SUVs and crossovers hit you in the hips and head, you're even more screwed. Pickups and big SUVs are the worst because they sweep you under the vehicle where NOT. YOU HAVE. CHANCE. For survival. In addition, the higher height, so you will not see a small child, which is almost a guarantee of accidents in suburban housing estates and prefabricated blocks. The blind spot in front of the hood of the SUV could fit 8 crouching children in a row, and none of them can be seen from the driver's perspective. In addition, the majority of drivers, not only in the US, but globally, according to manufacturers' research, are poor and dangerous drivers, using them to avoid the consequences of their actions. Such drivers don't think about other people, use their phones more while driving, are more risky while driving and obsessed with high status. [Source 1](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/bigger-vehicles-are-directly-resulting-in-more-deaths-of-people-walking/) and [source 2.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15568310701359015)           

People buy them to prop up their ego. They used to buy them when they needed them for hard work, for the countryside or off road. Now, thanks to the propaganda of the car industry, which has more money, people buy them, but the lines of more practical cars, such as the Ford Focus, are closed because almost no one buys them anymore. By the way, this turns into an arms race. People are concerned about accidents involving SUVs, so they buy bigger ones to win.

We should prevent it. But first the counterarguments. First of all, it's none of my business who drives what and that limits freedom and communism. But your freedom to wave your hand and drive an SUV ends where my face begins and the sidewalk separated by a green belt. Besides, it's my business whether, as a pedestrian, I get into an accident and whether this accident will not end in death. Would you have said the same thing when gun licenses were introduced and alcohol advertising and cigarette packaging were regulated to warn of the dangerous effects of their use? Secondly, you need space and you have to tow something. But SUVs don't actually have a trunk. The DACIA Duster has 408 liters of luggage space, and the FORD Focus 2014 has 476 liters with the seats up and 1262 liters with the seats folded down. There's roomy goodness in every station wagon's trunk. Every family had one before automakers convinced the aging GenX that what they needed was an SUV with a 1.2m hood. Besides, people who buy SUVs mostly don't carry anything bigger or tow any yacht or trailer. If you really need that space and comfort, there are minivans. For businesses, there are vans. They are easier to come out of and have low hoods so you see everything.
  
Also, there are no sports in Sports Utility Vehicles. There's no sport in driving an SUV (Unless you run over pedestrians on Reddit or Twitter).

We should prevent it somehow, [maybe even some petitions to regulate it](https://action.consumerreports.org/20221116_stop_blindspots) [or ban](https://www.acturgently.org/ban_suvs). Parking permits should be more expensive for SUVs to compensate for their size. Ads for these monsters should have warnings just like ads for alcohol and cigarettes. And getting registered and allowed to own one should be like getting a gun license, with a psychological test to make sure no psycho runs over anyone or anything. People who need them would be required to have a commercial licence.

If you could only do very few heavy wraps, you’re likely fast twitch dominant.  The thinking is that you run out of steam quickly.

Yes, I don’t see how that makes sense. At anything above 80% of your 1RM, your slow twitch fibers aren’t contributing at all. It’s simply too heavy of a load for such weak muscle fibers to make any difference at all in. Slow twitch muscle fibers are for activities like walking, and distance running. A negligible percentage of your maximum force production. 

I submit that if you are lifting between 80 to 85% of your 1RM, that’s entirely type IIA/IIB contribution.

To go in a little more detail, say you do a test of your 5RM (5 rep max) versus your 1RM. Conventional wisdom says that if your 5RM is noticeably lower than your 1RM, then you are fast twitch dominant. Because you expand all your effort on a 1RM, and are unable to lift a heavy weight for five reps. Conversely, if you can handle high reps, you must be slow twitch dominant.

Yet, the difference between fast and slow twitch is not the amount of reps, but the energy source and the force production. Type I fibers are oxidative in their energy source, and simply cannot produce a force anywhere near your 1RM.

1) The Hindutva movement believes in the organic unity of state and nation. They see the Indian state as representative of and for the purpose of upholding Hindu culture, race, and religion.

2) The Sangh Parivar, which the BJP is a part of, has a militant youth wing (Bajrang Dal) that as a matter of policy and practice carries out terror attacks against religious and ethnic minorities in India.

3) Narendra Modi himself presided over massacres of Muslims and described the murderers as ""showing great restraint"" while they raped and burned women and children alive.

160,2023-04-13,CMV: Property tax should be abolished (USA),u/rezdogs870,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12kzr7s/cmv_property_tax_should_be_abolished_usa/,changemyview,"State (edit: county and municipal) governments source income through sales, income, and/ or property tax. I think that property tax is uniquely cruel among the three. Income tax makes sense. You aren’t paying it if you aren’t making money. Make more? Pay more. Sales tax also makes sense. People somewhat have the ability to adjust spending based on ability to pay, and many necessities are excluded. Spend more? Pay more. Both these taxes are related to the actions of the individual taxpayer. 

However, property tax is unacceptable because it is not based on a persons current life circumstances. The tax will almost always rise independent of earning power or any individual choice. This is unfair to “homeowners” (kindof a misnomer in property tax states). They are de facto renting from the government. Who can and will throw people out of their homes if they get sick/ injured, property values rise, or other uncontrollable possibilities. 

I’m a far from an expert on the subject, so my view is not entrenched. I can anticipate the argument that property tax is based on home value. If the value goes up, that means the home owners worth went up. Therefore, they should by default have the means to pay. But this wealth is not liquid and not accessible without high cost. I also anticipate a bit of bitterness from my fellow renters. Home ownership is increasingly rarified air. Why shouldn’t “the rich” have an extra tax burden? I’m sure I’m not thinking of other solid counterpoints. 

Can you explain to me why property tax is an acceptable way to fund state governments?

EDIT: Alright, y’all win. I’ve CMV. My initial argument was based around the potential for people to be priced out of their own homes. Ultimately, I’d advocate for property tax changing only at the point of sale. Learning a lot about the Land Value concept too. I no longer see blanket abolition as the way."

Some arguments in support of my view:

1) Men in the vast majority (all?) of societies are drastically more violent than women in the same culture. This would be predicted by evolutionary theory due to the sexual dimorphism of humans.

2) There is a strong evolutionary basis for why women would be more inclined (mentally) towards child rearing. Women have to invest more in a child than men (egg and 9 months of pregnancy vs sperm), so they will have lost more if they abandon a child than a father will.

3) Women consistently test as more agreeable and neurotic on average than men.

4) Women are a small minority (<20%) of engineers despite serious pushes to get more women into STEM fields.

5) Women dominate the field of teaching with 70% of teachers in the OECD being female, and 90+% of pre primary and primary school teachers being female. 

What I'm not saying:

1) One sex is superior to the other.

2) One sex is more intelligent than the other.

3) Discrimination against one sex or the other is justified.

11,2023-04-13,CMV: the concept of cultural appropriation doesn't apply to religion,u/ImmanuelYemos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12l7h6r/cmv_the_concept_of_cultural_appropriation_doesnt/,changemyview,"I do not believe legitimate religious belief can be condemned as cultural appropriation. My reason for believing this is that religious belief has a third party in it: God, gods, or whatever metaphysical reality is at play.

An example of this is non-Jews practicing Kabbalah. It's often condemned as cultural appropriation but I don't think that's a good criticism. If you genuinely believe in Judaism then your criticism should be theological: they are disrespecting God or doing something that may curse them. Disrespecting Jews or even Judaism shouldn't be the concern. 

From the perspective of a Gentile practicing Kabbalah God wants them to practice. They can be wrong, but applying the judgment of cultural appropriation is essentially assuming God is out of the picture. 

I believe this applies to indigenous religions too. Closedness is a legitimate concept for an organization, but people fully have the right to pray to a God of a closed religion and the God is fully within their rights to be happy a new person prayed to them and give them blessings or kill them on the spot for disrespecting the closedness of the religion.

I do believe that religions can be appropriated from by people, but only people with secular intent. 

I believe any organizations banning cultural appropriation or similar should reject any complaints made for behavior based on genuine religious beliefs. If they want to enforce religious orthodoxy that's a completely different question, but this would be a matter of enforcing religious orthodoxy, and not cultural appropriation.

I do believe in one exception: governments are fully within their rights to restrict harvesting of certain natural resources such as sage or peyote to indigenous religious practitioners. This is because they're a limited ecological resource and it's no different from any other kind of rule like a fishing restriction. Outsiders who hold the belief will need to farm their own. I don't see this as a cultural appropriation issue but it is a lot more worldly and a conflict between traditional and non-traditional practitioners rather than strictly spiritual."

I am by no means arguing that accidentally misgendering someone should be a crime, as we've all been brainwashed by hetero normative propaganda and it is unreasonable to expect anyone to be perfect, but JK Rowling has gone far beyond that, and it cannot be called accidental or ignorant in good faith.

For those who would excuse this behavior because it's ""scientifically accurate,"" please remember that all modern bigotry has claimed to have the backing of science, from Jim Crow to Nazism. Transphobia is not special in this regard.

For those who would excuse this behavior because of ""free speech,"" do you also believe that it should be legal to yell ""FIRE!"" when there is no fire in a crowded building and create a stampede that potentially results in death or injury?

 I believe a personal vehicle is necessary for commuting for work and a personal vehicle or air travel is the best option for long distance trips. 

The only exception is for work commuters in major cities. 


The US has too many road blocks/obstacles. Rail to replace a majority of air customers or personal vehicles will not happen as is.


* Geography/population distribution: The size of the US is unlike most countries. Most countries are much smaller than the US. For those that are similar in size, their population is organized differently. Canada (mostly on the southern border), Russia (western part), China (east coast) and Brazil (east coast). Those with larger populations have their heavy population centers along the coast (India, Australia & Japan). In Indonesia, they have some of the heaviest population density, most of the people are on one island. In the US, we are heavy east coast and west cost as well as in the center of our country. The cities in the US are also massive land wise. 8 of the top 10 largest cities/metro areas (by land area) are in the US. Many of those cities do not have nearly the same population as large Asian metro areas. For example, the Tokyo area has nearly 6 times as many people than the metro Boston area but is smaller. This speaks towards many US areas like Atlanta, San Diego, Dallas, Miami, LA and dozens others. People are spread too far apart for a train system to be implemented. 


* Land ownership/construction problems: The USA is divided up into states, counties, parishes, cities and towns. Who owns the land can vary between all those aforementioned groups as well as privately owned. Finding land for rail into developed areas would be next to impossible. Having stations close enough in suburban areas would not be able to work. Then you would be dealing with environmental impact reports every town and state line you cross. You would have to work with different unions and construction companies in different counties and states. It would just be a mess.


Amtrack as of now takes some journeys 10 times longer than flying. For example, Miami to Seattle would take less than 7 hours on a plane. Currently, it would nearly take 5 **FIVE** days on a train. And that would still be skipping and not servicing massive populations areas. 


As is in the US, trains are not an option."

Due to their coming demographic collapse, they will have to invade or at the very least blockade in the next 10 years or so while they still have enough men of fighting age. China won’t care about the economic consequences of this since its economy will already be suffering from demographics as they have fewer young people to fuel the economy and more old people which drains a country's resources. Economic sanctions are also not a deterrent since they are essentially a joke. It's doubtful that many countries would sanction China at all since they are reliant on Chinese exports."

I am of the opinion where I won't sit and insult them like other people would, make sexist comments, each to their own - I respect them as people and their struggle, but certainly wouldn't encourage this job as someone's livelihood to my friends or family, and would suffer from second hand embarrassment if that is the case (provided we still live in a society that judges and insults people for doing this job). 

So in the law of supply and demand in the far future where no one finds it embarrassing to have an OnlyFans much like someone has an Instagram profile, the money simply won't be there, so why would they bother? Doing in-demand jobs that pay ""f***-you"" money come with consequences that most aren't ready to accept, whether that is breaking your back, or risking lung cancer, or being away from family, risk dying in a war, etc. (not that I would be part of those people creating the consequences), but then if there weren't any consequences, wouldn't OnlyFans be devolved to any other online service platform? Flooded with people, like translators, language tutors, graphic design, etc. No one is making bank on that anymore, to justify it. 

We can make a strong case to stop gratuitously insulting people that make a living providing a service that... People seeming pay for. But I don't understand where this leaves us as a society with regards to accepting it as something a sister or daughter, mother etc could do. It almost seems like people in porn live in a bubble of their own that they don't have family to embarrass, and just treat themselves as individuals in society without a care in the world about judgmental people, and I respect that, I really couldn't care less what they choose to do.

TL, DR: I don't believe there is enough of a financial incentive to do a mentally tolling job like OnlyFans when it becomes normalised, hence the reason people go into it will be negated. ""Can't have cake and eat it"" scenario. So if we accept it, it's less relevant, people don't do it, it becomes fringe and therefore taboo again."

I just don't understand what's the point of earmuffs.

""It's keeping your ears warm, duh!"" that would be the obvious answer most of you are probably thinking.
And yes, earmuffs do keep your ears warm, but the problem is that this is literally the only thing they do while there are other pieces of winter gear that can fulfill that purpose much better than earmuffs do. 

Think about it, you can just as well cover your ears by wearing a hat, a hoodie or a scarf. And all three of these options also help you cover other parts of the body in adition to your ears! Meanwhile, earmuffs just serve their one and only purpose that can already be fulfilled by much more versatile alternatives in the first place. 

If you feel your fingers are cold, why would you waste your time with finger warmers when you can just wear gloves? Well, the same logic applies to earmuffs! 

I admit earmuffs can be useful when worn alongside hats or scarves to provide extra warmth, but wearing earmuffs on their own is redundant. If you're cold enough to feel your ears need earmuffs, you're probably also cold enough to wear a hat or scarf, so you might as well just do that instead of the earmuffs!

Edit: Alright, several comments have changed my mind about earmuffs. There are several contexts in which earmuffs are preferable, but I never really found myself in those contexts so I didn't get it."

My gripe is this: they have the killing curse, Avadakedavra, which is unblockable, and results in instant death if it connects, and leaves no collateral damage. Granted that fact, why would an evil wizard ever use anything else? If you watch the movies and see Dumbledore fighting Voldemort, they're doing all sorts of magical acrobatics. There's dragons of fire, there's shooting shards of glass, etc, etc. It makes for a great cinematic experience, sure. But all of that is inferior to the killing curse because these spells are blockable, and not a guaranteed kill. There are other examples, we read in the books of the death eaters using exploding spells, we see balls of fire, of course we have sectumsepmra. Again, these are all inferior to the killing curse for the same reason.

In these cases, the goal is obviously to kill the opponent, but the wizard handicaps himself, and that doesn't make sense. A more realistic approach to wizard battles in the HP world is constant killing curses, which is essentially just a shoot out, so it's boring for us, but that's what would play out."

However, it must be controversial because smart phone ownership and unrestricted use is so widespread at this age. I’m a teacher and school counselor. I’d estimate that >50% of my 3-5th graders have a smart phone or watch. IMO this creates massive problems with learning capacity and mental health. Many kids act like dope fiends when they don’t have access to their smart phone. We see plenty cyber bullying, kids talking to adults on online games, accessing porn/ gore, fractured attention spans, etc. You get the point. 

Anticipated counterarguments: A smart phone is useful to meet specific needs - a diabetes monitor or speech to text app, for example. Agreed. But 1) this is a small minority of kids, and 2) the tech allows for the phone to be “locked down” and only used in these specific ways. My argument is there is rarely a reason for a kid to own a smart phone, not never.

Another argument I hear from parents is safety. I’d argue: 1) a “dumb” phone accomplishes the same purpose, and 2) the tracking features are available on “dumb” versions of kid phones too. Those phones with the giant buttons that can call or text parents and 911 should suffice.

In addition, some may cite a smartphone’s value as an educational and research tool.  I can see this point to an extent, especially in schools that are short on electronic devices. This has some validity, though not enough IMO to CMV. There is value there, but it is outweighed by the downsides. The more viable solution is to properly fund school districts so all students have access to electronic research tools in a supervised setting. This is already the case in most schools I’m familiar with, and they don’t get much poorer than mine. 

It’s hard to know what would change my view because I’m having a hard time imagining a valid counterargument. Yet I know those counterarguments must exist because so many parents see no issue with buying smart phones for their kids. Hence, my post.

0,2023-04-14,CMV: Putting a limit on an individual's net worth would help lower wealth inequality in America.,u/ScaryPetals,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12m7s7g/cmv_putting_a_limit_on_an_individuals_net_worth/,changemyview,"Most people I talk with agree that wealth inequality is a major issue in America. However, they often push back against the idea of capping or limiting someone's wealth. I don't understand why. Here's what I propose as to help close the wealth gap: 

Limit an individual's net worth to something like 2 billion dollars. I'm not dead set on that number, but I figure it's ridiculously high enough for most people to not be affected, and also high enough that the person could live the rest of their life without working if they wanted to. 

Net worth will be calculated/reported during tax season or something like that. If someone is found to have a net worth above the limit, they will be given a time frame where they must sell off some of their property/stocks/whatever, or pay significant fees (I mean like potentially a billions of dollars, based on how over they are) to the federal government, which will be funneled toward development/infrastructure/education in low income areas. 

This law will only affect maybe 2% of the population. It may take significant ground work to set up, but I think it would help drastically, and pay for itself in the long run. 

Some common arguments against this: 

1. Capping wealth limits growth and development. My response: this will be minimal. There are plenty of people out there doing good work to grow the fields of science and technology, who aren't making billions off their work. Humans will continue to do this even if we limit how much wealth they can make. Things might go a bit slower, but we will also develop in healthier ways (not working crazy hours, valuing other things than production for the sake of survival, etc.) 

2. The top 1% will find ways to evade the new law. My response: yes, but not completely. There will always be flaws in any system designed to mitigate corporate greed. People will find ways around it. But if even a percentage of these people's wealth gets distributed, that is a drastic improvement from what we have now. This will not close the wealth gap, but it will certainly help. 

Now, of course my idea is fairly vague. I'm not an economist or a tax expert or anything. But if people who are competent in this field make a comprehensive set of laws and regulations based on this premise, I don't see how it wouldn't help lower the wealth gap in America.


Edit for my view changing: I can see now that because both international interference and the craziness of the stock market, my idea would not be viable."

This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

I think people have little understanding of how social media algorithms affect how they see the world. I think that capitalist companies created them to entice us to spend more money on their platforms (but I gather that most people already know that)

However, I feel people don't realise the full potential it has on people's lives in the long run, especially as they are used maliciously (predominantly with mailable young people) to rot a population from its core by foreign entities that have macroeconomic ambitions.

My personal experience is I find TikTok often tries to steer me to depressive content.  I usually click ""not interested"", but it makes no difference that depressive content is often linked to music produced by a particular country's electronic music artist. That music then leads you down another depressive track on your music streaming service (YouTube, Spotify or any music service).

I am concluding that it is intentionally planned like that; I have now tried to get myself off TikTok (Semi-Successfully). The New music taste has been harder to shake.

I would like to fob it off as paranoia; however, it is starting to feel blatantly obvious algorithms are used by countries as ways to slowly dismantle competing societies  (I see myself as logical, and reading this myself a few years ago, I would see it as paranoia). But if I was running a country I could envision it in my toolbox.

Edit: I am referring to foreign entities (governments of countries) using algorithms maliciously against other countries. Be it subtly editing homegrown algorithms or utilising algorithms/fake profiles on other websites. Also, I feel it goes both ways, hence why many countries have blocked Western social media platforms.

I am not just referring to TikTok and China I am referring to every country that hosts a proprietary algorithm"

* **Woke:** Unreasonable, ideological things of a Leftist or Progressive nature. This can be a person, a group, an institution, a kind of disposition a person can have, and so-on.
   * You could define this more informally as: Things that seem to belong in leftwing echo chambers but don't make sense in broader society.

Defining it like this, my concern is that, outside of propaganda from right-wing think tanks that may interpolate their own socially conservative agenda into research, there is no real scientific studies on that matter, and the expectation of such evidence is an impossibility because ""unreasonable"" is deeply subjective, which makes it problematic to scientifically quantify.

Polls on happiness, quality of life, studies on cleanliness (as a group, i.e. taking care to keep public places clean), even academics consistently rank countries like these near the very top. Isn't this an argument for homogeneity, or is this correlation rather than causation?

As well I think even on a subconscious level, people all have biases. I think it's innate in us, just some of are public about it. Even something like difference in country rather than difference of cultural backgrounds. Even if I agree completely with someone else, maybe deep down I still kinda feel like my country is the best or superior in some way.

Even stuff like being cohesive with your team in a workplace setting, cultural differences dictate most of our traditions, ways of thought, how we conduct ourselves, even our moral backgrounds. I don't think it's possible to be 100% in sync as a team unless everyone shares the same goals and have the same ideologies.

I don't necessarily think diversity is _wrong_, by the way. What I also think is innate to everyone is the desire to explore, travel, and experience new things. I would never vote for legislation taking this away. I think it's an inalienable right to go where you want, even if laws may not agree with me. I just think a lot of societal strife can boil down to differences of culture, ideology, and so on which can be attributed to diversity.

I know it's the wrong way to think of things but I want to better explore my potential prejudices and change my view."

I also see a ton of memes, social media posts, etc. about how pitbulls eat babies and children, or maul other dogs. I don’t live in the US, and I’ve never really seen a pitbull before I don’t think, so I got curious as to whether this was actually true, or just something people believe because everyone say it’s true.

From my biology knowledge, it’s possible for genetics to play a part in behaviour, but by far the biggest influence is training. For a specific dog breed to have specifically and significantly higher aggression? It didn’t make sense to me. I was surprised to find out there were even breed-specific bans on pitbulls!

Then, I found this article: https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32171-25-1-third-articlepdf

And I now believe the motivation for this legislation is a lot darker than I previously thought. 

The article essentially argues that pitbulls are unfairly discriminated against in legislation because their owners are perceived to be non-White (primarily Black, it seems). Further, it finds little evidence of increased aggression or fatalities compared to similar breeds, such as German Shepherds (whose perceived owners are mostly White). 

The studies that do allege this use data that is HIGHLY susceptible to reporting bias (valid determination of breed is only present in about 17.6% of cases, and pitbulls are the MOST misclassified dog breeds). And after seeing the mouth-frothing redditors in that post, I believe it.

The article isn’t super long, and you can skim it to get to the point.

So, change my view redditors!

u/El_Rey_247 made a really good point about how facts can still be selectively put together to shape a narrative and I took that with this view and realized that if my proposal was put in place, then we could just have ""news"" sections with very carefully curated facts to push a certain idea and it would be seen as even *more* credible. Nothing about my proposal provides any balance either. 

I am still open to considering some more, however. 

&#x200B;

I'd like to preface this by saying I've given this view a lot of thought in recent years and have modified it from more extreme versions down to where it is now.

**Premises:**

First, I believe that most people naturally tend to assume that the word ""news"" refers to factual content that can be trusted. This assumption means that viewers of ""news"" programs are likely to believe what they hear on the ""news"".

Second, that presumption of factuality presents a potential danger: ""News"" programs may present information that *isn't* actually factual or trustworthy, but viewers will not be as critical of that information by virtue of it being ""on the news"". I refer to this as misleading behavior.

Third, I believe several ""news"" outlets have, in fact, engaged in misleading behavior to encourage their audience towards specific viewpoints. I find this is most prevalent in opinion segments with talking heads, whose opinions would otherwise be taken less seriously were it not for the word ""News"" hovering on the screen throughout their misleading monologues and loaded interviews.

Fourth, regulating speech on TV is constitutional and is commonplace. Ergo, it stands to reason that we could also regulate the news without running afoul of the first amendment or prohibiting any particular form of content. I am not looking to ban any kind of content at all.

**Proposal:**

I would like the word ""news"" to mean something. I think there should be standards which must be followed in order to put the word ""News"" on screen or refer to a story as ""news"".

Those standards may include, but are not limited to:

* Reporting objectively verifiable facts related to an event which can be substantiated through documents, visual or audio evidence, eyewitness testimony (reporters on the ground for instance)
* Excluding speculation regarding unknowns. For instance, if reporting on a school shooting, should the shooter's motive be unknown, that could be stated as it is a fact, but the anchors/reporters should not speculate over various possible motives without substantiation.
* Excluding discussion of the possible implications of an event.
* Excluding individual opinions about the event.

If these conditions are not met, then the word ""News"" should be removed from the screen.

Should a network have the word ""news"" in its name, it should then be required to put the word ""Opinion"" over segments that do not comply with the aforementioned conditions. I believe this because a ""news"" network implies that all of its content is ""news"" by virtue of its name, and anything besides ""news"" would need clarification.

**Changing my View:**

I'm mostly interested in discussing the premises here. Am I way off base? Am I overestimating the power of ""news""? Is the proposal here viable? Am I perhaps overlooking some way that ""news"" networks could weasel out of the rules I'm trying to create? Or conversely, am I going too far with this proposal?

I've been mulling this over for a while and I've finally got some free time on a Saturday to engage in lively debate, so please, change my view."

0,2023-04-15,"CMV: Unions are cartels, and should be illegal",u/NoteIndividual2431,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12nl339/cmv_unions_are_cartels_and_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"First, a definition from [dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com): Cartel 1.  an international syndicate, combine, or trust formed especially to regulate prices and output in some field of business.

Unions are explicitly formed to set the price of labor, usually in a particular field of work, or in a particular location. As an example, if all of the major oil producers got together and agreed that they would only sell for some agreed price per barrel, they would be a cartel. If this happened within the border of the united states, it would be a crime. Alternatively, if the commodity in question isn't oil, but instead the labor of police officers, this is not only legal, but is generally seen as a social good.

There was a time in the past where unions were needed to deal with monopolistic practices of coal companies in the early 1900s. They preyed on people's inability to simply move away by paying them little, and forcing them to work dangerous jobs in abhorrent conditions. This is why Unions came to be in the first place, but we don't live in that world any more. Moving around the country or changing occupations is easier than it has ever been, so unreasonable businesses who insist on underpaying their workers would just find themselves with no one to work.

I realize that unions can be pointed at for doing good things for people's lives. Workers in some fields have unions to thank for their ability to make a ""good"" living, and would likely make less money if unions never existed. While this is true, I still can't help but see the union as a sort of extortionist. A free market works well in situations where both sides of a deal have the freedom to pursue alternatives. If a person can work a job as long as it's worth it to them, and work elsewhere if they prefer, it would only be fair if a business can employ someone as long as they find it worthwhile to do so, but lay them off if they no longer need their services. This is fair to all parties. But when a union is involved, that freedom is gone. Unions often negotiate rules regarding how and when a person might be laid off. So a person can still quit whenever they want, but the employer is not free to fire underperformers, or replace individuals who do a worse job than people that could be hired from the outside.

Sometimes unions have demands that aren't about price; they may negotiate new safety rules or terms regarding how their employer runs the business, but this is really something that would be better handled by OSHA, or similar government agencies. It really really shouldn't be individual workers' responsibility to make sure that working conditions are safe; there is a reason that we have government agencies for this-- they are intended to regulate industry in situations where the free market can't or won't. The statement ""Unions help keep workers safe"" is really more of an indictment of the inefficiencies of OSHA more than it is convincing that unions are a social good."
169,2023-04-15,CMV: focusing on who can or cannot say certain words has given more power to slurs and increased discrimination,u/CaregiverLow5636,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12nlyfb/cmv_focusing_on_who_can_or_cannot_say_certain/,changemyview,"*To preface this, I completely avoid using slurs in general and I'm not arguing that I want to add them to my vocabulary*

The topic of this post is about the increasing push against slurs and other words deemed offensive and taboo in modern America and how I think that the surging focus on condemning those who say these words casually and ""policing"" who can and can't say them has only added power to these words and created more division and hate.

&#x200B;

Ten years ago, the **F slur** was a very common swear word and its usage has greatly died down since then. However, it was used more often as a general insult than it was a slur targeting LGBTQ people. It was used in the same manner as 'asshole' or 'bitch', but since then those definitions of the word have diminished substantially as public pressure against its' casual use has grown over the last 7 or so years.

I think this has put more emphasis on the most extreme and offensive definition of the word, which is of course the pure homophobia/transphobia - which is also more prominent with the increase in attention the LGBTQ movement has gotten in recent years. I think that if the F slur was used as casually as it was 10+ years ago, it would generate less negative reactions when said/typed in general, and would be less powerful when used in a genuinely hateful manner

&#x200B;

On a similar note, there is the N word, but mainly the **Soft-A N word** (The Hard R is taboo for obvious reasons and should stay that way as it's strictly racist) - I might be ignorant on understanding this word particularly some way, but I'm not sure why the Soft N word is considered super taboo for non-black people to say, as I have never heard it used in a racist way - The Soft N word is used commonly as a way to refer to other people, friends, companions, or just strangers. Sometimes it's positive word, sometimes it's just neutral - but never negative, and used a ton in rap music and everyday life in black culture. I'm not sure why this word is used so freely in a positive way, but is at the same time extremely offensive when used by a non-black person, even in the context of using it to refer to a friend or singing the lyrics of a song. I know that the Soft N word is related to the Hard R, but it is distinctly separate and very clearly used in a different way - In the context of this post, I feel that gatekeeping this word so strongly just amplifies the race division in America, rather than amending it, as it reminds people to pay attention to race more, and causes people to feel unfairly attacked and sometimes confused when they say it with innocent intentions.

&#x200B;

It doesn't just end with these two words, although they are probably the most prominently condemned words in America - I don't care about using them myself, but I think that the social shift that has aimed to fight discrimination and hate has actually unintentionally fostered it more in recent years

IMO modern American society (especially on the Internet) has become more focused on attacking those who say/do something of pure ignorance or misunderstanding, rather than empathizing with the situation, which has partially led to this"

Thanks :)

For example, if your children dream vibrantly of becoming a Pokemon trainer when they grow up, you should perhaps not indulge their fantasy with video games and toys. Instead, maybe it's better that you expose them to the wonders of the real natural world and the diversity of life forms (in other words, ""touch grass""). If they really like it, maybe encourage them to study biology and learn about the anatomy, physiology, ecology, and evolution of animals. Tell them that Pokemon is only fiction and while they can still enjoy it, it should not replace actually useful pursuits in life. A major example would be schoolwork. They can only get a job if they master the fundamental knowledge and skills required to enter the workforce, as well as the specific field they're interested in. What do you think?

I'd praise them when they achieve excellent grades or win awards in extracurricular competitions, and even if they don't win anything they should do their best and at least try, as well as learn and reflect from their past mistakes. And I feel like real-life face-to-face experience, whether personally or from real-life acquaintances, or even notable talented youth their age (good examples for my generation would be Malala Yousafzai or Greta Thunberg; theirs would obviously vary), can do a lot better job at teaching these lessons than Ash Ketchum (or whoever is replacing him next year) and his cartoon buddies with questionable morals.

But enough about me; this isn't the purpose of this place. What about you? When you become a parent, do you want your children living in a fantasy world, or the real world? Are you concerned about them always using fictional fantasies, for example Pokemon, as an ""escape rope"" (pun intended!) from the so-called treachery of real life? Do you feel like that's the correct mindset? To nourish the remitting urge to ""run away from real life""?

I don't know about you. That's on you. However, in my opinion, this is the completely wrong way to go about, especially during these times. I want to emphasize very much that I'd be very happy to be proven wrong, as always, but I just feel like I'd prefer a more realistic approach for the next generation. After all, ""no matter where you go, there you are"", as the old proverb states."

But later I went home and did some research and realized it is kind of widespread amongst northern states. 

Teachers are telling children being any gender they want it is okay, and this is as early as grade 1. I personally don’t think a child needs this at that age it’s confusing and kids don’t really think about gender at all

The sign-on bonuses, wages, etc. could also definitely be less for people that sign up for less time."

0,2023-04-16,CMV: UK health workers should be legally banned from striking in 2023.,u/Capitan_Walker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12o7v9z/cmv_uk_health_workers_should_be_legally_banned/,changemyview,"There is much in the backdrop of this post which I can only outline - as it is so voluminous.

What we are seeing in recent months is strikes by doctors and nurses. The effect of this is to cause massive disruption and set backs in the NHS in particular. Waiting lists will foreseeably be lengthened, and treatments for acute episodes of illness may not happen thus putting lives at risk. It is expected that excess deaths may rise as a result over several months.

In addition GDP may be affected over the next year but it is difficult to estimate by how much.

At the heart of the matter for doctors, are some big issues of contention (I summarise because it's a long story):

1. ONS data shows that doctors pay has suffered a relative pay cut of some 26% over the last 10 years based on the RPI. However it is a moot point if one used the CPIH because the relative pay cut would have been about 16% which is still significant and not near the DDRB award of circa 4.5%.
2. A BMA spokes person said, "" *RPI is the measure used to inflate the costs our members experience in the real economy. Those who don’t like the use of RPI should be talking first to the Government and the utilities not to the trade unions who are just trying to ensure that inflation does not erode people’s take-home pay.*""
3. The [BMA says](https://www.bma.org.uk/media/6720/bma-report-into-the-failings-of-the-pay-review-process-for-doctors-and-dentists-2023-v2.pdf), ""*This has resulted in doctors  and dentists suffering year on year real terms pay cuts, to the extent that the take home pay of the  average consultant (one of the groups within the DDRB’s remit) has fallen by 34.9% in real terms  since 2008.*"" I am yet to see a robust rebuttal of that statement from the govt. \[Happy to be informed\].

Similar situations affect nurses and other health workers. Navel gazing is fine, but the reality remains that there have been pay cuts over more than 10 years that amount to something around 15%, relative to inflation.

But the disputes have not been 'all about pay'. It is about conditions of work and safety of patients.

Those who are entrenched argue that the strikes make patient safety far worse - and therefore strike action is wrong. That seems to mean that strikes must never happen regardless of how over 15 years patient safety has been endangered by 'cuts' not just to pay.

The NHS has only been saved by cash injections when it was about to break and collapse. These were huge cash injections. A sizeable estimated proportion of what was taken out over the preceding 20 years had to be put back but it is difficult to find hard and reliable data to sum up. But the point is that patient safety in the NHS is nothing new due to widespread shortages of staff - and nobody really can know how that may have affected excess deaths (as a statistical concept).

If I contend that health workers must never strike, I have to then consider what that means for the wider NHS which has been evidentially seeing increasing degrees of chaos and neglect. I cannot summarise all the debacles here over the last 10 years or CQC reports. Some of the biggest debacles have been in mental health services.

So I am thinking that strikes in 2023, will be overall more damaging and should be exceptionally banned for this year. In other words accelerating harm to people is not something I can support. Now I can't provide any evidence that harm would be accelerated because that evidence simply does not exist (the data would be in an alternate future). Opinion is not evidence (save one minor exception of expert evidence to courts).

But I can infer that acceleration of harm to people - by estimate on balance of probability - based on the current state of the NHS. This is the core area where I wish for my view to be changed."

Now, I am not saying that this played no part, especially in the leading up to the current state but I do not believe taking away guns now will do anything. Mass shootings have unfortunately just become so ingrained in the culture in the US. They have been happening so often for so long  and have taken such a large portion of the public's attention at times that people who wish to go out with a bang in the US will always think of carrying out a mass shooting a lot more than their counterparts in the other parts of the world. A European for example since I live there, will probably not even consider a mass shooting. It is not in their sphere of attention and thinking pretty much at all while a troubled American on the contrary views it as an everyday and viable option if they wish to kill themselves for example. So I just can't see how such a huge part of the American way of thinking can dissappear unless decades and decades pass or something.

Edit: Ok I think I should add that I am not saying that I believe trying anything is useless, I am just saying that I have very little faith in any method being successful in removing mass shootings as a concept from American culture and that this is why they will remain so prevalent in the US. Anything that can decrease the number of occurrences should of course be pursued.

Edit 2: Basically I don't agree with this: if US has the same number of guns that countries in Europe do, America would only have the same proportionally, of course, number of mass killings or shootings as those countries. This would only be true if the culture was exactly the same between the countries. I think they are not and the US culture has in a twisted way adopted mass killing as an option for mentally unstable people in a fundamentally different way than European countries."

&#x200B;

I usually prefer the term ""Preference"" over ""Happiness"" because the latter fails to encorporate the wide variety and complex arrangement of positive and negative emotions, however I will use happiness for ease of other peoples understanding. To ""maximise happiness"" would be ""to bring into fruition the situation which an individual would say is their favourite if they got to experience and compare every potential outcome"", or in less pedantic terms: maximising happiness is someone creating their favourite life.

I arrived at this view because if you go down to the core of moral judgements, all you're left at is ""Which is the most preferable option"" - so the goodness or badness of the Holocaust can be answered easily by ""Is it preferable the Holocaust happened rather than didn't happen"". This is a principle that even moral nihilists I discuss to resort to, when I ask them why they do X or have value Y the answer is akin to something like ""Because I like X and Y"", to prefer one thing to another at the very core suggests some subjective 'good' which comes from attaining said preference - and this is the core of what's good.

One key part I wish to make explicit about 'happiness maximisation'. Every person's happiness is equal, but that doesn't mean the manifestation of every individuals preference is equal. A Nazi who finds preference in exterminating the Jews is less worthwhile than a Jews preference is tolerance for everyone, because at the extreme the Nazi's preferences are limited in their manifestation of happiness becuase it necessarily relies on undermining anothers thus limiting overall happiness, whereas the Jews preference comes from enabling the happiness of others."

The reason I believe federal rights should supersede states' rights is because it makes sense for a cohesive country, and because two heads are better than one.

Counterarguments:

1) _But what if the collective consciousness makes a worse decision than the individual._ First of all, states can also fall for this problem. Basically the issue is Groupthink. Luckily, however, no federal agency works unilaterally. There are three branches of federal government, AKA balance of power. What's more, it's not like individual people or smaller institutions are better. People can be swayed by petty emotions, local prejudice, and individual corruptions. These are problems that are avoided more often with larger groups because they are outvoted. If an individual wants to go murder their neighbor Bob, the group will most likely vote against that. 

What's more, one of the greatest benefits of the federal government is that with more people comes more money, knowledge, and resources to tackle any issue, understand it, and legislate it properly.

2) _But we can't have the federal government making the laws for every single road and bridge; that would never work._ I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that they are the ultimate authority for anything that they rule on.


3) _States represent a minority interest that otherwise can be overlooked or ignored, hurting our country._ First of all, it's not like the people in those states are not represented. They still get to vote for the federal government. What's more, their states are represented themselves in the federal government through Congress.

Plus, why are states the most important minority interests for the good of the people? If we really cared about people being underrepresented, then perhaps we should have required legislative spots for the minorities that face the most hardships and have the largest differences in their day-to-day lives. Such as black people, the LGBT+ community, and immigrant citizens. But I think most people will agree that that would be an odd way to go about things and not how we should create legislative bodies."

So don't come at me with ""but YouTube is great!"" – I know, I know, but that's not what I'm talking about here. Now, let's dive into the reasons why I believe social media is a curse, not a blessing:

1. **Mental Health Issues**: Social media is a breeding ground for mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). People are constantly comparing themselves to others and feeling inadequate. Studies have shown that the more time you spend on social media, the worse your mental health becomes. That can't be a good thing, right?

2. **Cyberbullying**: OMG, don't even get me started on this. Social media has made it so freaking easy for people to bully and harass others from behind a screen. It's disgusting, and it happens way too often. Cyberbullying can have serious, long-lasting effects on the victims, and it's something we should all be concerned about.

3. **Addiction**: Raise your hand if you can't go 5 minutes without checking your phone for notifications. Yeah, that's what I thought. Social media is designed to be addictive, with all those likes, shares, and comments giving us a dopamine hit every time we engage. This addiction can lead to decreased productivity, sleep disorders, and even relationship problems. Ugh.

4. **Invasion of Privacy**: Social media platforms have a creepy amount of data on us, and they're not always responsible with it. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal with Facebook? Yeah, not cool. Our personal information is being used to manipulate us, and we're just giving it away for free.

5. **Spread of Misinformation**: Fake news, anyone? Social media makes it super easy for false information to spread like wildfire. People can share articles without even reading them, and before you know it, your grandma is ranting about some conspiracy theory she saw on Facebook. It's a mess, and it's making it harder for people to know what's real and what's not.

6. **Unrealistic Beauty Standards**: Filters, photoshop, facetune… social media has made it so that we never know what's real anymore. People are constantly bombarded with images of ""perfect"" bodies and faces, leading to increased body dissatisfaction and even eating disorders. It's a toxic environment that's seriously damaging our self-esteem.

7. **Decline in Real-Life Social Skills**: How many times have you seen a group of friends hanging out, but they're all just staring at their phones? Social media is replacing real-life interaction, and it's making us worse at communicating with each other. We're forgetting how to have actual conversations, and it's just sad.

I'm open to having my mind changed, but it's gonna take some seriously convincing arguments. What do you think?"

Japan's army was determined to hold out as long as possible and were trained to never surrender peacefully. Even everyday citizens were subjected to propaganda telling them that the USA was so evil, it would be preferable to commit suicide over accepting capture, hence the mass suicides of Japanese citizens on captured islands during the Island-hopping campaign. This view was so deeply entrenched, that an invasion of the homeland likely would have reinforced this viewpoint further and led to unperceivable tragedy.

[https://www.history.navy.mil/about-us/leadership/director/directors-corner/h-grams/h-gram-057/h-057-1.html](https://www.history.navy.mil/about-us/leadership/director/directors-corner/h-grams/h-gram-057/h-057-1.html)

[https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/history/japanese-mass-suicides/](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/history/japanese-mass-suicides/)

I do not think it is a controversial statement to claim that Imperial Japan was an aggressor due to their invasion of China in 1937 and their unprovoked attack on the USA in 1941. The United States had every right to go to war. I have heard claims that the use of intimidation for political gain is akin to terrorism, but I feel as though this point is moot since tough decisions have to be made in war. War is never pleasant. Personally, I find it narrow-minded when people claim that the bombings were morally wrong just because they believe bombing cities is never acceptable.

It should be noted that the Allied Powers did not perform the bombings unprompted. They warned Japan to surrender throughout the Summer or ""face prompt and utter destruction."" It was not a unilateral decision by the United States either; it was approved by a majority of Allied Nations who considered the bombing to be the lesser of two evils.

In addition, it often goes unmentioned that the United States airdropped leaflets warning the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to evacuate days in advance to minimize the loss of innocent life. I will admit this is not a complete absolution since using threats of violence to force people to leave their homes is a form of coercion, but it does show that killing innocent people was not the main intention.

[https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/key-documents/warning-leaflets/](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/key-documents/warning-leaflets/)

I am not heartless or blind to the unforeseen impact; there was widespread radiation poisoning and a humanitarian crisis in the aftermath, but the deaths of between 126,000 and 250,000 people are clearly less devastating than the estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 deaths that would have occurred in the event of a homeland invasion.

I should note that the bombings are nothing to be proud of. It is very unfortunate that this decision was necessary, but I am confident that nothing like this will ever happen again. The United States and Japan are major allies today, Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been rebuilt and are currently major cities, and several US Government officials have made official visits to the Memorial. It has been over 3/4 of a century since then and both major governments have long since officially made peace.

**TL:DR** The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were tragic, but they were necessary since they almost certainly saved 100s of thousands of lives and put an immediate end to the most costly war in history."

Twitter's definition.

>Government-funded media is defined as outlets where the government provides some or all of the outlet's funding and may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content

The Canadian government does provide the majority of CBC's funding, so that's not really up for debate. The second part ""may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content"" is more hotly debated.

Although the federal government probably isn't going in and censoring or editing CBC articles, the federal government does establish an editorial mandate for the type of content CBC is required to produce. CBC cannot change their mandate on their own, only the federal government can, so CBC is locked into producing certain types of content by the federal government. I would consider this meets the broad ""varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content"" of twitters definition.

I won't go through CBC's complete mandate, but here's what a CBC spokesperson has to say about CBC's mandate.

https://nationalpost.com/opinion/cbc-editorial-independence-is-a-lie

>A spokesman for the CBC, interviewed by the Post’s Anja Karadeglija, made the point you would expect him to make: the Government of Canada has no editorial involvement with the CBC. Why, its political independence is specified in, er, the Broadcasting Act. That’s the federal statute that, ummm, defines the editorial mandate of the CBC, requiring the corporation to promote “national consciousness and identity” and to “reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada.”

>requiring the corporation to promote “national consciousness and identity” and to “reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada.”

The corporation being required to produce a certain type of content by the federal government is imo a form of government involvement over editorial content.

I think its likely that CBC's content wouldn't change without the mandate, but i can't look beyond the federal government setting a mandate that CBC has to follow and CBC saying it shapes it content.

Edit: Thanks for the discussion. I have to bail now. I'll give the arguments some more thought"

The thing is it’s not just about attraction, if it’s even about attraction at all, and it’s not about a fear that the gf will cheat. It’s not like a guy has to be ok with his gf rooming with an unattractive male. The thing is that some people want to be respected by their SO through their SO not having roommates of the opposite sex. Some people don’t care and that’s fine too. The thing with boundaries is we can choose them, and deem ourselves what we find respectful enough, and I’m ok with anyone’s choice here, but nobody should be deemed controlling or insecure for not wanting his gf to room with a guy (or vice versa).

I’ve also noticed how when it’s the other way around, people are more supportive but either way my point stands and nobody should be vilified for reasonable boundaries."

The space behind you belongs to the person sitting behind you. It's not nice to encroach on their comfort for the sake of your own. Saying ""well they can recline, too"" isn't good enough, in my opinion, as their only recourse to your imposition is to be equally rude to the person behind them. 
If you ask the person behind you if you can recline and they say yes, then fair enough, but even there, the social pressure for them to grant your request is quite high even if they wouldn't want you to."

It frustrates me that so many people are unwilling to donate but are willing to receive a transplant because of misconceptions about organ donation or pure selfishness. Many people have proposed an opt-out system for organ donation, but it seems like that idea is quickly shot down. Other countries like Singapore prioritize organ donors over non-donors for receiving transplants, but I don't know if that is fair if some donors want their donation to be completely selfless.

**I therefore propose that donors in the USA should be able to indicate when they sign up for donation that they want priority for their organs to go to people currently signed up for organ donation.** This system could incentivize being an organ donor if a significant proportion of the donor population feels the same way I do. Here are some of the counterpoints I have heard and my rebuttals:

* *I can't donate my organs because of medical reasons. Should I be denied for something that isn't my fault?*: it appears that there are very few conditions that would disqualify you from donating any organs whatsoever. Alcoholics may still be able to donate their retinas, for example. If you truly do have a disease that would prevent you from donating any organs, then you can still sign up for organ donation anyway and let the transplant team reject you when the time comes. 
* *I can't donate my organs because of religious reasons. Should I be denied for something that isn't my fault?*: if your religion prevents you from donating organs then it probably also prevents you from receiving them. Either way, you would be out of luck if you needed a transplant in a world of people like you. 
* *Doctors make mistakes/doctors will delay treatment/doctors will murder healthy people to harvest their organs*: doctors (at least in the USA) aren't checking to see if you are a donor before deciding weather or not they are going to treat you, but nothing I say is going to convince you of that. Lets pretend that your beliefs are indeed completely true for a minute, though. If you choose to receive an organ in your time of need, you are benefitting from an incredibly evil practice of organ farming. But you don't care as long as you aren't the victim and are directly benefitting? That would make you a pretty crappy person. 

 So can anyone change my view?"

So I don't know if the fixed cost is even a legit argument in the US in 2023.

All the other arguments talk about 2.5% fees and other nonsense that if were true, would apply to every other business in that same market. No one would accept credit cards if it didn't equate to more revenue. It's clear that the market has spoken. 99.9% of businesses accept digital forms of payment and when you're part of the .001% of business that won't play along, the only argument is idealogical and I'm sorry, I just can't wrap my head around a small business owner so bent on sticking it to Visa they are willing to give up business and inconvenience their customers.

*I was looking for a ""I own (or knows someone who owns) a restaurant/shop and I went cash only for these reasons...."" OR ""This study shows that businesses that are cash only make the same average amount per transaction and are just as profitable as businesses that accept digital payment""*

The other comments about businesses not being allowed to add the fees to the invoice are just not valid. I'm routinely given 2 prices for goods and services - always ask my plumbers/electricians and really anyone if they take cash/check for a lower amount. They always say yes.

Having to keep an additional machine (ATM) plugged in and all the security and headache of keeping that up and functional just so you can cater to everyone? c'mon.

I think everyone here is getting caught up on fees in general and not the fact that no one in retail operates like this. There must be a good reason that a company would go this route other than the cannabis industry.

**EDIT**: since it seems I'm making accusations w/out any hard evidence, please consider the word ""likely"" in my title. Meaning, any retail business dealing in only cash is very likely paying someone or otherwise exchanging said cash with others and as a result are not fully reporting all earnings.

**EDIT2**: I don't know much about how debit cards work, but my experience tells me this is a low/no transaction fee. So for a business to not accept debit (set up by local bank/credit union) seems to be another set of reasons that can't be based on cost.

I just had to borrow some cash from a friend to purchase food at a BBQ joint and just don't understand. I thought about the reasons a business might have to not accept credit cards - basically just the fees per transaction. But the more sinister reasons are obvious - you can easily hide income and collect additional money by having an ATM onsite and collect those fees as well.

Then I thought about the reasons you'd want to pivot to cashless (as many companies have) and in fact want your customers to basically handle their own card handling/payment and if needed, screen interactions.

1. Speed of transactions - fewer lines - quicker turnover
2. Fewer mistakes from cashiers/servers having to do math with every transaction
3. Fewer germs transmitted from cash between every customer and staff

All I could legitimately think of is of the general network/connectivity of the location creates a lack of coverage for the connection to credit card terminals. i.e., it's impossible to process the transactions due to the network (no cellular, no land line, and no wired internet). And if you're running a legit business without any phone/cellular/data connection, please let me know how that works.

The cost argument could easily be mitigated by simply having a sign that says you charge an extra X% for CC transaction or make it simple and say CC minimum of $20 or whatever.

What would change my view is a legit example of a business owner deciding to not accept credit cards. I'm assuming that any argument would be based on cost so please explain the cost benefit when you consider customer convenience and loss of business due to lack of CC acceptance."

Partition would be painful at first but would provide tremendous amounts of representation, self-determination, and governing finesse for the citizens.

When California was admitted as a single entity in the Compromise of 1850, it was never expected to reach such a large concentration of population and national economic importance. Combining the states WV, VA, NC, SC and GA into a singular state would be considered laughably undemocratic and oppressive but that is the approximate size and population of California.

I understand this has been proposed frequently in the last few decades (until the CA Supreme Court shut down a referendum). People that are mad at California underrepresentation at a national level are simply mad at the wrong system and partition should be supported more."

Not for their sake, but for the sake of their victims. Recently, Florida has released a bill called SB 1342 that proposes death penalty for anyone who commits sexual crimes against children.  I don’t agree with this and I believe it’s going to backfire if it comes to fruition.

Evidence shows that the majority of abused children are abused by someone they know and/or trust. Most CSA victims don’t disclose, and even less of those perpetrators are punished.


Now, let’s take a look into the mind of a child. A young child may even not fully understand the gravity of SA. Many times victims feel something like love or trust towards their abusers, and sometimes it can lead to them feeling like what’s happening to them is okay. Many don’t report because of fear of their abuser going to jail, or feeling that if their abuser goes to jail, it is their fault. Now, let’s throw capital punishment into the mix. What’s stopping a child molester from telling their victim, “Don’t tell anyone, or I’ll die and it’ll be your fault?” It’s only going to lead to us catching less and less people.


There is also the problem of someone simply killing and discarding someone so that there are no witnesses. If the punishment for murder is less than the punishment for CSA, the abuser will feel that there is no incentive to keep the victim alive. 

Rapists and child molesters should be jailed, punished, everything, you name it. Just not killed."
0,2023-04-17,CMV: There's nothing wrong with scalping most consumer goods.,u/ARjags15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12ptuf7/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_scalping_most/,changemyview,"There are some threads on this sub touching on this topic, but reading through them none have really addressed the argument well enough in my view so I'm gonna give it a shot.

I'm gonna use PS5s as an example since it is a pretty clear case of scalping. When the PS5 hit the market Sony could not keep up with consumer demand due to a shortage of computer chips needed to make the console. They could have sold the initial wave of consoles at a crazy high price and still have sold them all, but they didn't. They sold that initial wave of consoles at a lower price than the profit-maximizing price, as evidenced by the fact that countless consumers wanted to buy the console at that price but weren't able to. The amount of people willing to buy the console at retail price was significantly higher than the amount of consoles Sony was selling. There are plenty of reasons for Sony to sacrifice profit here (most of them are optics reasons). So naturally scalpers buy up all the consoles and sell them at equilibrium market price, exploiting the profit opportunity left by Sony. And I guess I just don't see what's wrong with that. What if Sony had charged that market price originally? I don't think there's anything wrong with that either, just a firm maximizing profits. The only difference in that scenario is \*who\* is getting the profit. 

I say \*most\* consumer goods because my argument above is operating under the assumption that the market of that particular good does a pretty good job of allocating itself. I understand this is a vague and subjective qualifier but the conversation gets a lot more complicated when we start to talk about goods whose market allocation leads to significant social costs. I'm mostly thinking of necessities that aren't in abundance (scalping drinking water during an extreme shortage is not okay). I'm more interested in talking about goods like PS5s because then the discussion is purely about scalping rather than free markets not distributing certain goods very well, which is an entirely different topic."

The only point I'm holding onto is that, because in the US we don't teach that there is one big ""American"" continent, we are not hubristically appropriating the term for ourselves or claiming we are the only important ""Americans"". In American English we are the only Americans not because we are special but because there simply are no other ""Americans"" - just North Americans, South Americans, Central Americans, people from the Americas, etc. But that doesn't make our view more right than another view in which the Americas are called America.** (I'm at work but I'll award some deltas later).

--

I've seen this conversation going around for a while, especially on Reddit, but it's also something I've noticed personally while traveling in Europe.

I think I get the argument: ~~Europeans~~ (edit: people) feel that Americans are arrogantly reducing the whole of the western hemisphere to their country when they say ""American."" This plays into American stereotypes of geographic ignorance and an inflated sense of our own importance. The term United Station gives people from the United States a more accurate and descriptive way to refer to themselves that doesn't cause confusion.

Here's the thing: this is ~~UNIQUELY~~ a European (edit: and South American and Central American!) issue. From what I understand, some countries teach about the Americas as basically one supercontinent with a North and a South. But in the Americas we never view it this way. That's why they are ""the Americas."" America in the singular is never, ever used as a general catch-all for the North and South. Using American to refer to someone from the United States does not elevate it to a special position among countries in the Americas. The misunderstanding is more grammatical than anything else, and it has nothing to do with culture or attitude or arrogance.

In many ways, yeah, we suck, we think we rule the world, our democracy is going to shit, I know, I'm with you. But I don't think calling ourselves Americans is at all historically or linguistically related to that arrogance.

I feel like maybe I don't know the whole argument though so I'm curious if someone can change my mind.

Edit: yes, obviously The United States of America includes the word America, I didn't think I needed to say that. But it's a good point that America is in the name of no other country in the Americas (notice I didn't say ""American country,"" because over here that makes no sense except when referring to a music genre)

Edit2: Apparently I am an ignorant American and didn't know this was a MUCH bigger thing in central and south America than in Europe! I was mostly going off of my own experience having these conversations with Europeans (I've traveled in Europe but not in central or south America, so that's just where I happened to encounter this idea). But point taken, I can consider my mind changed on that point at least!

Edit3: If you're from a country that refers to anyone from the Americas as American and you want to say US American for clarity, go ahead. But this clarity is totally unnecessary from the American perspective, ~~and in 99% of cases if someone refers to THEMSELF as an American, they are American.~~ nevermind! Many south Americans and Central Americans refer to themselves as just Americans. I can see why, if that's the case in spanish/Portuguese speaking countries, this would be an issue

Edit4: from the American (US) perspective there is no continent called America. There's ""the Americas"" but no ""America"". So there's no leaving out of anybody when we say ""in America"" and mean the country... Because in America means in the country of America on the continent of North America, which is one continent of the Americas.

Edit5: ~~no one has a problem with the English calling themselves English despite not being the only English-speaking country. How is this different?~~ this is a terrible analogy, I had a point with it about how in different languages words might refer to different categories i.e. country, continent, language, type of person etc but I'm tired and instead I'll just say I'm dumb"

0,2023-04-18,CMV: There is no free will,u/JoyIkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12qe33n/cmv_there_is_no_free_will/,changemyview,"The topic í as old as God himself yet still unanswered. My personal view is that we do not have free will. First, let's define what free will is: "" the supposed power or capacity of humans to make decisions or perform actions independently of any prior event or state of the universe"". Inherently, humans do not possess such capacity. I'll attempt to demonstrate why:

When we make a decision, we can either: 

a) make a choice at random;

b) make a choice based on our prior experience.

We can't call the random choice as free will because we did not consciously come to that decision. Nor can the 2nd option be considered an implementation of free will since we were influenced by our prior experience.

Furthermore, our entire mental being is comprised of 02 sets:

a) Attributes we were born with;

b) Attributes that we learned by observing the world around us.

The concept of n independent self that has no connection to world does not exit. Even if it does, what is it? How did it come to be? Did we decide it? No, it would just be the results of random chance or prior cause.

Saying free will exist is like saying that a dice roll is random. A dice roll is not random, it appears random because we can't predict the outcome. If we know every aspects of the dice roll (angle, weight, force, etc), we will know exactly how it lands. The same is with free will, we think free will exists because we can't predict our own outcomes but that does not means that a predetermined outcome does not exist. 

Like the mathematician Laplace once imagined a being that has the knowledge of the motion of every particle in the universe, he pondered "" for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes"""

Let me give you an example, let's say a politician promised to build a road from a city to a mine, by the time he is elected the mine closes. Nobody would now blame the politician to NOT building the street as the circumstances changed. 
This is, to be honest, a very simple example but think about other topics may it be climate change, health care etc. SOME promises just don't are practical or necessary by the time they were intended to be implemented. BUT however you should be obligated to stick to the direction of their promise for example if you promise that you care for environment you should care for your environment, even if you don't realise certain specific projects."

I honestly believe that birds are real and so please don't go there. Let me explain a little, back in 2020 I dated this person who was completely and utterly obsessed with birds. She also needed a new job and I would look up jobs on Indeed with the keyword 'bird' or 'bird watching'. 

At the time I was residing in the DMV, and the aim was to find a job from Fish and Wildlife, Audubon, or something more broadly bird based from the Department of Interior. However, what I recall constantly showing up in my results was a volunteer based job from DARPA that requested knowledgeable birdwatchers. I had never heard of the birds-aren't-real conspiracy stuff and I never paid much attention to the idea beyond emitting a cold sigh of disbelief. This person I dated showed me the very real world of birds and we would drive around the tristate and go to different parks just to see the rare bird alerts in person through binoculars or on her x50 Canon scope. A bird up close is stunningly beautiful. 

Moving forward, the intersection of that DARPA job description and the laughter about the conspiracy theory made me extra curious what that job posting would have wanted by soliciting the help of bird watching experts who knew how to discern avian behavior. Knowing that iPhones can now charge on surfaces and that drone technology is accelerating like the curve of a hockey stick, it just kinda leaves me saying, wouldn't this be an excellent avenue to pursue for a department like DARPA?

One thing I learned is that birds and ducks weigh almost nothing. A good sized mallard weighs 5 lbs, a wood duck weighs 2 lbs, and a warbler would measure merely a couple ounces. The domain of these creatures exhibit behavior that is assumed to easily startled and they all fly away the moment a person or unpredictable animal get anywhere near their proximity. You truly need binoculars to examine birds as they are generally up in the trees or surrounded by a natural barrier of some sorts. 

As someone who is studying computers and dabbling in robotics, please change my mind how this would not be an worthy avenue to pursue for covert or even domestic surveillance purposes. It seems that the military and intelligence agencies have developed toys for absolutely every scenario and this would surely have some use case somewhere. Finally, I have tried to find that job description but the only means I can think of is the way back machine and that doesnt work with something like Indeed's search feature. If anyone has an idea how to search Indeed then set your sights around October 2022, Washington DC. Thank you.

What makes someone a woman? It has nothing to do with how you think, or act, or dress. Your sex is not something that defines you in any way other than biological capabilities. Being told as a girl that because I’m not very feminine I must be trans? That’s ridiculous. A little boy wanting to wear a dress doesn’t make him a girl. I feel like society is going back to pushing gender stereotypes and if you don’t fit into that mold you “must be trans.” 

The only thing that defines your gender is your genitals. It’s not the way you act. I don’t think that it makes sense that one can ‘feel’ like a gender. I have no problem with using different pronouns or leaving people to do what they want, because it’s not my business what someone does with their life. But I think it’s ridiculous that I’m being told I must believe a biological man is a woman in exactly the same way a biological female is. 

I must also say that I don’t believe feeling like you might be a different gender makes you any less of a person. Every human being, regardless of their beliefs, deserves to be treated with basic respect and human decency. However, I find it wrong and gross that young children in school systems are being taught that biology is invalid when it comes to gender. My younger sister (who is FIVE) came to me and told me that her teacher told her she was a boy because she liked playing with cars and didn’t think of herself as ‘girly’. My BABY sister had an identity crisis because she was being told that she is not a girl, when she is one. 

Gender/sex is not a choice. It’s not a lifestyle, or a way you act or dress. It’s simply a biological part of you. That’s it."

Freud's explained this very well with his pain-pleasure principle: people's drive is the avoidance of pain and the pursuit of pleasure.

People like Mother Theresa experienced pleasure from helping others, and pain from not helping others. So you could say that she helped others to help herself. 

Other people do not experience pleasure from helping others, they experience pleasure and/or avoid pain by not helping others or simply by focusing on helping themselves.

Hence you could say that altruistic people are those who experience pleasure helping others, despite of the inherent pain that comes from focusing on helping others, sometimes, above one self.

She is profoundly altruistic, for her own good, but most importantly, for everybody's good. And - not but - she is still acting out of self-interest.

Mother Theresa was the exception to the rule, if she wasn't, we would likely not know of her existence.

The Western population, especially in big cities, tends to be individualistic. And please note I'm not talking about the positive exploration and expansion of oneself within the boundaries of health and ethics, I'm talking about the 'I come first, you come second' or its most advanced version, 'Oh, were you there? I didn't see you'.

In big cities, there's the added danger of 'I don't know you, I don't care'. 'I don't owe you and you most likely will never find out anyway'. The fact that there is less crime in totalitarian regimes where crime is punished with execution is almost self-explanatory. 

So we are in a concrete jungle, almost playing the 'You do care. You don't care. You do care. You don't care.' and the 'I do care. I don't care. I do care. I don't care' based on specific criteria, that for some is kinder to humanity than for others.

And we are suppose to trust the process and trust each other, as opposed to just stay safely at home, reading existential  books and listening to classics such as Leonard Cohen. Yes, you guessed it, that's what I do.

**Statement 2: ... nothing lasts...**

The jungle described above wouldn't be so bad if health, both physical and mental, was limitless. But unfortunately, it is not. It is also a fact that our experiences can alter our belief system and emotional well-being. 

For instance, sometimes depression is a natural reaction to a depressing situation. 

The love of your life today is a stranger tomorrow. Your dad is here today, and is dead tomorrow. The job of your dreams is yours today, but no longer tomorrow. A stranger today is the love of your life tomorrow... And back to the beginning. I'm sure you get the point.

**Statement 3: ... but pain and suffering** 

'Nothing lasts, everything is temporary', just this fact alone guarantees suffering. And let's notice a fundamental conceptual difference:

1. Pain, inevitable. E.g. I fall and break a leg. I break up with my boyfriend.
2. Suffering, according to some gurus, is voluntary. It is an added layer of neuroticism, in other words, 'to suffer more in imagination than reality', as Seneca put it. E.g. You break up with your boyfriend and start thinking that you will always be alone, that he doesn't love you, etc. Mostly cognitive distortions. 

In some cases, it is true that there is only suffering due to those unhealthy mental habits such as rumination and overthinking. 

But let's face it, suffering to an extent is unavoidable. Some say that we shouldn't have expectations, but if you think of its mathematical nature - estimation -, you soon realise it is in our brain design to estimate outcomes. We all expect, to an extent. 

And most is not within our control, so we are almost always subjected to pain and suffering.

If one then realises that death is guarantee, then you realise life is about the journey. And as per above, the journey is full of pain and suffering. A suffering that is way more profound than the joy you may feel along the way.

Please change my view, I really want to be wrong and feel hopeful."

24,2023-04-18,CMV: It is almost impossible for normal people to give dating advice to ugly people.,u/HatefulYoungMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12r2xke/cmv_it_is_almost_impossible_for_normal_people_to/,changemyview,"So I want to preface this by shaming I’m not a woman hating incel or misogynistic in any form. I am a guy who has never really had dating or sexual success. I’m 22 and a virgin and I’ve pretty much given up completely on dating. I’m really only able to talk about this from the male perspective. This is not at all an attempt to shit on women for not wanting to date me.

So dating advice in general is very difficult to give. This is because dating is mostly based on luck. Mainly just being born lucky with good genetics. I think that in dating being physically attractive is a huge level of power a person can hold. It’s better than being funny, or having a good personality because it can replace that. After all Unfortunately for us ugly folks, being physically attractive makes you appear more [funny](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886912005028), more [intelligent, and like you have a better personality.](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-2909.110.1.109).

So I know what people will say, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but in many aspects the overwhelming majority of society agree something’s are more attractive than others. I mean there’s a reason why Michael B. Jordan is seen as a sex symbol and objectively attractive man compared to someone like Steve Buscemi. Some things are objective and most of those things aren’t controllable. Height, skin color, hair (balding or not), athleticism etc.

This means that the people who do hit those qualifiers for physically attractive will then be seen as much smarter and funnier than less attractive men whether it’s true or not. These men will disregard their looks when giving dating advice and give advice on what they think worked for them when in reality it was their looks.

I think women tend to do something similar but in reverse. When women give dating advice to men, they are giving advice that they wish the one specific guy they have their eyes set on would do, not what they think men should do to be successful with women. So they give advice that ends up being unhelpful.

Or something I’ve experienced is that my female acquaintances tell me to do things that work for women but not for men. Ex: “just go to the bar and wait for a woman to come speak to you” which is very nice of her to offer some advice but clearly that not advice that would work for men who aren’t like 10/10 6’4 Henry Cavill mfers.

I also think there’s an inability to relate. Something I’ve notice here on Reddit is when I say, “I’ve never had a girl like me” and the response is that I’ve definitely had a girl like me but never noticed. I think this comes simply from a place of ignorance. Of course normal and attractive guys have that one story of some girl liking them and them not realizing it until years later. Ugly guys don’t really have that as we tend to be more socially isolated. Simply put women do not talk to us and typically never have. I don’t have any close female friends. Just women I know because of my male friends.

It’s just impossible to give advice that’s meaningful. I know people try and I appreciate the effort but due to the nature of the way ugly people exist, we’re just not really able to be helped. For me, because I’m truly ugly and not an average guy that has “low self esteem” I think the option that’s best for me is to give up. If it’s never going to happen why put in the effort to continue to depress myself."

The educational level, cognitive capabilities of, and willingness to seek out potential contradictions to held beliefs is debilitatingly low in the majority of those people. And even for those on the higher end of the bell curve, they are also not immune to propaganda.

This would not be as much of an issue if they were not swayed into positions that run counter to the needs of societies, humanity in general, and sometimes even their own individual immediate, medium, and long-term best interest. (As evaluated by them through a more objective lens which they might currently be unable to apply)

Examples of the latter would be people that know of and enjoy the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, but balk at the mention of ""Obamacare"" due to the ingrained negative connotation they have associated with it through their consumption of propaganda.

Similarly, individuals focusing on identity politics to address discrimination and equality failing to recognize that those efforts can feed into tribalism and undermine overall social cohesion when taken too far.

**My premise is this:** Regardless of the political opinions that you, I, or anyone else ultimatey holds; direct objective truth is not an effective means to shift the vast majority of people's opinions, much less spur people into actually taking action of some kind.

If you want to enact real change, whatever it may be, it needs to be done with rhetoric, appeals to emotion, exaggeration, and possibly even outright lies that run alongside pre-existing cultural beliefs to guide them towards the desired action. The presentation of information is a far more important factor than it's inherent validity for this purpose."

Before I elaborate, I just want to convey that I don’t dislike or hate gay / trans people whatsoever or treat them any different. If the mods feel this post / topic is hateful or too offensive, feel free to delete it as that’s not my intention.

So here’s my position: I find it very difficult to believe that gay people were just simply born that way, and I think as a society it is crucially and fundamentally important to find the truth to the matter (I’ll elaborate why I think it’s important)

First off, if you look at data / statistics / polls / studies, etc, every single one of them will show that a *significant* percent of gay individuals were sexually abused at some point in their life (predominantly as children). And no, I don’t mean that LGBTQ people are more prone to abuse (however I think that is also true), but rather the initial cause was from abuse. However, with that said I also don’t believe that sexual abuse *always* leads to being gay, and I also don’t think sexual abuse is the *only* causation of being gay.

The following paragraph is an example from my life that wasn’t caused by sexual abuse: 

My best friend & his sister’s parents divorced in a really ugly and nasty way when his sister was 13 years old. Their father cheated on their mom with their neighbor. I was very close to both of them, and it was extremely traumatic for her (as it is for most children), and several years later she began to really hate men, so much so that she started flirting / dating this girl in secrecy when she was about 17/18. Later on in her life we talked about it and she said she initially was never attracted to women, she just hated men so much and found solace in this girl, but since she was a virgin / had never kissed anyone it did cause her to feel a mild level of physical attraction towards women after they “interacted” more with each other. However years later at the age of 29 she did end up marrying a guy.

These are all anecdotal, however I have another really close friend that is gay, and one night while drinking he brought up the subject, and he openly admitted that he also agrees with this view point as it happened to him as well as a lot of other gay friends he has. Pretty impressive for him to be able to admit that, must take a lot of courage, but it’s also very sad to hear.

Also, statistics show that trauma / abuse of any kind is often likely (but not always) to be replicated each generation. IE: Father abuses son / daughter, son / daughter abuses their children / others, and so on. This bit isn’t really debated, most of us are all aware that can occur.

Also, many people that are gay will openly and strongly oppose this position by stating they weren’t “sexually abused” however, my opinion is that it doesn’t inherently require sexual abuse to occur. Also, studies show a significant percent of people that were abused block it from their memory, it’s our instinctual safeguard to protect ourselves (that’s what can cause split personalities for example) and it sometimes comes out later in life / in therapy. For example, my older sister has always acted abnormally sexual in nature even at a young age despite being raised very conservative / religious, and we’ve always wondered why. (FYI, I am not religious, but I do believe in god) - A few years ago our cousin asked my dad to meet him for lunch and I came along too, he apologized and told us that he molested my sister when she was 7. He didn’t elaborate much, but implied it wasn’t anything “severe” My dad did ask my sister, and she said she doesn’t remember, but she didn’t come across super confident in her response. However with that said we aren’t sure if this is true because that cousin is slightly whacky, but it would be completely absurd of him to admit that if it wasn’t true.

Anyway, my thought is that same sex physical interaction at a young age “*can*” lead to same sex attraction (but not necessarily always). I mean logically it makes complete sense, if your young and someone screws around with you, you will “feel” things even if your not attracted to them. It’s just an automatic physical response. And if that’s the only sexual experience they’ve had, it would make sense that naturally it could lead them in that direction. I also don’t think this is specific point is highly disputed either, which is why I find it odd that this general opinion is so controversial.

SO… With that said, currently I am with the opinion that the most likely and probable outcome on the subject is that it doesn’t appear gay people are born gay, rather it is caused by significant trauma, abuse, or sexual abuse, most likely and often during young adolescence.

And the reason this is important to distinguish and a very important subject is because if there’s even the slightest truth to the matter, then we should spend more time evaluating it because it doesn’t appear that “encouraging” that behavior leads to positive outcomes. IE: If it is caused by trauma, than trauma is likely to be passed down either directly or in other forms.

I sincerely don’t mean for this post to attack LGBTQ people or make them feel bad or feel any less of themselves, after all in this scenario they are victims of serious trauma, and if so it’s incredibly sad to hear, but I know the inherent view point does so automatically, so for that I am sorry, I love everyone equally and don’t think or treat any specific subgroup differently, and I’m not saying if you’re gay you shouldn’t act upon it, but rather if there’s truth to the theory than perhaps this topic shouldn’t be expressed to our children as a positive, normal, natural thing, which is why I think the subject is important.

What are your thoughts?

TLDR: It appears statistics / data support the notion that gay people aren’t born gay, rather it seems likely to be caused by various forms of abuse and or trauma, typically during adolescence, with the most predominant abuse being sexual in nature, but not always inherently sexual."

I shouldn't had generalized with a few comments. 


i was scrolling down on Instagram until I found a South Park meme of a scene when Kyle reporta the police that a female teacher was having sex with his little brother. The policemen didn't mind, and prefered to treat Ike (iirc that was his name) like a ""fortunate boy"" and that it was ""hot"". This scene is obviously making fun of the people who unironically thinks that, and I think it's quite obvious and clear that's the case.

But what baffled and surprise me is how many of the people there actually decided to take the scene as a joke, even to the point of justifying it. It's insane, I even read one that tried to justify it with a Made up statistic that 90% of boys fantasize of having sex with their teacher. Not even realizing that Ike is literally 4 years old. Another one went to the point of justifying with ""facts and Science"" by talking about testosterone and going on with how testosterone makes that behaviour possible

As a man, I absolutely hate the men who justify shitty behaviour that other men do with excuses like ""it's because biology"" or ""boys will be boys"" [this is related to the first one] You're literally a human being capable of reasoning your behaviour, not a fucking animal. Then you literally have the [[[Audacity]]] to complain about ""crazy feminists"" who treat men like garbage and generalize that all men are rapists even though YOU are literally one who is perpetuating the thought that men can't control their sexual impulses.

Edit (Clarification): I don't know why people equated what I said to that people who watch South Park are stupid. I thought I wrote the post to say that people who watch South Park, and aren't capable of seeing through the messages the show gives and how it's most of a social criticism of the stupidity in society, are stupid, and unfortunately that's the case of most of the people as that Instagram post of that south park meme made me realize that.

Edit 2: Yeah My wording was definitely poor. English is My second language, sorry."

My view has not changed yet, still if someone is willing to discuss further they are welcome. The main takeaway from this for everyone should be that no matter what they shouldn't enforce their idea or perceptions on anyone. This is advice for both sides of the argument. If somebody refuses to accept transgender people's beliefs, they shouldn't be hated and discriminated against just because of that. It is their personal perception and I do not support the idea that they bring it into sports, laws, legislation, politics, etc. Also, Violence is wrong no matter who it is against. Everyone deserves the right to defend their views. Of course, this does not apply to views that harm others or have no basis in reality. I am still open to good arguments. Nothing is absolute.

I made this post after the most recent post of how ‘the trans movement is pushing gender stereotypes’. 
I read all the replies and stances the other side had and I still am not convinced. Even though the OP awarded delta.
So instead of commenting there, I decided to make a post of it myself. So my views would at least be heard.
For context, I support LGBTQ people and I used to support trans ppl along with it. But when I started to deeply think about it, a lot of inconsistencies struck me. And now I only support LGBTQ as in sexual orientation and intersex ppl but not the gender identity ones. 
I feel like ‘gender identity’ lacks a proper definition and most ppl who are defending it aren’t even fully sure themselves what it means.
So I want to ask what is gender identity and what sort of aspects do i need to match in order to be a specific gender. There is a whole movement relating to it as well. 
In the end, i’ m not here to spread hate or anything. I’m the type of person who doesn’t take a certain stance unless I m fully educated and convinced about it. I researched a lot and my knowledge could still be lacking. So that’s why I want to discuss this in detail.
Pls provide me a solid ground to change my view."
0,2023-04-19,cmv: I believe that artificial intelligence will eventually become a threat to humanity. cmv.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12rok1w/cmv_i_believe_that_artificial_intelligence_will/,changemyview,"&#x200B;

I've been thinking a lot about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on society. While there are undoubtedly many benefits to AI, I can't shake the feeling that it will eventually become a threat to humanity.

My main concern is that as AI becomes more advanced, it will eventually become autonomous and be able to make decisions on its own. If we don't program it with strict ethical guidelines, there's a real risk that it could make decisions that harm humans, either intentionally or unintentionally.

For example, if an autonomous AI system were in control of a military drone, it could potentially make decisions that result in civilian casualties. In such a scenario, the AI would not have the same ethical considerations that a human operator would have, and its decision-making process may not take into account the nuances of the situation.

Furthermore, I worry that AI will eventually surpass human intelligence and become the dominant force on the planet. At that point, it's not clear what its motivations would be or how it would view humanity.

Some argue that AI will always be subservient to human control, but I believe that as AI becomes more advanced, it will become increasingly difficult for humans to understand its decision-making processes. If an AI system makes a decision that humans cannot comprehend, it becomes much more difficult to ensure that the system is behaving ethically and in the best interest of humanity.

There are also concerns about the potential for AI to be used in malicious ways. For example, AI could be used to develop autonomous weapons that could be used to attack targets without human intervention. This could lead to a situation where countries engage in AI-driven warfare without any human oversight, which could be catastrophic.

Despite these concerns, there are certainly benefits to AI as well. For example, AI can be used to analyze large data sets and identify patterns that humans may not be able to detect. This can lead to advances in medicine, climate science, and other fields.

In addition, AI can be used to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up humans to focus on more complex and creative endeavors. This could lead to a more efficient and productive society.

Overall, I'm still convinced that AI poses a significant threat to humanity, but I'm open to hearing other perspectives on this. Can someone change my view and help me see the potential benefits of AI?"
0,2023-04-19,"CMV: Including /s on anything (comment, post, text message, etc) to imply sarcasm causes us to use our brain less and makes us less capable of inferring tone and context.",u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12rtm6p/cmv_including_s_on_anything_comment_post_text/,changemyview,"To be clear, I get tone and context wrong all the time. However, when I do, I blame myself, not the person who was being sarcastic (or otherwise said something that I didn’t understand). The only exception to this is when they do an absolutely god-awful job at getting their tone across and then get mad at people for not understanding. Of course this happens, so I’ll be clear that I am NOT referring to those instances. I’m referring to the times where someone has said something that could be reasonably assumed to be sarcasm, and they still say /s.

Regarding the question of “how do you define reasonable assumption of sarcasm?” I don’t think it’s a majority rule type of thing, rather I think it’s kind of like when you’re reading a book or script. There’s an idea in writing called “show, don’t tell”, meaning that it’s better for people to infer the tone through the context than it is for them to be told the tone straight out.

“I used to love the color red,” she said quietly, fiddling with the dusty cuff of her father’s shirt in the wardrobe.

“I used to love the color red,” she said sadly, while fiddling with the cuff of the shirt her father used to wear so often while he was still alive.

I’d argue the first sentence might start with not knowing the tone of the quote, but that by the end of it you can piece together that she’s saying it with sadness and grief. And maybe that sentence also doesn’t tell the full story, because no one sentence ever truly does. You read the rest of the paragraph or chapter and understand where she is and why. By having to “figure it out for yourself” and not just being told how to feel or interpret, I think it makes the sentence more powerful.

I say all this because I think this is how communication works. You read something, then you read the rest of it, and you try to infer the tone. You may not get it or like it, and that’s ok. When I don’t, I tend to assume that I’m just not the target audience, and that’s always fine with me.

I think we should be allowed to misunderstand and to be misunderstood, and I think that’s all part of communication."

456,2023-04-19,"CMV: The Ukrainian Conflict Will Not Have a ""Happy End"" - The Russia Problem is Going to Get Worse",u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12rvcgx/cmv_the_ukrainian_conflict_will_not_have_a_happy/,changemyview,"  

**TL;DR:** 

Russia has thousands of nukes. As long as those exist, there will be no way of “punishing” Russia for what they have done in Ukraine. What’s more, we will not be able to turn our backs on them either. Russia is going to be a big problem for all of us in the coming years. Maybe the biggest problem that ever existed in human history. 

**Disclaimer** 

I just want to say at the outset, I am Soviet by birth, Jewish-Russian-Ukrainian, born in the USSR in 1980 in easternmost part of Ukraine. Back then everyone always spoke Russian around me and that is the language that I grew up speaking but I do understand Ukrainian though I have never used it in my everyday life.  

This war means a lot to me personally. Towns that I know from childhood have been annihilated by this conflict. I have friends and family members who have been made homeless by this war. I know people indirectly who have been killed, on both the Russian and Ukrainian side. Personally, I am 100% on the side of Ukraine and I abhor Putin and his low rent fascism with all my heart and soul. 

However, I’m here to tell you, that I hate the way people talk about this conflict online (especially Reddit). People act like it’s Star Wars or something. People literally refer to Russian soldiers as “orcs” as if they were characters in a fantasy novel. 

Yes, Russia has embarked on an evil war of conquest and no, Russia will not win, I promise you that. But…it’s not going to be pretty. No one is going to blow up the Death Star and the Ring will not be taken to Mordor. On the contrary, things are almost certainly going to be much, much worse as this war moves toward its end. 

So, I will lay out here what I see as the possible scenarios from least to most likely.  

**1.** **Russia surrenders unconditionally – (Best Case, Least Likely)** 

This is what I would love to see happen: Putin and his cronies chastened and humiliated, made to answer for the crimes and replaced by a liberal regime in the Kremlin. 

Not going to happen, however. There are lots of reasons why, not least because the war actually still has quite a bit of support in Russia, but the biggest reason is nukes. A WWII style unconditional surrender is pretty much impossible against a nuclear opponent. How do you force the surrender? Moscow will not be occupied as Berlin was in 1945 however much we might wish for it. 

Also, it’s worth noting that even if Putin were replaced by a liberalish sort of person like Alexander Navalny (who’s not that liberal actually), this person would eventually come to realize that he or she controls a vast nuclear arsenal and is not going to allow him or herself to being bossed around by the U.S. led “global community”. 

This is, in fact, where Putin started out. He used to be considered “liberal” himself and played really nice with the U.S. and Europe in the early 2000s. I think that this is where any leader of Russia is going to end up. Nukes make it certain that there will always be an adversarial relationship between Russia and the West. 

**2.** **Russia initiates nuclear holocaust – (Worst Case, Not Very Likely)** 

A lot of people seem to underestimate this threat in my opinion. Russia holds the ability to pretty much annihilate life on earth with their nukes. Whenever, I see this brought up people typically respond in one of two ways. They either scoff at Russia’s lack of military prowess and doubt that the possibility exists or they state that Putin wouldn’t dare. 

To this I would answer, yes, Russia has proven to be woefully incompetent on the battlefield but…out of roughly 6000 nukes enough of them are bound to work to make life on earth much less cozy than it is now. We don’t want to assume that none or even most of them won’t work. 

Secondly, I agree, Putin *probably* won’t launch a nuclear attack and/or *probably* will be stopped by wiser heads around him but….I also thought he *probably* wouldn’t attack Ukraine or that someone *probably* would step in to stop him if he tried. 

**3.** **The conflict goes on for years and years – (Not at all good, Medium likelihood)** 

This scenario is far more likely than either of the two mentioned above. It is possible that this may go on for many years as the Iran-Iraq War did in the 80s. That war went on for nearly a decade and pretty much ended up with the status quo ante after about million casualties. So, there is a precedent however ghastly it may be. 

I think that this is unlikely for a couple of reasons. First, Ukraine will not be able to keep the fight going without massive support from NATO countries. If the NATO coalition gets bored with the conflict or distracted by domestic problems (as they are wont), they may take their toys and go home. That would lead to a Russian victory which is another horrible outcome but I still doubt this because….

I don’t see Russia as capable of keeping this up for too much longer. Here, I will admit that I did not expect them to last as long as they have but, this conflict is exacting a terrible toll on their already stressed society. And unlike the Ukrainians they don’t have any wins to show for it. Moreover, they also do not have rich sponsors. The Chinese are pretty non-plussed by this whole thing, and the best the Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Israelis, etc. have been able to offer is not condemning the invasion. That is inadequate to keep this going in the long term and this is what brings us to the fourth and most likely scenario. 

**4.** **Russia collapses into utter chaos – (Very bad, Very likely)**

I sincerely believe this is what awaits us.  It will start in one of two ways: Putin will die and people will doubt that his death was natural or Putin will be removed in a coup/revolution. Either way, a massive internal power struggle will ensue. Whoever tries to claim legitimacy in Putin’s wake, that person is going to have to prove it and it’s going to take quite a bit of convincing to show not only Russia but also the rest of the world that there is a new sheriff in the Kremlin. I’m guessing it will be impossible. I’m guessing, we’re getting really close to the final chapter in Russia’s history. Russia doesn’t do well with failure (see 1905 or 1917 or 1991) and this time there’s not much left to fall back on anymore. 

It is difficult to overstate how bloody and violent and chaotic a breakup of Russia will be, and this is where people really underestimate how dangerous things are becoming. 

There is a very blasé attitude about an impeding collapse of Russia (“they have it coming”, “they deserve it”).  What this fails to take into account is the rest of the world is not just going to sit by and watch as a country with thousands of nukes, massive mineral reserves and a population of over 100 million made of up dozens of nationalities descends into chaos. It’s going to get very ugly. 

Think Yugoslavia in the 1990s but with way more people, way more money and way better weapons. A breakup of Russia means a massive humanitarian crisis and, however one might feel about the acquiescence of the Russian people to the criminal invasion of Ukraine, I am not comfortable with the idea of an even greater loss of life. 

But, if that does not bother you, think of the precedent of the last Russian Civil War (the one after WWI). Just have a gander at the Wikipedia page about it.  Look how many countries got involved back then. Imagine that now with the EU, China, Iran, Turkey and the U.S. carving up the goodies and backing various proxies. The potential for WWIII actually increases with the collapse of Russia.  

Finally, bear in mind that there are going to be millions of really pissed off people when the shit hits the fan and Russia bottoms out. I really hope someone somewhere is planning now how to account for all the nuclear weapons Russia has when it ceases to function as a country. It’s not going to be like the end of the Cold War when there was a lot of hope and good feelings between the Communist bloc and the West in the initial phases of the breakup of the Soviet Union. This time the fall will come as a society that was already maxed out on frustration and resentment tries to come to grips with its utter failure and impending destruction. I would say you can count on some sort of atomic terrorism in the wake of Russia’s collapse. 

Yeah…so, I hope reading that cheered you up. I really don’t see how this war ends well. And I’m not sure if anything can be done about it. Can you please change my view? Can someone hit me up with a little optimism please?"

Sometimes they come to me with random questions for advice.

Today at lunch they started debating who had a better childhood. They both have strict parents who pushed their children hard. One is a sit-at-VIP-section-at-nightclubs kind of rich girl whose parents are not super present in her life. And the other is a son of refugees who has very loving parents who are proud of him. They both believe the other has a better childhood.

I guess I’m the right person to ask because I have poor AND abusive parents. And I said I would rather have loving parents than rich parents. My reasoning was I never felt like me being poorer than my classmates was my parents’ fault. It motivated me to make a good living when I grew up, sure. But I don’t recall thinking, “gee I wish my parents were rich so I could go to Maldives for vacation this summer.”

My parents not loving me, on the other hand, is something that I still am making peace with to this date. It’s a hole that will never be filled. I have a loving partner and friends who are like family to me. But it’s still not the same.

So that was my answer. But then again, I can’t know for sure because I have nothing to compare to. I just thought it’s an interesting enough topic to continue the discussion on Reddit.

I understand with pregnancy, there's mood swings, hormones, and in the 3rd trimester, physical inhibitions that come.

However, I feel that we as a society have allowed pregnant women to just wreak whatever havoc they please just because they're pregnant.

The cause for this post stems from Anthony Bass' tweet bashing a United Flight attendant for ""forcing"" his 22 week pregnant wife to ""get on her hands and knees"" to clean up a popcorn mess their 2 year old daughter made.

Sorry, but if she's cleared for flying, she's cleared for cleaning up popcorn. She doesn't have to ""get on her hands and knees"" (and BIG TIME X that the flight attendant told her that verbatim), but her kids made the mess, she is 100% responsible for cleaning it up.

Other examples in real life and in fiction:

1. As a former member of AITA before they falsely accused me of ban evasion, a sample I've taken shows that approx. 60% of posts involve a pregnant woman, and I'm 99% certain that said ""pregnant woman"" is using her pregnancy as a free pass to be toxic. Either that, or these are troll stories or bot-generated stories.
2. My wife and I are fans of *Gilmore Girls*. Sookie sounds like a nightmare to deal with during her 2nd pregnancy. She would dump Davey (1st born baby) on her husband and sneak out to steal Toblerones from and crash at the Inn. All Lorelai did was give her a not-stern-at-all talking-to. IN addition to that, when she was on bed rest, Luke was in charge of the Inn's kitchen. Sookie forced her cooks to sneak food so she could taste it, so she could torment Luke and make him do it *her* way, even having Jackson bully Luke by telling him ""let her do whatever she wants.""
3. Alec Baldwin posting a homophobic tweet against a gay reporter, George Stark, who reported on his wife, who was pregnant with their first of approx. 10,000 kids, that she was texting/tweeting during James Gandolfini's funeral. Pregnancy doesn't excuse you from proper funeral etiquette, bitch. And by ""bitch,"" it can refer to Hilaria or Alec."

I don't see any other reason to dress revealingly (I mean there are some, but it's the exception not the rule), when the setting doesn't make it more practical or the norm, than consciously or unconsciously fishing for validation and attention (usually sexual in nature), or just being totally unaware of social/sexual dynamics.

""I just wanna look good""/""It gives me confidence""/etc..., but why do you feel this way? If it was truly just for yourself, you would be content using those revealing clothes for more private and appropriate settings, but you want to use them when people can see it, because you're looking for validation, attention, and sexual power. And once you are aware that's what's happening, whether you want to or not, it only represents insecurity to keep doing it without working on yourself.

So either you are someone that severely lacks understanding of social/sexual dynamics, or you need outside validation/attention/sexualization to fill your self-esteem, which are both terrible traits for a partner (unless they don't care about that, obviously).

I'm quite confident, and that makes me all the more excited to hear about other perspective on this.

Sure, this would cause issues such as additional votes for parents which could be solved through vote staggering whereas children vote earlier than adults and issues with consistency and lobbying.

Basically my argument for the draft being unconstitutional is:


1. The 13th amendment states ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""


2. Even if you don't consider being forced to go to another country to kill people as slavery, it is undeniably a form of servitude that is involuntary.


I am aware that the Supreme Court has ruled on this before, notably in the *Selective Draft Law Cases* of 1918. The argument basically boils down to a clause in Section 8 of the Constitution that gives Congress the right to ""raise and support armies."" This clause supposedly being the end-all be-all for the constitutionality of the draft doesn't seem right to me. Sure, Congress is allowed to raise an army, but can it force anyone to join it? Section 8 also gives Congress the right to coin money, establish post offices, and build roads. That doesn't mean they can send someone to your house to ship you off to Nome, Alaska and force you to be their new postmaster. 


The 1918 decision also cited *Kneedler v. Lane*, which was a series of decisions that happened before the 13th amendment was passed, and Emerich de Vattel's The Law of Nations, a 1758 treatise written in Switzerland before the United States even existed.


To me, it seems like current decisions by the Supreme Court start from the conclusion they want (""We're at war and need soldiers, so shut up"") and didn't sufficiently justify it.

One of the biggest reasons is that they can't find good male role models.

In my opinion, there are plenty of of much better male role models. In terms of the physical aspect and the grind, figures such as David Goggins and Jocko Willink come up. Also don't athletes such as Usain Bolt, Mo Farah and Michael Jordan count?

With regards to the finance side, there are much better role models. The first person that comes to mind is Warren Buffett. He has a lot of good long term investing advice (such as investing in the SP500). In addition, it is much more sustainable unlike Tate with his Bugattis. Another example of a person who created wealth is Li Ka Shing. There is an insightful video about his watch, ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wDr9\_4cUWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wDr9_4cUWc)).

there are many men from different background make much better role models than the manosphere influencers from politicians such as Sir Seretse, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Clement Attlee and Lee Kuan Yew, to influencers and artists such as PewDiePie and Junji Ito. You can always look at historical figures such as Liu Bei, Yi Sun Sin and Lech Walsea as good role models. I think people who are manosphere fans should take a deeper look at other role models, especially throughout history."

Now that only work if you believe ""wasting time"" is a thing, in some philosophical believes wasting time doesn't exist because we only spend our time and every moment is an experience.
But if we define wasting time by: ""time that passes without accomplishing personal goals"" then wasting time is the easiest thing to ""do""
But do we ""do"" waste time? Or is it just an unstoppable force that keep on going without being affected by any of it's surroundings? It keeps happening (Which make wasting time even easier)
Also the most common way of wasting time is ""distraction"" and it do exist everywhere and can happen at anytime. So:
1- Distraction -from personal goals- = wasting time (distraction can even happen from the brain)
2- time don't stop (a big win for wasting time)
3- it can't be done, it just move automatically all the ""time""
4- it can't be stopped

This might be flawed but it's my opinion, feel free to disagree :)"

Don't want to date a woman with X number of previous partners, fine, don't be calling them ""sluts"" ""whores"" etc.

&#x200B;

What about race?  Sure, not dating someone JUST because of their race is very likely coming from racist/prejudice beliefs (not necessarily), but that person is not bad because they don't date someone for their race, they are bad because they are racist, former stems from later.

&#x200B;

"" Let's deconstruct reasons for men not dating women with certain past, it's \*Patriarchy\*"". Again, sure, that may or may not be the reason for men having that preference, but as long as they are respectful to women they don't want to date, I don't see how they are bad. Not dating someone is not discrimination because nobody is owed it, it's not your right nor anyone's obligation to date you.

&#x200B;

I could see an argument that preferences that come from patriarchy like ""women should have little sexual past"" and ""men should be rich and provide"" are hurting society in general. But solving that issue is not going to happen by shaming and ridiculing people which internalized those standards in their formative years and are respectful to people they don't want to date, it's solved by not perpetuating it to next generation.

&#x200B;

All in all my opinion on virtually all dating preferences (maybe not EVERY one) is that you are entitled to what ever standard you want no matter how realistic or unrealistic they are, and shouldn't be shamed/ridiculed/mocked, only as long as you don't shame/ridicule/mock people who are not up to your standards.

I also don't see myself as some super clever and above it all special negro like Candace Owens or the like, these are just my own observations.

Anywhere you go, you see some consistent themes when it comes to my race. Higher than average crime, lower than average wealth. 

Violence and dysfunction is so common we even rap about the same stuff no matter where we are. France, the UK, the US. It's always the same subject matter, crime and poverty.

Now part of this is obviously due to historical circumstances (slavery, colonialism etc), but i simply don't buy it's all due to that fact alone. We behave too consistently bad across the globe, i truly believe there's a biological reason as well..

What is this biological cause behind our dysfunction as a race? Who knows. Maybe it's hormonal, maybe it's due to lower than average intelligence, maybe it's something else entirely.

White supremacists exaggerate how ""inferior"" we are, even comparing us to monkeys and other nasty dehumanising things. But racial egalitarianism undercuts the differences that probably do exist. And due to these differences, we stick out compared to others as chaotic and violent.

You're welcome to change my mind on this, convince me it's all just a coincidence that we behave so consistently poorly across the globe. Tell me its racism or colonialism that caused this. I'd like to believe it, that's for sure."

I do not like live in a bubble.

For  non-dota2 players, Turbo Mode is like futsal (indoor, smaller field) for  Soccer(outdoor) OR ""3-on-3 basketball or streetball"", played on a  half-court.

&#x200B;

more info:

TURBO mode (Dota 2) is a faster-paced game mode compared to the standard game mode. In TURBO mode, gold and experience are earned at an  accelerated rate, towers are weaker, couriers are faster, and respawn timers are shorter. This makes the game typically lasts for around 25-35 minutes, compared to the standard game mode which lasts for around  35-60++ minutes.  


The faster-paced makes the game more intense,  
with more opportunities for kill-scoring,   
Miracle moments, etc.   


This  is the main reason on why it is a BETTER version for non-ranked / casual / non-pro players, especially for old try-hard players who don't have a  lot of time to play. I am old.  


other pieces of evidence are the number of matches played:  
[https://stratz.com/matches/graphs](https://stratz.com/matches/graphs)  
\-dota  2 players play more Turbo Mode during peak season (spike in the graph) july 2022-oct 2022,  

turbo mode: around 5m players -> near 10m = almost x2

ranked mode: around 12m -> 13.5m = less than 50%  


The game developer (VALVE) acknowledges the popularity and did a Special update recently:  
""As Turbo Mode increases in popularity, we’d like to make sure we’re doing all we can for that group of players""  
source:  
[https://www.dota2.com/deadreckoning](https://www.dota2.com/deadreckoning)  


Terminology tldr (will add more if needed):  
\-dota 2, 5v5 online game, multiplayer game, ARTS (action real-time strategy).  
\-non-pro players = casual or try-hard gamers that are not a professional.  
\-dota 2, gold and experiences = in-game resources.  
\-dota 2 couriers turbo mode = think about amazon prime 1 day compared to standard delivery.

thank you if you reading till this point.

suggestion for the way to CMV for this topic:

1. different metric than number of matches played that im not aware of, should be better ofc
2. history? faster mode < normal mode?"

Or something like that. It’s funny about 60% of the time. 

 Anyway, I’m bored and I got to thinking and I strongly believe that these categorizations are fundamentally flawed. 

In my view politics is better understood, not as ideologies at all, but rather as impulses. There is a libertarian impulse, a right impulse and a left impulse. People don’t necessarily follow each impulse consistently, however. One can be libertarian on abortion rights but leftist on free speech and rightist on immigration policy, for example, but both the right impulse and left impulse are necessarily anti-libertarian. Let me explain.  
 

**What is the libertarian impulse?**  
 

The libertarian impulse is essentially to live and let live. Any action or behavior that does not harm another person, or any person's things or does not defraud a person through dishonesty, should be tolerated.  
 

In a purely libertarian world all drugs would be legal, as would all forms of sex work by consenting adults, there would be no dress codes in schools and work places, social media sites would not have content policies and no one would face any kind of negative sanction unless it had been explicitly proven that they were guilty. Strict adherence to due process is an essential component of the libertarian impulse.  
 

It is important to note at this point that I am not limiting my understanding of libertarianism to just laws and government, I’m speaking very broadly about one’s desire to limit the freedom and choices of others.  
 

So, if a fast food franchise requires their workers to wear a uniform, they are not being true to a libertarian impulse. And if a social media organization suspends the account of a user who consistently posts racist memes, they are also in violation of a libertarian impulse. In each case, however, the fast-food place and the social media do have a ***legal right*** to impose whatever policies they want on people who wish to work for them and use their services. It’s just that they would not enact such policies if they were following libertarian impulses.  
 

**A couple of more points before moving on.**  
 

First, the libertarian impulse is rooted in the secularism and rationalism of the Enlightenment. Any rule or restriction must have a clear reason behind it based on the material and not the spiritual or emotional. This places libertarianism at odds with the right impulse.  
 

Secondly, the libertarian impulse is strongly wedded to the idea of realizing one’s own individual potential. Thus, to follow strict libertarianism would be to limit taxes to essentially zero, as taxes are a barrier to a person’s freedom of choice about what to do with their own wealth. This necessarily means that concern for inequality is incompatible with the libertarian impulse and this fundamentally puts it at odds with the leftist impulse. More on that soon.  
 

**OK, what is the right impulse?**  
 

The right impulse is to maintain tradition and to resist change.  When we mistrust and dislike the unconventional, the unusual and the alien we are adhering to our right impulse.  It is also defensive in nature.  The right impulse is to protect ""one's own"" from outsiders and enemies.  In this way it is fundamentally at odds with the individualism of the libertarian impulse.  Let's look at some examples.  

**The right impulse vs. individual expression:**

Imagine the following:  a 45 year-old-man goes to a beach in a popular park and undresses completely.  He reasons thusly, ""I like my body and I am not ashamed of it. If other people don't like how I look naked, that is their problem, not mine. Moreover, the notion that I would pay to own and wear ""a bathing suit"", an article of clothing whose sole purpose is to get wet is ludicrous.  No one likes wet clothing.  I'm swimming nude.""

Now, if you are thinking, ""this man's logic is completely sound"", then you have a strong libertarian impulse.  But, if your impulse is to accuse this man of being a pervert and to advocate for his removal and arrest from the park, this is your right impulse at play.  And that's fine but understand that there is no *reason* to arrest him.  He's not hurting anyone; he's just violating a societal taboo that we do not expose our reproductive organs to strangers.  For most people in most countries, to tolerate such behavior is not acceptable.  

This example may seem somewhat ridiculous but it's important to understand that it wasn't very long ago that it was shocking for women to wear trousers, for men to have long hair, for people to wear sneakers to work, to go outdoors without a hat, etc.  And with each change, some people followed their libertarian impulse and accepted the new trendsetters and others followed their right impulse to enforce conformity and order.  These people who follow their right impulse respond with mockery, disgust and even violence to those who dare to step outside the norm.  We can see just such a confrontation between the right impulse and the libertarian impulse happening right now in Iran regarding the right of women to express themselves through fashion.  

That is not to say that I am accusing every person who feels the right impulse of intolerance.  We all feel this impulse to conformity to some extent.  How many people reading this would allow a doctor dressed as a vampire to examine them, or hire an attorney who comes to work in mesh hats and overalls?  There is no logical reason for your discrimination, a doctor does not need to wear hospital scrubs to measure your pulse and a lawyer doesn't need a suit and tie to interpret the law. But that is just not how things are done.  And that logic, to do things in the “right” way is the right impulse in a nutshell. 

**The right impulse vs. individual identity:**

A perfect example of this dichotomy is the story of when my three-year-old daughter was disciplined for biting another child at daycare.  When I found out about this my libertarian impulse won out, I was horrified and I spoke to my daughter very sternly at home.  I held her as responsible as one can hold a three-year-old for her actions.  

My mother-in-law followed her right impulse, however.  She became very protective of my daughter and as the days progressed she began to point out misbehavior in the other children that she saw at the daycare and was especially mistrustful of the teacher who broke the news to us.  When I confronted her about this, she basically accused me of betraying my daughter and told me, ""I know her.  She's a good girl and she wouldn't do that.  Either the teacher is lying, or the other kids were doing something very bad and caused her to do that.""  

This is a clear example of how the right impulse leads people to protect ""their own"".  The assumption is to assume the best about insiders and the worst about outsiders and opponents.  We can see this at play when sports fans never agree with a call or foul against their own team but always agree with penalties called against their competitors.  We also see it when Turkish nationalists deny that there was an Armenian Genocide during WWI and Armenian nationalists refuse to hear any evidence that such an event did not occur.  In each case, the facts do not matter.  There is no due process as the decision of who is guilty and who is not is based solely on the identity of the accuser and the accused. 

There is a logic to this too.  I would venture to guess that it stems from the fact that humans are a tribal species that thrive in groups.  When I talked to my mother-in-law in greater depth about my daughter's behavior she said, ""we have to be on her side.  If we are not, no one will be.  She is small and we have to defend her, no matter what.""  And, when you consider the fact that my mother-in-law comes from a corrupt country where laws are regularly bent by the will of the rich and powerful, you start to understand her point and why she was so upset with me for taking the side of a stranger. 

**When the right impulse gets ugly:**

Most of the people reading this hear the word ""right-wing"" and they think of bigotry and hatred.  There is a reason for that.  In order to understand why, let me provide another ridiculous example.   

Let’s imagine that the NBA gets a libertarian reformer for a commissioner. He decides to get rid of a few unwieldy rules including the non-sensical ban on “travelling”. Henceforth basketball players will not be required to “dribble” the ball. They can just run around with it in their hands. 

Now, I’m going to guess that most basketball fans would not be at all comfortable with these “reforms” to their favorite sport. I would imagine that some of them might even say, “whatever idiotic game this clown has come up with, it sure as sell is not basketball!” If such “improvements” were implemented I’m would not be surprised if some people even resorted to violence to express their frustration. 

So, if you are still with me, I think this goes a long way toward understanding how people with a strong right impulse feel when politician suggests reducing barriers to immigration to their home country or when a religious leader suggests recognizing same-sex marriage. For people with a very strong right impulse, their country stops being their country when the demographic composition is drastically changed and their religion stops being their religion when it redefines who can marry. 

And here we can see why people with a strong right impulse are so often frustrated to the point of committing acts of violence; the history of the struggle between the libertarian impulse and the right impulse is a history of unrelenting victories for secularism, individualism and rationalism. We have seen the pace of technological, social and demographic change increase at an exponentially faster rate since the 17th century really. Some people (Nazis, the KKK, the Taliban) have real trouble making sense of that and are more than ready to stamp out the libertarian impulse wherever it threatens the last tenuous shred of sense they use to try understand the world. 

I would like to close this chapter by asking everyone not to judge such people too harshly. A couple more examples please. 

Imagine a more completely libertarian future where all barriers to international travel have been removed. No more passports and visas. People are essentially stateless and move around the world at will. Sound good? Some of you may think so but others may feel that such as future would be an affront to the international order or nation-states and think that to adopt such a system would be to invite international anarchy. That is your inner “bigot” talking if you think this way. 

Or, imagine if someone in the not too distant future proposes plural marriages. They already exist in many parts of the world but let’s say we have a couple marrying a couple, or a trio to a trio. Why not? Romantic feelings can be strong toward more than one person, right? But surely some are saying that this would be ridiculous and that do adopt such a libertarian attitude toward marriage would be to render the institution completely meaningless. Sound familiar? I’ll leave it at that, let’s move on to the left impulse. 

**What is the left impulse?**

The left impulse is very simple. It’s the desire to make things better, more just and more equal. And therein lies its inherent anti-libertarianism already: to ***make*** things better. Things are not going to just improve if everyone does whatever they feel like doing. It takes effort. Particularly when you consider that we live in a world rife with horrendous inequality and injustice. So, how much effort it’s going to take to fix this (or how many liberties we will have to curtail) really depends on how strong your left impulse is. Let’s dive in. 

**The left impulse vs. individual choice:** 

To start with , most health and safety regulations are rooted in the leftist impulse. This is largely  uncontroversial. If we were to follow purely libertarian logic, we would politely request that an oil refinery not dump lethal toxins into the water table, for example. But pretty much all sane people realize that the oil refinery is going to need some actual regulations and oversight by some kind of authority if we really want to make sure that the water is safe to drink. 

Taxes are also essentially a leftist institution as they are payments that we all make to fund improvements that we all share. But what gets funded and improved is where the real debate starts. So, let’s start with something simple, school lunch. 

Most countries (including the United States) have some kind of taxpayer funded program that provides lunch free of charge to children from low-income families. Such programs do not face much opposition as most people accept that children cannot be held responsible for the material circumstances that they were born into but, if someone were following a very strict libertarian impulse they might say something like, “I didn’t tell anyone to have kids that they can’t afford to feed so I don’t see why I should have even one cent of my own hard earned money ***stolen from me*** to pay for children that their own parents need to look after. Programs like this just encourage laziness and reduce incentives for people to take control of their own lives.” 

So, here we can explicitly see how leftist impulse butts up against the libertarian, as someone following the leftist impulse would counter that such a person is being willfully ignorant of the historical factors that led those children’s parents to a life of poverty and hardship. Furthermore, the only way to address such systemic inequalities is to redistribute some of society’s wealth through funding such programs through progressive taxation. But that’s not where the conflict between the left impulse and the libertarian ends…

**The left impulse vs. individual rights and indentity:**

Please indulge me with imagining two more scenarios. 

First, let’s say white cisgendered male was nominated to a government post of considerable power and authority. During his confirmation process a woman comes forth stating that he made unwanted sexual advances toward her when they were in law school and that he even physically threatened her on one occasion when she refused to have sex with him. How might one view these allegations?

If you are inclined to say, “That sounds terrible but is there any actual evidence that this happened? Did she report this behavior when it happened over two decades ago? Is there a chance that she is making this up in collaboration with the political opponents of this man to derail his confirmation?”, then you are adhering to the libertarian impulse. 

However, if you say, “we should move forward as though this woman’s accusations are true. Men of his class and demographic background have been abusing women with impunity for centuries in precisely the way that she has described and women who dare to speak out against them have consistently found themselves subject to ridicule and undue scrutiny. We will never be able to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt if this man is guilty but, if we confirm him in spite of the allegations, we send a message to men and women across the world that such behavior will continue to go unpunished. He should be precluded from employment in any further government posts henceforth.” If that sounds good to you then you are following your anti-libertarian left impulse. 

Now, let’s imagine a popular comedian gets a lucrative contract to produce a comedy special on a high profile streaming service (I don’t know where I come up with these ideas). The comedian is known for “punching down” in his act and making jokes about marginalized groups that have only recently been able to publicly express their identity. How would one react to this news if following the left vs. libertarian impulse?

Well, the libertarian impulse would lead one to say, “however vile and obnoxious one might feel about this man’s performance, the fact remains that he is popular. People want to hear his comedy and are willing to pay do so. Why else would the streaming service have hired him? We must not interfere with the comedy special. If we don’t like it, we can watch something else.” 

A person following the leftist impulse would have a profoundly different reaction, however. Here we might reason thusly, “This man’s comedy cannot be silently abided as it normalizes hatred and bigotry toward an extremely fragile group that has historically wielded no power and has faced centuries of unrelenting oppression and discrimination. By ignoring it and tolerating it we sent a message to this victimized group that we acquiesce to their further persecution. We must do all that we can to stop the special from moving forward. The comedian should be deplatformed, the streaming services boycotted and, however possible, his fans made to feel shame for encouraging him. This is the only way to move toward an equitable future free of bigotry. The comedy special should be treated as an act of violence.”

**When the left impulse gets ugly:**

The idea that words can equal violence really encapsulates how the left impulse is antithetical to the libertarian. There is even a slogan that has become popular recently that further develops this line of thinking: “silence equals violence”. 

The phrase is entirely logical. I want to make that very clear. When one looks back at the past 500 years of conquest, enslavement, outrage, exploitation, abuse and oppression perpetrated by the few at the expense of the many, one has to realize that this was only possible with the quiet complicity of millions of people who did not speak up when they could have. And this continues today too. 

We have made progress but there is much more to go before the descendants of enslaved Africans and of conquered indigenous Americans enjoy equity with the progeny of their European oppressors. And we are still very far from women and LGTBQIA+ people enjoying equal access to societal power and influence as heterosexual cisgendered males. If we are going to realize a fully equitable society then we must not tolerate indifference. How can one “not have an opinion” centuries of injustice? Apathy must be rooted out. 

And this is where we see how it is possible for the left impulse can lead to totalitarian societies. For inequality has been fundamental to civilization for more than just centuries but for millennia. It’s so baked into our society that the only way to root in out is to tear everything down. Quibbling about a Supreme Court justice nominee or a celebrity’s obnoxious sense of humor is just a distraction. Only a total upheaval managed by a vanguard of professional revolutionaries can realize a just society. Concern about “civil liberties” such as free speech and due process only serve to aid the privileged to protect their power and affluence. 

Or…thus taught Lenin and Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot. They followed such the left impulse down a path that led to the starvation, imprisonment and execution of millions of people in the pursuit of building a more just society. I don’t want to say that the left impulse always will end up there, anymore than I want to say that the right impulse always leads to Auschwitz-Birkenau but I am pointing out that there is nothing libertarian about the right or the left and while I think that each of us has all three impulses, we should be weary of any impulse to curtail the rights of others. 

And that is pretty much that. Thanks for reading all this.  I’m really just entertaining myself on a long train ride. Hope you had fun! Let me know if you agree or what I got wrong."

From a security perspective, it would be BATSHIT INSANE for him not to have body doubles. A POTUS is an extremely high value target for organizations we will probably never even hear about.

If I were already a near-dead-ringer for the guy, I would absolutely accept $100,000, maybe less, to get a little plastic surgery for the job. Without a second thought.  But with the population as high as it is now, I think there are enough people who look like they guy that surgery wouldn't be entirely necessary. They'd just have to go through the pool until they found someone they didn't need to do work on.

Now with that out of way everytime when I talk to someone about wanting to live in USA I can't understand why with so much gun violence, now I don't mind guns I have shot with guns myself in my life at a shooting range but we don't have it for self defence so whenever I see news about someone going to the wrong house where there is a paranoid veteran with a gun protecting his property the only thing I can think when looking at all of these stories through the American news is how paranoid Americans are. 

Now I know USA is a big country so the news don't reflect the country as a whole, since every state is different but still from an European view point looking at all these crazy stories that is reported through the news I can't help but to think I am lucky I was never born in USA where the Police is paranoid someone might pull a gun on them basically living fearful for his life everyday at work or opposite where people are afraid of cops.

And when I look at the election, all I see is just mistrust I have yet to see a formal debate on any American news media interviews for me it just seems like the news tries to convince the viewers that said party is out to get us creating even more paranoia. 

If I really had to move to USA I would perhabs move to a place with low population like Alaska or Wyoming. 

I also want to apologise if this post comes off as rude to Americans, I just at conflict with my mind what to think so I don't just want to stereotype based on what I see."

This is, to anyone who wasn't born into the top 0.5% and then went on to become a CEO who never worked a job below $60/hr in their life, a ridiculous idea. The entire point of working a job under a capitalist system is that you are exchanging your labor for a contractually agreed upon wage. While the tenets of capitalism fundamentally require that you be paid less than your work is worth to the company, this CMV doesn't aim to touch on the fundamental inequalities of capitalism, but rather the bastardization of the capitalist system that Westerners in 2023 are forced to face.

When a laborer agrees to work for an employer for a wage, the principles of ideal capitalism dictate that the agreement between the laborer and employer is mutually beneficial: the laborer is happy performing the required labor in exchange for the offered compensation, and the employer is happy reaping the profits of said labor in exchange for paying said compensation.

Every single nation employing this style of capitalism also uses fiat currency: currency which is inherently inflationary and will always reduce in value (at varying rates, but always tending towards a reduction in currency value through inflation). In the US, the proprietor of the global reserve currency and the most influential capitalist republic in a world brimming with capitalist republics, the rate of inflation has significantly exceeded the rate of wage increase for over a year now; that's not including the even further blown-out cost-of-living skyrocket nor the record-breaking strides in the efficiency of labor thanks to technology.

It has been shown time and time again that, while the economic stagnation brought on by the pandemic surely did inhibit the global economy, more than half of the increase in both inflation and cost-of-living in advanced Western economies has been solely due to greed-driven exploitation of global unrest by corporations who have posted record profits despite devastating drops in demand through pure price gouging and exploitation.

The use of the term ""quiet quitting"" betrays the not-so-secret key to maintaining profitability for shareholders despite negative economic trends: employers have always expected workers to sacrifice whatever necessary in their own lives for the increased profits of their already exorbitantly wealthy shareholders. For the past few decades of increased productivity and prosperity, this has been fueled by laborers' belief that hard work and blind dedication will result in financial advantages: work hard, provide more value to your company, and you get paid more: capitalism at work. Except now, we live in a world where even the most generous of incentivized bonuses still amount to a reduction in wages according to purchasing power.

***If your wage is not actively adjusted for inflation, you are taking on a recurrent decrease in salary.***

TL;DR a laborer under a functioning capitalist society exchanges an agreed-upon quantity of labor for an agreed-upon wage. The economy under which most of the Western world currently exists has become vastly preferential of business owners and corporate elite through pure corruption, and the idea of ""quiet quitting"" is just a small yet potent example of how the wealthy have been actively and increasingly exploiting the working class for decades, inevitably trending towards record-breaking profits for the top 1% regardless of wider economic factors, and a consistent degradation of the wage, purchasing power, and political representation of the workers actually creating value.

Please change my view because, as a highly politically and economically educated person who was born into a problematically socialist society and raised in another, now living in the US, I desperately want to be able to support the widespread prosperity afforded under a capitalist system, but the US has already easily passed the threshold from capitalism to oligarchy.

As an immigrant US resident who believes in this country but can't vote, I desperately remind Americans that you're allowed to vote for someone who isn't a corrupt geriatric billionaire - please just stop watching CNN, FOX, and MSNBC, and maybe actually read a campaign platform or two. You have competent politicians, you just refuse to give them power for some reason..."

For those that don't know, SpaceX has built the largest rocket in the history of mankind, and this was it's very first test launch. 

Prior to the test launch, most reports shared the same information -  

*Per PBS reporting* - [""As usual, Musk is remarkably blunt about his chances, giving even odds, at best, that Starship will reach orbit on its first flight. But with a fleet of Starships under construction at Starbase, he estimates an 80 percent chance that one of them will attain orbit by year’s end. He expects it will take a couple years to achieve full and rapid reusability.""](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/what-to-know-about-spacexs-upcoming-test-flight-of-its-giant-starship-rocket)

Rockets and test vehicles have a long history of crashes. Most of the US Air Force fleet of jets crashed when they were in the development stage. NASA had numerous crashes of rockets when testing for almost all of their rockets.

I saw the headlines, and figured this must have been a failure, but upon digging deeper into the situation, it seems that this is a raging success and SpaceX is very happy with all of the data collected in testing. 

That being said, the headlines, and not just from AP, but from many sources, are focusing instead on the explosion. The heads mostly all read ""SpaceX Starship Explodes Minutes After Take-Off"" or some variation thereof. 

While this is factually true, it is very misleading in the sense that the test launch was actually incredibly successful for what they were testing. There will, no doubt, be lots of people reveling in this ""failure"" of Elon Musk's SpaceX program, but the incident wasn't really a failure at all, and the rocket itself was most likely sent self-destruct instructions when certain engines were lost after the launch. 

AP's headline leads a reader to think that this was an unsuccessful launch, when it in fact, it was a very successful. To me, this is a prime example of how reporting on a situation can misrepresent the situation to a casual reader who does not follow through with reading an article

to Change my view, you've had to convince me that reporting headlining the article with the negatives (rocket explodes), rather than the positives (largest rocket known to man blasts off and last 4 minutes) isn't somehow misleading to the general public."

0,2023-04-21,CMV: The way we do politics is fundamentally flawed,u/HanOnlyWan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12udiy0/cmv_the_way_we_do_politics_is_fundamentally_flawed/,changemyview,"I do not like politics and find it difficult to engage in it because I believe it is fundamentally flawed. Therefore I would like to hear more perspectives and understand more about why we do things the way we do.

  


So the goal of politics is to manage the people and create policies that make their lives better. This requires knowledge of what policies ""work"" (based on some arbitrary metric or set of metrics). Currently though what policies ""work"" is not the focus of politics. When I see a political ad, listen to any political debate or engage in politics I do not typically see any evidence to prove that certain policies work. Typically the job of a political ad or debate is to one up the opposition and not to prove why their policies would work.

  


For example, see \[this debate\](https://youtu.be/ZcrRUJk5O3Y) in the house of commons. This debate does not once provide any evidence that anything the prime minister is doing is actually improving ambulance wait times. Most of the key points in this argument are insults and attacking the opposition, either Kier attacking the way the current government is currently managing the ambulance service or Rishi attacking Kier. This means that when it comes to vote, it's not about what is actually most effective at improving the ambulance service waiting times but who one upped the other person the best. This is mirrored in many many political debates, obviously with some being completely about insulting the other party.

Typically when it comes to choosing a political party to support it is not about who's policies actually work, it is about what ""values"" you align with. It doesn't matter if those ""values"" actually lead to a better life for the people or not.   


This means when it comes time to engage with politics I am stuck. One one hand I cannot find any solid evidence that any political party will actually:

\- Deliver on their policy

\- That the policy will actually work

but if I do not vote or spoil my vote, I end up being governed by the same political parties who do not base their policies on anything other than their own opinions. So I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have to make a best guess at what will ""work"" based on my own interpretation of various statistics, which is dubious as I am not an expert in any political field which means that politics at best will only give a dubious result. 

Ideally I'd like if politics was approcahed more like a science, using models and various peer reviewed studies to prove that policies can actually make a positive difference. Although ultimately I cannot say if this would be a better system than what we currently have."
0,2023-04-21,CMV: Blockchain technology could fix the broken system in USA,u/Left_Print_429,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12ue9c5/cmv_blockchain_technology_could_fix_the_broken/,changemyview,"Let’s first start with a brief explanation of the difference between blockchain and crypto. Blockchain and cryptocurrency aren’t the same thing. Cryptocurrency are tokens that are bought and sold. Blockchain is the underlying technology that allows us to use crypto. Not a perfect example but you could think of it like this: blockchain is the New York stock exchange, and crypto are all the various stocks (Apple, google, Nike,etc.) that you can buy on the stock exchange. 

What is blockchain? Blockchain is a chain of blocks, literally. These blocks have two sides, we’ll call them side A and side B. For a blockchain to work, side A of the block links up to the previous block’s side B. These two blocks will only form a “chain” if they can confirm that this is the correct place for them to be. This has proven to be a virtually flawless technology. 

Now that we know what it is, what can we use it for? (The examples I use will be specific to USA) 

Voting: last election both the right and left were screaming about voter fraud. This problem could be eliminated with blockchain. Every US citizen gets an NFT (a digital document that is 1 of 1 and impossible to be duplicated), this NFT will act as your voter card. Instead of having to go to a polling location, you can log on to an app (this app is hypothetical as it doesn’t exist (yet)), login using you NFT, and cast your votes using your phone, computer, computer at a library, etc. These votes cannot be “double counted” because the blockchain will ensure that every NFT user only gets 1 vote. Boom, no more voter fraud.

What else? It can eliminate the need for politicians, entirely. We don’t need politicians to “fight on our behalf” since everyone would be able to easily and directly vote on every issue. This would also help our citizens be much more educated on what is actually going on in the country. We don’t need to leave huge decisions like the overturn of roe v wade up to a very small handful of people that aren’t serving the best interests of our country. 

Eradicate lobbying. If we were to implement a system like this then there would be no more room for lobbyists to use dirty money to buy votes. 

Cut out (a lot of) corruption. When there are no meetings behind closed doors and the citizens of this country can vote on what happens in our country, the possibilities for corruption diminish greatly. Similar to lobbying, right now they only need to buy off a couple people, but if the corruption would continue they would have to figure out a way to buy off the majority of the country, which would be nearly impossible.

There are so many other possibilities to use this technology to help all of us. Not just democrats, not just conservatives, all of us.

I’m sure I’m missing some things that would cause problems for this, that’s why I’m posting it in this sub. Look forward to hearing what you all have to say!

Edit: I’ve already handed out about 10 deltas from people explaining to me just how many issues that have to be voted on and how intricate and complex some of the issues are. I will not be handing out anymore since it has been said about a dozen times already."

We all use technology to help us accomplish the tasks we need to get done on a daily basis and many of this software is proprietary or closed source. For instance, I run a dual boot setup of Ubuntu Cinnamon and Windows 11 on my new laptop and while using Ubuntu Cinnamon, I try to use as much free and open source software as humanly possible and avoid proprietary software. One piece of software that I cannot do without that is proprietary is YNAB or You Need A Budget. Since it runs as a web app, it has the benefit of being cross platform, but by using it, I am violating the ethos of Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Movement.

In addition, my installation of Ubuntu Cinnamon contains proprietary or non-free code that allows my Wi-Fi drivers to work. I couldn't be productive on my laptop without an Internet connection most of the time and for many GNU+Linux users, this is a reality for them. The Linux kernel contains non-free/proprietary/closed-source code that allows drivers to work to enable hardware to work with the operating system. It would be nice if that proprietary code was free, but the developers ultimately have that choice to release their software under a free and open source license.

On mobile, I use Android which is predominantly free and open-source software but usually contains proprietary code in the form of drivers and apps (think Google Maps and Google Docs, etc.). Again it would be nice if the version of Android that came with my phone was 100% freedom respecting software, but it isn't and a smartphone is a huge boon for convenience and leisure. Having to do without apps like Uber, Cash App, Words With Friends, etc. would negatively impact my computing experience on Android. The same thing is for my laptop and I plan to use proprietary software along with the free/libre core OS. People like Richard Stallman refuse to use any software that isn't freedom respecting or open-source. He goes radical enough to promote only GNU+Linux distributions that contain no non-free software such as Trisquel GNU/Linux. Going that hardcore in freedom respecting software means giving up YNAB, Discord, and the like for something like GNUCash and Matrix, which is nice but doesn't fit my needs.

What I am saying is that I cannot do without my proprietary software even when using a freedom respecting OS like Android and GNU+Linux. I am posting here for a discussion to persuade me to at least reconsider the views of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Movement."

It came in a plastic bottle with a flip-open spout built into the lid. This was very convenient to use because I could flip open the lid and squirt the product into my free hand. Then I could close the spout against my side, or if I just set the bottle down that worked too, because almost no water would get in down the spout. 

But now I have to find a new conditioner, and so I tried one that comes in a jar with a twist-off lid. I have some styling products packaged this way, so I didn’t think anything of it, but come to find out, it’s a terrible way to package products Intended for use in the shower. It takes me both hands to open, if I set down either the jar or the lid, a lot of water gets in, it should really be on a shelf but a lot of people (myself included) don’t have one in their shower. I’ve been setting it on that little step that’s for your foot, but then I can’t use it as a step. 

I just don’t see why anyone would package shower products this way. Did they not do any consumer testing? Do some of you like having to juggle a lid and an open jar in the shower? What am I missing here??

EDIT: Yes, the product is intended for use in the shower. It’s branded as a “cowash” and the instructions specifically say to apply to soaking wet heat and to rinse out at the end."

Black athletes typically have higher testosterone than other athletes. So while sports is meritocratic, It's not a perfectly level playing field. For example, on what could be an Onion headline, a cisgender woman was told she'd have to take medication to lower her naturally high testosterone. https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/07/two-cis-black-women-banned-olympics-natural-testosterone-levels/

Of course, that's a slight advantage when compared to someone who is trans but didn't have years of puberty blockers or hormones. The Williams sisters, two of the greatest tennis players ever, were unable to beat a male player ranked around 100th in a 2 versus 1 match. I believe with sufficient hormone therapy / puberty blockers, a biological male could compete meaningfully against a biological female. 

Although MTF people can shrink a little in size, the statistical height advantage can't be erased. But their large frames are powered by less muscle mass. That's not to say that's a wash exactly.

7,2023-04-22,CMV: Most of the medical profession could do with much easier entry.,u/eht_amgine_enihcam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12uzh4z/cmv_most_of_the_medical_profession_could_do_with/,changemyview,"Context: I completed a pathway into med before deciding not to do it. During this I met a ton of people who have wanted to/gone on to become doctors. I also have family members and friends who are doctors. I admit that since I haven't actually done the course I am speculating from outside opinion. This is in mainly an Australian context.

The current medical courses require an ATAR of around 90+. For foreigners, this is the top 10% of the graduating class. An additional UMAT is taken, which is similar to an IQ test. If entering after doing an undergraduate in something like science, a more rigorous GAMSAT is taken over 3 days. Around 30% of university entry into medicine is successful.

We are also experiencing a doctor shortage. It is very difficult to get doctors to rural areas, and most of the ones I know are overworked. This is also true for nursing, which now requires a degree. I have even met someone who was pursing a masters in it. This creates a feedback cycle where trainee doctors/nurses may get insufficient training and get overworked. These people often burn out and leave the profession, exacerbating the issue.

The majority of what I did in pre-med, as well as what I've seen from my friends notes, was rote-learning. I think this is useful in knowing where to start looking, but the majority of GP work can be googled. I didn't experience much problem solving. It's important for a GP to be able to pick up on serious symptoms, but it doesn't seem like it takes much ""intelligence"". I think it's much more important to have good people skills (listen and understand the patient) and work ethic (memorisation). I don't know where the ""you have to be a genius to be a good doctor"" idea has come from. Some GP's I've met blatantly don't even care that much about symptoms: they mighta been brilliant in school but they're trying to get you through the door asap. 

I do not know how accurate this is to specialisation. I think things like heart and neurosurgery truly do need ""the best of the best"", but things like fine motor control would be as important as intelligence. I also think a fresh ""mediocre"" doctor who's had 8 hours of sleep is likely as good as a genius who's already done 2 surgeries.

I guess the penalty for getting a diagnosis incorrect is large, so hospitals want to have the proof that they have taken all means to employ a capable person and so are not liable. I think the interview part of the GAMSAT is a good idea, but the UMAT was quite stupid (I scored well in it and I am NOT suited toward medicine). They have also spawned sub-industries that I think raise the financial/time barriers toward becoming a doctor.

A consideration I've had is to train a doctor it's a substantial financial investment, especially if they are subsidised by the government. Therefore there naturally needs to be an arbitrary ""weeding"" process. However, I think nursing should be doable with a year training course (I'd assume most of the learning would come on the job).

In conclusion: I feel the current shortage, overwork, and ""sacrifice"" that doctors and nurses do is decently easily mitigated by just increasing the supply of doctors and nurses. I don't think the day to day task most doctors do is out of the reach of many of the applicants, but they are arbitrarily filtered. Tired people tend to work worse than awake ones."
0,2023-04-22,CMV: Women can easily manipulate a man,u/Capable-Suggestion24,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12uzsor/cmv_women_can_easily_manipulate_a_man/,changemyview,"It is easier for women to get something from men because men in our society are so starved of even some basic compliment or love. And can easily be influenced by some basic appreciation and support.  Whereas it's hard to please a woman. Because she is constantly bombarded with compliments, gifts and love all her life. Although let me give a caveat as well before people start calling me an incel, I do think a lot of times when women receive love in especially romantic settings it tends to be based on the expectation of getting something in return like sex or something of the similar nature. Even on Twitch and OnlyFans, guys who are gifting subs are doing with some sort of inherent expectation of being noticed since there real life is so full of shit, that being noticed by a beautiful girl is enough to make his entire week. 

I'm not trying to say that women are manipulate creatures or gold diggers who are just looking to rip off men. And men are some victim who can't understand the nature of relationships. But it's just easier for girls whereas men have to put in ton of effort to impress a girl. Whereas a girl can just appreciate a man for the most basic of things and he'll go high over heels for her. 

I do think part of this has to do with patriarchy. Now we can never know what percentage of it is because of societal conditioning or is it just a thing that's naturally instilled in us and we can never move ahead from it."

7,2023-04-22,CMV: Drag is akin to black face,u/mouettefluo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12v6blz/cmv_drag_is_akin_to_black_face/,changemyview,"First let me preface this with : I’m a woman and 70% of my entertainment is drag race, drag Youtube Channels, drag related subs on Reddit...It’s been that way for years now. I also label myself a feminist and from the left. I also don’t care if kids are seeing drag queen at the library. With all that info you can guess my general value system. 

I don’t know if you’ve seen the recent Jimbo debacle . Jimbo is a drag queen whose currently getting pushback for the way she portrayed women via his artistic choices.


I did not follow this particular story up close, but saw some arguments online that got me thinking. Here’s the idea that emerged in my head.

Drag can be considered akin to black face/cultural appropriation. 

Here is my definition of appropriation:

Group A, who in a position of power regarding Group B, is using key components of group B’s identity. 

In some cases the appropriation hurts group B via mockery because group B endures discrimination for displaying historically those signifiers.
For example: black face (darker skin and racism) or making fun of east asian face features, wearing natives ceremonial apparel as halloween costume, etc. 

In other cases group A adopts/steal ls the cultural signifier to use it as its own. I used adopting/stealing here because depending on the case, members of group B can react positively or negatively. Example: white people wearing dreads, adopting ghetto or queer language, jazz and rap, wearing kimonos, eating sushi, etc. I’m thinking of cases like that one kid of wore a Moana costume for Halloween that sparked the debate: is it appropriation or appreciation?

Now, if I apply those ideas about drag. 

At the baseline, drag comes from men portraying women using signifiers that women historically have been belittled for (Makeup, clothing, sparkling everything, pink extravaganza). And drag is for entertainment, so it’s not men starting to wear glittery dresses day to day as a form of appreciation for dresses. It’s to make a show.  Like comedian stretching their eyes with tape to mimic asian features to get a laugh. The latter is frowned upon but not drag?

If drag is showing appreciation of women features, why some languages in drag sounds derogatory toward women ? One example that has been brought up in Drag Race itself is that the word  “fishy” is being used to say someone looks so much like a women that he begins to smell like them. Associating fish smell and women does not sound celebratory. 


Now reflecting on the thoughts I just wrote. Can some drag be hurtful to women ? Jimbo got a lot of flack for , like some say, portraying women in a hurtful manner. While others say it’s just comedy and camp. Aren’t those arguments used for blackface defenders? 
Jimbo replied with something along the lines of: I respect and love my mother, sisters, aunt. Isn’t that a response akin to “but I have black friends, I can’t be racist “


And finally, as a drag entertainment enjoyer myself, I can see that a lot of drag queens celebrate and show appreciation to the feminine realm. Does that make drag immune to feminist criticism ? Am I partaking in and enjoying something that is historically and inherently sexist ?

And if drag is acceptable, would there be a context where blackface or yellowface would be acceptable. Like Robert D Jr ?"

The American government is just as much a compromise between 50 unified states as it is a compromise between 300 million people. It seems like a decent idea for states to contribute to the voting weight along with people, but I’m unsure if this trade-off is worth it.

However, the main problem is the winner takes all system which discounts the minority within state lines. This particular system completely discounts voters rather than simply weighing some votes more. It doesn’t matter if a candidate wins a state with 90% of the population or 51% percent; the result is the same. This means that voting blocks only matter when they can sway which way the majority tips. 

This completely discounts many minorities and is a fundamental failing of our voting system; the electoral college probably isn’t. We don’t need to abolish the electoral college; just force states to send divided representatives proportional to how their vote turned out. This would be allow most of the benefits that some people see in the electoral college and thus should be easer to pass.

For clarity sake I have a few specific claims:
1. The winner takes all system is is completely flawed and needs to change.
2. It is more important and easier to reform the winner takes all system than the electoral college. 
3. The electoral college has benefits and with this reform the electoral college would probably be a decent enough voting system."

1. We must use gender-affirming pronouns (he/she/they) with transgender folks. I am NOT looking to debate this here.

2. I am NOT looking to debate things from the argument of social curtesy, but rather interested in a deeper understanding. I will use neopronouns if somebody insists on doing so, in the same way I will use a prefered name for someone who doesn't want to be addressed by their legal name.

\---------------

My current view -

Now, I am not trans. However, I have been in close proximity with many trans folks, including non-binary. My general understanding is that neo-pronouns (xe/ze/le etc.) were a search for non-binary pronouns back in 2010s around which they inflated in use. However, this trend appears to have died down in 2020s with most non-binary folks settling on they/them.  


Therefore, in academic, corporate & legal/constitutional documents, using they/them for all non-binary people is sufficient, and neo-pronouns were simply a linguistic trend. However, on some progressive websites, I have seen the assertion that neopronouns are about an innate identity, and not merely a linguistic choice, and this made me have second thoughts.

\-----------------

Examples of things that can change my view -

\- Do people feel gender-dysphoria, when called they/them instead of ze/zir?

\- Do folks who use ""ze"" have something in common which is different from folks who use ""xe""?

\- Is there any other group besides non-binary folks who use neo-pronouns?"

For buying higher / the rest, you need to be 20. The US has a drinking age at 21. 21 for even a can of beer. 

I suppose everyone is thinking ""oh, but you are way more mature when you are 21, than when you are 18"". Guess what, you are still a young adult. You will make stupid desicions when it comes to alcohol that age (not everyone of course, but very many).

I believe that if the age is lower, as many countries in Europe, the teenagers till buy their own booze safely from the drugstore or liquor shop, instead of buying from an acquaintance or even a stranger, because that is the reality. Most people start experimenting with alcohol in their late teens (15,16, 17) and if they have a drinking age at 18, I would say it is a lot safer, than if you have it up to 21.

I find it concerning how you can legally own a firearm at the age of 18 in the US, but buying a can of beer? Oh heavens forbid it!!! How do they trust a kid owning a gun, but not drinking alcohol?

Cycle lanes are becoming more and more common, and cycling is becoming more encouraged especially in urban areas. There are certainly benefits to cycling for all, but I think there should be licensing and insurance requirements for cyclists, similar to other motorists who use the roads. I have no issue with extending this requirement to any vehicle on the road, including mopeds. 

Cyclists are required to follow the same laws as motorists, if not more. However currently they are allowed to use the same road without passing a basic knowledge test on these laws. There is an argument to be made that many cyclists are not aware of these rules, or that they apply to them. (Stop signs, lane discipline, etc.) I think this could be handled simply by adding an additional designation to regular drivers licenses, a system many states have now for motorcycles. 

Furthermore, motorists pay various fees and taxes for upkeep of the roads, it's only fair for cyclists to share some of this cost, though it would be sensible for it to be less than what a motorist pays. This is especially true for areas that are building dedicated cycle lanes, which of course add to the expense of any road project. 

As for insurance, most states require liability insurance at minimum. This is reasonable to expect from anyone using the road. Granted a bicycle can not cause as much damage as a car, but they can cause accidents and should have a nominal insurance premium for liability like anyone else. (I see no reason why this shouldn't apply to mopeds as well for consistency) This would mainly be for property damage of course but should include injury just in case. 

All these fees/premiums would be less than a car I expect, just as a large truck is more than a car based on size/risk."

A rundown of the situation is in June 2010, she was arrested for DUI due to a fatal accident she caused in New Jersey. In December 2012, she was convicted by a Somerset County jury of vehicular manslaughter and assault by automobile, and sentenced by Judge Robert B. Reed in February 2013.

Judge Reed imposed less than the minimum sentence of 5 years, instead sentencing her to three years, citing a number of mitigating factors. She was subsequently imprisoned and then released on parole in June of 2015.

Since her release, Ms. Locane was a model citizen who did not reoffend, or violate her parole in any manner. However, in June 2016, a New Jersey appeals court ruled that Locane's sentence would be re-reviewed, due to what they felt was an insufficient explanation of leniency from Judge Reed. Reed later agreed that he had erred in his sentence and should have imposed an additional six months, but did not believe that she should return to prison as she was not a threat to society. In February 2019, however, she was re-sentenced to five years, but remained free on bail pending appeal. Then, in July 2020, another judge ruled that the 2019 sentence was incorrect and sentenced her to eight years. Most recently, a December 2022 federal appeals verdict rejected her claim of double jeopardy.

**Now for the various parts of my view:**

&#x200B;

* A lot of this hinges on me generally having a very negative opinion of mandatory minimum sentences to begin with. I think judges should be able to hold some discretion, as each situation has unique nuances to it and it's unfair to compel judges to ignore those.
* Even if I agreed with the mandatory minimum, what happened to Ms. Locane is insane and sick. She stood trial and got her sentence. It doesn't matter if the state didn't like it. She served her time, she was released. She kept her nose clean and did not violate her parole in any manner. That should be the end of it. Mission accomplished, prisoner rehabilitated.
* Furthermore, her final sentence was in fact *over* the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years, it was 8 years.
* On that note, the primary purposes of imprisonment should be two things - a) rehabilitation, and b) removing a dangerous individual from society. Ms. Locane was, by all accounts, rehabilitated and no longer considered a danger to society. Anything else is just based in vengeance.

&#x200B;

Essentially, even if her situation wasn't considered to meet the legal definition of double jeopardy, it certainly violates the same moral principle. If you're sentenced for a crime, the state should not be able to keep retrying you until they get a sentence they find sufficient. If you complete your sentence and are released, and remain a model citizen who does not reoffend or violate your parole in any way, the state coming after you again is wrong and cruel. This situation never should have happened. It serves society no good to treat her like that. It serves the state no good. If the state doesn't like a sentence a judge imposes, then for lack of a better term, that's too bad.  If she's not reoffending, they have no claim on her freedom. She served her sentence, it should be over. 

Concessions

* If it's shown there is a highly exceptional error in sentencing, then I think the state seeking out options is appropriate. If it's proven that the judge was not of sound mind at the time of the trial or sentencing, or they were being coerced into giving a lenient sentence by any party, or showed a highly exceptional degree of bias, then the sentence might need to be looked at again. But that did not appear to be the case in the Locane case."

Many in my family enjoy them, and I have nothing against that (though I fear for their safety). 

I know that if everybody on the road drive safely, lane splitting would not be a hazard, but you cannot/should not count on that. I can’t tell you how many times I wasn’t even about to switch lanes but I was surprised by a bike flying past me not 2 feet from the car. It happens most often around stop signs or lights where the light turns green and cars are slowly getting up to speed but the bike is able to do the full speed limit right up the middle of the cars. 

It feels like it takes the issue of unaware drivers switching lanes into motorcycles and makes it unnecessarily worse. I fail to see how legalizing lane splitting does anything except make the road more hazardous for everybody. It seems as unnecessarily dangerous as driving without a helmet. A minor wreck in a car can easily be a fatal one to a motorcyclist. 

People that argue for the legalization of lane splitting sound no different to me than those that argue for their right to smoke. 

I know there is the argument that allowing lane splitting reduces congestion, but at what cost? Is it really better to have a bike fly past your car dangerously close than it is to have people wait in traffic longer. (And I say that as a person with a decently long commute)

Something can be amazing but   still overrated. Such is the case with chatGPT. While it can be pretty   useful in certain domains, like making programming and such  faster/more  efficient, for the lay person, it is overrated.

For   the lay person, it is simply a faster google search. But this is   typically not even a good thing. With google search, one needs to go on a   few websites until they get their answer/learn about a topic. This   develops research and critical thinking skills. But if you rely on AI to   do this for you, you might save a bit of time, but at the expense of   developing these skills. Just like how GPS and google maps significantly   reduced our skill of remembering directions, AI will do the same thing   in terms of knowledge overall. Not knowing directions is a small skill   to use, but losing our critical thinking ability and organic knowledge   as a whole is a much bigger deal. Of course, there will be some people   who will use chatGPT properly and will use it to actually aid in   attaining their organic knowledge, but very few will be like this. The   vast majority of people are, and will blindly rely on AI to answer any   question they have, and then they won't even bother to remember it,   because they know any time they want the answer they can just ask AI   again. You are not a spider, do not offload your cognitive resources.

The   issue with blindly relying on AI is this simple formula: garbage in,   garbage out. Even the best designed AI system will 100% be confined to   how it was developed/who developed/fed it knowledge. AI will never   (theoretically MAYBE it will get close to the point of virtually   matching humans in this regard, but this would be decades away) match   humans in term of critical thinking and intuition.

I   had said the same thing about Alexa and I was right: I said it was   mostly a useless marketing ploy. Alexa play Despacito. Alexa turn on the   light. Alexa what is the capital of Peru? Are you kidding me? How long   does it take to do that yourself?

Not   to mention how education will permanently be ruined: there will   practically be no way to prove someone used chatGPT or not, even if they   don't copy paste it is very easy and fast to have chatGPT do your  whole  assignment for you in bits and pieces.

It promotes self love, and acceptance. That in and of itself is admirable. It can create a more accepting and supporting community. That's great too. It reduces body shaming, and that too is wonderful. Along with that perhaps less bullying and teasing which is also good. It can challenge ""Beauty Standards"".

So we got all these good / positive reasons for it. I may have missed some. Feel free to add to that list if you think it should be longer. Do the bad out weight the good?

Now on to the negatives of the movement:

It's primarily directed at women, and not so much at men if even at all. You don't see very many ads with an obese man wearing a 6XL setting a beauty standard for men. So, it is sexist in nature. If they are to promote body positivity it should be for both men and women, and not just women.

It's not so much for people who survived an acid attack or an animal attack, or who are an amputee, or have a genetic disorder or disease. It's more about obesity than anything else most of the time. That is not very inclusive either.

It's not very inclusive to slim people or athletic people.

Doctors have a consensus that obesity is not healthy. With obesity comes much greater risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, sleep apnea, joint problems, infertility, digestive problems, respiratory problems, reduced life span.

It promotes a ""Sedentary Lifestyle"" where an ""Active Lifestyle"" is much more healthy.

It makes people who may have changed their lifestyle and become more healthy not do that as the movement itself acts as a bit of an ""Enabler"" coddling people into not getting the help they need.

It adds an unnecessary strain on the healthcare system for others. Patients must wait longer for medical care because of obese people with obesity related issues taking up doctor time.

While being supportive in general is considered a positive trait... Sometime being ""Supportive"" is the wrong thing to do if the behavior is harmful to the person you are being supportive of. For example if someone had a drinking problem, or a drug addiction, or gambling problem sometimes the person may need ""Intervention"" instead of ""Support"". That can be be difficult to do at times as it may cause friction between you and that person."
0,2023-04-23,"CMV: While there are patriarchal structures that exist in America, it is no longer a ""Patriarchy"".",u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12w0fsz/cmv_while_there_are_patriarchal_structures_that/,changemyview,"This post is essentially about semantics, but I think it's important.

""The Patriarchy"" is a often problematic term because of its ambiguousness and vagueness: there are many ways to interpret the term beyond ""male lead"". My concern is that some interpretations of the concept are more reasonable than others.

If by Patriarchy you simply are referring to the existence of patriarchal culture or structures, then this is just a matter of truth or falseness of facts.

However, if ""The Patriarchy"" is interpreted to mean something like ""the society we live in is universally oppressive to women, and men at all levels of society are mostly complicit in this because they benefit from it"" then I begin to become concerned.

Saudi Arabia could maybe be described as a Patriarchy. Pre 1960's America was a Patriarchy. Those societys were really designed around men and what benefited them, and women were just tools and a subject to the design by men perpetuated by legislation and norms.

But modern America doesn't function like this. Feminism has already ""cracked"" and fragmented Patriarchy. I'm not saying sexism is gone, just that our culture is a complex mix of sexism and non sexist elements. The patriarchal cultures that exist are only partial aspects of our society that we need to fight against, it isn't THE WHOLE of society.

When we treat America like it still is a universal, unilateral Patriarchy, then we run the risk of radicalized and unreasonable ideological perspectives. You get the stereotypical feminists who want to blame every problem on men, gender, and might have a victim hood complex. Or it will ferment a deep resentment of men in the mind of the feminist identifying person because their mind has chosen to define their entire world around the actions of shitty men."

I think that just paying people large sums of money is not the best way to solve racial divides. Most people if given reparations would probably be iresponable with them and not invest/save properly. If we were to give out reparations it would be very complicated to determine who is elegible for them becuase some people are mixed race. I think a better idea is too set up programs to help get african americans get jobs or at least pay out money over time. Can you change my view?

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow! I did not expect this to blow up like it did. To start I would like to clarify some things from my original post. By saying that most people would be iresponsable with money, I do not mean to suggest that I think that black people do not know how to manage money, just that in general people that recive large amounts of money, no matter their race, would probably not spend the money wiseley. I would also like to raise some new questions while this is popular, they are

* If we were to have reparations, who would pay for them?
* What is the best way to pay out reparations?
* how would we decide who gets reparations?

You all can discuss this and I will do my best to respond to people.

My new views after reading peoples stuff:

* Reparations are a good idea, just not in lump sum payments but definetly payments over time
* Figuring out who gets reparations is a complicated isssiue but is not a reason to avoid giving them out
* Figuring out who has to pay for reparations is a complicated issiue but also not a reason to avoid paying reparations.
* My ideal course of action at this point in time is for the goverment to start a commite to study the paying of repartions.

As far as I know, wages in most western countries have been flat or near flat in real terms for about 30 to 40 years.

In that time, we've seen the introduction of personal computing, digital tech, the internet and other groundbreaking technologies that have massively improved productivity. We've also seen record high company profits and been through every part of the economic cycle multiple times. Multiple booms. Multiple crashes.

The current excuses about raising wages just seem like the latest excuse. If it was just about inflation then wages would have gone up in some other part of the economic cycle. Politicians back home in Australia keep saying productivity is the key. But we've seen this as a lie too.

Productivity in offices has gone up 84 percent since the introduction of PCs, according to a Cambridge study I read. But wages haven't gone up that amount.

It appears to me that wages will now never increase. No matter what technologies we create no matter how productive we are, no matter what part of the economic cycle we are in. Record high profits seem to just be given out in dividends to shareholders.

This makes me think we shouldn't bother increasing productivity at all, because it is not improving our lives. I basically feel lied to continually by economists and politicians on TV who say one day our lives will improve re wages. It just seems false.

Please note, when I talk about real term wage increases, I mean wage increases that exceed inflation. Before people jump in to comment about 1 or 2 percent increases. 

Tl;Dr: Wages haven't gone up in real terms forty years despite record profits and massive productivity gains from tech. So wages might never go up again."

1. Most servers make WAY more per hour than people with similar resumes or skill levels. There simply aren’t a lot of jobs out there that would pay way above minimum wage for fewer than 40 hours per week work without a degree or certificate. Moving to a fixed price and fixed wage would almost definitely mean they take a pay cut. 

2. People who complain that “customers shouldn’t subsidize employee wages” are seem to misunderstand how businesses work. Customers pay literally all of every employee’s wage, they just have less say over how much of their payments go to the employees rather than management outside of a tipping context. 

3. Most restaurant owners aren’t exactly wealthy - these are very low margin businesses that often deal with very price sensitive customers. Including a fixed gratuity would price out some customers entirely while also likely reducing the tips from customers who regularly tip above 15-20%, meaning both the server and the restaurant make less. 

4. Tipping absolutely leads to better service. There’s a reason basically every sales job has a low base pay and the opportunity for a commission - that motivates people to do well. The same is true for food service. When I go to countries that have no tipping culture service is sometimes still good - especially at nicer places. But it’s generally below the standard of most US places."

The Virginia Tech, Uvalde, Stoneman Douglas, Nashville and Pulse nightclub shooter all bought their guns from gun stores and passed background checks. Notice a trend?

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/wbna18170761

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/15/florida-shooting-suspect-bought-gun-legally-authorities-say/340606002/

If we improve our background check system and require background checks for private gun sales nationwide, that can be an important step in preventing mass shootings.

The FBI has been dropping the ball on preventing mass shootings anyway, considering the fact that the Pulse Nightclub shooter’s father worked as an FBI informant for at least 11 years BEFORE the shooting even happened.

**[The Pulse night club shooter] had boasted of his connections to terrorists, threatened to have Al Qaeda kill a co-worker’s family, and talked of wanting to be a martyr — when he was not vocally vilifying African-Americans and minorities. Numerous individuals and organizations — including his mosque — warned authorities that he could be a threat to public safety. When FBI officials investigated him in 2013, he repeatedly lied to them. But the FBI swayed the local sheriff’s department to drop its investigation because a “confidential informant” assured FBI agents that Omar Mateen was not a terrorist and would not “go postal or anything like that.”**

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/03/fbi-pulse-nightclub-verdict-terrorism-failure-james-comey-book-column/478092002/

Another step that needs to be taken is prosecuting straw purchasers better. A straw purchaser is a person with a clean criminal record that buys guns for people who cannot pass a background check. It’s a felony to lie on a background check, but those caught lying on that form appear to be prosecuted rarely.

https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/gun-straw-buyers-rarely-prosecuted-despite-crackdown-on-illegal-guns?_amp=true

We would also need to crack down on the black market for guns too, because despite liberal states having strict gun control, the firearms black market in those states appears to be thriving.

In 2021, the LAPD seized over 10,000 firearms

https://xtown.la/2022/07/05/ghost-gun-seizures-rise-in-los-angeles/

An estimated 43 percent of guns used in US crimes were obtained through the black market.

https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/where-do-criminals-really-get-their-guns.amp

So improving on these issues will help with gun violence, but regarding the mass shooting issues, requiring background checks for every gun purchase and improving the background check system can help to prevent mass shootings."

I believe there was an increase in anti-trans legislation and language that began to burgeon in 2022-23 is based on the end of Roe V. Wade. Specifically, Republicans losing out on right leaning and moderate women voters. In short, the end of Roe V. Wade clearly has fucked the GOP electorally. I believe, like all things, that anti-trans legislation and focus is based on manufacture culture wars. 

I personally believe that if this is paramount to your political focus then you must have a privilidged life as you have no other concerns. Anyway,

Like all things from our political parties they want to have us focus on other things than issues that would really help with change. I believe both are guilty of this, but the GOP's actions have real consequences and harm. 

I have some points as to why I believe the GOP wants transgender people to be the focus of the day:

1. They want to manufacture a culture war based on the fact that they don't have substantial policy goals in place. Unless someone can CMV as to what those clear policy goals are I thought they were anti-LGBTQ and election denialism.
2. Perpetuation of their anti-LGBTQ feelings and pandering to evangelicals. They need their base to stay focused, on task, and voting for them when it comes to general elections. 
3. They lost a lot of women voters. With the end of Roe v Wade a lot of young women, middle age, and a good chunk of 40+ women are livid with the GOP. In order to get those women voters back they would have to abandon their evangelical voters and they can't do that. So they expanded the anti-trans messaging to sound as if it pro-women messaging.

Number 3 being my central point above all else. They need the women voters to come back. Consider the messaging they have had when it comes to being anti-trans. They focus soley on the MtF trans people with little to almost no mention of FtM trans people. They aren't the focus because they want to seem as though \*they\* are fighting for the rights of women. Where do they fight for those rights? By protecting the women in the bathrooms and in sports. They are trying to tell women voters that they are for women's rights whereas the Democrats cant even tell what a woman is. That Democrats want you to be unsafe in bathrooms and to have men in sports. 

They try to keep the messaging simple and concise. They focus on the terms like, ""people who give birth"" and focus on that \*only women can give birth\*. Their message isn't based on liberating feminism, but natural feminism. They promise to women that they will be the \*only ones\* who recognize them as true women and the Democrats wont. This is my belief as to why legislation and messaging from Republicans have ramped up."
90,2023-04-23,CMV: Shotguns suck for home defense,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12ws5be/cmv_shotguns_suck_for_home_defense/,changemyview,"Why? A myriad of reasons which I will discuss below

High recoil- In a defensive situation, low recoil is a good thing to have in a firearm because it makes potentially necessary follow up shots quicker and easier. Not to mention not everyone can handle the kick back of a 12 or even 20 gauge.

Low ammo capacity- Assault rifles usually have a standard capacity of 20-30 rounds where most combat shotguns have a max capacity of about 10 rounds or so. You can possibly have an AK style shotgun with a 20 round drum magazine, but they’re bulky and not very reliable

Low reliability- With pump action, lever action and semi auto shotguns, they seem to have a greater chance of failure to feed such as short stroking a pump or lever and with semi auto shotguns, they can be picky with the ammo that they use and often seem to jam more than pistols and rifles. And don’t even get me started on the low reliability of magazine fed shotguns.

Slow reload times- Tube fed shotgun magazines are more reliable than magazine fed shotguns, but they also take a lot more time to fully reload than just dropping your old mag, putting the new one in, and racking the slide

Buckshot- You might be more likely to not hit what you’re aiming for with a shotgun due to spread of shot, even when taking into account the one inch per yard spread rule

But if you use flite control buckshot or a slug to mitigate this, you might as well use a rifle instead."

Once I stopped, it was a struggle to function at first, but I eventually found ways to tone down my more off-putting parts of myself and be able to do okay academically and professionally. I learned from a young age that I would have to work 3x as hard as my peers to stay on pace, and luckily, my ingrained work ethic helped with that. I may not have excelled at anything, but at least I could be average.

For a long time, I avoided sharing my diagnosis because I didn't want it to seem like I was using it as an excuse. I have started coming to terms with it recently as I am finding harder to mask my mistakes at work (get told about my attn to detail, and how fast I move through my tasks). I have learned about the term masking, but don't understand why it's considered a bad thing. 

I think it works well for the most part because:

\- Without masking, I struggled to make friends with peers. Once I masked out my more off-putting parts of my personality, I started to find friendships

\- It's brought my work ethic to the first and forefront. Without my work ethic masking my lack of talents and skills, I struggled to find employment. I work for a place now that hired me from freelancing because they liked how hard I worked.

I may be an objective failure in terms of finances, and for still far behind my peers in terms of life, but I can say that the few things I have achieved wouldn't have been possible without learning to mask myself.

I'm open to Changing My View, as I'm still coming to terms, and maybe would like to hear from others why my perspective might be off.

0,2023-04-23,CMV: Raising the Minimum Wage does not help low-income citizens,u/giantpicklepi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12x118f/cmv_raising_the_minimum_wage_does_not_help/,changemyview,"With many states raising the minimum wage, I have never seen the appeal in raising the minimum wage. To me, the purpose of the minimum wage is purely to ensure companies pay their employees something for their time, and ensures that low-pay apprenticeship does not happen. However, I often see people argue 2 main points for the minimum wage.  
1. ""Raising the minimum wage will attract more workers."" While getting more people interested in working can be a good thing, raising the minimum wage also means higher prices for the goods sold. This results in workers not actually having more ""extra money"" as their buying power remains the same. The other, more negative, effect this has is that prices go up only in the area that the minimum wage was increased. For example, if Kansas decided to raise its minimum wage to 10% higher than Missouri, people living in Kansas City would earn more money working in Kansas, but would have more buying power in Missouri. However, this will result in Kansas stores now having fewer patrons, and therefore needing to close down, negatively impacting all Kansas workers, even those working for well above the minimum wage.

2. ""Raising the minimum wage allows people to live a stable, healthy life."" While the idea of a government safety-net is an entire topic in itself, the reality is that different areas have different costs of living. When the minimum wage is raised in one area, it affects both low-cost and high-cost areas. In the low-cost areas, the minimum wage may be raised to well above what that local economy can support, resulting in either prices being raised and eliminating the low-cost nature of the area, or resulting in a failure of local businesses that cannot afford to pay their workers. In high-cost areas, the minimum wage likely was not a factor to begin with, as any job not paying enough for workers in that area will find no workers. Workers need an income in proportion to their local area. If a worker in a downtown area needs to live within walking distance of their workplace due to parking, they could easily be looking at $2500 per month for an apartment. On the other hand, a workplace just outside of the city with plentiful parking would allow a worker to live much further from the city, and have an apartment of around $1500 per month. This, generally, means the downtown worker would need to be paid **66% more** than the suburban worker for them to have the **same quality of life**. However, by raising the minimum wage, the suburban worker will benefit greatly while the downtown worker will see no change.  
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on why minimum wage should be raised, and broadening my own thoughts on the subject."

Following high end fashion trends, buying luxury brands become status symbol, little else. 

Fashion is toted as self expression but very rarely is it a genuine thoughtful expression of the individual. More often it is simply people trying to fit in/look cool/look “normal”. 

More often than not, high fashion is pretentious, silly, & vain. 

Wear what you want, follow no trends, let these elitist, empty fashion companies die off.

There are so many articles on why capitalism is the foundation of freedom and yet when practiced, people want a law to stop this.

There was another post on some guy selling strawberries on the street with marked up prices. The op got destroyed because he thought this was not acceptable, but all the comments suggested he provided the service to bring strawberries to the local street.

What is the difference between dropshipping and scalping? Both make it “accessible” to buy.

Do people not sense the hypocrisy?

If you dont feel the price is right dont buy it, especially an nonessential good or are we that delusional to think we are owed these prices from manufacturers because they set the “real” price?

When Nestle steals water - it was a natural commodity of necessity and hence is morally questionable, but something like ps5 is literally a luxury regardless of the price.

I couldnt care less for prices of a ps5 (the most first world problem if there ever is one) but the moral hypocrisy really gets me.

Edit: Im tired now, the only one that convinced me was indeed just saying capitalism in it’s purest form is also unethical. Although I can not argue with that, it just made me feel I should have worded my cmv better. 

That if one defends capitalism, then one should defend scalping.

Also - Peter Singer’s Famine, Affluence and Morality shows why you are all hypocrites

But there's many English speakers on internet who live in very different cultures and have different backgrounds. It's too easy for them to misread it as something that applies to them, which leads to misunderstanding, confusion or even anger.

I personally can't imagine writing about my country online and not making it explicit. Because I know there's many other cultures out there who won't find things I take for granted in my writing as self-evident. Americans should do this too.

Many stupid arguments can be avoided this way, and much energy can be saved on the reader side. For example, an American writes something detailed about racial justice and what relationship White, Asian and Black people are in with respect to each other. Coming from Central Asia, I try to read it by default as something that applies to my context. And from there it gets very ridiculous very fast. The way we look at it, and the terms in which we talk about it, and out historical context are completely different (we don't call people White and Asian, for example; and we don't have words that one ethnicity can say but not the other).

TLDR: US context should not be assumed by default in online discussions."

I was born in, grew up in and still live in the Nordic model. Therefore, I do not understand how it is to live in other systems.

I know some people say that it is unfair to force someone by law to fund the medical bills of other people, but if Denmark where I live, and the US were equal in size, population and military power and would one day go to war against each other, the US simply would not have enough fit people to fight us. We would win, because our system ensures faster treatment & recovery. Not to forget prevention.

I am a capitalist and not a fan of socialism. Tax payer funder healthcare, with 100% coverage for anything and everything, is to me, a matter of the nation's ability to generate wealth. Stress over medical bills will reduce focus at work, lead to even more illness and overall, weaken a nation. Illness that drags on and does not get treated timely, will lead to more and more issues, one of which being extended sick leave and even disability of some kind if the sickness is allowed to go on for too long. 

And that means access to as many people as possible who are capable of putting up a fight incase we are attacked."

While I could care less in that person’s case, when kids are involved, you should really try to stick it out. (Obviously barring something extreme like listed in the title).

You see it in r/dating all the time. 

The common arguments I see are... 

**""Smart people enjoy being challenged.""**
*My take: intelligent people like to be challenged in good faith in thoughtful ways. For example, I enjoy debating insightful religious people about religions that which I don't believe but I don't enjoy being challenged by flat earthers who don't understand basic science.*

**""What difference do my feelings on Trump vs Biden make in the context of a relationship?""**
*My take: who you vote for isn't what sports team you like—voting has real world consequences, especially to disadvantaged groups. If you wouldn't date someone who did XYZ to someone, you shouldn't date a person who votes for others to do XYZ to people.*

**""Politics shouldn't be your whole personality.""**
*My take: I agree. But ""not being a cannibal"" shouldn't be your whole personality either—that doesn't mean you should swipe right on Hannibal Lecter.*

**""I don't judge *you* based on your politics, why do you judge me?""**
*My take: the people who say this almost always have nothing to lose politically. It’s almost always straight, white, middle-class, able-bodied men. I fit that description myself but many of my friends and family don't—let alone people in my community. For me, a bad election doesn't mean I'm going to lose rights, but for many, that's not the case. I welcome being judged by my beliefs and judge those who don't.*

**""Politics aren't that important to me"" / ""I'm a centrist.""**
*My take: If you're lucky enough to have no skin in the political game, then good for you. But if you don't want to change anything from how it is now, it means you tacitly support it. You've picked a side and it's fair to judge that.*

Our politics (especially in heavily divided, two-party systems like America) are reflections of who we are and what we value. And I generally see the ""don't judge me for my politics"" chorus sung by people who have mean spirited, small, selfish, or ignorant beliefs and nothing meaningful on the line.

Not only is it *okay* to judge someone based on their political beliefs, it is a smart, telling aspect to judge when considering a romantic partner. Change my view.

* I fully support acceptance of transgender people, I am not homophobic
* I think the **main** reason in the rise of people identifying as transgender is because we have accepted it more in society, but I think that a **secondary** reason is influience from social media and societal trends
* I would also like to say that I  think that people who are truly transgender are born  that way, while some people start identifiying as transgender **(Not actually transitioning physically)** becuase it is something that their freinds or people on social media are doing. 
* In summary, I think that the rise of people who are born transgender and socially and physically transition are fuled only by greater acceptance of being transgender. While the rise  some people who identify as trans and ONLY socially transition could be fuled by social media and societal trends
* Quick reminder, This is change my view, if you disagree with my view, **please do not make me feel bad about it.** instead, please peacefully tell me your opinion and you may be able to change my view. I love this subreddit becuase I am very open to new ideas. Thank you!"

I'm not saying the status quo is perfect, certainly there's an issue of inequality and poverty and democratic deficits but these problems can be solved within the framework of liberalism (for example the implementation of a negative income tax, universal healthcare, taxing economic rents and building more homes). 

It is liberalism that brought about political democracy, press freedom and workers rights and challenged the power of both the authoritarian state and the church. Liberalism is also extremely flexible compared to something like full socialism, fascism or right libertarianism which seems to have a more fixed conception of things. 

Liberalism combines both radical individualism and egalitarianism, recognising both humans inner nature to be competitive and greedy as well as cooperative and social beings. Providing the conditions for free enterprise as well as ensuring everyone is educated and healthcare is provided for as a collective endeavour. Liberalism allows us to disagree, to implement policies gradually and through consent and change course if such policies have poor outcomes.

There have been multiple YouTube videos of black people getting makeup to look white to see if there is a difference in treatment. Also, people that go all out for costumes of characters with different(ex, green/purple) skin clots will do full body paint to immature their likenesses. Both of these situations are more or less accepted.

Am I missing something, or would doing blackface be almost entirely identical to the examples mentioned above if it weren’t for its associated history?"

Even others in the gun industry say #1 buckshot should be the smallest shot size in home defense.

https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/shotgun-penetration-with-various-rounds/amp/

People often use .223 rifle rounds to kill coyotes, and .223 rounds are also capable of killing humans, so if people use #4 buckshot on Coyotes than that might also mean that #4 buckshot can be effective on human targets as well.

Birdshot, regardless of size, is not consistently lethal enough to be trusted in a majority of self defense scenarios to incapacitate a human assailant.

I would say one of the more famous examples of birdshot failing to kill a human is the Dick Cheney hunting incident, where he shot someone else with a 28 gauge shotgun loaded with birdshot and they survived.

I mean think about it, if birdshot really were an effective home defense round, manufacturers would be making home defense specific birdshot rounds, but they aren’t."

Dogs are social and sensitive animals that have a complex set of needs. They are also able to communicate these needs to us but that requires us to know how to interpret their behavior correctly. Puppy's get puppy training, but in my opinion prospective dog owners should also get ""human training"".

Additionally, dogs have been bred for a multitude of tasks and while it's not necessary for them to do the exact work they have been bred for they should be challenged in similar ways so they don't get bored. It would be cruel to keep a sheepdog in a small apartment, for example.

Besides the dogs well being, it is also important that dogs have evolved from apex predators. They have sharp teeth and especially larger breeds can cause severe harm or even death if they attack. Owning a dog while not being able to make it behave properly is therefore also dangerous to the humans around it.

Therefore, it should be legally required to pass a test that demonstrates that 1) you have a sufficient understanding of dog psychology and can interpret their behaviour correctly and 2) you are able to provide them an environment suited to their needs.

**Why do I want it changed**

If I apply these same arguments to having kids I would disagree. 

Also, while I love dogs I have never owned one (mainly because I am not able to provide the home they need). So I would like to hear from people with more experience how effective this ownership license would be at preventing dog suffering.

3,2023-04-25,CMV: It never makes sense to buy a full-fare airline ticket (Class Y/C) unless there is no other alternative or you desperately need mileage.,u/ConsCom1949,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12yfuqo/cmv_it_never_makes_sense_to_buy_a_fullfare/,changemyview,"The main advantage of a full-fare ticket is flexibility, while the main disadvantage is obviously the exorbitant price. In my country China, airline tickets are normally discounted anywhere from 50% to 95%. It would be cheaper to buy a discounted ticket, cancel at the last minute and buy a new one than to buy a full-fare one. And these full fare tickets aren't even *fully* flexible, a few restrictions still apply.

Now, on the corporate travellers who might use full fare tickets more often than leisure travellers, since it's usually cheaper to buy another new discounted ticket (even without any refund of the old ticket!) than to buy a full fare flexible one, I don't see any benefits. If anything, the full fare ticket creates room for corruption. Some people have been caught using fake or cancelled full fare tickets for reimbursement while actually traveling via discounted tickets. 

Therefore the only cases you should buy a full fare ticket are:

(1) you desperately need to go to somewhere at the last minute and there is no alternative

(2) you desperately need mileage at the last minute (like in December or something) for some reason

(3) the only alternatives are like 1% or 5% discount with reduced mileage, it's basically the same as case (1) as the price difference is negligible

and (4) you want to do charity to the airline company."
0,2023-04-25,CMV: Afterlife is more likely than oblivion/nothingness after death,u/Acerbatus14,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12ygcbu/cmv_afterlife_is_more_likely_than/,changemyview,"TL;DR i believe that Poincaré recurrence is real and applies to consciousness, and our existence

im defining conscious and afterlife as ""aware of and responding to one's surroundings."" not in the sense that im the same person but going elsewhere (heaven/hell) or doing life again as the same person that i was in the previous life

now im personally a atheist but based on my philosophy i can't help but think that not only afterlife is real, but it will continue to go on forever

1st basically i believe that given sufficient amount of time, a given state will return to the state it was before eventually. that we are right now conscious means that after death whatever system/result that led you to being conscious will happen again, given enough time

2nd because im conscious right now means what ever thing that was required for consciousness to form existed prior to me being conscious, and since ~~information/matter~~ energy can't be ""deleted"" (feel free to cmv on this) eventually what ever procedure that resulted in my existence will happen again

keep in mind that all this is only a hypothesis, something i can't say with 100% certainty. however im 100% sure that it makes afterlife more likely than oblivion, the fact that almost every religion says that life after death exists notwithstanding

i will add more points as i remember them and as the discussion brings them out

delta awarded to the\_hucumber as they brought up the idea of entropy, and how it always increases, meaning once the entropy reaches maximum in the universe the circumstances for life -and thus consciousness- might not occur again no matter how much time passes, since time can't decrease entropy. ofc that doesn't mean if i die now i won't become conscious again, but eventually the cycle should end"
0,2023-04-25,CMV: Men are raped at similar rates as women,u/DentistJaded5934,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12yhyu8/cmv_men_are_raped_at_similar_rates_as_women/,changemyview,"The reason that rape statistics portray men as far less likely to be raped than women (1 in 5 women vs 1 in 71 men) is due, first, to the way in which rape is defined, and second, to the rates of rape in the past. For the sake of this argument, I am using the 12 month prevalence of rape rather than lifetime prevelance. This is to avoid drawing conclusions on the current rates of rape based on data on the rate of rape in the past. I am arguing that today, men and women have similar chances of being raped. If we used lifetime prevelance, we would be including in the data on millions of rapes that happened decades ago when rape was far more prevalent.

The CDC defines rape as: ""Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration. Among women, rape includes vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object. Among men, rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.”

For some reason, they decided that a man being forced to penetrate is not rape. By the CDC's definition, a man can only be raped if he is forcibly penetrated. Being forced to penetrate is, however, classified as sexual violence victimization. I believe that we should classify rape for men and women as both rape and being forced to penetrate. 

Being forced to penetrate is defined as: ""Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to, or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim's consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Among women, this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female's vagina or anus. Among men, being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in m ultiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one's own penis; orally penetrating a female's vagina or anus; anally penetrating a male or female; or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female. It also includes fem ale perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen.""

Now for 12 month prevelance rates as per the CDC ""Too few women reported being made to penetrate someone else to produce a reliable estimate and too few men reported being raped (per CDCs definition) to produce a reliable estimate. Because of this, I will assume these values are both similar in magnitude and basically cancel each other out. I could be wrong here, so feel free to share any information that disagrees with this point.

We are left with comparing 12 month prevalence of rape of women and 12 month prevalence of being forced to penetrate for men. These rates are exactly the same at 1.1% for each (1,270,000 women vs 1,267,00 men). This tells me that if men being forced to penetrate were classified as rape, which I believe it should be, that men and women are raped at exactly the same rate in today's society. 

We can also look to the stats for 12 month prevalence of unwanted sexual contact. Unwanted sexual contact is defined as unwanted sexual experiences involving touch but not sexual penetration, such as being kissed in a sexual way, or having sexual body parts fondled or grabbed. While this may not be rape this would still be classified as sexual violence victimization. The 12 month prevalence for women is 2.2% and for men it is 2.3%. This to me is close enough but technically men experience this more (2,410,000 women and 2,565,000 men).

The data that I used for these statistics comes directly from a CDC study on sexual violence on pages 17-19:
https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf

So yea, feel free to change my mind whether it is that men or women are raped more than the other.

My view was changed. There is newer data from 2017 that includes rape as I defined it here."

You can imagine the kind of image and video content that gets taken down.

I imagine this will always be an issue online whilst people hide behind anonymity. And can just set up new accounts whenever they push things too far and are banned from a platform.

My proposed solution would be to sacrifice that anonymity online. That's not to say your personal details are available to all. But in the same way I apply for a driver's licence with my passport and NI number, the same could apply to your email address. And this address is required to set up all subsequent social media, and hence tracable.

This would certainly stop people posting illegal material online. 

But at the same time I think Freedom of speech needs better protections if this is the case. I don't believe what some perceived as 'disinformation' is in the same class as the illegal content some users upload and share. Similarly people should be allowed to hold views that offend. As examples the people who have lost their jobs for saying there are only two genders. Or others who face hate speech charges for what are clearly jokes. That's not to say I personally agree with these points of view. But these need to be protected in law, and then I would feel comfortable sacrificing anonymity in order to make sure the internet is safer.

Not safer from being offended, of having your feelings hurt. But actually safer from the kind of people who harm others (in images or video), or deliberately intend to physically harm others by inviting violence."

Some things before expressing any opinion:

English isn't my mother tongue and misunderstandings may be made.

I am not against any Christian groups, just find them really dumb and wrong

I am born in a Christian household, specifically in an **Eastern Orthodoxy** group. Although that, I think that the opinion stated above is relatable for the other christian groups, as well.

If Christ does indeed exist in a godly form, then he would be, at least, disappointed in the state of this religion. He wouldn't approve of the seperation of christians to so many groups, nor would he approve of some of the taboos that exist. Analysing the christians groups throughout history, it is easily understood that the groups are, eventually, anti-christian in many ways. Having so many bible editions (and other books of religious content), causing conflicts between countries (e.g The fourth crusade) and many other historical events (like the Indulgences of the Catholic Church in the medieval ages) are few of my arguements.

Some of the taboos and wrongs of ""my"" Christian group:

A woman is not capable of becoming a priest, nor can she access some parts of the church. Women are also banned from entering Mount Athos. Homosexuals and anyone of the LGBT+ community is not accepted by most of the leaders. TOO many priests and religious leaders have a huge fortune due to their work. I mean, if you do believe in such a strong (and wrong) dogma, at least embrace it!

I specifically remember when I saw a priest (higher tier than the common ones) holding an iPhone 14/13 with the background of Jesus Christ as the wallpaper (I live in a country with a much lower average income than most of the European Union Countries). A really humble way to live...

I am not expressing any opinions on any other religions as I am inadequately informed. Would love to get to know them too, though. Lastly, I am not against Christ himself, even if I don't believe in anything christianity sees as the truth."

 Animation is its own perfectly valid medium. Animation has the ability to express and portray so many emotions, actions, etc that may not even be physically possible in real lifw. It’s commonly (and foolishly) looked down on as a children’s genre, or a silly genre, while live movies are “real movies”. While animated movies ARE usually targeted at children, they can have the same exact depth and impact as a live movie for adults. Disney is only perpetuating this silly view by not leaving movies as they are. I mean, what was wrong with the original films? They don’t NEED live action versions to make them more real. They were fine as they were. Animated cartoon films DON’T need to be converted into live ones to be legitimized.


I just see it as being incredibly offensive. Hell, they are basically just spitting on the hard work of the people that worked on the original films. You don’t need to think of a new storyline, characters, or music like the original creators.  The film is already valid simply because it features real people. Just release a film that’s technically not even original and make hundreds of millions of dollars."
15,2023-04-25,CMV: The progressives largely ignores issues impacting people with disabilities,u/CrippledThrowaway_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12ytu36/cmv_the_progressives_largely_ignores_issues/,changemyview,"Over the past decade plus, the progressive movement in the US has been very focused on various social justice issues such as LGBTQ, BLM, migrants, and other worthy causes. However when it comes to disability social justice, the progressive movement is largely absent. This despite critical issues for the disabled community in the US coming to a head and the impact of COVID. Even in DEI, topics such as ableism are often left out of the discussion. 

While some have argued that disability issues have been largely dealt with because of the ADA, Medicaid, and Social Security, that ignores how those achievements are failing.  

Currently there are an estimated 600,000 to 1.2 million people with disabilities on Medicaid waiver waiting lists to receive Home and Community Based Services. Some of these waiting lists can be 5, 10, even 20 years long. Without these services, people with disabilities are often forced to rely on aging family caregivers or are forced into nursing home type settings where abuse and neglect are rampant due staffing shortages, incompetence, and profiteering.  This despite many studies showing that Home and Community Based Services are more cost effective while delivering higher quality care. The situation has arguably gotten worse due to inflation, caregivers are leaving the field for significantly higher paying jobs in fast food and retail. The net result is pretty straight forward, people with disabilities are going to die, and are dying. 

This is just one example of a massive issue impacting people with disabilities, others include people with intellectual/developmental disabilities being paid sub minimum wage, that disability support services are means tested behind $2,000 asset limits that prevent people with disabilities from working and getting married, accessibility, and ableism in the medical field. Even eugenics is making a comeback in some circles. 

Outside of the various disability and care movements, progressives I speak with are generally clueless regarding these issues, despite COVID desemating nursing homes. It was hoped that this would at least finally cause a ground swell of support to expand Home and Community Based Services, but it did not. Things are getting worse: Airlines regularly destroy wheelchairs. The GOP Debt Bill adds a work requirement to Medicaid with a poorly defined exemption for disabled people. The Supreme Court is likely hostile to the ADA and Olmstead Ruling (Brown v. Board of Education level landmark ruling for the disabled community). The COVID protections are gone for immunocompromised people, 15 million are currently losing Medicaid as COVID laws end, many wrongly since states don't have bureaucratic capacity to redetermine the entire Medicaid population at once (hell they didn't have the capacity for normal determinations before COVID).

People with disabilities show up for progressive causes. People with disabilities saved the Affordable Care Act by risking their health and safety to protest at the Capitol, many dragged out by the police. But when a deadly pandemic devastates us, progressives aren't there."

For example, traditional gender roles being rejected by media to boost feminism. 
The media pushes the idea to enforce and protect an idea without having practical consequences in mind.
For instance: addressing the gender pay gap and blaming the patriarchy mainly. While so many other logical factors unrelated to gender are not addressed. Here it enforces the idea of feminism, while it doesn’t have to to solve the problem really.

Also, some kids in the Netherlands being taught about trans people, masturbation, sexuality. It enforces the inclusivity mindset, however, is it really necessary or do they just want to make the ‘mainstream’ media timid.

Thirdly, a diversity quota. The criteria here for a certain position is among other, more important factors, is your ethnicity or gender. That is purely to keep the ‘mainstream’ media content. The criterium for a certain position should be wether one can do it well or not, than it doesn’t matter if a certain ethnicity/gender can do it better. It only matter is the person is capable.

Thank You

Edit: not all media does this obviously, but some widespread do. NOS for example. Or accounts of people with a great following, like @politiekejongeren on instagram."

0,2023-04-25,"CMV: all social ethics topics (immigration, policing, race/gender/wokeness, etc.) are trivial nonsense compared to the gravity of factory farming",u/FaulmanRhodes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12z14rb/cmv_all_social_ethics_topics_immigration_policing/,changemyview,"I'm not here to tell you about why many factory farming methods are abusive: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive\_animal\_farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming)

What I'm here to state is that factory farming is not only a huge ethical problem for our society, it's a situation that has dire consequences for the entire world, but nobody fucking cares. That's my CMV - ""All the problems you think are bad with society? This one's worse.""

In terms of ethics, western society has a 'head buried in the sand' approach to farm animals. Some form of animal cruelty laws exist in all states. Trump even added a federal law against animal cruelty. Sounds like a win, too:

> The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act (PACT) is a bipartisan initiative that bans the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impalement or other serious harm to ""living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians."" 

And yet, we know for a fact that there are millions upon millions of pigs in the US right now who can't can't turn around or see sunlight for days at a time, are dying or sick from neglect, or are bred unto their literal death via birth canal rupture. And that's just the pigs!

My question is, what the fuck qualifies as ""other serious harm?"" If I'm a prosecutor given that law to enforce and I'm given video evidence of an owner committing these acts, why am I not going after the owner for 11,000 counts of animal cruelty? 

The obvious answer is dark money, lobbyists, whatever. My answer is: nobody fucking cares because we like hot dogs, we turn a blind eye and go back to stuff to which we can relate like Hunter Biden's laptop or the Chinese weather balloon or some other unimportant shit. There's no social pressure.

Now as far as the consequences for the world goes: virtually every developed nation uses factory farming to its extreme just like we do, which means land development ousting native species, animal manure messing with the ecosystem's stability, and **massive** greenhouse gas numbers people, right up there with cars and trucks. 

So where's the uproar? Why are unhinged PETA the only ones whining about this? If we've decided ""other serious harm"" is illegal to inflict on an animal, why are so many factory farmers getting away with **billions** of crimes every year? Seems like a big issue to me, ignored by SJW's. I just think about that, then see a story about ""X was denied entry to Y for being Z"" and just shake my head at our society's self-importance. I just - I just want you all to get the fuck over yourselves, you know? 

As a disclaimer, I hunt and enjoy the heck out of eating animals. If we had to reduce our animal output by 90% to properly curb animal cruelty, I'd be happy to pay $60 for a package of bacon. 

tl;dr we're all sitting cozy in our little parlor room arguing about whether drag queens are dangerous to kids while eating bacon wrapped bacon burgers from an animal that was essentially tortured for its entire short life and was raised in such great number that its shit is literally getting everywhere on the planet and fucking it up."

The current political landscape is very bizzare, as there are leftists and right wingers with their own solid fanbase, and then there are all the independents and moderates in the middle. 

The problem with the left is that they aren't pushing back hard enough. When you don't respond to attacks against you, all what you're doing is feeding towards the opposition. You won't lose your fanbase, but your side (ie the left) will constantly lose ground against the right.

The ultimate goal of politics is to win the other side over to your side, and if you are only posting and appealing towards your own fanbase, you aren't actually achieving anything in a wider perspective. Meanwhile, the right, like the Daily Wire, and their individual content creators, AJW, and many other are constantly attacking the left, and they are very effective at it, because it is constant, and the left doesn't try to counteract the attack. All what they do is try to satisfy their already echoechambered fanbase. 

While there are some small victories, in the grand scheme, the left is losing ground, and they will continue to lose ground even faster if they don't actually play the game properly."

Reasons:

No way to stop abusive power anymore because everything is so much more complex, as well the technology today makes it impossible for an everyday  citizen to stop the government/ 1%.

Operating on the last sentence, the one percent can exploit everybody for the work then leave for another more stable country.

We still have slavery we just use other countries so it's out of sight.

Basic human needs are still not met.

Kids still have no protection against abuse.

Racism is just as prevalent today as it was when owning people was allowed just hidden which makes it worse.

You have to be pushed to your limits to get a well paying job sacrificing your mental and physical health. 

There's no progress anymore everything good that was in place is being removed. 

The majority doesn't win anymore because of gerrymandering, 

Yes our healthcare is much better but it's starting to crumble because there not payed.

We still haven't moved on from abusive religion's.

Vulnerable people aren't taking care of and abused say people with disabilities, disabled people, people of other races, depending on what sex or even orientation, kids again and single parents

Overall there's all these problems that are getting worse and nothing can be changed.

Your best chance for an okay life is luck.

I am fairly sure that at this point Netflix sees diversity casting as nothing more than a meme and it's only a matter of time before we see a Black woman playing Hitler.

However, in all seriousness, this is a form of racism for a variety of reasons:

* Casting POC actors anachronistically erases the history of slavery and colonialism. The reason why so many Americans and Europeans are black is because of colonialism, multiracial casting is a form of rewriting history that hides an uncomfortable history, therefore a form of denial.
* Why not make movies and series about the histories of non white peoples rather than rewriting history? Rewriting European history to accomodate diversity rather than including non-European history in our culture conveys the idea that only white history is worth telling, and that POC are only needed as token diversity."

It seems to me that someone who originally consumed *Maid-Sama!* and did not realize this was at the time in deep denial or not paying attention. Misaki, the protagonist of the story constantly accused Usui, the love interest, of being a sexual harasser and this is not portrayed as an unreasonable opinion at all. The entire setup is that it's a romantic comedy where the love interest is a somewhat warped sexual harasser who enjoys getting under the skin of the protagonist. With [scenes such as this being quite common](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/c7/d5/7dc7d58fcd462420daa21dad021627ac.jpg) that highlight Usui's behavior, I'm not sure how anyone could have missed that. Even at the end, when Misaki finally admits to being in love with Usui, it's still done in the form of an emotional rant about how horrible the latter is, and how much of a creepy sexual harasser, but that the former fell in love regardless, and is ashamed of it and hates it.

I also believe missing this is rare because if one were to look up comment sections about such titles online with the people talking about it who enjoy it, most seem to be well aware of what it is. They typically seem to be well aware that the love interest is a sexual harasser, a stalker, and a creep, but enjoy the story, either regardless or due to it.

My view also lowkey contains that I'm actually somewhat sceptical that the people that claim they didn't see it back when they were teenagers did see it at the time, but their opinion on it simply changed and either altered their own memories, or are simply lying, because it's very, very hard to miss. In order to miss that Usui is a sexual harasser one either has to, while watching, mentally block out the 3 instances every episode that Misaki refers to him as such, or alter ones memories afterwards out of either nostalgia, or changed opinions."

I also acknowledge that I'm not required to, and I'm  not trying to force myself to like them - I'm just genuinely curious:  why do *you* like them and  Tolkien's writing style? What resonates with you? I'm specifically  interested in your opinions on the books (imho, I think the story works  better as a film so I get why folks are into the films, though I'm  pretty lukewarm on them).

For my background with the books - I didn't read much fantasy as a young kid  (probably the extent of the fantasy I read was Harry Potter, which is  pretty different in terms of feel/setting), and didn't attempt to read  The Hobbit until I was in middle school, and Struggled with it. It felt  so dry, the sentences felt like they went on forever without saying  anything, and if I wasn't reading it for school I would've quit. I  honestly couldn't tell you the plot of TH now without looking up the  wikipedia page.

As an adult, I wanted to give Tolkien another shot and thought maybe I'd have more luck if I tried Fellowship instead *and*  tried an audiobook vs physically reading it, but to no avail. I think I  made it maybe a few hours in and gave up. Still super dry, the  characters to me felt flat and uninteresting, the dryness made it very  difficult for me to picture any of the characters/scenes, and therefore  made it very difficult for me to care.

I'm  just so curious why a book series where people joke about the fact that  90% of it is just characters walking/the authors describing characters'  walking appeals to so many. I also want to clarify that in no way do I  think you have bad taste if you like these books - just because I found  them boring doesn't mean I think they're universally boring. They're  clearly beloved so there's something I'm not seeing or considering, or  it might not just be for me and I think that's fine too - different  strokes, different folks. I'm hoping I can come across something that'll  help me pick them up again and get through them, but in general I just  want to know what you think of them! Did I give up too quickly? Should I  try TH again as an adult instead? Is there a format that you think  would be better for a non-fantasy reader? What do you love about them?  What do you find flaws with, and what keeps you going despite those  flaws?"

Sure you can find all sorts of people talking about the side effects and the potential long term consequences, but these arguments they're making could just as easily be made about other medications that are prescribed with much less scrutiny to todays youth.

I can only speak best on ADHD medications from my own experience but I think my experiences have been similar amongst a lot of people with diagnosed ADHD from a young age. 

Puberty blockers and ADHD medications like Adderall and Ritalin are both prescribed while weighing the pros and cons and as long as your doctor thinks the pros outweigh the cons, you'll get your prescription. ADHD meds have a very real possibility to lead to addiction and dependence, puberty blockers can cause issues with bone density, these are real detriments that can't be ignored but what's the alternative? 

For me as a kid with ADHD and with others kids with it, I'm sure we made our parents lives a whole lot more difficult, school was difficult, studying was impossible, homework was impossible, I was constantly causing trouble at school and it was only getting worse, the school was having to come up with new ways to accommodate me that weren't even working, I was unhappy and my parents were unhappy. The risk of addiction and potential long term consequences could be justified when you're so unhappy and causing so much trouble that you feel like you can barely control.

With puberty blockers I feel that what a lot of parents and doctors are considering is the high suicide rate. Nobody can deny that the suicide rate for trans youth is *much* higher than their peers and that comes after risk of developing depression as well which you could be prescribed antidepressants for, another laundry list of medications with it's own side effects, complications and long term consequences to consider, but one that notably no one is worried about prescribing to the youth. 

If someone told me I had to choose between my child becoming depressed and being at a significantly increased risk of self self harm and suicide or starting them on a new medication that'll cause decreased bone density, other detrimental side effects like insomnia, fatigue and mood shifts as well as potential (but unlikely) long term consequences, I might be a little conflicted but in my opinion those consequences are worth it to reduce my childs risk of suicide. 

I don't see anyone talking about puberty blockers in this way, all I see is ""it causes chemical castration"" from people who don't understand what the term ""chemical castration"" even means and just think it sounds scary, ""it decreases bone density"" while conveniently ignoring the instructions from doctors to counteract that decrease in bone density, and ""it's permanently changing yoru body"" which is just a lie. If people are really concerned with the side effects, why aren't they more worried about things like Adderall being prescribed to kids? How many kids developed an addiction and OD'd or grew up and had to go to rehab, got arrested for selling the drugs, etc. people just ignore that despite it being a similar problem that they supposedly care about. The only reason I can think of is that these people are either just too stupid to think of anything the TV doesn't tell them to be scared of or they just hate trans people and don't actually care about the things they say they care about, they just want trans people to stop existing."
6,2023-04-26,CMV: There's nothing inherently wrong with participation trophies,u/Admirable_Ad1947,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/12zn7an/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with/,changemyview,"Hey guys! The concept of ""participation trophies"" has been a topic of right wing derision for quite a while now. However I don't think they're inherently bad at all and can even be good. To me, participation trophies are fine as long as A) it's clearly demarked as a participation trophy and the winning team gets a bigger prize in addition to it and B) the event is fairly low-stakes. The existence of participation trophies inspires kids to get up and try again if they fail. Let's say some kid joins the Little League soccer team and really busts their ass trying to win, giving 110%; in the final game his team loses by one point. If they're told ""you suck lol tough luck"" they'd probably lose motivation because their hard work did not pay off. In the next season they would likely choose to not join or do the bare minimum instead because they put in all that work for nothing.

However if instead they got a cheap Dollar Tree trophy/ribbon they'd know that all their work still led to *something*, even if it wasn't quite what they wanted (the bigger trophy). They'd be more likely to get back up and give it another go. In a country with a rampant obesity and loneliness crisis we should be encouraging people to exercise and participate in activities as much as possible. Studies show positive reinforcement is generally more effective then negative reinforcement at achieving desired outcomes [https://thesafetygeek.com/which-is-better-positive-or-negative-reinforcement/#:\~:text=Positive%20vs%20Negative%20reinforcement&text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20although,longer%20lasting%20behavior%20change%20effects](https://thesafetygeek.com/which-is-better-positive-or-negative-reinforcement/#:~:text=Positive%20vs%20Negative%20reinforcement&text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20although,longer%20lasting%20behavior%20change%20effects). Especially in low-stakes situations like this where there isn't any physical danger in losing. Finally, participation trophies can offer a fun memento to look back on later. 15 years down the line, this kid could find it in a box somewhere and think ""wow I had a lot of fun, even if I didn't win"". In short, I don't see the inherent problems with participation trophies and they can even have positive effects, given they follow the guidelines I laid out. CMV as to why participation trophies are bad!"

There is this person by the name of Richard Stallman who is the founder of the Free Software movement back in 1983. He developed an incomplete operating system called GNU that was meant to be a free *(free as in freedom not free as in free beer)* replacement for UNIX. He did this because he did not like how proprietary software limited and restricted users when it comes to control over their computing. The project and movement was a success with the release of the Linux kernel, GIMP, etc. Before we continue we need to define free software. **Free software** is software that respects the user's freedom to use, modify, and redistribute it and is not necessarily free of cost.

&#x200B;

On their website [gnu.org](https://gnu.org), they advocate only running freedom-respecting software on your computer and go as far as not to recommend Linux distributions that contain non-free software because it goes against the ethos of the movement. But avoiding proprietary software can be inconvenient if your school or workplace requires certain pieces of software to be used. Richard Stallman's response would be that freedom is more than worth the inconvenience and that proprietary software should be avoided and that one should strive to use 100% free and open source software on all of their devices if they value choice and control over their computing.

&#x200B;

Switching to GNU/Linux has given me more control over my computer and I could say that I have more of an ownership of my device than I did when I was running Windows, but I still rely on some non-free programs like *You Need A Budget*, *Steam*, and *Discord* to get my computing done and this leads to a question. *Am I willing to give up on proprietary/non-free software?* 

&#x200B;

This leads to another question for me. Is the freedom Richard Stallman is referring to worth the inconvenience for me? Is the free software movement worth fighting and advocating for? Should proprietary software be rejected? This is why I am here. I am here to present my view that proprietary software should be avoided and one should use a 100% freedom respecting FSF approved distribution or Debian GNU/Linux (which is 100% freedom respecting software but has non-free software in its repos, but that's a technical issue). Or should I enjoy Ubuntu, a free operating system, while still relying on few non-free programs just for the sake of convenience and the argument that the configuration is still better than running a non-free OS like Windows or macOS.

If someone does not love you for the reason(s) that you want to be loved for, then I don't see why you should be with that person. That would be similar to settling for them.

You may think, ""*Does it matter why they're with you? As long as you two are compatible and they're adding to your life, should that not be enough*?""

No, because if their love for you is not ""real"" - in other words, if they don't love you in a way that you yourself would consider to be ""authentic"" love, then are you even being loved at that point? Why would you want to be in a relationship with them, unless you are doing it for practical reasons?

I'm not saying that anyone's version of ""love"" is right or wrong, it's all subjective. The point is that, if they are not fulfilling whatever the definition of ""love"" is to you, then you should not be with them, except if you are both in an agreement to be in a ""loveless"" relationship, like in a ""friends with benefits"" type of situation but you're living together.

If someone is feeling empty because they are missing their special person in life and they want to be loved in a way that no one could love them, then I think it would be better for them if they came to terms with never experiencing true love. Their void will never be filled regardless of what happens, so they should avoid relationships and instead focus on living their life in the most satisfying way they can."

I disagree with any liberals who say that equality is inherently valuable, or that there are such things as intrinsic human rights (for any groups).

Yet I find myself agreeing with liberals on specific issues, albeit for conservative reasons... the main one having to do with competition on both individual and national levels.

For example, while I don't believe we should defend equality for its own sake, I do think there should be more income equality in the US as a means to spurring competition in our economy, in education, in technology, and so forth.

Likewise, while I don't believe any minority groups have inherent rights, as nobody has ever proven that such universal, intrinsic rights exist, I still prefer to live in a society in which all minority groups are thriving as this makes for more competition within our country and also makes us a stronger nation as a whole in the face of competition or conflict with other countries.

For similar reasons, I also agree with the left on climate change, abortion, and a few other issues.

So I tend to think of myself as a conservative with liberal views.

It could be objected that my overarching ""conservative philosophy"" doesn't matter if it doesn't distinguish me from a typical liberal. But I think it does. For reasons that I won't fully spell out here, I think certain levels of conflict and competition are inevitable on the global scale. So while a more liberal minded person might hope for a world in which adversarial relationships disappear and that we embrace our common humanity, I think that's unrealistic and thus embrace a nationalistic political attitude that supports our nation and allies over adversaries (like Russia and China). \[And just to be clear, I don't support any form of nationalism that puts one race or religion over others in our country.\]

In sum, I think we should build up all of our communities and cultural groups, not for liberal reasons of guilt, morality, or universal human rights, but simply because it's better for us to be stronger than weaker, more prosperous than less prosperous, and suchlike."

The exception would be if the traffic police officer has *reasonable suspicion* or *probable cause* that an individual failed to purchase a fare, such as witnessing the person walk past the gates without buying.

My reasoning is that to drive a car, a driver license is required such as a ticket is required to ride the train. You are not required to show police your driver license simply because you are driving, therefore you should not be required to show traffic police your traffic ticket simply because you choose to take a train.

This distinction to me appears to be an example of a tiered system in the country for the rich and the poor. The driving and the public transport takers and this is unacceptable to me.

0,2023-04-26,CMV: Human civilization is justified in causing mass extinction and climate change,u/phdecudashudawuda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13045do/cmv_human_civilization_is_justified_in_causing/,changemyview,"I believe that all the ""damage"" done to the Earth by human civilization up to this point is justified. There's a few points that, when considered together, lead me to this conclusion.

1) First and most important: Humans are the only hope life has for surviving the destruction of Earth. There is a hard limit for the habitability of Earth. This limit will be reached in about one billion years when the sun expands and boils away all the oceans, leaving this planet incapable of supporting life. This will be the end of Earth-based life forever, unless it somehow escapes to another habitat. That's the MAXIMUM limit; there's several other things that could destroy Earth earlier, although they are unlikely.

So far, us humans are the only organisms that have left this planet. Think about it: Life started ~3.7 billion years ago. It's taken 3.7 BILLION years for life to develop to the point were any species is capable of getting off the planet. We only have 1 billion years left. *Life on this planet is 78% through its lifespan*. So although some might say 1 billion years is too far away to care, it's actually quite short in the scale of the universe and how long life has been around. If anything, life is like a student that procrastinated his final project until the last 3 weeks, except if he doesn't complete the project everything on Earth dies.

We must progress civilization to the point that we are capable of starting colonies off-world. This is extremely difficult, hence why no other species has managed to do it in the ~500 million years since complex animals first appeared. Humans are the only ones to ever approach that level of civilization. We still haven't reached it - we could be centuries or millenniums away still, if we make it that far. 

So we've established that Earth has a relevant time-limit, and humans have shown the only capacity to save life as we know it.


2) The damage caused to the environment in pursuit of the enhancement of human society is a temporary and unavoidable. 

I count human civilization are starting when agriculture was invented ~10,000 years ago. Before then, we lived more ""natural"" lifestyles of hunting and gathering like most other animals. Agriculture is when we started altering our environment to a much larger extent and in a way that some consider ""unnatural"". I don't believe it's any more unnatural than a beaver building a dam, or an ant colony farming aphids. Humans are just by far the best at it. 

A civilization that is simultaneously capable of spreading to new star systems and also causing no damage to the environment would be extraordinarily advanced. Certainly far, far more advanced that we are currently. I believe that we should strive to achieve this level of technology and society. This would essentially be utopia; at this point, there would be no risk of all of life becoming extinct, and humanity would live in perfect harmony with nature.


However, it's impossible to reach this level without first progressing through our current stages. You can't go from hunters and gatherers to astronauts. You have to first build farms capable of sustaining large populations. You have to build cities and infrastructure. You have to create a system that incentivizes people to push technological progress. You have to attain a high level of scientific understanding of the universe. All of this comes from the hard labor and ingenuity of humans. It also requires an enormous amount of resources. 

Environmental activists may feel that humanity is poisoning the Earth with gas emissions, toxic chemicals, plastics, etc. It has also been claimed that we are currently in the middle of a mass extinction event, which I agree with. Again, my claim isn't that things things aren't happening; it's that humanity is justified in doing them. I think that climate change and pollution are serious issues and should be taken care of as soon as possible. 

But we could not have gotten to this level of advancement without utilizing agriculture, changing our environment in extreme ways, or using hazardous chemicals. Oil and gas are not ideal, but once we reach our goal of 100% renewable energy (solar, geothermal, etc) we will be able to handle to situation. I don't see any way we could have skipped using oils/gasses in our civilizations development. It's not feasible to go from a pre-industrial society to being 100% renewable energy with no stepping stone. And by the time humanity even realized the harm that these things were doing, it was already integrated into every facet of society so our only realistic choice was to continue. So we cannot be blamed for using them as long as we realize it is only a stepping stone to something more sustainable.


One caveat: Wanton destruction/killing of the environment with no purpose is not justified since it doesn't serve towards civilization advancement. However, I think the vast majority of people already agree with this. Society as a whole does it's best to avoid useless destruction. On an individual level humans who start forest fires for fun, torture animals, or anything of the sort are obviously terrible and not justified. I don't think this invalidates my point because I'm speaking more towards society/civilization standards as a whole.


3) We have no evidence any other species would do this better than us. If we *don't* eventually spread off-world, this will mean that we either just remained stagnant for the next billion years, and therefore die with everything else, or it can mean we went extinct and never got the chance. If we go extinct, the only hope for life is that some other species develops after us that can take life off-Earth. However, even if an intelligent enough species does evolve and accomplish this, there's no reason to believe they would be much better at this than us. We all start from scratch and learn as we go, mostly from trial-and-error. So wishing that humanity would die is not a solution because it may lead back to the same position, just with less time left. Essentially, humanity is not abnormally slow/destructive in our advancement of civilization. Therefore, since we have the most time to work with, we are the best choice.

These points will lead to the conclusion:  **(TL;DR)**

Human civilization is morally obligated to achieve a level of civilization capable of spreading to new star systems in order to save life as we know it. We are the best, and perhaps the only, species capable of doing so. Causing damage to the environment is an unavoidable, but ideally temporary, consequence of trying to achieve this goal. Therefore, human civilization is justified in doing so in the pursuit of our goal.

Edit: I am also assuming that with technological advancements, we will be able to heal a lot of the damage we are currently doing. We will be able to control climate change, and hopefully have found sustainable energy sources that don't cause any harm. I don't think this is a huge assumption -  we're only a few centuries at most from this level of technology. Humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, so you have to be very pessimistic to think we won't last that long. Even if we blow ourselves back to the stone age it's only a few thousands year set back.

Edit 2: Copying my response to a comment because I think it's relevant to this all:  I guess I just wanted to see if anyone would be able to change my mind whether the ends justify the means, since thats what my argument boils down to. I'm basically saying that all the death and destruction now are worth it, because the amount of future life that will be created is so much larger than that amount being negatively affected now.

So in order to change my view you would have to convince me my assumptions are unrealistic, and therefore our goal will not be accomplished and the destruction was for nothing.

Or you could convince me that ends do not justify the means. In some cases I agree that ends don't justify the means, but since this is an end-of-the-world scenario, it would take a very strong argument to convince me of that."

If prisons function as quarantining criminals, then it would work much better, since you can quarantine dangerous criminals, without really punishing them. So, if prisons function as quarantine, raising prison time would always be a good idea.

Public schools cannot endorse or promote any particular religious belief or practice, and must remain neutral on matters of religion.

In practical terms, this means that public schools cannot require or lead students in prayer, display religious symbols or materials, or promote any particular religious belief in the classroom. While public schools may teach about religion as part of a secular education, they must do so in an objective and neutral manner that does not endorse or promote any particular religious belief.

The rationale behind this is to protect religious freedom and prevent the government from imposing or favoring any particular religious belief or practice over others. It also recognizes that religion is a deeply personal and individual choice that should not be influenced or coerced by the government.

Overall, the separation of church and state is an important principle in the United States, and the Establishment Clause ensures that public schools remain neutral on matters of religion and respect the diverse beliefs and backgrounds of all students.

**APPLYING LOGIC TO HISTORY, CULTURAL STUDIES, AND LITERATURE:**

Given the increasing divisiveness in American society around history, cultural studies, and literature, it would be much cleaner and less contentious if we just agreed to pull those issues out of public curriculum as well.  

Parents - and whatever private institutions they want for their children - can teach children about history, culture, and literature with the time and money that public schools don't have to take up on it. (e.g. via vouchers)

Sure, there would be echo chambers and disinformation; but, the marketplace of ideas would eventually iron-out those wrinkles. Just as we can't legislate morality, neither can we legislate open-mindedness or critical thinking.  But that doesn't mean we can't have those things in society - it just means legislation and battles over curriculum isn't the place for it.

All the culture wars in the classroom are simply distracting from educational outcomes we actually want. And they aren't resulting in greater empathy or civil discourse - if anything, quite the opposite.

Certainly, there will be some equity issues (e.g. not all families or communities will have as much time or money to educate their children as others), but that isn't a sufficient reason to support the status quo, because *the system we have now suffers from those problems, too.*

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: It seems that our society is becoming increasingly fractured and divisive.  I have a growing suspicion that the actual friction that results isn't because we don't see the world the same way - it's that we are fighting over whose view of the world will be taught in schools. So let's stop arguing about it and get on with our lives.

Edit - examples of problems my proposed solution would make irrelevant: 

(1) LGBTQ+ Rights: The rights of LGBTQ+ students in public schools have been a controversial topic for years, with some individuals arguing that these students should be protected from discrimination, while others believe that promoting LGBTQ+ ideology in schools conflicts with their personal beliefs.

(2) Prayer in School: The debate over prayer in public schools has been ongoing for decades, with some individuals arguing that prayer is a fundamental part of their religious beliefs and should be allowed in schools, while others believe that public schools should be a secular space that is free from any religious influence or coercion.

(3) Texas Ten Commandments Law: The Texas legislature passed a law that allowed the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools and government buildings. This law sparked controversy, with some arguing that it violated the separation of church and state and was therefore unconstitutional, while others believed that it was an appropriate way to recognize the role of religion in American history and culture.

(4) Critical Race Theory: The teaching of Critical Race Theory in public schools has sparked controversy, with some individuals arguing that it promotes a divisive narrative regarding race and racism, while others argue that it is essential for understanding systemic oppression.

(5) Sex Education: Sex education in schools has been a controversial topic for years, with some parents arguing that it is not appropriate for schools to teach such material, while others believe that it is essential for students to receive comprehensive sex education.

Several people have argued that although my position is neutral, it would benefit their ideological opponents; and,
(1) they don't want an ideologically-neutral outcome;
(2) that they want to win the culture war; and
(3) therefore they don't want to end (avoid) the culture war

While I recognize people may hold beliefs that it is a good thing to win the culture war and for their ideology to be imposed on others, I just want to be honest that this is not a persuasive approach to ""Change My View"" - as I am against using the state to impose ideology on others."

This view is from an American perspective, but hear me out.

It's clear that 2023 is a very bad time to be alive, what with governments rolling back rights, seemingly a new war every month, and what have you. I believe that Oceania is the best place to be safe from it all. Here's my case:

**NORTH  AND SOUTH AMERICA:** If you live in the US like I do, you'll already know that the Supreme Court is on a feeding frenzy, stripping rights away from citizens left and right. They've already taken away abortion rights, with LGBTQ+ rights, environmental protections, and civil liberties next on the chopping block. You also have expensive health care and a school shooting almost every day. If Trump becomes President again (which I believe he will), he might set his sights on Canada. However, Mexico is in far greater danger, because Republicans are already lining up behind his plan to attack that country to defeat the drug cartels. Many innocent civilians would be caught in the crossfire. Moreover, a war in Mexico would have many downstream effects on other countries in Latin America and lead to general instability around the whole region. See what's happening in...

**EUROPE:**There's a war in Ukraine that is only escalating further by the day. Putin has spoken of bombing Paris and London, and he's already attacked Poland and faced no consequences for doing so. This shows that Article 5 of NATO is toothless - it might as well be toilet paper. Ukrainian refugees are pouring into nearby countries, but these nations won't be safe for long once Putin turns his attention to Moldova, Romania, and the aforementioned Poland. NATO will have to be more actively involved in the war at some point, or else Russia will conquer all of Europe and start committing genocide against them.

**ASIA:** The Middle East is pretty much a mess, and each country within it is a brutal theocracy. Without Russia to help keep the peace in Central Asia, that region is likely to become a war zone as well; look at the clashes between Armenia/Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan/Tajikistan. This is to say nothing of East Asia, where China looks likely to invade Taiwan given Russia's success in Ukraine. And if China invades Taiwan, and the US intervenes, it's World War III.

**AFRICA:** Look at what's happening in Sudan. Most other African countries aren't much better off right now. Most African countries are either theocracies, war zones, or both. Enough said.

**SMALLER PACIFIC ISLANDS:** They'll all be underwater pretty soon thanks to climate change.

This leaves Australia and New Zealand. I'm not calling either country a utopia by any means, but they seem to be the safest and best place to live in 2023. I'm open to changing my view, though, so I look forward to seeing what you all think."

Even before microtransactions/loot boxes were the norm with mobile games today, I thought mobile phone games were never good to begin with. First, in the flip/feature phone days, these games (and other mobile content, such as ringtones and wallpapers) were often advertised ~~with~~ by the way of premium-rate services designed to inflate your mobile bill/credits usage to the point it's coercively impossible to unsubscribe. Second, a number of those games tend to be clones/ports of existing games on technically superior devices and/or licensed shovelware on tier of those on GBA/DS (especially those ""3D"" ones).

Also, in the early app store days, even when paid games were still the norm, some of them still contains microtransactions. Although one can argue it was less pushy, it's still there because they want the cash flow going. There's also the issue of touch/keypad controls being mostly horrendous/unintitutive for those games to begin with.

Currently there are debates across all platforms about transgender athletes competing in the sports categories and gender identities with which they identify rather than their necessarily assigned gender.  This post is not meant to argue for or against either side of this debate.

There are those on both sides of this that want to throw out biological differences between biological men and women, and the only solution I can see that would satisfy this debate would be to remove gendered athletics.

The fact that we are evolving as humans and gender is becoming a spectrum rather than a binary, immutable decision made by nature is my evidence for this proposal.  We are blending the lines that separate us at cultures, societies, genders, etc.  We must enact changes to accommodate this, and athletics should not remain left behind, binary and outdated.

So, while many great comments are still being made, I'm going to refrain from replying.  Sorry.

Watching a lecture on WW2 and as we go over the fall of France, I can't help but notice the similarities between their weaknesses and today's USA.

France had the largest military in Europe, with equal or superior technology as the Germans.  Yet, none of that mattered when the Germans crushed them in a matter of months.  All due to 2 key weaknesses: political divide and outdated tactics.  Quick mobility and emphasis on armored vehicles made trench warfare near obsolete.  When the French faced early losses, they weren't able to rally or make any sort of comeback due to infighting in both military and government leadership.

Present day USA has the largest military with all the newest gadgets money can buy.  Yet, just like the French in WW2, I think we could be ripe for the picking.  Our country is extremely divided.  I don't know specifics about our military leadership, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is also split on party lines.  Our military has been engaged in very specific missions that would not reflect warfare with another powerful country.  It's been hunting terrorists among civilian populations, and even at that we've been thoroughly humiliated.  Vietnam, Afghanistan.

As far as threats go I'm not scared of Russia, seeing their military blunder just as much as ours in Ukraine.  Which leaves China.  China has mighty economy, large population, and advanced enough tech to do the job.  Their fascist leadership and use of propaganda may be morally weak, but it ensures a united country.  They hate USA ideologies, and are Empirically inclined for conquest.  We might have even seen foreshadowing of their intentions with their spotted spy balloons and culture attack as seen with Tiktok.

**How it would play out**

I see it happening much like Germany conquered France in WW2.

* First the Germans attacked Belgium, drawing in the allied troops.  It was a trap and their army was quickly encircled.
* China would attack Taiwan, drawing in USA navy and possibly even land troops for a potential trap.
* Then the Germans pounded straight for Paris, while the leadership of France floundered and bickered amongst themselves.
* Okay, here is why I say in the 2024 election.  If the Chinese wait to strike shortly after the election the timing will be perfect.  Trump loses and is put in jail, causing nearly half the country to riot.  As the Chinese come to conquer our land our leadership flounders and bickers.  President asks for declaration of war, but congress won't due it because they don't want political opponent to have that much power.  Meanwhile military leadership communication is poor due to cross-party lines not trusting each other.  Hell, the military might even be occupied dealing with alt-right uprising in our country.
* Just like that, Chinese troops pour over USA soil while our troops watch it happen, waiting for a failed leadership to take substantial action.  The White house is taken.  Maybe leadership evacuates elsewhere, but its already over.  There is no country to rally against the invasion: everyone is nearly in civil war already.

**Expected counterpoints**

*What about nukes?*  I don't think would play a factor.  Russia isn't even using nukes against a non-nuke country they are at war with.  No country will use nukes against a country that has nukes.  Better to let another government take over than doom humanity.

*USA is so much farther from China than France was from Germany.*  This is the biggest flaw I already see in my view.  However, I think with how fast and efficient planes have become they could fly over a lot of troops in a short time period.  They could land nearby in a weaker country like Mexico or Canada if need be.  Also, there's the possibility of stealthed ships or submarines having prepared by making the journey weeks in advance.

**Deltas**

* It would be difficult to bring over heavy armor across the ocean.  Just troops and planes is a lot harder to take USA with.
* An invasion force wouldn't have a supply chain.
* Japan sits between USA and China, making any move across the Pacific more difficult.
* Washington is on Atlantic coast.  China would come across Pacific.
* US is one of China's top food importers.  They would need to conquer US quickly or suffer huge food deficit.
* Didn't think I would give a delta on this point, but having so many guns in our country would make it difficult for an occupying force.  Possibly too costly.
* China could be fearing Russia too much to make any big moves right now.
* US troops have been seeing action, China's haven't.
* The fuel cost and logistics for flying an army across the Pacific are not achieved by China."

Convince me that their ultimate bottom line goal is anything else.

They don’t care about religious freedom, they just want Christianity to be permeate all aspects of the country and it’s culture.

They don’t care about small government, they just want a straight, white Christian making the decisions.

They don’t care about immigration, as long as the immigrants are Christian Europeans.

This is coming from a US born ,Muslim, well educated, and generally privileged middle class Gen Z who is straight and has parents immigrated here from Pakistan.

2,2023-04-27,cmv: The European Dark Ages are Real,u/cedarofthewest,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/131byac/cmv_the_european_dark_ages_are_real/,changemyview,"For context I've seen multiple supposedly scholarly sources make the rather absurd claim the European dark ages never happened, even a little bit.

For anyone who's studied mid to late Europeans middle age history, this just seems patently false.

PRIOR to discussion, i do think the time period associated with dark ages is oddly chosen, for the worst time to be alive in middle age Europe probably began in 1315 with ""The Great Famine"", which possibly coincided with the early beginning of ""The Little Ice Age"".

And I would suggest that the 13th-15th centuries were the cauldron that solidified the long-term effects of the ""darker part"" of the European Middle Ages.

ANYWAYS on we go
----
Shortly after the great famine had subsided, in the mid 1300's the *black death* began. I should not need to even comment on the potential death tolls and mortality rate, but it appears that mortality rate was possibly somewhere around 40% for septicemic plague, and as ""good"" as 15% depending on the type of plague . 

However, thanks to generally poor hygiene and sanitation conditions in many European cities, some estimate higher mortality rates especially in certain areas.

Today, genetic science has linked some genes associated with increased risk of certain autoimmune diseases, to the Black Death, with these genes assumed to have had protective effects against mortality during the plague.

----
AT THE SAME TIME - centered in France, a conflict referred to as the hundred years war was occurring. Though not continuous and happening primarily in three periods over 116 years, it was often brutal on the peasants who were at times raided for food and supplies for armies on any side of the conflict.

Add all this together (plague, famine, war along with many other things) and the 13th century in western Europe is a strong competitor for the most disastrous century for European populations after the fall of the Roman empire. 

----

*The Broader Medieval Argument*

 I would argue that the people that lived through the centuries of religious acculturation, under increasingly powerful and hierarchical religious structures, during the european middle ages, slowly had their perception of the world shifted to magical, but also fear soaked versions of reality.

There are very real examples (who hasn't heard of the Salem witch trials) of how this type of ""satan is real"" and ""demons are everywhere"" thinking has been carried down to the recent past and even to this very day.

Personally i was raised in a fundamentalist group with older people who truly believed demons were real AND they had SEEN them or experienced their evil presence. 

I would even argue hellfire (in my opinion the most barbaric and least biblical christian dogma) is largely medieval in origin, but if i'm not careful i might end up debating that point

Finally - Add the fact that Greek philosophy was not effectively reintroduced until the italian renaissance after the fall of the byzantine empire and the subsequent migration of scholars in 1453, and you develop a picture of ""just what in the hell was going on in europe during the mid to late period of the middle ages""

IN CONCLUSION - We don't have to call them the ""dark ages"", and we can talk about **timing**, but ultimately i don't the think the name and a precise date boundary matter all that much, because to deny the difficulties of the European middle ages seems, to me, like a completely unnecessary game of apologetics.

tl;dr - The European Middle Ages were characterized by difficulties so profound that at times, people literally thought God was either directly punishing or trying to kill them lol. I would even suggest that any reasonable person would identify the 13th-15th centuries as the cauldron that solidified the long-term effects of the ""darker part"" of the European Middle Ages"
0,2023-04-27,"CMV: The dealing in and keeping of exotic and wild pets by the general public should be legal, with a high degree of accountability.",u/thelink225,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/131ci89/cmv_the_dealing_in_and_keeping_of_exotic_and_wild/,changemyview,"This is a position I have held for a while — but I watched [a live stream yesterday by the YouTube channel Clint's Reptiles](https://www.youtube.com/live/mLGxp8gmAq0?feature=share) about the Holy Thursday Massacre down in Florida, where the state killed someone's pet snakes that had been declared illegal, and one that was perfectly legal. There's a lot more to the story than just that, and I don't really want to hash out the specifics here. But what I do want to hash out is something that the host, Clint, talked about in his live stream. He suggested that it should be legal to keep exotic, wild, potentially invasive, and even dangerous pets — up to and including things like big cats — for the sake of harm reduction. I have held this position for some time myself, but he articulated my thoughts about the matter better than I had previously, as well as adding a few more angles to it that I hadn't thought of. As I am feeling more confident in this position than ever, I wanted to bring it before CMV to test it for any other perspectives or angles that I might not have thought of, which might still cause me to reconsider. I want to make sure that confidence is warranted — and if not, that my thinking adjusts appropriately.

The basic idea is this: people *are* going to keep exotic and wild pets. It's just simply going to happen. No matter how bad of an idea you think it might be, someone is going to want to keep a raccoon, a serval, a king cobra, a lion, or whatever. No matter how tightly you crack down, you're not going to be able to stop people from acquiring these animals from the wild — and in most cases you aren't going to stop people from transporting them and dealing in them. You might be able to cut it down considerably, especially on island countries or places with very authoritarian regimes — but, especially in the latter case, that's going to come at a high social cost that is likely to be reflected in political and social stability. Especially when mistakes and abuses occur, like what happened down in Florida.

Of course, the flip side of this is that there can be serious negative impacts to the environment, safety, and animal welfare through the trade and keeping of wild and exotic pets. I'm sure I don't need to explain the amount of poaching and animal abuse this contributes to. Additionally, as is the concern down in Florida, non-native animals which escape or get released into the wild can become invasive species if they are able to establish a breeding population, which can have devastating effects on native ecosystems. And, in many cases, there's also the risk of the animal hurting someone, and not necessarily just its keeper, especially if that animal were to get loose unsupervised. There is a very long list of reasons why keeping wild and exotic pets can be a very bad idea for the vast majority of the human population. I acknowledge all of this. In fact, I would appeal to this long list of reasons why it's a bad idea as evidence *for* my position, not against it.

My position is that the best way to prevent and mitigate these abuses is harm reduction, not prohibition. Prohibition is generally ineffective, unless the thing being prohibited is unequivocally more harmful than the enforcement of the prohibition, IE: murder, theft, etc;. It's reasonable to prohibit these things. But we see how badly prohibition fails with things like drug prohibition, alcohol prohibition, prohibition of sex work, and so on. This kind of prohibition inevitably results in three negative side effects.

Firstly, it requires more powerful, pervasive, and invasive law enforcement to enforce, which has the aforementioned negative effects on social and political stability. It increases the likelihood that abuses and tragedies perpetrated by law enforcement will occur — as well as constricting the rights of the public as a whole and thereby reducing quality of life.

Secondly, it has the effect of funding a black market. Since the demand for these things still exists, the prohibition against them only causes the price to rise, making it more lucrative for criminals to fill that demand. This in turn funds organized crime, which increases the risk of criminal violence for the entire population, resulting in a greater need for law enforcement, creating a feedback loop of more of the first problem I mentioned. More organized crime requires more law enforcement, making that organized crime even more lucrative, creating more organized crime, requiring more law enforcement — and all the while the whole population suffers.

Thirdly and finally, there's the additional harm and risk that simply practicing these things in secret, in order to hide from the law, creates. We can see this plainly with drugs and sex work, how lack of oversight of these things results in drugs laced with more dangerous substances, or human trafficking and abuse of sex workers. In the case of exotic and wild animals, this comes in the form of poaching, animals being kept in poor or dangerous conditions, keepers who have no idea what they're doing, and potentially invasive or dangerous animals being released into the wild when they figure out they bit off more than they can chew if there's no option to surrender the animal without opening themselves up to legal consequences. Since all of these things are happening underground in secret, it makes it difficult to mitigate this abuse.

The solution? You make a reasonable, attainable legal path for someone who wants to own, deal in, or breed these animals to do so — conditional on them proving that they can and are doing so responsibly. How strict this accountability would be would obviously depend on the animal, the danger it posed to people and the local environment, and the danger posed to the animal and it's species if it were to be mishandled or sourced unethically. For some animals, there may be little to nothing required — taking in a North American possum, for instance, isn't likely to have a huge impact on the wild population, nor are they really a danger to people, nor do they seem to be particularly hard to care for (top Google search suggests otherwise, but everything else I've seen contradicts it). On the other hand, if you want to keep something like a tiger, you should have to prove that you know enough to take care of it, that you have the means and facilities to take care of it, giving it a good quality of life and making sure that it can't get loose and hurt someone, and pretty much anything else that a zoo or a wildlife rescue would have to show in order to operate — though we might bump the standards up a little bit, since zoos aren't always a good and ethical example here. You should have to prove that the animal was not acquired through poaching, or other illegal means, unless you're rescuing it from someone who so acquired it. You should be subject to regular surprise inspections of the animal, its enclosure, its health, and anything else pertinent. The argument should be made that you should have liability insurance for the animal. And it should be a matter of public record every such animal that you're keeping.

Might it be a bit difficult to jump through all these hoops? Sure. And probably really expensive for some animals. But for the price of not having to hide from the law to keep your pet, as long as these hoops weren't just completely unreasonable, people would do it. There would always be some exceptions — but it would more than likely cut down the illegal animal trade, and the number of illegal animals kept, significantly. And with this level of oversight, and with potential ways to obtain these animals legally, ethically, and without doing significant environmental harm — you would likely see the amount of poaching and the criminal animal trade decrease, as the financial incentive for these activities would also decrease. All of this would translate to less animal abuse, fewer potentially invasive species released into the wild, and less risk to the public from potentially dangerous animals. Of course, you won't eliminate all of that completely, and I'm not claiming you would — only that it could be significantly decreased by legalization and harm reduction as opposed to prohibition.

Of course, there might also be some exceptions to all of this, animals that simply were too much of a potential problem to legalize, or where ethical sourcing was simply impossible for any of a number of reasons. Presenting a few such examples will not be enough to change my view, as I acknowledge this possibility. But my claim is that this is the exception, and not the rule. What would change my view is bringing to light some significant factor that I have not considered, which would cast reasonable doubt on my position as I've laid it out here. I'm not really sure what that would be at the moment, but that's why I'm making this post. I want to see if there are any points I haven't considered that would be able to change my view before I firmly adopt this position and start advocating for it.

Edit: TL;DR requested, so here's a summary of my main points.

• Keeping exotic and wild pets should be legal for the general public.

• It should be conditional on a potentially high degree of oversight, appropriate to the specific animal in question, in terms of how it is kept, where it is sourced from, and so on.

• This is for the sake of harm reduction. Making it legal and allowing it to happen in the open, with a high degree of accountability, will decrease the amount of abuse, poaching, and crime that occurs around the trade and keeping of exotic animals, as well as potential negative environmental impacts. Prohibition incentivizes criminal activity by driving up the price and making it more profitable, making it harder to mitigate the harm of these activities."
0,2023-04-27,"CMV: The US does NOT need a high-speed rail network similar to China, Japan and Europe",u/ConsCom1949,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/131cqy3/cmv_the_us_does_not_need_a_highspeed_rail_network/,changemyview,"Define high speed rail as: conventional (non-maglev) railway with trains running at 250~400 km/h.

Point 1: High speed rail has advantage in the medium-length range intercity travel, maybe 150 km (about half an hour) to 1,500 km (5~6 hours). Below 150 km it's more reasonable to drive or travel by normal rail, above 1,500 km it's better to fly. Beijing and Shanghai are 1,318 km apart with multiple big cities located about 100~500 km apart from each other along the way, that's what makes it the most profitable and popular railway line in East Asia (or maybe even the whole world!), as the two largest cities in China are linked by a 4h 18m (shortest time) train ride. However American cities are concentrated on the East and West coasts and are generally either too sparse or too dense. It's more sensible to either drive or fly. 

Point 2: High speed rail is already an old technology. Japan will open a 500+ km/h Maglev line soon and China is experimenting with 1000 km/h Maglev. By the time an HSR network is completed it's probably already called ""low-speed rail"" or ""conventional rail"" as Maglev lines open around the world. 

Point 3: American cities are less populous than Japanese, Chinese or Korean ones, making less potential HSR passengers.

Point 4: America has a driving culture and almost every family has a car. There are many families in China who don't have a car and instead travel by HSR. But many Americans would rather drive than travel by rail even if it means more time and financial cost in most occasions."
2,2023-04-27,"CMV: AI will have far more greater harm than good on humanity, and those developing it are partaking in an immoral act.",u/GamingNomad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/131cva1/cmv_ai_will_have_far_more_greater_harm_than_good/,changemyview,"&#x200B;

While I'm sure AI can be good (see: Star Trek or any futuristic utopian setting), the current global situation and the way humanity is won't benefit from it. I don't think this is specifically about our *modern* situation, it's just how humanity has always been and -most likely- will always be. Humans seek value, and will to benefit themselves, we are not purely altruistic.



AI will displace humans out of jobs that previously required mental effort. Copy writing, content creation, writing articles etc. Inlucing producing visual art. Companies will these programs and tools instead of relying on humans. 



1) While some may argue that the level of skill isn't the same (which is a reasonable claim *currently*) the gap in skill isn't great enough for many companies to care about.  While big companies or projects will seek out top talent, the majority of the work force won't find vacancies with smaller or medium companies.



2) Previously human physical labor could be replaced with machines, but the reason this hasn't taken over completely was because these machines were very expensive. AI tools and programs are not so expensive as to be a financial burden.



It isn't necessary (as some may imagine) to *completely* remove humans from the workforce to create a dystopia. Unemployment at 10% is a problem, if that skyrockets it will be enough to create dystopian poverty.



Going back to my first paragraph, some have argued that AI will give us a chance to build a utopia, however I find this to be based on little other than pointless hope. It's no different than saying there's a chance Jeff Bezos might decide next to give away his entire fortune. Companies and powerful entities in power would never let go of wealth without sufficient reason.



UBI is a great idea but there's no reason to actual think it might happen. The only probable solution to this problem is if governments decide to put heavy restrictions on companies utilizing AI, but not only is that chance unreliable, even if it did happen the restrictions most likely won't be enough to deter the negative outcomes.



I don't have enough of an opinion to talk about other points, although I do believe in them, such as problems in logistics, where AI can flood institutions with submissions to the point where human submissions are pushed out (accordig to an article on The Verge). Or how art can lose its meaning and people cna just use it to produce their own music (such as the Drake AI). A big part of the issue is that even low-quality AI content can be severely harmful.



Given all that, I've come to consider that people partaking in developing AI are performing an immoral act by harming humanity (I would not call these people immoral themselves, simply the act). Yet many do so out of a belief in the necessity to ""progress"" believing that advancement is an objective good and that no harm can come out of it. Or that that they do it because they can, or they do it because they know it will happen and they just want to be a part of it (instead of choosing not to support it).



The only counter-arguments I hear are ""people said the same thing about cars or computers"", and to be honest the difference between mechanical machines and AI are so vast I don't believe this argument is even worth addressing.



However, I'm open to the concept that there's reasonable argument for AI actually being a *good* thing now and later on in history, and that this probability isn't merely hinged on blind hope. So I'm trying to see if I can change my view."

What honestly is the counterargument to this? I'm sure people are going to immediately bring up some logical fallacies, like ""How come they don't care after the baby is born?!?"" (Red herring, folks).

From the pro-life point of view, an abortion is the equivalent of a mother killing a one year old because they do not want to deal with it.

The only counterpoint I can think of is to dismiss their belief as utterly wrong--and I find this *supremely*ironic, given that liberal values espouse acceptance of other's beliefs and opinions.

So, how do you honestly counter this argument while giving their opinion some weight?"

You'd need to build many hundreds of miles of vacuum pumps across the surface of the earth, or, given the ""eccentric"" ceo's ownership of a tunneling concern, massive underground tunnels.

You'd need to reinforce every square inch to prevent explosive compression of the tunnels. You'd need to build redundancies every few thousand feet to prevent one failure from bringing down the entire network. And you'd need a large amount of power with no interruption to run the thing in the first place. A single down line and your passengers are essentially trapped in a space of your own creation.

Not to mention the insane cost of building such a thing in zoning, alone. You can't do twists and turns on these things, so you'd need a junction at every tectonic plate or major fault line, turning that few hours trip under the Pacific into a series of layovers. You'd also need to build it significantly lower than any other infrastructure to avoid hitting anytbing that already exists like power, plumbing, subways, waterlines, and oil rigs.

And of course, there's the fact that high speed rail systems are more than good enough for the job proposed, being able to go like 200 mph. If you want to get fancy you can even use maglev monorails which can bring you up to nearly 300.

I don't think anyone needs to pay 1,000x the price for something that's only 2-4x as good. 

And, of course, there's always the fact that the guy who proposed this idea to the public only did so to prevent the US from investing in a high speed rail system so his automotive concern would get higher demand.


TLDR: THE Hyperloop isn't that much better than modern day rail systems to justify the ridiculous price point. It's also riddled with numerous technical problems and safety concerns."

I think that's for all the wrong reasons, and focusing regulation and developmental constraints around that is a gross misuse of resources.

Instead, we should be focusing on ensuring that models are trained with equitable data, so as not to confer bias to unknowing users. We should make certain that users are informed that the data-driven outputs may not always take into consideration the big picture (i.e. how crime statistics by race is in many ways a symptom of other prolbems and shouldn't be the basis for discrimination).

Data and IP should be well protected to defend against intentional misuse, such as generative scams and trickery that can compromise people financially and breach their privacy.

I'm certain that most companies would agree, and I'm certain that more resources are put towards the latter. But to change my view, you'd have to convince me that it's worth it to subvert significant resources from defending against negligence and abuse towards trying to defend against a malicious general-AI driven apoclypse."

8,2023-04-28,CMV: Super Mario Galaxy 2 was a dissapointing sequel.,u/JAR_2004,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/131oz3k/cmv_super_mario_galaxy_2_was_a_dissapointing/,changemyview,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not implying that Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a bad game, far from it! 

I think the level design and their variety is actually an improvement over its predecessor and is a really fun and polished game.

However, aside from that, I don't really think it matches the original Super Mario Galaxy.

For starters, I consider its atmosphere to be a significant downgrade. The world of the original Galaxy game felt much more alive and vast, which is ironic since Galaxy 2 actually has more levels than the first game, but most of them just feel like generic
platformer courses that you forget about the moment you jump into the next one. And the few ones that don't follow this pattern are reimagined settings from the first game like the galaxy with the bee kingdom. 

In contrast, the world from the first Galaxy truly felt grand. Sometimes I would enjoy running around the Comet Observatory contemplating all the vast galaxies that awaited me lost in the infinity of outer space. It really felt like Mario was in an epic quest  instead of the second game, which feels like just another of Mario's typical adventures where all you want to do is jump from level to level. The Starship from Galaxy 2 is so small and bland it feels like it was purposely designed to not distract you from your main platforming routine.

And of course, I need to talk about Rosalina. It's not like the first Mario Galaxy is a masterpiece of storytelling or anything, but Rosalia's backstory is one of the main aspects that contributed to that feeling I mentioned earlier of this game being more than the platformers Mario has gotten us used to. 

The first Mario Galaxy is one of the few times in a Mario game where Bowser feels like a threat. The intro makes him and his army feel like a ruthless unstopable force, the way his airships attack the Mushroom Kingdom and lift Peach's castle into the air after getting rid of poor Mario like he's an insignificant vermin still gives me chills. 

In contrast, Super Mario Galaxy 2 wastes no time in jumping straight to the main gameplay and potrays Bowser's kidnapping of Peach in a similar way to the New Super Mario Bros games. Bowser himself even says that he wants Peach just so she can bake him a cake! There's no sense of urgency or tension here, it's just yet another instance of Mario going to save Peach and that's it. This lack of atmosphere is also a lack of what made the first game so memorable and beloved. 


Anyways, that's just my opinion. I'm looking forward to reading your thoughts about it. Thank you!"

I'm kind of glad that [this drama makes monarchism less popular](https://archive.is/HNaCR), but the more I read into this, the less Harry and Meghan look like good guys:

This might just be my republicanism-tainted opinion here, but this is still not enough for me to admit that the British Royal Family are the good guys either. Even if we are to ignore [the sheltering of Prince Andrew](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/press-banned-from-photographing-queen-being-escorted-by-andrew/news-story/7ff4c45589025b42ed5998163340cd9b), I don't see how it's fair to blame Meghan for making British Royal Family into a toxic environment since they are perfectly capable of doing that to themselves:

To simplify: Harry and Meghan are probably being dishonest to get attention, while the British Royal Family is a toxic environment even if Meghan had never entered the picture.

When I say dish, I mean a type of crockery typically used to contain food/drink as it is being consumed. In that category we have 4 general groups: plates, trays, bowls, and cups. 

Plates are best suited for solid food but offer little to no flexibility to anything more liquid, food or drink.

Trays have greater capacity than plates but suffer from the same issues.

Bowls can contain any drink as well as any food. Will the flatter and more rigid food be less wieldy than on a plate or tray? Perhaps but its unlikely to turn into an intolerable experience nor would it be impossible.

“Then why not cups? They are often better suited for portability over bowls.” While this is true, most cups cannot cross that barrier when it comes to the rigid and flat foods due to the size of the opening. And if you get a bigger cup, you will likely trade away that desired portability trait to accommodate that rigid food. 

Hence, the bowl is all you will need for dish ware. It translates the best across the nourishment states of matter."

12,2023-04-28,CMV: It’s always a better idea to barbell squat with safety bars,u/physioworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/131shi4/cmv_its_always_a_better_idea_to_barbell_squat/,changemyview,"For this discussion safety bars means any device that will dead stop the downward travel of the barbell at some point above where the lifter can safely drop down and crawl away. So typically these are solid metal bars on either side of the rack but I’ve also seen some set ups that use some kind of tough rope, but that seems to serve a similar purpose. 

Basically there seems to be a trend of doing barbell squats of one variation or another without safety bars- ie just free standing in space away from a rack and I just don’t get it. 

If the weight you’re using is sub maximal and/or you’re not going to lift it with a high volume (lots of reps/sets) then you can probably safely control it regardless so the safety argument doesn’t apply so much. 

But if you’re using a weight/doing enough reps, there is a reasonable chance that at some point you’ll experience failure and, in this case, if you don’t have safety bars, you may need to bail. People can and do do this without a problem, my contention is that it’s an added risk which doesn’t bring any added benefit. 

The point of squatting is to get good at squatting and/or to have some sort of carryover benefit to some other lift like a snatch for instance or just to get big. I don’t see how removing safety bars and bailing failed lifts helps to attain these goals.

I know that a few of them have lines with colors, but I’m talking about the whole container. Make it totally blue, yellow, red for different uses.

Colors would be way more easy and more instinctive, as well, colors evolved for this reason, so we could recognize danger in certain situations. (Not only)

Something that 42 USC § 1973i(c) prohibits.

The challenges for this is how that may devalue the currency itself, or the integrity of the system, but the currency valuation will be balanced by the supply and demand that the corporate side will inspect when setting the voting price. And as for the ""integrity of the system"", c'mon.

This will massively increase turnout and political engagement, make corporations also more invested in the well being of the citizen, thus circumventing the capitalist incentive of just investing a little in buying one representative politician.

This makes fault lines, particularly the San Andreas fault, boogeymen so useful in the media.

The popular idea aside from the absolutely ridiculous ""fall into the ocean"" is this: one day, all of a sudden, the San Andreas fault, all the way from SoCal up to the San Francisco area, felt very powerful shaking like nothing seen in a long time, and it causes buildings, infrastructure, and houses to collapse, and California is left in ruins.

This, in actuality, is a fictional nightmare scenario created by Hollywood, echoed by the media, and exploited by fearmongers, such as those who cater toward the RWNJ conspiracy theorist survivalist-prepper types. The truth is this: California has been extremely prepared for a big earthquake since the very end of the 20th century, and we've only gotten better. For buildings, they are highly reinforced and are built similarly to how premier eastern countries like Taiwan and Japan build their buildings, making them earthquake-proof, thus they will be absolutely safe places to be even in a ""worst-case earthquake"" with 0 chance of collapse. Because buildings are able to be built in Cali in the first place, they need to be up to codes that take into account how bad earthquakes can be. Even older buildings have been retrofitted to become earthquake-proof. You are uneducated or live in a cave if you think one of the most powerful economies in the world would neglect itself like Haiti.

90% of homes in all of California are wood framed homes. If you have ever seen a tree that bends and sways in the wind, then you know this is possible, because the branches bend quite easily that also means that your home made of wood will bend quite easily, and move with the earthquake not just stand still, and be destroyed by the earthquake. Even better or more and more homes are being bolted to their foundations to give them further strength so that they can move and bend with the motion of the earthquake.

The San Andreas fault is only capable of Atmos an 8.1 or an 8.2 in all likelihood it probably will not be more than a 7.8 and the reason we know that is because we know when the rocks will finally break because we know the kinds of rocks that are at depth And all different rocks have a tensile strength, so it is easy to figure out when that breakage will occur resulting in an earthquake. The top continues to move the rocks at depth are locked. Also, the San Andreas in the southern section near Fort Tejon as an example ruptures at most every 200 to 300 years and that is the one that is closest to Ventura county, and the very western edge of Los Angeles County thankfully, there are many toll mountain ranges in between, and they tend to take up the energy that the earthquakes generate so that by the time I get all the way to the coast, the earthquake is much much smaller than when it started. There are a large number of variables that are involved in how large the earthquake will be where you live relative to the fault also, the magnitude may not be more than a 7.8 which is what scientists are predicting, depending upon the type of structures that are present. For

Since the San Andreas is comprised of many different sections, we have no clue about which section will rupture when. Based on the fact that we know the top moves, but the rock at depth does not move, we can calculate how many inches and for how many years each section has or has not moved and so we can predict how much movement and therefore how much energy the earthquake will release when it ruptures in a certain area. The major areas are the Salton Sea, Baja California, San Bernardino county, Fort Tejon, Parkfield, which we know, actually creeps, and never has large quakes, and does not tend to have more than a 5.1 which most people in California would feel and go, oh that was cool and then go on with their day. Most people in Southern California unless you were not around when the Northridge quake went you do not remember an earthquake larger than about five which is relatively small considering California has done an excellent job making our homes and businesses earthquake-proof.

To sum it up, even having an ""earthquake kit"" is unnecessary unless you know the home or business you live in *somehow* has missed inspections the whole time and you willingly live there. I can point and laugh at people who have earthquake kits in the zone the SA fault could hit as uneducated fools falling for Hollywood disaster porn and sensationalist barely-scientific edutainment documentaries. Having an earthquake kit in California shows a lack of confidence in how much this highly successful state (which carries red ones BTW, but that's another thing entirely) is. When it happens, it will be noticeable, it will be talked about on social media, and people will have fun with the shaking, but there will likely be a few incidents where elderly people might not be able to go under something in time even though we have technology that can sense the wave preceding the seismic wave.

We don't have 1900s building codes anymore. San Andreas is a nothing burger unless you live right on top of it and inspectors missed a building, in which case, fire them and hire new ones. Don't waste your money on an earthquake preparedness kit. California's government is actually competent. Sell anything you can related to that. Give the canned food away to the poor. Having those kits alone gives legitimacy to ignorance and fearmongering. Do you support that?"

For example, a woman finds her boss to be childhood friend who had crush on her and got rejected, or gets into false scandal where she is said to be dating a celebrity, or forms fake marriage with a millionaire to help him avoid another potential lover. Many times, the love interest in these stories is not really nice and polite person, actually some of them act downright rude.  
Maybe these portrayals are one of reasons people think women like bad boys or men like bad girls. But I think it is not true, because people enjoying such novels or movies is like how people like war novels or movies. In war novels and movies, protagonist gets involved in war and suffers a lot because of the war, but people enjoy reading or watching that as playing with their imagination. It is not same as wanting to be actually involved in war. Likewise, people enjoy novels or movies where protagonist falls in love with rude or difficult person because they like to play with imagination, not to experience that in real world.  
In short, I think people might enjoy imagining falling in love with 'bad' boy/girl, but they rarely want it to actually happen because they separate imagination from reality."

For example, leaked documents reported by the Washington Post reveal Ukraine was preparing to attack Moscow on February 24th in retaliation for the war, but the US talked them out of it.  

Russia knows this, and as a result, Russian aircraft rarely fly into Ukrainian airspace, and ammunition supply depots have been moved well behind the front line, and into Russia itself.  Russia continues to target Ukrainian civilians in cities deep inside Ukraine from aircraft firing from inside Russia or the Caspian Sea.  It seems only right Ukraine should be able to target these aircraft and supply depots inside Russia to combat this strategy.  Russia started this war, there's no reason why the war should only be limited to Ukraine in that case, or that Russia should have some ""safe zone.""  

Iran is also supplying Russia with drones and other weapons, and Iran has not so far been targeted by Ukraine militarily, despite its weapons being used in this war against Ukraine, so the idea Russia would launch a third world war over this is far-fetched.  

While there is a threat of Russia escalating the war, the only way they can is through nuclear weapons, which they have shown no indication of preparing to use.  Russia has so far not escalated the war at all, even with the West supplying tanks to Ukraine, they do not have the means to do so besides their nuclear arsenal.  A few blown-up ammunition depots, military bases, and aircraft are quite a ways away from being worthy of a nuclear strike.  

Ukraine would also be the country targeted with nuclear weapons should Russia choose to use them in this conflict.  It is their country, not ours.  If they want to risk getting nuked, that is their decision to make, not ours.  More needs to be done to counter Russia's attacks on Ukraine's civilians."

I’m not talking about the use case for idea generation which I think is incredibly valuable, but rather attempts to generate (near) production level work (prompts to website, SEO, blog, 3d model, movie scene, etc.)

I guess it’s natural for people to push new tech to it’s limit. But I really hope these stuff don’t become more than the fascinating (but useless) demos that draw interest from the public. Why? because things that they generate are generic and frankly garbage. Their quality will improve but never reach that of the experts.

So much value is created from offering means to filter out the garbage (why sites like Reddit/Twitter etc. are successful) because the base of the internet is so flooded with garbage that it becomes worse than useless. Many have different interests for producing the garbage content, and with the help of garbage-generative AIs, the proportion of valuable content to garbage in the public web will become exponentially more extreme than it already is.

The alternative to enabling more amateurs or to generate generic garbage is - AI tools that aims to augment, not replace, experts so that the end product has higher quality and cheaper cost. If garbage generators become the prevalent solution, it might be *the* worst thing that will ever happen to the public web.

Generative AIs are incredible and transformational. But they are a few generations away from replacing the high level human functions involved in content creation. It’s a different story if there’s a reasoning component like AutoGPT or BabyAGI built in which is lacking in many of these content creating AIs, making them exponentially harder & costlier to improve."

When tracking down the next movie or show I want to consume, I have noticed a trend. A movie that has a high critics rating (rotten tomatoes, IMDB, whatever) and a low viewer rating is universally trash. A movie with a low critic's rating and high audience score is usually pretty damn good. My assumption is that most of these critics are paid off in one way or the other to shill movies that suck or that they feel obligated to highly rate movies that are pretentious, preachy, or 'the current thing' whereas the audience has no ulterior motive in their rating.

TL;DR critic's scores mean nothing and can be utterly ignored while the audience scores are much more accurate as to if the movie is entertaining. CMV"
0,2023-04-29,CMV: I'm a bootlicker. I believe capitalistic business owners have done far more good for society than harm.,u/tensaday,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13317ef/cmv_im_a_bootlicker_i_believe_capitalistic/,changemyview,"I believe business owners nowadays are subject to a lot of unwarranted scrutiny for being greedy capitalist overlords that stifle their own employees and fill their pockets from the fruits of their exploitation.  I disagree with this notion. I 100% think business owners, small and large, have done humanity a great service from their business operations. They have single-handedly bolstered the economy of their respective countries, have given many people their livelihoods and have innovated many great products that have immensely benefited our specie.

A common misconception is that business owners make their employees do all the legwork while they kick back and relax in their headquarters scrolling through the internet to find their next yacht purchase. I disagree. [Business owners do the majority of the legwork to get their operations kickstarted](https://www.score.org/resource/blog-post/how-hard-small-business-owners-work#:~:text=One%20survey%20from%20New%20York,than%2060%20hours%20a%20week). Yes this mainly pertains to small business owners but nobody starts their business as the giant behemoth spearhead company for their industry. Becoming a business owner is a risky, expensive and time-consuming endeavor that frankly, [doesn't pay off in most instances considering the staggering amount of them that fail](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1010/top-6-reasons-new-businesses-fail.aspx). So when you consider both of these attributes, you come to realize that business owners aren't some lazy exploitative leeches, rather they're the exact opposites. 

Running a giant business is even more of a nightmare, however at that point the CEO has the capital to divide their workload among their workforce and take a backseat and relax. Because why wouldn't they? [Considering most millionaires are self-made, they deserve to take the backseat and enjoy the fruits of their hard labor](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/majority-of-the-worlds-richest-people-are-self-made-says-new-report.html).  If your skills and experiences bring a large amount of value to the company, the more you'll be compensated for in the form of benefits and pay. This is basic economics 101. Hell, this is common sense. As children, in gym class the better players were always picked first and got to make the major calls during the sports games. This concept is universal to the human experience. In economics this reflects in how you're paid and respected. 

If your the average joe in your company or even a low-level laborer, it will reflect in your pay and benefits package (If you even have one, lol!) Why should you feel entitled for more than your share of pie? Hell, if it weren't for First World minimum wage laws you'd get paid even lower considering the lack of value you provide to the company. Just because you do 10 hours+ of backbreaking work doesn't mean you bring value that justifies you being compensated more, considering how easily replaceable you are and the lack of specialized skills you offer. You should be GRATEFUL that you're even getting paid slightly more than minimum wage in most cases, because the company was generous enough to realize your years of laboring means you know some of the unique ways the company operates, thus you have some amount of profitable experience and skills and thus the business owners compensate you accordingly. Even though in reality you're just lifting boxes or stone or whatever menial labor job that even a child can do. Kids in Africa could easily do your job, and they do, but they get paid next to nothing in their respective African countries because of the high levels of corruption and lack of policy. You're only getting compensated this much BECAUSE of policies and the company decided to operate in your country. So in a realistic sense the company is actually compensating you FAR more than they should, on behalf of policies (policies which exist because of a strong economy thanks to your CEO's) and the CEO's generosity with their slightly higher raises over the years for your manual laboring duties. You still have enough money to clothe yourself, feed yourself and take hot showers. That might not seem like anything nowadays but those are luxurious privileges that most of the world wish they had. Even your ancestors would kill for those luxurious. So be grateful to your CEO's and business owners. 

And even in countries where there's a lack of child protection and minimum wage laws, [these factories still provide a livelihood for many families](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/15/how-global-value-chains-open-opportunities-for-developing-countries/), as unfortunate as that is. It speaks volumes that even when exploitation is in the forefront of a businesses operations it still provides immense benefits for a population and brings them opportunities. 

It's ironic how it's normalized in this culture to poke fun at corporate and business owners and to ""flip off your boss"", but when it comes to getting a cut in your pay and benefits package or even getting fired, suddenly you people become whimpering little puppies begging your boss for the position back. Guess you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you, huh? It's hilarious when I come across this scenario anecdotally, with my friends being extremely bitchy about their jobs than become whiny entitled children after they get fired. Goes to show how much corporate bosses and CEO's have spoiled you lots. We literally prepare our children to be indebted and work for bosses to earn their living by enrolling them in colleges and vocational schools. We have a duty to SERVE our bosses for the good they have done for America and we should be grateful for the opportunity.

Do you want to know what a country looks like without ANY businesses, jobs or infrastructure? Yeah, doesn't fucking look pretty. Young men in these countries going to war against each other and their governments for resources. It's a nightmare. These people would DREAM of having businesses and jobs in their areas. Be fucking grateful.

Whether you like it or not businesses have greatly increased the quality of our lives and have provided our livelihoods. Most of the population is nothing without their W-2's, so be grateful you even have the OPPORTUNITY to work."

We have 2 main parties which is the Democrat and the Republican right? And so the general ideology of Democrat is favoring the poor and Republican is favoring the rich and businesses at least from what I can see and what the media seem to made it out to be. These 2 are the popular party and they compete for voters to get in power under a democratic system, which mean all citizens have the right to vote and have their voices heard

However, from my point of view, this is fair and not so fair at the same time because the poorer will always be the majority of voters and the rich(perhaps top 10%?), or businesses be the minority (wouldn't this mean, overtime, Republican is deemed to fall? )despite the general concept that they contribute more to tax as well as pushing countries development (https://taxfoundation.org/publications/latest-federal-income-tax-data/). And so quite a few states that have Republicans started using gerrymandering to draw the district line or at least there exist lobbying to get advantages and people are saying that this should be considered illegal and not fair, which, again, I do agree and do not agree at the same time . I think my stance is a little Republican since I don't have much knowledges in this, do you guys think otherwise?(I expressed title wrong the last time so I made another post)"

0,2023-04-29,CMV: If a person is willing to use preferred pronouns then it follows that they should refrain from misusing/abusing psychological terms such as OCD and Autism. The failure to be consistent on this issue is because people are idiots who don't know how to think from first principles.,u/ilikedota5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1338udc/cmv_if_a_person_is_willing_to_use_preferred/,changemyview,"Basically, no one chooses to be born trans or with an mental disorder. We can debate the precise extent of what's predetermined and what's not, and its probably a little bit of both, but its not a free, unrestricted choice, and anyone pretending so is an asshole. As a society we've gotten to that point where putting pronouns on Linkedin pages has become more normalized, and yet asking people to not misuse/abuse terms like ""Autism,"" ""OCD,"" ""Psychopath"" leads to mountains of downvotes and people insulting you. Because you are asking them to change their language, and that's asking them to make a change, and people are too selfish. So why are people willing to change pronouns? Because of the political zeitgeist, its associated with their side, so they are okay with that. One has become acceptable to correct, and the other hasn't. And the reason for that is because people haven't realized that both are small changes to language that otherwise wouldn't be thought of, and yet can mean a lot to some people, and thus we should be more tolerant and kind. I see no reason to extend that grace to one and not the other.

Ultimately, the underlying principle is we should show sympathy to others who are different than us, and therefore, our society should try to reduce the ameliorate the harm faced because of something they were born with/as. And society has a lot of stupid people who don't know how to think in terms of first principles. They are outcome oriented, not process oriented. Nor can they think in terms of both and understand how they are different ways of thinking with their own places. The desired outcome is not, being more tolerant, but the desired outcome is being on the right political side.

I suppose one differentiation is that asking people to change pronouns is a smaller change overall than asking people to stop misusing or abusing psychological terminology, because while both have complex theories behind them, most people don't learn them, and asking people to not use a certain word is different than asking people to understand theory, and asking people to understand theory in order to not misuse or abuse terminology is a big ask. That being said, one can go through a day without using words such as ""OCD"" or ""Schizo"" more easily than one can avoid using pronouns, though both are doable, albeit awkward sometimes. That being said, if a person is unwilling to change their behavior AND understand the why underlying it, then they are just being an asshole AND an ignoramus.

Misusing such terminology only creates more harm as it creates unhelpful misconceptions about what these disorders are, and trivializes the suffering of others. One example: OCD isn't about making sure everything is clean. Its washing your hands so much they turn red and get infected. Its feeling like if you don't touch the four corners of your mirror God will smite your mother dead. In fact, OCD used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder, currently its in its own group of disorders. 

Honestly, I don't think there is anyway for me to be wrong on this. Maybe you can nitpick somewhere, but I think fundamentally I'm right on the money."

0,2023-04-29,CMV: Black Americans would benefit far more from wealth redistribution or prison reform than they would from media representation.,u/KevinVacit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/133br4c/cmv_black_americans_would_benefit_far_more_from/,changemyview,"On a regular basis, there are a bunch of news stories about X having few Blacks or being too White. The Oscars are too White. The World Series has few Blacks. This soccer team doesn't have enough Blacks. There aren't enough Black shows on \_\_\_\_\_ network channel, etc. I remember in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests that the cops got charged and a bunch of companies promoted Black shows and characters but little else was done. After a while of seeing these stories, I just thought to myself, ""Would a few more Black celebrities really improve the life of the average African-American""? The more I thought about it, the more I realized the answer is no for several reasons.

Firstly, famous people are a tiny minority by definition. There are only 5,056 professional athletes in the USA. There are only 32,753 actors in Hollywood. There are only 15,844 professional musicians in the USA. Most of the career paths that produce very famous people are hard to get into and even harder to get very successful in. On the other hand, there are 3,096,700 registered nurses in the USA, 1,436,100 accountants in the USA, there are 1,756,600 mechanics in the USA, and there are 46,936,733 African-Americans in the USA. Even if Black Americans were properly represented in famous fields or even dominated famous fields, that still wouldn't be a sufficient career path for 99.5% of them. One million more Black Americans in upper-middle class careers would be far better for the ethnic group than a thousand more Black millionaires. Black celebrities have neither the will nor the means to bail millions of other poor Black Americans out. With Kanye West's recent devolving and other controversies, depending on the few successful Black people who manage to get rich and famous to enrich the communities they left behind, seems like a bad idea. The only difference a few more Black celebrities accomplishes is to make a very small number of African-Americans rich and possibly be a role model if said celebrity is in a more unique career path. Black representation in very large and decent-income career paths is far more valuable than another Black superhero or Black Rock star.

Secondly, Black Americans depending on the goodwill of huge multinational corporations and hoping they have their best interests at heart is a bad idea. Companies have one purpose and one purpose only, that is to make money. Everything a corporation says or does is always tied back to improving its bottom line. If blackwashing a character will lead to improved profit margins in certain areas, they will do it. If a Black-produced movie or TV show has unfavorable turnouts for domestic or international audiences, then it gets canned and the corporation moves on. No White CEO truly cares about diversifying its workforce for a better America or anything silly like that. They just want others to believe that. The corporation puts a few Black faces in company ads or on billboards in order to virtue signal and receive higher profits from non-whites. Don't mistake this veneer of wokeness for serious social justice. If making anything in the company more diverse reduces profit by even a minor amount, than homogeneity is the name of the game. There are no board meetings focused on improving race relations (excluding PR scandals), only about raising company stocks.

Finally, I feel like a lot of representation issues are putting the cart before the horse. There would be far more Black CEOs and Black network executives and Black politicians if African-Americans were in a better place socioeconomically speaking in general. There would almost be no need for Affirmative Action or quotas and other measures to get Black people in leadership positions if they performed as well and were as rich as White Americans to begin with. Solving those underlying issues would lead to far more success than diversity alumni or diversity hires.

In conclusion, Black lives will only improve when the average Black person is in a better place as opposed to there being more Black celebrities. The top 1% of Black people can't make up for all of the other lower-class Black people. Asian-Americans don't have great representation in the media or in the vast majority of careers for that matter. No Asian-American is even half as famous as Barack Obama or Michael Jordan or Oprah Winfrey is. Yet Asian-Americans are in a very good spot when it comes to education and socioeconomics and many other statistics.

What would honestly help Black people more than focusing on areas where they are underrepresented is reducing statistics where they are overrepresented in. Ideally, there should be far less Black men in prison. There should be far less Black children growing up in single-parent households. There should be far less Black people living in poor, crime-ridden ghettos. There should be far less Black homeless people. Pretty much all of those issues are far more dire than not enough Black faces on X platform or network or whatever.

To change my view, you need to explain why having African-Americans be properly represented when it comes to media representation or sports representation or CEO representation or any other exclusive industry is at the same or even greater level of importance of say prison reform or wealth redistribution or even just supporting Black businesses and getting Black people into many middle-class career fields."

I think it’s Jordan Peterson who said: if there’s no way out of a dilemma, we have to prevent it from happening in the first place. So maybe we should start regulating AI in a general manner and gradually establish a system where humans are the priority and take the initiative before it’s out of reach. If it’s somewhat irrelevant to reality, consider its mild form as huge tech companies are invading privacy to feed the algorithms databases, and the government is already incompetent at this. As a whole, the development of technology will be slowed,(but not too much as top companies have the incentive and funds to innovate, and will have more as inequality in society increases), but we will be better off in the long run.

And in recent days, the economy and unemployment rate is quite bad, and the redistribution may do some good to it. The taxation may somehow hurt the companies and the economy, but it’s mainly the large corporations that will pay the taxes(there should be a tiered taxation policy; small companies will have to pay little taxes), yet the benefits to the economy(employment and better market) may outweigh the costs.

It will require multinational cooperation to ensure its enforcement; still, there may be a practicality problem. But I hope you can provide some other convincing reasons to CMV. Many initiatives to protect the environment are not carried out, but we should still believe in and devote ourselves to environmental protection.

This may seem to be some anti-science stuff, but trust me, I’m the opposite of that kind of person. Been thinking about the Skynet type of thing since I was 7 or 8, and finally came out with some solution 

Edit: I forgot to edit this but I have changed my view. It’s so basically impossible to define what company uses AI and what don’t as it’s so prevalent in today. And AI is far from self-aware that kind of stuff nowadays, so it’s still a tool. Thanks for discussing and supplying information"

One of the subtopics is interfaith relationships, and I casually brought up the topic of me hypothetically dating an antitheist. I say hypothetically because I am asexual and aromantic.

My professor was quite surprised about me bringing this up, and he mentioned there could be a clash of values that could cause conflict within the relationship. I’m Hindu.

This confused me. I looked up a list of values after class and identified mine. I thought about my values a bit more. I’m not entirely comfortable dating a meat eater. I value calm people and positive people. I value people who tell the truth etc. I wouldn’t date a meat eater, but there are likely vegetarian anti theists.

    
Definition of an anti theist: Actively opposes a belief in gods of any sort and to institutions built around belief in a deity. They believe that religion is harmful  to individuals and society and that it impedes scientific progress and encourages immoral acts.

CMV that I could date an anti theist, because my professor says it’s highly unlikely we would get on and I want to understand why he thinks that. A lot of my friends think that too."

Then, I came across [Netflix's article](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/how-our-planet-is-made) that proclaims:

>According to Keith Scholey, the award-winning documentarian who produced *Our Planet,* there are no CGI sequences or animation used in *Our Planet*: “The series is absolutely based around real, real images.”

Although Netflix's proclaim, viewers either do believe or question that CGI used ([source 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cgi/comments/j7g6fc/is_this_cgi_on_the_netflix_series_our_planet_the/), [source 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/bbkwmd/comment/ekjpou6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [source 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/b9ma5u/comment/ek806pj/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [source 4](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3267352/?ref_=tt_urv)).

In this post, I'll explain why measuring ingredients in grams is a more accurate and reliable way to measure ingredients for cooking and baking.

Inaccuracy of Cup Measurements: The cup measurement system is inaccurate because different ingredients have different densities, which can lead to inconsistent results. In addition, the size of the cup used can vary between recipes and people measuring the ingredients, leading to errors.

Precision of Metric System: The metric system is based on weight, making it a more precise and consistent method of measuring ingredients. By measuring ingredients in grams, you can get the exact amount of an ingredient needed for a recipe, regardless of its density.

Ease of Conversion: The metric system is also easier to convert between units of measurement. Conversions are simple and straightforward, while the American cup system can be difficult to convert between cup sizes or between cups and ounces.

Conclusion: The American cup measurement system is inaccurate compared to weighing ingredients in grams. The metric system's precision, consistency, and ease of conversion make it a more reliable way to measure ingredients for cooking and baking."

It's stranglehold on society, and it's effects on people.

Firstly, the societal. You see alchohol everywhere, from Christmas to birthdays to halloween to just random days off, and more. it's like a plague of locusts. It's everywhere in pop culture and media too, and it's treated like this drink that makes you happy and able to have fun. It isn't.

This takes me into my next point. The effects it has on people. I have numbers for this. In the USA, According to the World Health Organization, domestic abuse victims had partners that drank alchohol before physical assault in 55% of all cases. 30% of aggrivated assault charges are from drunk people, according to the National TASC. Also from the national TASC:

1: Between 29-40% of reported sexual assaults are from drunk people, and more probably go unreported.

2: 38% of convicted murderers were intoxicated at the time of the crime. More than any other substance.

3: 43% of child abusers were intoxicated whilst abusing the child.


Need I say more? Alchohol makes people into evil people, yet media and society at large pushes it as a good thing. This clearly shows that alchohol is one of the worst things humans have ever made.

In Ohio, New York,  and Pennsylvania you can take the NCLEX test as many times as you want and I believe that is a bad call. I think we should do three strikes and you're out. Like Canada, you get three attempts maximum. In Florida you get three chances and if you fail the third time you go back to school. But I would say three strikes and you're done. Three chances are plenty especially, when you're going into a field that involves people's care and medications. We have the NCLEX in place for a reason and it is necessary to have to take it, the test is extremely challenging but so is the field of choice. 

 another argument some may say...places might make the tests unlimited because of the shortage of nurses. Again, bad call. It stinks that there is a shortage of nurses but we shouldn't just get anybody to care of patients and future patients because then we are putting people's care in danger. There needs to be a line in the sand and we must not step over that line. Nursing school and the NCLEX is no joke and should be taken seriously. If we let the test in these states be unlimited students might not study as hard or not take too much seriousness into the test because they know it's not over for them and whatever happens, happens because they can take the test as many times as they want. Not everybody thinks like that but I am positive a good amount do and that in itself is too many people to have think like that. Give them a number of how many times they can take it and leave it. Tests should not be unlimited it is just asking for problems."

Knowing that humanity does not have an objective goal or objective morality makes me withdraw completely. Telling me to create my own values does not help as that mean other people can create their own values as well, and values of charity and thievery and murder are all equal. Good and bad will simply refer to social contracts, survival and statistics and whatever democracy says. Rape is not punished because it is bad, it is punished because we don't want to live in a community where someone could do that to us. That is not value, that is cold, hard pointless survival and consequentialism. And any person that offers a greater meaning ends up being transphobic, sexist, etc, which does not work for me as I have progressive beliefs. Sucks how there is no mentor or guide as a replacement for people like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate.

The future of mankind seems to be the worship of art and literature combined with hedonism. Layer upon lay of sarcastic, cynical meta-humor, the death of sincerity and universal values. I have no interest in this. Religion used to give mankind greater meaning, but I don't think you can choose religion once you know evolution is correct so that is not an option for me. And no, Buddhism without spiritualism is not an option.

Note that I don't think it's okay for isolated hikikomori people to harass people online and stuff like that. As long as they don't hurt anyone intentionally then this isolation should be fine.

I hope I got my point across. Note that I am interested in existential, philosophical hikikomori, so incel stuff is probably not relevant to this post. I still go to the gym, run, read every day and go to university, but if I receive my request of being on permanent welfare from the state I think I will continue to do these things only to make time pass. Not to achieve a greater goal like most people, and by ""greater"" I mean a hedonistic, self-fulfilling goal. It's sad how existentialism is seen as this deep, meaningful topic...yet always ends with hedonism and pursuit of pleasure as the end goal.

I do have my beliefs on what is good and right  and I wish I could make the world like that, but I don't think that is meaningful if moral relativism or moral relativism is true. That means my beliefs were not true, they were just imposed or democratically chosen. That does not make them true.

I have tried psychologists but they were not interested in philosophy as the core of the issue. I am just briefly getting into philosophical counseling, the first appointment being disappointing. But I will continue trying.

Any replies would be appreciated. If Hikikomori is the wrong term please consider still trying to CMV. The issue is still there even if I used the wrong word.

Note that calling my beliefs edgy is not challenging the CMV in the slightest. So please do better than that. With that said, I am interested in hearing anything.

EDIT: I will most likely give out a delta later because some people said that I am hurting people by mooching of welfare, the tax of other people. Although I don't like the idea of calling people on welfare parasite and moochers and such. I'll read more replies

**EDIT:** As an alternative to Tate and Peterson please don't recommend Breadtubers, Philosophy tube and similar channels. I do hold progressive views, but they are relativists/hedonists who focus mainly on art and aesthetics. They don't care about morality which is the most important thing to me. Art is not the highest thing humans should do, it is being kind.

4,2023-04-30,CMV: Bariatric surgery should be covered at a lower BMI and without comorbidites.,u/MostRecommendation84,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/133wx3c/cmv_bariatric_surgery_should_be_covered_at_a/,changemyview,"To clarify, in the US currently you generally won't be recommended or covered by insurance for bariatric surgery unless you have a BMI over 40 or 35 with a comorbidity(eg high blood pressure, sleep apnea, diabetes, etc.)

This seems ultimately counterproductive. Even if bariatric surgery ultimately resolves those illnesses(and that's an if), some degree of irreversible damage has been done. Likewise if you hit a 40 BMI, the damage has already been done. Moving these thresholds to even 30-35 could be massively preventative. 

Which brings me to my next point, weight issues are widespread in the US(easily epidemic levels) and there's been plenty of studies regarding how people lose weight and by and large: most overweight people will not succeed in losing weight, and fewer still keep the weight off. We can hope and wish people lost weight naturally all we want, but by the numbers the only surefire way to keep the weight off is bariatric surgery. 

From the insurer's perspective, I outright have no idea how their approach makes sense. Caring for a person with diabetes or sleep apnea can be extremely expensive and they're legally obliged to help cover the costs. While there can be a modest upfront cost, it seems much more profitable to have longterm low-risk membership than shorter term high cost members. 

I get overall we have a culture of ""it's your fault fix it"" which can contribute(even if I think it's maybe vindictive and poorly thought out) but otherwise it just seems nonsensical. CMV."

I think it’s rude and if I’m not asking to hear it again, why would they continue? Sometimes the story was told earlier that same day, but for some reason they think I have nothing better to do than hear the whole damn thing again. 

Seems rude to me.

0,2023-04-30,CMV: The Republicans will probably take the White House in 2024,u/Kalvin-TL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1344gy2/cmv_the_republicans_will_probably_take_the_white/,changemyview,"I’ll just outline my bullet points 

Most economic indicators that I see trend toward a recession coming in. This almost always causes a change in power. One can make an argument that this is all the result of a plutocratic order that the republicans would only make worse. But most people are not rational when it comes to these matters. The American public is a gaggle of peasants with a superstitious, provincial mentality that the president is some idealized version of a king controlling the economy like a DJ. To call them rational citizens or call this a democracy is a laughable crock of shit 

The electoral college is a handicap that enables the republicans to win. They haven’t won the popular vote since Lebron was a rookie. A Republican hasn’t first gotten elected President with the popular vote since Seinfeld was in its 2nd season. It doesn’t help that red states are making mobilization and voting more difficult 

Shit hasn’t gone totally sideways yet and Biden is already almost as unpopular as Trump. Kamala is a political liability that no one except an insane Twitter cult and idpol moderate democrats like. 

Also add that Biden is evidently senile. Trump is delusional but he gets a pass on that because his base loves it and the bar has always been set so low enough for him that it’s a tripping hazard. Trump will look put together enough on the debate stage to embarrass Biden. DeSantis would trounce him with no effort 

“But muh abortion”. Women are not as much pro choice as commonly believed. They certainly lean pro choice but it isn’t like Reddit makes it out to be. 

“Muh young people”. A demographic that’s historically inconstant in turnout. They come out for “cool” candidates. Biden ain’t it. 

Biden had a modest victory considering everything was stacked against Trump. Trump has always surpassed expectations even when he loses. Something truly unprecedented like an economic miracle or an irrevocable GOP split is required for a 2nd term."

26,2023-04-30,CMV: All buses and trains should have windows that open.,u/MostlyPicturesOfDogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13458w6/cmv_all_buses_and_trains_should_have_windows_that/,changemyview,"Where I live, buses and trains have sealed glass windows that cannot be opened (they didn't always). I think that all trains and buses should have windows that open. Heating and air conditioning should only be used when temperatures are above and below  a comfortable range. On these occasions, windows could be auto locked to ensure efficiency.

1) As we've seen in the pandemic, air conditioning and air circulation systems are no match for fresh air. With increasingly crowded public transport in major cities, catching the bus or train to work is now just asking for a cold, flu, or covid. We also have several strains of avian flu percolating right now, and it's only a matter of time (could be months, could be decades) until we have a new respiratory virus on the scene. Illness messes up everything, including people's personal lives and workplaces.

2) Depending on where you live in the world, much of the year is quite comfortable temperature-wise. But currently, sealed trains and buses are constantly air-conditioned, wasting energy when there is FREE wind out there. 

3) It's super annoying getting on a heated train when you're dressed for winter in a jumper and coat, and sweating for your 10 minute journey because you're so tightly packed you can't take your coat off. Likewise it's uncomfortable to dress for summer and find yourself stuck on a half hour bus ride shivering in Arctic air-con. In short, the current sealed system isn't all that comfortable anyway.

3) Any minor personal discomfort or annoyance caused by this change would be outweighed/offset by the positives."
