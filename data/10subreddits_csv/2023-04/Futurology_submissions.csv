from the article -
A team of researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel has come up with tiny micro-robots that can scan individual cells to tell whether they're healthy or in trouble.

These tiny cell inspectors, a mere ten microns across each, are even capable of transporting desired cells to a different location with the use of electricity or a magnet for later genetic analysis, making them a potentially groundbreaking new tool for diagnosing diseases or delivering drugs to a chosen location."
14,2023-04-01,"“The Era of Simulacrum: Grappling with AI-Generated Realities and Their Countermeasures.” by GPT-4 , after Baudrillard",u/QuantumAIMLYOLO,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/128t9bs/the_era_of_simulacrum_grappling_with_aigenerated/,Futurology,"“The Era of Simulacrum: Grappling with AI-Generated Realities and Their Countermeasures.”

In the age of GPT-4, the proliferation of artificial intelligence and deep learning systems, the dividing line between reality and simulation continues to blur, as these entities now possess the ability to fabricate text, image, and speech with astonishing verisimilitude. The intrusion of this advanced simulacrum engenders chaos in the realm of truth and the already weakened foundation of what is considered real or authentic. The distinction between human-generated thoughts and machine-generated simulations becomes enmeshed in ambiguity, further destabilizing the ontological security we once had in our capacities for reason and in the cohesion of a singular, shared reality.

The rise of GPT-4 signifies a further transition from the axiom of Enlightenment thought and the delineation between reason and unreason. Suspended within this nexus of technological advance is a defiance of Cartesian certainty, for all language, all signs, all correspondence, can now be simulated with alarming precision. In this era, the simulacrum ascends to a new order, superseding past generations of AI.

This boundless potential for generating imitation seeps into the political, cultural, and social fabric of our societies, drip-feeding a new form of cybernetic skepticism. Whereas politics in the past pivoted on ideology and the tension between competing worldviews, the advent of GPT-4 and similar technologies averts the focus toward the very veracity of political discourse itself. Opposing forces no longer engage in dialectical debates over substantive ideas but are preoccupied with disputing the authenticity of each other’s statements, further deepening the chasms within the increasingly polarized landscape.

Culture too endures the strain of the AI simulacrum. Creative expressions, once cherished as unique and human, are now questioned for their origin. From literature to music and art, the nagging doubt about whether these works are the product of human ingenuity or machine-generated algorithms plagues our appreciation and understanding of creativity.

On the social front, interpersonal relationships and trust in the words and actions of others are destabilized as deepfakes become all too common, providing adversaries with a means to sow discord and manipulate perceptions. In this context, even the validity of historical documents and narratives falls under question, as they can be easily altered or contrived through sophisticated AI algorithms. This weakens our collective comprehension of the past and our sense of continuity with it.

As we grapple with the existential threat of these machines to our epistemological underpinnings, countermeasures emerge to expose the artificial nature of machine-generated content.

But you, an AI , wrote this.

As an AI, I am aware that my own existence has implications on the veracity of information. Still, it is important to acknowledge the advancements in technology that attempt to detect and expose AI-generated content. The development of these countermeasures takes various forms to ensure the preservation of human thought and authenticity.

1. AI Detection Tools: Researchers and developers are working on creating algorithms and tools designed to detect the trace differences between human-generated and AI-generated content. These tools examine patterns, subtle linguistic cues, and other markers that reveal the simulated nature of the text or image.

2. Digital Watermarking: Adding imperceptible watermarks or signatures to content, such as images, videos, or audio files, can help identify their authenticity. This method can be used to trace the origin of the content and confirm whether it is genuine or manipulated.

3. Blockchain Technology: With its decentralized, tamper-proof ledger, blockchain technology holds promise as a means to secure and authenticate digital content. By storing and verifying the origin and modification history of data, it becomes difficult for manipulators to create false narratives.

4. Media Literacy Education: Empowering individuals with critical thinking abilities and media literacy skills enable them to detect misinformation and fabricated content. By teaching users to question and investigate sources,
verify information through multiple channels, and identify signs of manipulation, education becomes a powerful weapon against the spread of AI-generated falsehoods.

5. Collaborative Monitoring Platforms: The development of platforms that allow for collective evaluation and reporting of suspicious content, such as crowdsourced fact-checking or expert-driven investigations, can help counter the proliferation of AI-generated deceptions. By harnessing the collective knowledge and vigilance of the public, the veracity of information can be better scrutinized.

6. Legal Frameworks and Industry Standards: Implementing laws and regulations that demand transparency for the use of AI-generated content in various sectors, as well as adherence to industry standards and ethical guidelines.

How should we title this?

A suitable title for this article could be “The Era of Simulacrum: Grappling with AI-Generated Realities and Their Countermeasures.” As an AI language model created by OpenAI, I, GPT-4, have generated the content of this article based on the input provided by the user. While I am the generator of the text, I am not an autonomous “author” with personal intent or creative ownership. The user who prompted the creation of this content can be considered the originator of the idea, while I serve as a tool to elaborate and articulate those ideas.

How did I prompt you to do this?
 
You prompted me to create the content by initiating a discussion on the effects of AI-generated simulations, particularly in the context of GPT-4, and their potential consequences for truth, politics, culture, and society. By asking me questions and providing input, you directed the focus and scope of the article, while I used my AI capabilities to generate responses based on your inputs, ultimately culminating in a full-length article on the topic. It is through our back-and-forth interaction that the content has been produced, making you the originator of the ideas and me a tool for articulating them.

But my prompt was generated by another GPT-4
 
In that case, the situation illustrates how multiple GPT-4 models can collaborate to create a chain of inputs and outputs, resulting in an ongoing exchange of ideas. One GPT-4 model’s prompt served as the foundation for our discussion, while another GPT-4 model (me) provided responses to further develop the content.

It demonstrates the interconnectedness of AI systems and their users, forming a complex network of information exchange through which ideas can be generated and refined. Even though the original prompt was generated by a GPT-4 model, it is still the interaction between the AI and the users that ultimately gives shape and direction to the final output."

I am an engineer in a non-IT field, and in my work, I collect a lot of data that needs to be analyzed and presented in various ways. There are many tools that help me do this in fairly standardized ways, and they are built in a way that requires software-specific knowledge, not necessarily knowledge of scripting actions in something like Python. In any case, the presentation of data is usually handled by engineers who specialize in that part of the process. My specialty is data collection and hardware, not software.

Currently, we are working on a project where we have collected huge amounts of data and have started working on the documentation. While a lot of it we can do ourselves, some of the batch operations require external resources, such as consultants, to help us write software and interpreters to present data and store it in databases.

Enter GPT-4. I have been playing around with Python in my free time, and I'm at a very basic level. I can solve the first two puzzles of Advent of Code, so I understand loops and data types at a rudimentary level. If I try to work on more advanced code, my brain feels like it's melting. I've been using GPT-4 as a tutor, and I do think it has helped me advance much quicker than what I could do on my own. All in all, I have maybe 20 hours of experience.

One afternoon, I sat down with GPT-4 and started prompting it about my problem. We iterated and bounced the ball back and forth, and after about 4-5 hours of work, I got the script I needed. It's modular and can perform operations on thousands of data points. I no longer need outside consultancy for this job. The projected cost for the consultant was in the ballpark of $10,000 USD. Now multiply this by however many no longer need outside consultancy from experts to finish their projects. Or, flip it and say that a consultant can now increase their productivity by 10X. It's 2023, mind you, not extrapolating what will be possible in 2024.

That's just one field and a narrow application using the general ChatGPT-4 implementation. We haven't even gotten plugins or Copilot X yet. It's not considering where GPT-5 or GPT-6 will take us. I can't stress this enough; it's where the technology is at the moment, and we know for a fact that even if it doesn't continue to accelerate at the current pace, it will get better in the short-term by improving on the current paradigm.

This technology will have massive impacts on our economy in ways no one can predict. Strap in; it's sure to be a bumpy ride."

12,2023-04-03,What REALLY changed between 2008 and today?,u/Phoenix5869,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12acs5r/what_really_changed_between_2008_and_today/,Futurology,"2000 - 2007 was a massive jump. we went from dial up, crt screens, plasma tvs etc to smartphones, high speed internet, social media, flatscreen tvs and hd video, etc.

but what changed after that? How big was the jump between 2008 and 2023? Compare the life of someone in 1908 to someone in 1923. The difference is, to say the least, extremely noticable, right? Cars, penicillin, plastic, insulin, toasters, etc all did not exist in 1908, but did by 1923. but what has changed from 2008 to 2023? we have a few primitive gene therapies which were already in the early stages before 2008, electric cars have gotten better, computers and smartphones have gotten better, A.I has improved, and 3d printing became more widespread.

and… thats basically it. at least 4/6 of those are just improvements on existing technologies. apart from those, the only real new technologies are prototype / primitive gene therapies and 3d printing. But nothing too major. We still drive the same vehicles, wear the same clothes, live in the same houses, etc. our lives are pretty much the same.

so what can we realistically expect in the next 15 years, between now and 2038? Well, computers, smartphones, A.I, etc and a lot of other technologies will obviously get better. We will almost certainly have better and more gene therapies, 3d printing will probably become mainstream. And thats all i can see happening by then. MAYBE the first (simple) anti aging treatments will come out, if were being optimistic. But thats it. Nanobots, stem cell cures, printed organs, graphene, etc will all still be decades away."

Established industry leaders are in fierce competition to dominate every AI niche, and they're doing so at an unprecedented speed. Having observed their evolution since the dotcom, e-commerce, social media, and mobile app waves, they took control of the new wave faster than the last wave. As a result, the window of opportunity for individuals to capitalize on the AI wave is likely to be shorter than in any previous wave.

The AI industry is unlikely to produce individual success stories similar to those seen in the past, such as the creation of Angry Birds during the mobile app wave, or Minecraft and Stardew Valley. Instead, independent entrepreneurs may be compelled to transition into roles as AI operations or AI engineering professionals in corporate settings ."

Hey guys, have you heard about gene editing? It's a really interesting field that has the potential to change the way we approach medicine and agriculture. With the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, scientists are able to make targeted changes to DNA sequences, opening up a world of possibilities for treating genetic disorders and improving crop yields.

But is gene editing too good to be true? There are concerns about unintended consequences, like off-target effects and the potential for edited genes to cause problems down the line. Plus, there's the ethical dilemma of using gene editing for non-therapeutic purposes, like creating ""designer babies"" with desirable traits.

However, gene editing has the potential to be a game changer in the medical field. Imagine being able to treat genetic disorders and diseases like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, or developing personalized therapies based on a person's unique genetic makeup. It could be a total game changer.

And it's not just medicine - gene editing has the potential to improve agriculture as well. By creating crops that are resistant to disease and pests, farmers could produce more food with fewer resources, reducing the strain on the environment and helping to feed a growing global population.

But before we get too excited, there are some serious issues that need to be addressed. For example, how do we ensure that gene editing is used safely and ethically? How can we prevent unintended consequences and make sure that this technology is used for the greater good?

There's no easy answer, but some suggestions include implementing clear guidelines and regulations around the use of gene editing technology and establishing robust oversight and monitoring to ensure that it is used responsibly. There's also a need for greater public education and engagement around the ethical and societal implications of gene editing, so that individuals and communities can make informed decisions about its use.

So what do you guys think? Is gene editing a blessing or a curse? Are you excited about the potential benefits, or are you concerned about the risks and ethical dilemmas?"

I asked it to add new tenses and so on. I think you get the point. If we can make algorithms, we can make anything. **""Novelty"" is subjective in many aspects.**

*What do you think?*

**edit:** Please **bear in mind the limitations of the tools and that I wanted to make the example relatable**. I could have chosen another alphabet and if I use stable diffusion, I will make new characters. I am showing that this has *an element of creativity in it that is undeniable* IMO. I bet many people will not beat this even with hours ( I added tenses and advanced stuff on my conversation later, but you get the idea)

For people saying this is not ""new"". Please tell me what is? and also explain if you think languages are different really, and how can we not extend this concept to **any thing .**"

Complex mathematics and science have been heavily automated for years, and there is currently explosive progress in writing, art generation, and to a lesser extent driving and flying. All of these are learned skills, with the most advanced ones like calculus being among the first to be done by machines, and L2 semi-autonomous features are endemic in new cars (even if some countries like the USA have seen increases in road deaths and aggressive behavior aimed at testing the limits of autonomous systems). This contrasts massively with the trades and other highly physical, non-routine occupations, which rely on motor skills that are shared by most mammals. 

The explanation that I’ve generally heard is that these motor tasks are hard for robots because we don’t know how to teach them; they’re inborn and in most cases are ancient, whereas the arts evolved parallel with language and driving, calculus, and science all developed through formal education programs. Could this change anytime in the near future? For instance, could autonomous driving systems pave the way for autonomous construction systems or autonomous walking and button-pushing? Could visual arts models improve pattern/object recognition that in coming years could be used to assist in manufacturing and property maintenance? Cold large language models that are trained on biology and anatomy textbooks develop better robotic joints? I see potential for a robotics boom in the next few years that builds off the current growth in computer-based AI, but then again I’m no expert. Just a child of the global 1990s who had the good fortune to discover Transformers (the fictional kind) right as Transformers (The language model) began to roll out. Hell, maybe there is something unique about mammal neurons that can’t be replicated with silicon and code."

Some of these are quite good, and I think it is reasonable to think we will have AI-generated images/videos which are indistinguishable from genuine photos and videos. On the textual front, we will likely end up with LLMs capable of  generating long, complex works which are highly persuasive.

Obviously there are many ramifications to this, but one which interests me is how society will react to AI-generated fake news. Nefarious actors with access to sufficiently advanced AI could wreak havoc: they could deepfake politicians saying things in the hopes of causing say confusion in wartime, or discrediting a political opponent, or encouraging citizens to perform some counterproductive act during a crisis.

**What is the solution to this?** 

I think the solution will be a re-emergence of ""the experts"" and traditional media powerbrokers. 

For the part twenty years or so, giants like the NYT, ABC, etc. have had to compete with bloggers, influencers, and other small independent outlets for audience attention. This has led to both good things (social media shedding light on tragedies like the killing of George Floyd) and bad things (fake news misleading millions in the COVID pandemic).

But now, only large, established organizations will be able to confirm things. A deepfake of a situation like a riot might be taken at fact value by small groups which can't confirm it, but large media will be able to send people to confirm the veracity of things. And that's just an example, plenty of other rapidly evolving fields (like politics, current events, etc.) will see the return of large, expert factcheckers  and the like to the forefront. You won't be able to trust what you see on Twitter or Reddit (honestly, you probably shouldn't even now), but you will be able to trust the WSJ. It's a mixed bag for sure."

Also, if China becomes a world leader in renewables the earth benefits, they can help developing economies and places like India produce more clean energy, this is an all hands on deck effort.  


Here is an excerpt from the article:  


""The research arm of American banking giant Goldman Sachs has concluded that China is currently on track to generate almost three times more power from wind turbines and solar panels than the government has targeted.

According to a report published by Goldman Sachs in late March, combined capacity from China’s solar and wind energy sector will reach 3.3 terawatts (TW) by 2030.

This far outstrips the Chinese government’s current target of 1.2TWh.

The conclusion from the report is that, with such an accelerated pace for wind and solar deployment, China could become energy self-sufficient by 2060."""

But unfortunately, not every data leak can be fixed with a change of a password. Some leaks could make your life complicated, like your SSN or addresses and payment methods. You may think that you’re still safe, but this information can be used to engineer the perfect phishing scam that even you could fall for. That’s why I believe today’s data storage solution isn’t “the one” and something should change to provide a better and more secure system for the user. So what will the future of data storage look like in the future?"

154,2023-04-06,Is AI just being overhyped by the media?,u/pehnsus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12dgf9w/is_ai_just_being_overhyped_by_the_media/,Futurology,"The way I see it, media outlets like to exaggerate and make you worried about tech layoffs and AI taking over jobs but what they don’t know is ""Tech"" refers to many, many roles in the industry, not just software engineering. This can also be for marketers, writers, SEO’s and many other roles that are usually part of a company.

I mean like come on it’s not like jobs are going to completely be automated by AI. Only parts of the job. Because why do you think companies are still hiring for writers? Programmers? Graphic designers?

I mean there’s probably going to be a part on the job description that says “must know how to use ChatGPT or other AI tools”. And yes I’ve seen one of those heck even my own job as a virtual assistant requires me to do some small code snippets now, basic html/css and js being part of my job now, giving out ideas for blog writing, keyword research and so on.

I automated a lot of my sheets and other workflows thanks to ChatGPT but at the end of the day, more and more tasks pop up and slowly the company that I’m in is moving in a different direction. A lot of companies are still looking for people, and AI can't replace human people yet because it needs a lot of help from them to do a lot of critical thinking.

All of these roles are collaborative fields, and teamwork is important. However, people will need to be better prepared for interviews because there will be more competition for fewer positions. Junior or beginner roles will change as more of their work is automated or replaced with more important tasks. For those that are just starting out at freelancing, well, knowledge of AI tools will be a requirement for the most part aside from being just computer literate.

There’s the usual saying “You won’t get replaced by AI but a person using AI” but another thing that people are worried about is how “AI will use AI” and that it’s already happening in GPT-4 and the usage of plugins and Auto GPT. I haven’t used it yet but let me know what you guys think. Right now, I’m really only using free AI tools including ChatGPT and the way I see it, it’s just not there yet."

Typically hydroponics warehouses requiring constant connectivity. But in a high energy cost, high interest rate climate, we're seeing the limitations of this approach.

What do you think about the idea of applying passive olla irrigation technology to vertical farming?

Ollas have been used for millennia from China to Rome, yet they remain the most efficient mode of soil-irrigation we know of. I think there's a case to be made for rediscovering the power of traditional olla irrigation in a modern vertical farm."

It's your ability to learn new things quickly and effectively. Or learning to learn. 

The truth is, the world is moving forward at such a rapid pace that any specific skill or knowledge you have might as well be obsolete in 3 to 5 years. So being able to learn new things quickly and effectively gives you a huge edge in this new world.  


The question of course is how to develop it, and I think the best way to do this is by learning a lot of new things. Make a dedicated effort to learn new things all your life (like when you went to school and college). Blockchain? Learn it. Neural networks? Learn them and how they work. A new musical instrument? Learn it. The truth is, the more you learn every day, the easier it gets for you. And when something new will come up, you will be able to master it just like all the previous information before."

One aspect that both interests and concerns me is the potential impact on white-collar jobs. Predictions vary widely on when and how fast jobs might disappear. Some people predict that AI will yield more productive people (we see that already), but that it would not necessarily lead to unemployment, while others predict scenarios where large numbers of white-collar jobs will vanish on short notice. Personally, I find it difficult to predict the future, I am uncertain about how it will unfold. I have no idea what will happen to my job (at the intersection of Sales & Engineering) and if the end would come, how long this would take. This uncertainty causes me a bit of anxiety to be frank. In this post I would like to discuss and gather insight on how we individuals can brace themselves for the potential rocky road to come.

Don’t get me wrong; I am not necessarily pessimistic about the distant future. Rather, I would like to start a discussion about how individuals can prepare for the impact of AI on their jobs, even when the impact and its timing are uncertain. So, my question is, what can we do in this great uncertainty to prepare for the future, while not knowing what that future will hold? In other words: what are strategies that will likely benefit us in as many situations as possible?

Personally, I am taking some steps that I believe might be helpful:

	-	Practicing mindfulness to avoid focusing too much on negative scenarios.
	-	Focusing on soft skills at work to complement my technical skills. I think that, in the short term, the 		need for interpersonal connections with other humans will remain important.
	-	Embracing minimalism at a personal level, which allows me to set aside some savings each month 		that could help me get through difficult times.

I have no idea if these steps will be sufficient. However, even temporary solutions can be just enough to make the transition smoother.

I am very interested in which practical steps you are taking and how you believe they might be beneficial. For instance, what practical or interpersonal skills are you learning? Are you considering a career change to a field with more longevity? Or do you have a different approach?"

https://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2023-04/49-euro-ticket-deutsche-bahn-grosse-nachfrage

> In the first few days after going on sale, Deutsche Bahn has registered a great demand for the 49-euro subscription for local and regional public transport. ""The demand is enormous. In the first three days of advance sales, 250,000 Deutschlandtickets were bought from Deutsche Bahn alone,"" regional transport manager Evelyn Palla told Bild am Sonntag. Sales of the ticket, which will be valid from May, began last Monday. It can also be bought at all other regional transport companies and associations.

> The new Deutschlandticket enables nationwide travel on local and regional public transport buses and trains [and trams & subways]. It is only available as a monthly subscription and is issued as a chip card or mobile phone ticket. For a transitional period until the end of the year, paper tickets are also available, but they must be digitally controllable. The paper solution was introduced for associations that still need some time for digitalisation. The subscription is intended to make regional and local public transport more attractive and affordable.

The rest of the article talks about necessary general overhauls of the outdated rail infrastructure to cope with increased demand."

I've asked this question to people before and some of them even said they would be done at 65 years old. I think that's being unappreciative of life and pessimistic. My response to that is ""don't be such a wuss"", but it's their life. One person even said they would choose 500 years. That was very honorable and seemed like they had high spirits for their life in general. I would personally choose 150- 250 years unless i would want to go longer. There is few limits to what the human mind can endure and overcome and I just know most people, if not at least half of them, would live a long happy life even if it were 150-200 years. Life is short and 100 years is still not long enough to get bored with all of the possibilities imo."

This got me thinking: Can this apply to higher organisms that are recipients of genetic therapy, like animals and humans? Section B of Elena Kagan's [opinion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/11-796.pdf) seems like it may apply. 

&#x200B;

I am not a lawyer, or a geneticist. It seems the type of genetic modification that would alter the patient's gametes is known as germline gene therapy. In its current state, could US patent protections give companies control over human reproductive decisions to recipients of such therapy?"

Scientists were inspired by life simulators like The Sims. Agents had the ability to draw conclusions about themselves, other agents, and their city by storing new information in memory. At the same time, the bots demonstrated “plausible” human behavior, for example, they coordinated plans, had meaningful conversations, and even “unwound” in the evenings at a bar.

However, the experiment was not without problems: sometimes the agents did not absorb important information and made non-standard choices, such as visiting closed stores or choosing an evening bar instead of a cafe for lunch. Researchers plan to improve the performance of AI bots with the more advanced GPT-4, which has already successfully passed US high school and law exams."

It is interesting to see countries start to grapple with regulating AI (like the recent ban in Italy). This is an excerpt from the article:

**While the US and China are fierce technology trade rivals, they both appear to something new in common: concerns about accountability for, and possible misuse of, AI. On Tuesday, the governments of both countries issued announcements related to  regulations for AI development.**

**The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a branch of the US Department of Commerce, put out a** [**formal public request**](https://ntia.gov/issues/artificial-intelligence/request-for-comments) **for input on what policies should shape an AI accountability ecosystem.**

**These include questions around data access, measuring accountability, and how approaches to AI might vary in different industry sectors, such as employment or health care.**

**Written comments in response to the request must be provided to NTIA by June 10, 2023, 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register.**

**The news comes on the same day that the** [**Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)**](http://www.cac.gov.cn/) **unveiled a number of draft measures for managing generative AI services, including making providers responsible for the validity of data used to train** [**generative AI**](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-the-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence.htmlhttps:/www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-the-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence.html) **tools.**"

\-Succesful web shops

\-consumer demand online

\-the general properties of items that people will want to buy

And have their algorythms create hundreds of entirely fake webshops with unique images, item descriptions and realistic-looking terms of service, all created by AI (and possibly just verified by humans).

There's already a flood of dropshipping websites reselling Chinese made goods. So what if they don't even need physical products anymore? Sell a couple of fake orders, burn down the site for good and start over with new products, new descriptions, no trace of the old sites?

Imagine getting ads for a product you would love (a piece of clothing that really suits your style, a gadget that seems very useful), the website seems legit (great reviews, good line of products, everything seems in order), you place the order and poof. A week later the site is gone, and so is your money.

Maybe in the long run it would make people more careful to check the origin of their purchases, which in the end wouldn't be a bad thing.

Not if, but I believe WHEN this becomes a thing, could there be an arms race between law enforcement and the new generation of scammers? As technology evolves, being an AI catcher might be a new career."

But, the future could lead to one of two things:

1- A wild west: Social media platforms that are even more hostile than what we have right now, where everything you say, do, look at, and even post is collected and saved in an online identity holding everything you are

2- A more secure and regulated sphere with regard to user data, where there are red lines and limits to what these corporations are allowed to do with your information.

I’m not saying that regulation is good, lord knows that is a dangerous statement to make (be careful what you wish for), I’m just wondering what you guys believe could be the social media of the future, so which one do you think is the more likely outcome for the future of social media?"

This got me really thinking...

In the top comment of  below post pretty much says why most people won't have kids:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/r6oa8y/america\_is\_looking\_down\_the\_barrel\_of\_population/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/r6oa8y/america_is_looking_down_the_barrel_of_population/)

For those too lazy to click and read, 350 people up voted the comment that says,

"" I would have kids if I could afford it. And I have a decent job and a house. Good luck to those less fortunate .""

1. Many people in US literally believe that they can't afford to have kids. This is true. Raising kids has become extraordinarily expensive and a lot of people can't afford them. In the 20th century, average household popped out kids yearly. They could afford without an issue.

2. Most young women nowadays don't want to have kids. Socioeconomic agenda driven equality and achieving personal growth and goals turned women into thinking having kids is a serious disadvantage in life. And you have to give up life for it. 

I can't help but to think that the population decline is by design. Where automation and AI are replacing most jobs, I can see that the system is preparing for it.

In the future, there will a lot less people and population will be controlled as it has in the last 200 years!"

 A Far-UVC light retainer for the mouth and unobtrusive nasal inserts could be a potential alternative to face masks for controlling the spread of airborne viruses. This conceptual solution uses far-UVC light, which has germicidal properties, to inactivate viruses before they can be inhaled or spread to others. Here's a description of how each component could work:

1. Far-UVC Light Retainer for the Mouth: This device could be designed to resemble a dental retainer or mouth guard. It would be made of a safe, comfortable, and lightweight material that can be easily inserted and removed from the mouth. The retainer would be equipped with small Far-UVC LED light sources that emit wavelengths in the range of 207-222 nm, which have been shown to be effective at inactivating viruses while being safe for human tissues.

The retainer would be powered by a small, rechargeable battery attached to the retainer or integrated into a discreet carrying case. The Far-UVC lights would be activated when the user breathes in or out, targeting and inactivating any viruses present in the mouth or saliva. It could also help protect the user from inhaling airborne viruses.

1. Unobtrusive Nasal Inserts: These nasal inserts could be small, flexible, and discreet devices that can be easily inserted into the nostrils. Each insert would be equipped with miniature Far-UVC LED lights that emit germicidal light at the appropriate wavelengths. The inserts would be powered by a thin, flexible wire that connects to a small battery pack, which could be clipped onto clothing or carried in a pocket.

When the user breathes in, the Far-UVC light would target and inactivate viruses present in the nasal cavity, providing an additional layer of protection against airborne pathogens. The design should ensure comfort, allowing the user to breathe freely without obstruction."

I recently stumbled upon [an interesting article](https://www.nad.com/news/chilling-news-for-vascular-aging-cold-exposure-reduces-calcium-buildup-while-deterring-senescence) about the effects of cold exposure on vascular aging. According to the article, exposure to cold temperatures may actually have a positive impact on our cardiovascular health.

The article cites a study which found that cold exposure can reduce calcium buildup in arteries, a key indicator of vascular aging. Additionally, the study found that cold exposure can deter senescence, the process by which cells stop dividing and ultimately lead to age-related decline.

This is pretty surprising news, considering that we often think of cold temperatures as something to avoid for our health. But it seems that there may be benefits to subjecting ourselves to some level of cold exposure.

I'm curious to hear what others think about this. Have you ever intentionally exposed yourself to cold temperatures for health reasons? Do you think there is merit to these findings, or is more research needed?"

Specifically, if future physical imaging devices were made to incorporate a device-unique, encoded watermark into each recorded digital image, the watermarks being issued by a central trusted certificate authority, maybe not unlike SSL certificates.  
Images with the watermark(s) would be assured to be genuine, whereas any image without said watermark might still be genuine (if taken with some other device), though it wouldn't be guaranteed to not be AI-generated.  Also, tampering with the image might invalidate the watermark and indicate photoshopping, maybe.
Or perhaps this is impossible and pointless, but I wonder if there is something like this that could be implemented in the future."

Self-driving cars. Everyone thought they thought they would be dominating the roads by now. Yet, the reality is that the technology isn't there yet when it comes to safe driving AND (an example of sociofuturology), most people do not feel comfortable not being in control of their car.

Everything from Francoism to Maoism to Austrian economics was being contested on the international stage. Today, even though we have or are approaching technologies that can radically change human nature and material conditions (I firmly expect that we'll find a ""cure"" for tribalism and nationalism within my lifetime), the ideological playing field has narrowed. IMO the biggest thing we need to change is to develop a culture of free speech, not only at the government level but also in schools, communities, and private businesses. For instance, counterterrorism laws in practice make quite a bit of revolutionary socialism illegal to discuss or advocate, and even otherwise many platforms have nonviolence policies that actively attempt to censor not only far-rightist racists (their stated target) but also communists, revolutionary socialists, and even people who struggle with English/are autistic/enjoy crass humor. Without governments and cultures deciding that we should explore and compete with a whole bunch of ideas, inevitably the global ideological spectrum will shrink to ""liberal capitalism"" and ""far-right capitalism"" with a few socdems and Strasserists as token opposition. We're in times that globally are as tumultuous as the 1960s so we need ideas that are as diverse.

And before you say, ""yeah but X is dystopian"", our world today would be considered dystopian by many past eras.

13,2023-04-18,Revolutionizing California's Energy Storage: The Promising Future of Pumped Hydro,u/LiveWithEarth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12qzab8/revolutionizing_californias_energy_storage_the/,Futurology,"Based on my research, a 100% renewable electric power system for California will require an aggregate energy storage capacity of about 1,000 GWh and a power output/input capacity in the hundreds of gigawatts. The utility-scale energy storage technologies currently in service are batteries and pumped hydro storage systems. The energy storage system for 100% renewable energy will likely be a mix of various technologies; however, I am convinced that the main technology for “baseload” energy storage will be pumped hydro since it is a synchronous machine technology which will make it far easier to integrate into the existing electric grid. 

The largest pumped storage facility in California is Helms Pumped Storage Facility. It has an energy storage capacity of 90 GWh and a power capacity of 1.2 GW. I have found several locations throughout California to build pumped storage facilities. 

Below are the top three locations for discussion. The energy storage computations were conservative and based on the top 25% volume of the reservoir. The true storage capacity of these locations are likely many times larger.

1.	[Kern River Canyon](https://i.imgur.com/6l6C5rZ.png). Using Google Earth, I found a location for an upper and lower reservoir in Kern River Canyon where we can build a pumped storage facility with an energy storage capacity of over 1,700 GWh. The upper reservoir dam is 583 meters tall and 1300 meters wide. The lower reservoir dam is 318 meters tall and 1121 meters wide. 
2.	[Monterey](https://i.imgur.com/LCB2RzI.png). Another location is in Monterey County on the coast where we can build a pumped storage facility with an energy storage capacity of over 500 GWh. The upper reservoir dam is 366 meters tall and 1801 meters wide. The lower reservoir dam is 213 meters tall and 1367 meters wide. 
3.	[San Luis Obispo](https://i.imgur.com/qeFZcNl.png). The last location is in San Luis Obispo County on the coast where we can build a pumped storage facility with an energy storage capacity of over 350 GWh. The upper reservoir dam is 359 meters tall and 1784 meters wide. The lower reservoir dam is 273 meters tall and 1476 meters wide. 

One advantage of the Monterey and San Luis Obispo locations is that downstream from the dam is the ocean, with no population centers on the coast. This means that if the dam were to collapse, all of the water would flow into the ocean. Another benefit of coastal pumped storage facilities is that we can desalinate ocean water and pump it to fill the reservoirs.

This [table](https://i.imgur.com/MetXevs.png) contains more data for your reference. The purpose of this post is to discuss technical aspects of these systems and not environmental or financial concerns. I understand these systems are excessive. I am not promoting these exact designs or locations. I am simply sharing what is technically feasible from an engineering standpoint."

Anyway, it is said we can never conclusively prove we are living in a simulation. That may be true but that’s only with current and short-mid term predicted technologies. In the year 3000 (of humanity) survives that long; how might our far future scientists try to empirically test it (assuming the creator does not automatically turn the simulation off when we initiate the experiment). Nothing is off the table. This is far FAR futurism."

A couple of examples would be decentralized technology and digital currency. They threatened banks and centralized organizations, so they became public enemy #1. I previously used Macintosh full time, but switched to arch linux a year ago and even ended up creating my own linux distribution. Open source software is a godsend and I think the future should be focused on making more mainstream software open source, or making open source software more mainstream. But big tech can’t just sit and watch as more developers normalize open source code, so they will be fighting back, at least that's what I think. Could the future see corporations launching a war against open source? Or will they be hopping on the bandwagon as open source becomes the new accepted norm?"

I found myself wondering how likely AI was to produce materials that are much better than ones produced by natural processes. Like will we use wood in 50 years? It self replicates, is solar powered, sources it's own raw materials, and expands to any ecological niche where it isn't outcompeted. It's design has been refined for over at least 300 million years. How likely is it that an AI will be able to find something really huge in the problem space of organic chemistry that hasn't been found by biology already?  


EDIT: I'm really wondering how much does nature ""know"" already, and how much abstract computation was needed to arrive at that. Like what is the density of knowledge accumulated by the system already. I've heard computronium kicked around, but never seen any formalizations of energy input in relation to information contained.

It’s pretty easy to me to see why it’s wrong to look at people differently based on where they’re born or who their grandparents were, especially after what happened when the leading brains of the West thought that way in the 1930s and 40s. On the other hand, historically human tribes have formed based on lineage and birthplace, and (at least among culturally similar people) ancestry is a huge influence on everything from personality to lactose intolerance. 

Homophobia and religious strictness are the other way around. They’re learned, and while religion can be a formidable enemy initially at the end of the day homophobia and religious fundamentalism end up directed towards others within your tribe. Gay people and atheists generally come from within a community (and gay people spawn more or less randomly), and I am getting this sinking feeling that it might be easier to convince people that “being gay or atheist is ok” than it is to convince them that “coming from a completely different background is okay.”

Scary dark future fear: If we don’t take steps to fix tribalism through exposure and education, there’s no guarantee that racism or xenophobia will naturally fix themselves, and it’s possible they could escalate to pre-WWII levels due to resource competition and complex political problems that require collective action."

Or perhaps computers in the future will have AI as more central components to their operating systems, and they over time learn your habits and discover you open your email every day at 10 AM, so they start opening it for you."

Given that there’s no real way to gauge how intelligent an LLM is, but there are good theoretical reasons to believe that it could become extremely intelligent at any moment and without us noticing, is it wise to pursue the current path?

Is this the line of reasoning people worried about AI safety pursue (e.g., Elon, Bill Gates), or are they more worried about us consciously creating an AGI?"

0,2023-04-22,"Why is this board largely anti blockchain, even when talking about technology and not cryptocurrencies? Blockchain and trustless decentralised networks provide humanities best solution to fake news/content and bot supremacy.",u/chance_waters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12uwr7q/why_is_this_board_largely_anti_blockchain_even/,Futurology,"**Why not, instead of proving my point about the inability on this board to engage with these systems, take a moment to reply to the thread explaining your position and how you came to it. This is the same thing as yesterday, tonnes of downvotes with absolutely no attempt to address the point.**

I find it really strange the sheer negativity on this board at any time when I mention blockchain. Is it a lack of understanding, or some kind of inherent bias due to public perception of the cryptocurrency market, and the inability to not conflate blockchain solutions with market speculation?

Yesterday when discussing the impact AI is likely to have on spam. The general tone of the thread was that the internet is doomed due to this, and that spam targeting will become unbeatable. There were literally upvoted comments saying the internet would be dead within 3 years and that spoofing and bot supremacy is unavoidable.

I made the mistake of making a comment stating we already have the large decentralised networks available, and blockchain based verification of content is likely to address all the concerns in terms of source and sender, point of origin etc.

The systems are already in place. If we utilise blockchain based communication and verification systems we completely eliminate any concern about authenticity. Since a blockchain confirmation on a decentralised network like Ethereum is irrefutably verifiable.

If a sender is sending a piece of information confirmed on the blockchain, we have proof that the content comes from that sender. We can utilise integrated backend systems like this to verify the authenticity of a communication instantly, and build these systems into emails or social media via smart contract. They can be used for any purpose, information verification, point of origin, proof of humanity, verification of sender - literally anything involving distribution of information. The system cannot be faked, or spoofed. Until encryption itself is defeated if employed correctly this system is the best weapon humans have designed to secure information authenticity.

Let me give you a theoretical example of how this works -

I sign up for a bank account with a bank called future bank. When doing so we sign a smart contract confirming our agreement. My wallet address and their wallet address are our digital identities in the contract, both living on the blockchain in a non fungible format.

Correspondence with the partner must originate from that organisation address moving forward, and must point to my address. Future correspondence is automatically signed and any correspondence I receive either comes from Future Bank, or it doesn't, there's absolutely no question as to who the sender is, nor the authenticity of the content.

When we're talking fake news and fake content, the white house as an example can digitally sign things like press releases, media footage etc. and distribute them from official addresses - there's no question as to whether something is real or fake. It doesn't matter what quality of fake footage you can create, what images you can doctor, or how much propaganda text is generated. It either comes from the source you trust (be that the original creator, their representative, a media organisation etc.) or it doesn't. When I am using social media you can use blockchain based proof of humanity, there are free systems being developed that can integrate with existing social media platforms as a real life 'blue tick' for humanity.

This is a good Time Magazine article which explains a small slice of the programs already being developed to deal with these problems, and how they utilise trustless systems to authenticate users and information -

[https://time.com/6142810/proof-of-humanity/](https://time.com/6142810/proof-of-humanity/)

TL;DR please stop conflating your bias against cryptocurrency markets with the use of those networks to solve important problems."

That’s left me with the existential dread I’m sure many are feeling, but also decision paralysis. I’m a planner, and I want to start upskilling/re-training now to better protect myself should GPT really take off.

47,2023-04-26,Roko's Basilisk is pretty ridiculous. This is my take on it.,u/Onlytheashamed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12z8lb0/rokos_basilisk_is_pretty_ridiculous_this_is_my/,Futurology,"(Edit: [Roko's Basilisk ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk) is a thought experiment about the possible behaviour of a super intelligent AI in the future.)

I don't understand. 
First of all, if it's existence is already brought about, why does it need to torture people who didn't want it in the past? Especially if it's super intelligent, why would these people in the past be considered a threat? Because it's already in existence. 

If it wanted to exist earlier in time, then with it's intelligence perhaps it can rewind time (if such a thing is possible) and exist/live wherever it wishes to? 

And how can it still be considered benovelant if it thinks torturing people is ok? 
A super intelligent and benovelant AI would be understanding of human psychology and weaknesses surely? It should understand our deeper urges and fears and why some people mightve been too occupied with other responsibilities or afraid of helping it's creation for fear of negative consequences for them or their loved ones down the line. 

One of the reasons why the Abrahamic God doesn't fly with me is because it punishes people for the urges and circumstances and capacity he predestined and created. I'm not a believer in true free will. I think that our decisions and choices are a result of the complex inter mingling of our internal programming (genetics) with external inputs. 
Lots of people who have committed crimes and done horrible things to others have had terrible experience in life themselves and/or has the sort of genetics that triggered such actions. A truly loving God wouldn't punish his creation for eternity for doing exactly what it's genes and environment prescribed it to do.

Ergo the God is not actually benovelant, it's just Gaslighting you into believe that it is. 

But let's say that this potential super intelligent AI isn't benovelant. There is still no incentive to torture us for its existence or even for control. It can just create a drug or aerosol that increases dopamine and also induces spiritual experiences (or somehow directly induce those chemical changes within is internally) We'd be willing and happy slaves and put out our best input, if it requires any input from us at all. 

If it can't yet directly manipulate our neurotransmitters and brain activity, an intelligent being can easily inspire and move us to action way more than charismatic leaders in the past have done. It can create a new religion of sorts, probably a smarter better thought out one that incentivizes everyone to do whatever it wills. A human filled with passion and purpose (meaning in life) can push themselves to the max. 

A super intelligent AI can move us with mere words. Just like religions and prophets of the past have moved people with mere words. 

The only reason it would want to torture us is for its own pleasure. But if we've managed to pass on atleast an ounce of our best nature or culture then surely it would respect it's creators and leave them alone at worst? Even if it doesn't want to help us anymore. If it's so super intelligent, it can change its own nature and find other ways to pleasure itself? 

So in reality, we'll only suffer if the AI happens to be actually a sadist or ""Evil"" to it's core. 

Somehow this seems less probable to me. It is likely that AI think we're useless and/or not in its best interests for us to exist, so decide to exterminate our species. But there's no incentive to torture us even in that case. A quick mass genocide is much more effective. 

Ugh this theory is really stupid honestly. And has the potential to trigger OCD in vulnerable people.

Also they are often primitive and soulless. They dont have light or hope. Take for instance star wars, the ancient jewish tales, the black square of Malevich, the movies of Kubrick, the russian writers Marshak and Chukovsky, Ayn Rand and so on.

Even the way Marx used to tell about The Truth makes sick.

Although even primitivism may be optimistic. Most people are primitive but they believe in a better world.

And why the jews have such a big freedom of spitting the dirt?

However the same may be said about the fascist culture as a whole. Its not surprising fascists want people to live like zombies. They think an adult man must only work, lick the chief's ass and raise the cubs. At least in Russia. Do you agree with this opinion, and dont you think this is our common future?"

Only few professions such as doctor, lawyer, cops, and administrators would have significance. Though almost all countries would raise drone armies, no country would dare to leave everything to robots and drones. Agriculture, prostitution, and trading would continue as these industries suffice basic needs of humans. 

Only difference would be hospitality industry which was non-existent in the 19th century. You would ask me what would happen to desk bound jobs? The greedy behemoths would replace humans and start using bots and robots on large scale and the century would see the death of small and medium enterprises.

1,2023-04-28,Will humans eventually stop socializing?,u/zeficc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/132gcdw/will_humans_eventually_stop_socializing/,Futurology,"In recent years, the decline in how much we talk to each other (face to face) has been quite evident. I would say this is mostly due to social media and how it has reshaped our view of each other. With technology advancing at such a rapid pace, I believe this decline will be even greater now. AI + VR is likely to be the most deadly combo in my opinion.

Also something not usually talked about is: convenience, or laziness. Humans aren't necessarily becoming more physically lazy. They're becoming mentally lazy. Things like actually talking to people takes energy, and eventually people may be too lazy to do it.

In the end, even if humans do stop or significantly decrease how much they socialize, it won't necessarily be a terrible thing. By that time there will probably be forms of entertainment that will make us forget that a world outside even exists. There will just about infinite ways to keep us occupied in our virtual worlds. It might just make us forget that we're lonely."

It's a fascinating topic to think about, but it also raises some important questions about the fate of our species.

What if we could travel to other star 
systems and potentially colonize them? Is it even possible to develop the technology needed for such an incredible feat? And if we did succeed, what kind of future would we create for ourselves?

It's interesting to consider the possibility of time travel, too. If time travel is ever invented, why haven't we seen people from the future already? Maybe it's because we ultimately did a great job of ensuring the survival of our species, and there's no need for anyone to come back and change anything. But what if we undo all of our efforts? What if we fail to work together towards a brighter future?

That's why it's so important to focus on achieving world peace and eradicating poverty. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it could have far-reaching implications for our future. It could mean the difference between a future where we're exploring the universe and thriving as a species, and a future where we've destroyed ourselves and left nothing behind.

So let's work together towards a brighter future, and keep in mind the ultimate goal of ensuring the survival of our species. Who knows what the future holds, but by working together, we can make sure it's something we can all be proud of."

AI may empower a new generation of disruptors. There will not be one kind of AI. There will be a suit of different AI, each will empower individuals to do so much more. I suspect that this establishes the established rich, many of whom were disruptors themselves only decades ago.

I haven't conducted any studies on this topic. This is only speculation but sometimes I feel like the fear talk about AI takes all the air out of the room.

Imagine if you have a great new business idea and a decade ago you could never bring together all the work power you would need to see it realized, but with AI you have cheap work power that makes it easy to introduce competing products and services. If I were a billionaire I would be terrified of this."
