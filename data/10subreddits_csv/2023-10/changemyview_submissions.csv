1,2023-09-30,CMV: Mean World Syndrome Is A Dark Horse Explanation Of Population Aging That Is Flying Under The Radar,u/nekro_mantis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wphj1/cmv_mean_world_syndrome_is_a_dark_horse/,changemyview,"Most people are aware of this issue: the trend across the globe is toward decreased fertility rates. The percentage of populations that are elderly is growing, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to support them and general infrastructure with shrinking numbers of young people. Modernized countries attempt to remedy this with immigration, but, among other issues, most of the countries that immigrants are funneled from face similar demographic trends.

  
Depending on which side of the ideology spectrum you ask, you’ll get a few different perspectives on the cause and solution to this conundrum. Hopefully, I can give a synopsis that hits all the most notable ideas on the subject.

  
A left-leaning person will generally say something about how the pressures of economic life have become too burdensome. There’s simply no time left over for people to start families. People with better economic prospects would be more inclined to have kids. The solution must involve interventions like paid maternity leave, higher wages, lower cost of living, and so on. Maybe such interventions would help a bit, but there are a couple of issues with this idea:

  
1. Poorer people are often the ones who have higher fertility. Doesn’t that contradict this premise?

  
2. Research has found that incentives only produce mild improvements in fertility rates at best, with some studies even finding an overall reduction.

  
Ask a right-winger and you’ll hear a different story. Perhaps something about how women’s rights are incompatible with demographic sustainability. That women’s career focus enabled by reproductive autonomy inevitably leads to population collapse, and we need to go back to when nature was forcing people to have kids ([fertility is also a usually unspoken ulterior motive for right-wing policy initiatives against women’s reproductive autonomy regarding abortion and birth control](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2022/6/the-economic-cost-of-abortion)). Some might tell you that norms of monogamy dampen the desire for children, and [we need to bring harems back for reasons that can be generously described as nebulous](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1062950/full). Some may echo what those on the left say about the need for more aggressive financial incentivization of procreation, albeit in a slightly different language.

  
1. The main response here is that women’s reproductive autonomy is ethical and massively beneficial to society in terms of economic development and social cohesion. Even if it were practically feasible to completely outlaw or undo the invention of birth control and abortion, that would be way out of line with the aspirations and ideals of modern civilization.

  
A variable that I think people miss here is the extent to which media warps people’s view of the world and how hostile and dangerous it is:

  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean\_world\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_world_syndrome)

  
The metric of televisions per capita was found to be a unique predictor of dampened fertility back in 1997:

  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223858/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223858/)

  
Research backing mean world syndrome has focused on the amount of time watching television. Now, we all have far more advanced digital media devices in our pockets at all times. Furthermore, democratized broadcasting, online anonymity, and the ease of manipulating imagery and information have allowed unhinged sadism, cruelty, and fear-mongering to dominate the attention economy, turning the digital world into a notoriously depressing and toxic place that is culturally war-torn. Relatedly, people project idealized images of their lives on social media, which makes others feel like they must be terribly inadequate [compared to the competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/nttlvw/increasing_population_densities_predict/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It seems that mean world syndrome is a likely culprit for worsening fertility problems. Digital media puts people in a headspace where they perceive the world to be hostile and hopeless to an extent that often isn’t an accurate impression of the reality of their lives and actual prospects. People’s courage and desire to start families is being dampened by media-induced fear.

 The problem with this is that the abrahamic religions all vehemently disrespect atheists. According to those religions, God is all-knowing and all-good. Also, according to these religions, God believes that it is right for atheists to be sent to suffer worse than imaginable. If God is all-knowing and moral, this means that this punishment must be deserved.

This means that these religions, and by proxy their followers, believe that atheists are terrible people and that it is right to torture them. Why would you respect anyone who thought that of you? Atheists are perfectly in the right to disrespect and shit on religious beliefs. It's completely wrong to expect, or even ask, someone to respect anyone who thinks of them that horribly."

1,2023-10-01,CMV: Remembering child hood traumas is a waste of a time and peddled by subpar therapists...,u/DN-BBY,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wtlw9/cmv_remembering_child_hood_traumas_is_a_waste_of/,changemyview,"I experienced a lot of childhood trauma, basically victim of childhood abuse and what not.  I've done about 2 years of paid therapy, which didn't get me anywhere, and then the rest I just did self therapy, which I've made tremendous progress on, but basically just involves a lot and a lot of self reflection, trial / error and experimenting in life, jotting down thoughts to understand patterns and remember things, interacting with people that have experienced similar traumas and trading life advice, reading articles/blogs/reddit, and Googling.

However, in no part of my self therapy journey did I go back and revisit my childhood (which paid therapists try to pressure you to do so, partly so they can so called 'understand' you, but I bet partly for selfish curiosity reasons so they can tell their friends).  The reason I don't do so is honestly I don't remember much of my childhood.  I dissociated and depersonalized all throughout my childhood and young adult years.  I remember some major negative events, like maybe around 4-5, but in general I don't remember much because probably I dissociate and depersonalize.  Heck I still depersonalize/compartmentalize a lot today so making what happened last week fuzzy - and people expect me to remember things that happen 20 years ago LMAO.

And till this day, I still don't find any reason to go digging into the past, which IMO just leads to rumination and overthinking.  My view has always been looking forward to the future.  My friends have suggested that I try shrooms or acid to see if I remember anything, but I haven't gotten around to it, mainly because I don't want to block out a day of my time, and I need the right headspace to do it.  But if I'm in the right headspace, I have no desire to do drugs, so basically I'm probably never gonna do it.

Regardless, I don't see what there is to gain to remember the past.  I'm currently working on managing so called 'emotional flashbacks' which is tied to just triggers in every day life.  These triggers obviously developed from childhood trauma.  Flashback is kinda of a misnomer because I actually don't flashback to any time in life. These flashbacks just take me to a feeling I felt in my childhood, not an event.  I have no idea what past event is causing said feeling and no vision of it pops into my head when I experience an 'emotional flashback' - I just feel small and scared or whatever.  But recognizing what caused the trigger currently and recognizing the emotion and realizing I don't live in the past, helps me manage and conquer that feeling.  This simple exercise requires no amount of looking backwards, but just looking at the present.

**CMV**: **Subpar therapists try to lead you down the wrong path by poking around in your past, and have you asking questions like why, what, when the focus should be to move forward, not backwards.  They take your mind to the wrong places.** Retraining the thinking process as well building emotional intelligence, mindfulness, self awareness, are much better use of time, then poking around in the brain for something that might not even exist."

1,2023-10-01,CMV: The neurodiversity movement is harmful to those with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD,u/RyanBleazard,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16x0l0o/cmv_the_neurodiversity_movement_is_harmful_to/,changemyview,"# Background

I will be arguing against the concept of neurodiversity or neurodivergence that we encounter periodically, especially in the trade media. There it's often used to express the idea that because ADHD or other neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD represent a continuum of symptoms within the population there is no reason to diagnose, and some extreme advocates even go the point of arguing against treating these conditions as a disorder when it is just part of typical human variation.   


One can acknowledge that ADHD, for instance, represents the extreme end of a typical distribution of a psychological trait while at the same time acknowledging that those at the extreme lower end of this trait experience harm and impairment.  It is therefore reasonable to offer them a diagnosis that grants them access to treatments, services, entitlements, and protections that, absent the diagnosis, they would not receive.  


# Underlying causes

In order to address this idea of neurodiversity, I've created an illustration here of what is a normal bell curve: [https://ibb.co/r0XLwjS](https://ibb.co/r0XLwjS)  


So yes, ADHD for instance, represents a continuum of symptoms within the population. Some people have very little if any ADHD other people have lots of symptoms and thus there is an underlying continuum. So we can represent this as that of a  typical bell curve like you would see for height, weight or your familiar with the bell curve of intelligence and so on.   


You might ask the question what is the trait that ADHD represents as the extreme lower dimension of? In other words, what is failing to develop appropriately during brain development that would lead to someone having the disorder. The answer is that it is a major deficit across most if not all of the executive functions (self-motivation, inhibition, working memory, emotional regulation, persistence to the future, reconstitution) and since executive functioning is necessary for human self-regulation ADHD really represents the extreme end of the curve of self-regulation.  


We can take this curve and parse it up by saying that the mean is what we would call the typical range of neurodiversity. And if we go above the mean on the right, there are people who are above average in self-regulation and if we go way up there are people that are gifted.  


# Where impairment begins

There is a below average group of individuals in executive functioning & self-regulation. They’re not necessarily impaired, they function pretty typically but they’re certainly not as talented in self-regulation as those on the centre or right hand side of the bell curve; but nevertheless, these people fall well within diverse typical range of the distribution.  
  
However there reaches a point where the executive deficits in ADHD that is self-regulation become sufficiently deficient/low that the individual begins to show symptoms of ADHD, the inattention, impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, the hyperactivity and so on and that’s going on about 1 to 1 1/2 deviations below the mean. Now, these people may not get a diagnosis, and if you want to call them an ADHD personality, they’re just sort of sparkling, effervescent and talkative, gregarious, probably extroverted, that’s fine but they’re going to begin to have some symptoms of the disorder but they’re not diagnosable. Because even though they fall towards the lower side of the spectrum we do not see evidence of significant impairment in major life activities such as education, work, etc or harm such as increased mortality or morbidity. **And this is really where the concept of neurodiversity is acceptable, can be relegated to, but ends here.**  
  
Because, we then we reach this point in the curve, where we start to see people who are impaired. The symptoms are leading to harm and the environment is kicking back against the expression of these frequent and often severe symptoms in executive functioning. So, it is at this point where harm and impairment develops; that we draw the line and make the diagnosis of ADHD as a disorder. This accounts for 3-5% of the adult population. This is where ADHD begins.  


# Diagnosis & Treatment

You might ask well why do we have to draw that line? Because we have decisions to make in clinical practice, do we prescribe for you or not, are you eligible for accommodations and protections under government acts or not? There's no halfway measure here. We either act or we don't.  


And the reason we have to do that is because these conditions causes harm. Professions such as psychiatry exist to alleviate harm and impairment in individuals. You can't have these professions and simultanously assert there's no disorder here and therefore we don't need alleviation of distress in these people.

And that's how it is. If you want these entitlements and all the other things that people with ADHD may be eligible for, then a categorical decision has to get made. We can't give you those things and then turn around and say that ""this is your superpower"" or a ""gift"" and you're just part of normal variation, there's ""no reason to label or treat"", do you see how silly that is? We're not going to go down the halls of congress and argue for entitlements and protections and at the same time champion these serious neurodevelopmental disorders as some kind of gift or normal human variation that otherwise does no harm."

1,2023-10-01,CMV: Inheritance taxes can't fix economic inequality,u/phileconomicus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16x1w5p/cmv_inheritance_taxes_cant_fix_economic_inequality/,changemyview,"Many leftist commentators seem to believe something like the following argument:

Premise 1: Rich people passing on their wealth to their children after they die is an important cause of rising economic inequality

Premise 2: Rising economic inequality is bad

Premise 3: Higher inheritance taxes would reduce intergenerational wealth transfers and so reduce economic inequality

Conclusion: Therefore, to reduce economic inequality, inheritance taxes should be raised

&#x200B;

I accept premise 2, but reject premises 1 and 3 because they substantially misunderstand how the world actually works. 

By the rich I mean the whole top 20%, not just the very rich 1% or super-rich 0.1% (cf [Richard Reeves on 'Dream Hoarders'](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/the-hoarding-of-the-american-dream/530481/)). Rich people do pass on enormous economic advantages to their children, but they do not wait until their death to do so. They buy houses in the best school districts; pay for quality extra-curriculars and child care; use their networks to access university and job opportunities; fund unpaid internships and post-grad vocational education (med/law school); subsidise the first step on the housing ladder; pick them up when they make terrible mistakes; and so on. Thanks to all this parental help - which is made possible only by their special wealth - these children enjoy outsized opportunities to become as wealthy and successful as their parents. 

The key point is that all these forms of assistance depend on parents' wealth, but none are dependent on a transfer of assets after the parents' death. By the time that happens, these children are usually already well into the careers their parents' money has opened to them, and are usually independently wealthy. The intergenerational transfer has already taken place.

It follows that if a society really wants to reduce economic inequality it should focus on taxing wealth as it is created rather than waiting until people die. e.g. Much higher property taxes to capture the outsized gains flowing to homeowners in the last decades. But also, policies to reduce the special advantages that money can buy children, such as banning unpaid internships, legacy admissions to universities, and so on. I won't go into that here. But what certainly won't work is increasing inheritance tax rates!

But I feel that the concept of video game monetization is'nt a bad idea per se as it can be used to incentivise people to frequent the games more as there is content for people to purchase that can be used to fund further game development.  As long as you don't have to rely on luck and you get what you actually pay for such as skins and those don't affect game balance at all, then I'm fine with the concept.

The problem is that studios such as EA Games tend to ignore what fans want and go into what they can squeeze out of monetization itself such as R&G gambling and randomized lootboxes. As much as they are useful for encouraging people to spend money, they tend to give  monetization a pretty bad rap in video games, resulting in gamers frowning upon the idea of monetization in video games.

TL:DR: The idea of video game monetization is'nt a bad thing as a concept, but how it's viewed by game studios and executed in game that's causing problems for monetization.

By no means am I condoning the many actions committed by these countries. 

By less dirty, I think that under the direction of US officials, the military has usually not been called to simply take the lives of non combatants. To further clarify, the US government’s aim has not been to commit a genocide. 

Russia/Soviet, France, Germany, Belgium (not a super power but an example), China & Japan have all just straight up massacred swaths of people under direction of their leaders. All committed genocides. 

The UK is the worst of the worst and I think they take the #1 spot.

Now there undoubtedly have been many people killed by the US military however I don’t believe at any point that was the goal. The situations in which those things happened also were horrible as well. So cases like the trail of tears, the US in the Philippines and of course (indirectly) we destabilized many Latin American countries that caused (continues to cause) a bad situation for many. 

You have to keep in mind that a majority of the Atlantic Slave Trade was committed by the Europeans and the US stopped it shortly (comparatively) after their founding.

It's as simple as not littering. 

Do cities generally have larger population/population densities than their rural counterparts? Absolutely.  I'll say that probably plays a factor. 

However, I'd more so attribute it to apathy for your fellow man, and for the land you and your fellow man both pay for. After all, why is it your job? That's what you pay taxes for, as you go to throw away your Starbucks cup and miss. You won't pick it up though, no. Why should you? The city pays people for that. 

I've now lived about half of my life in small towns, and half in the city. Never once have I encountered a town filthier than the city it played a satellite to. And it's always the same whenever you call someone out in the city for being filthy, they're more offended by the fact they've been called out than the act itself. Sure, there's a good bit of that outside the city too (after all, we do have a reputation for being a very, let's say ""proud"" people), but like the rest of my points, it just seems so much worse in the city. 

Tl:dr: if you live in the city and you complain about how dirty it is, you better drop the entitlement and pick up a broom."

I'm not going to say David Beckham is not straight up 10/10.   


I'm saying on average, British people, i.e. people who if they took a 23andme test their results would come back as predominantly British are just a pretty unattractive group of people.   


Few things that's come to mind.   


\- Lack of cosmetic dentistry 

\- Pale skin, and this isn't even always bad because there are Irish. people or people from Scandinavian countries that are pale and I think it looks cool and attractive, just not in this case...  


\- Not particularly tall or athletic

&#x200B;

I don't know why this is the case. I suspect is because of that community being very insular for a long time in their history so their genetic pool is just a little shallow... I mean look at the history of the royals and how inbreeding was an issue.   


I think if you asked a hundred people ""Hey what country in the global west do you think has on average pretty attractive people"" you would hear things like: France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavian countries, The United States. If you did the opposite question and people had to give an answer I think the Brits would frequently show up...

1,2023-10-01,CMV: Ghoulish conversation ahead. I don't see how anyone could seriously think that US support to Ukraine is anything except in our global interests.,u/TheBeaarJeww,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16x7gnl/cmv_ghoulish_conversation_ahead_i_dont_see_how/,changemyview,"To expand on the title: I'm not saying that it's exclusively in our interests, I do think that it's also in Ukraine's interests and I also happen to think this is the morally correct thing to do. I'm saying that this also happens to align with our personal interests, i.e. destroying the military and economy of one of our largest rivals.   


I want to clarify that the focus of this discussion is not on the tragic human toll this war is taking on Ukraine, which is both unfortunate and saddening. The Ukrainian people, who are directly affected, are the true experts on this matter. If they choose to continue the fight, it is not for us to discourage them. Instead, I aim to discuss the specific monetary cost of U.S. support to Ukraine.  
Let's delve into the substantial assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine from January 24, 2022, to May 31, 2023, totaling $76.8 billion:  
Humanitarian Aid: $3.9 billion (5%)  
Financial Aid: $26.4 billion (34%)  
Total Military Aid: $46.6 billion (61%)  
A significant portion of this aid falls under 'Total Military Aid,' much of which has been provided through presidential drawdowns.  
What have we gained from donating this money?  
Russia has incurred substantial losses, including personnel, armored combat vehicles, tanks, artillery, aircraft, helicopters, and ships, underscoring the effectiveness of this support. In just one year, the Russian military has experienced losses that could take decades to recover from.  
Why is this beneficial?  
Russia has long been a geopolitical rival to the United States, making a strong Russian military against American interests.  
The $USD figures reported could be misleading  
However, the reported USD figures may be misleading. I'm going to use cluster munitions specifically as the example but this is true for much of the aid.  
The U.S. currently stockpiles approximately 3 million cluster munitions, valued at around $3,700 per round. If donated, this could be recorded as an $11 billion aid package to Ukraine. But, has the money truly been spent? These munitions were produced long ago, and letting them expire without use would represent an $11 billion cost to the U.S. with no benefit to its interests.  
Donating these munitions to Ukraine, which are already manufactured and expiring, not only provides practical value aligned with their intended use but also opens the door to replenishing our stockpiles with more modern munitions, thus contributing to the economy and national security.  
In essence, supplying aging equipment to Ukraine, which we would eventually replace with newer stock, is a strategic win-win. It strengthens Ukraine's defense capabilities, weakens Russia, and generates economic benefits by stimulating new munitions production.  
This example applies to much of what we've provided to Ukraine—older equipment that may never see battle. Instead of allowing it to rust in a scrapyard, we can donate it to Ukraine, where it will be used to neutralize Russian equipment and personnel, creating real value for the United States.  
A unique opportunity to test systems and gather data.  
Furthermore, this conflict presents a unique opportunity to test equipment and gather crucial data on performance in a peer-to-peer conflict, which is highly valuable to the U.S. military. We've spent the last two decades preparing for counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism missions and are now adapting to confront near-peer adversaries like Russia. Evaluating these systems in real-world conditions allows us to fine-tune and enhance them before they are employed by U.S. service members against such adversaries.  
In recent weeks, concerns have been raised about the performance of equipment like the F-16 sent to Ukraine. It's far better to discover any limitations or issues now, in a conflict without U.S. servicemembers at risk, than in a full-scale war with a near-peer adversary.  
In conclusion, while the human tragedy in Ukraine remains paramount, the discussion here revolves around the significant monetary support provided by the United States and the strategic benefits it offers. It's an intricate dance between utilizing existing resources, aiding an ally, and obtaining invaluable data that strengthens U.S. national interests and security."

I think an actor could use make-up to appear a different race and it not be a mockery of that race. Ben Kingsley in Ghandi, Laurence Olivier on Othello, etc.

Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder is borderline acceptable, because it's an attempt to accurately portray a physical embodiment of how he'd look if he was black, but his mannerisms and speech etc are somewhat lampooning a culture. But this is just poking fun at charicteristics where aren't immutable, so to me seems less derogatory.

I think it would be great to see a talented dramatic black actor play a character who has to be white, using make-up to achieve the look. And vice versa. If they are the best choice to capture the spirit of that character then why not. If it it does in good faith then I feel this is distinctly different from throwing on the costume just to make fun of how people look."

People in first world countries don't give a fuck about pieacy because they can afford AAA games.

In my country, Uzbekistan, many people are biggest PUBG fans and not much people are bored about even latest indie releases. In my country games are costing like a half of salary.

Denuvo won because of cracking low demand. Nobody wants to pay to Empress for a crack because it would be cheaper to buy 60 dollar game. I already saw how many people in russian gaming forums are now not giving a fuck about latest AAA releases and are starting prefer indies and Genshin Impact.

That's sad. I love indie games and old games, but I don't want to restrict my gaming preferences. I heard about offline activation stuff in russian gaming forums, which could be a good alternative.

Economics: the global gdp per capita, real or nominal, is the highest it has ever been, by a wide margin. Per capita gdp of the world currently (12,647$ in 2022) is over double that of just 2 decades ago (5,537$ in 2002). 

Inequality: inequality on a global level (i.e. the difference between rich and poor countries) has shrunk, since poorer countries had faster economic growth thanks to globalisation. Inequality is on the rise on a national level in most industrialised countries, yes, but the average income is still growing for all percentiles (see the US MEDIAN income salary, while also keeping in mind the fact that benefits constitute a higher proportion of total compensation).

Morality: many people like to claim how modern day society is less moral than the past, even though crime rates are slightly lower than that of those in the 1960s, and much lower than that of the 1990s. I’m using the US as an example for developed countries since it’s the biggest of them.
It is true that society has become more liberal, which may offend those holding conservative views on morality, but being offended that individuals are doing something that doesn’t fit their arbitrary sense of right and wrong Ian something I’m sympathetic about.

Now I don't dispute the impact the countries and their people have had on the colonies and that rich prominent people in particular caused terrible things.

My issue is that in many of these countries the class divide means the leaders and rich people who complain are the actual colonists who arrived in the country not the indigenous people of the land. 

I think my point is the majority of people still from colonist countries were the poor not involved in these things and the majority of current elites of colonies are the people who exploited the locals. Therefore when we look back to colonial times we shouldn't focus on people of a nation as if they are to blame in any way but the worldwide elite and the leaders of these nations.

To give some examples: Argentina and Brazil are run by majority white governments. USA the same. Even many Arab states the leadership devolves front those working with the European governments.

P.S. Though I will accept democracy was around, though limited, in colonial times and the benefits did trickle down so normal people weren't entirely innocent."

1,2023-10-01,"CMV: not everybody with mental illness would benefit most from professional help, and sometimes, mental illness can be beneficial to the person",u/TheKijijiKid,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16x9s4j/cmv_not_everybody_with_mental_illness_would/,changemyview,"This view of mine is largely based on personal experience - please respond to my view rather than how I choose to manage my own mental health. 

Nowadays, I find that when people go through mental health struggles, any help they try to get is usually to try to get them referred to a professional. This varies from symptom to symptom - I find, for example, that people struggling with symptoms of depression are more likely to get advice beyond ""see a professional,"" like ""go outside more,"" and ""change your diet,"" than someone going through psychosis, possibly because people are more familiar with the former and feel more confident giving personal advice on the topic. 

Nonetheless, I still find that people hold a near-religious trust for psychiatry, including the idea that everyone should get therapy, or that everyone with psychosis should take anti-psychotics, and so forth. I will disregard the harmful side effects of many medications for now, because that's not the crux of my argument, though it definitely is an important factor to consider in seeking professional help. I will also disregard my skepticism in the supposed benefits of forcefully reporting/institutionalizing suicidal people. My argument is more radical - I think that mental illness can actually be a good thing. 

I think that people are prioritizing surface-level happiness and wellbeing over the long-term satisfaction of having gone through the emotional ups and downs of life. Of course, this may be a largely-subjective perspective, but I refuse to believe I'm the only one who values my hardships as much as I do my joys. It is a common saying that the person who hasn't felt sadness doesn't know true happiness, because they have nothing to compare it to. Additionally, I do not think that one gets as much out of a hardship if they do not go through the whole process of getting through it and learning how to manage it. As such, I find peoples' obsession with instantly medicating peoples' problems away  counterproductive. Issues like going through a breakup or going through grief are widely-acknowledged to be necessary, and even beneficial parts of life - why are more individual issues, like mental illness, treated differently? 

I would understand their motivations better if it were the case that everybody with mental illness is a danger to themselves and others, but this is simply not the case, or, at least, not more the case than someone going through intense grief, for instance. And I've had an episode of psychosis where I seriously-considered suicide because my brain convinced me that it would break me out of a simulation, and even then, I wouldn't take that back if I could. Obviously, my view would be different had my paranoia been even worse and I had actually gone through with it, so if others knew what I was going through, I would put no blame on them for trying to end my psychotic episode, but on an individual level, I still think that such situations can have their benefits. Personally, it made me more aware of how dangerous it can be to listen to my own head when I'm in such a state, and I've gotten better at resisting my paranoia in my future episodes. I'm still not perfect, but I *am* improving with time using my own coping strategies, showing that I am learning, and not just learning how to deal with my brain during psychosis, but also out of it. Personally, I believe that my psychosis has played a large part in my creativity and critical thinking skills, as, in the moment of psychosis, they are necessary to try to counter some of my initial mental gymnastics. Even if delusion currently still inevitably drags me under, I am learning every time how to properly fight against my own head, and against my assumptions and fears in regular life.

So, I do not believe that everybody with mental illness would benefit most from professional help, and I think it can actually be a blessing. I do think there are cases severe enough that really do require outside intervention to save that person's life, but I think that these severe cases have been blown out of proportion and that personal coping strategies are under-advised. I hope this causes no offense, I know that mental illness can be devestating. Would be happy to change my view."

People on this platform call them “red flags” and sometimes “creepy behaviour” but these are just ways of defining actions over which not even a SINGLE COURT in the entire western world would even assign an hour of community work, let alone possibly years of depression and isolation. 

Ladies, you have a right to not be harmed, you have a right to not have actions perpetrated on you that are illegal. You have no right to ruin people’s lives because you felt “uncomfortable.” 

To be clear, I definitely support *your right* to not associate with anyone you do not want for any reason whatsoever.

I believe that all sex offenders against minors have no chance of rehabilitation, since they can never be trusted in society again, therefore, it's pointless to keep them in prison for a few years and then release them to do the same crime again. 

It would serve to deter all people who want to do harm to children, since it would mean they would die. It would also give a sense of justice for all the victims and the parents of the victims, knowing they won't hurt anyone, forever.

As to the non offending pedophiles, all people that are diagnosed with pedophilia, but haven't been convicted of any crimes, would be immediately commited to a secure facility, where they would be living for the remainder of their lives. They would be forced to work to pay for their incarceration, while they would have basic living conditions, but absolutely no freedom. This would reduce the risk of these pedophiles towards society, preventing them from harming children, but it would also help the pedophiles themselves, saving them from being executed in the near future.

1) 99% of abortions aren't in pregnancies resulting from rape. If the only reason you can disconnect yourself from the violinist is because you were kidnapped against your will, then the violinist analogy can't be used to justify abortions in cases resulting from consensual sex. If you chose to have sex, you chose to connect yourself to the violinist. To continue the analogy further, if you didn't choose to have sex, the baby never would have needed you in the first place. A better analogy to pregnancy is if you caused the the violinist to have a fatal kidney ailment, by poisoning him. 

2) Most all abortion laws, such as in Texas, don't ban women from self-performing abortions. What they do is ban doctors from performing abortions. This is important because doctors are a third party. Even if you assume you have the right to disconnect yourself from the violinist, the doctor has an obligation to do no harm and should not be able to disconnect you from the violinist. 

For those unfamiliar with it, here's the violinist analogy. 

You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. \[If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but\] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.\[4\]"

1,2023-10-01,"CMV: Regardless of your feelings about former president Trump, he cannot and should not be banned from appearing on state ballots in the 2024 election.",u/Chorby-Short,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xfbud/cmv_regardless_of_your_feelings_about_former/,changemyview,"There have been a number of efforts as of late to bar former president Trump from appearing on the ballot in the 2024 election, and these efforts are getting a frankly alarming amount of support. Regardless of your opinions of the man, he should not be disqualified from at least appearing on the ballot next year, especially the primary ballot.  
  
The people arguing that the 14th amendment can ban people from running for office are misguided. There is a massive difference between appearing on the ballot for an office, and actually being seated in that office, especially when it comes to the presidential race. First off, the amendment at the time could not possibly have been intended to disqualify people from the ballot, because government printed ballots didn't exist in the US until over 20 years later. Elections before the 1890's were conducted by letting each person turn in their own ballot featuring whichever candidates they wanted. Parties would each print their own respective ballots for voters to sign, if those voters supported that party's candidates, and otherwise they were welcome to make their own ballot. There was thus not a single ballot to qualify for— anyone could put you on their ballot if they so wished. The introduction of government printed ballots and ballot access laws were in some ways actually highly detrimental to democracy in general, but I digress— in any case, the 14th amendment, passed in the 1860's, could not possibly have given anyone the authority to ban a candidate from running for office.   
  
There are two further points that are relevant to the 2024 presidential election. First of all, primary elections don't elect anyone! Being as they simply determine who a party's nominee is for a given election, they themselves don't elect any office holders. If you think about it, a large amount of people who win primary elections don't go on to hold the office that the general election is for. Thus, people can potentially win primaries for offices they don't qualify to run for at the time of the primary, assuming they can meet the qualifications by the time of the general election. Roque de la Fuente, for instance, was a businessman who ran for US Senate in nine different states in 2018 at the same time. He lost top-two primaries in California and Washington, and Republican primaries in seven other states. Despite the fact that being a resident of the state you are elected from is an explicit qualification to be elected US Senator, that didn't matter for purposes of the primary— If he had managed to win any of the nine primaries, he could have moved to that state before the general election and been perfectly fine.  
  
What's more is that the presidential election that people vote on is technically an election for presidential electors, not for the presidency itself. If it did turn out Trump was unqualified to serve as president (I'm not saying whether he is qualified to serve here, by the way; simply to be on the ballot), it is possible for those electors to cast ballots for alternative candidates. Despite the fact that some states have laws against these so-called ""faithless electors"", if it looked clear, with a majority of winning electors being republicans, that the only way to get a republican president would be for those republican electors to vote for an alternative candidate proposed by the party, the republican-dominated supreme court would almost definitely withdraw their approval of faithless elector laws in order to secure a win for their party. It would be controversial, sure, but the court isn't exactly non-partisan. In any case, having an unqualified nominee for president wouldn't prevent their chosen electors from winning the election, because that doesn't really make sense— Trump's electors would certainly be qualified to be electors, considering there are virtually no restrictions on who electors are allowed to be.  
  
Then, there is the fact that the disability imposed by the fourteenth amendment is allowed to be removed by Congress at any time. Say through some political miracle that republicans win supermajorities in both houses in 2024, or at least secure the two-thirds threshold in both houses necessary to allow an insurrectionist to become president through some sort of compromise. Trump theoretically could be seated as president even if he engaged in insurrection, and that might not become clear until after the election. To bar him preemptively, when he might later become qualified, would be paradoxical. At the end of the day, it is formally Congress' job to determine if the votes cast by electors are for a qualified candidate.  
  
Finally, this says nothing about whether Trump should or shouldn't be president. I'm personally against the man, but I think that not only is there no authority to say he is barred from state ballots under the 14th, the backlash against such efforts (which are already in their beginning phases) are inevitably going to be ruinous. January 6th was bad, and I am a bit fearful of a reprisal, but barring Trump from the ballot would only make his supporters more radical, and calamity more imminent.

In the animal kingdom and in insect species, this is not uncommon and may even be a majority case for males. Competition in mate selection always leads to a percentage of the male population missing out. I don’t think that the incel phenomenon is one that can be fixed unless you live in a patriarchal society that essentially forces women into relationships in some way. As society gets more advanced and lives become relatively easier, it seems that the need for a woman to be with a man for survival has pretty much ended and as a result, the percentages of men getting a mate or romantic partner have gone down. 

Is this not a natural phenomenon in all animal species? And is there some other way it can be fixed that i am not seeing? It obviously sucks that there are men who feel lonely and unwanted , nobody should ever have to feel that way but what can really be done ?"
1,2023-10-01,CMV: Fries and noodles are the most disgusting foods ever and I don’t know why people enjoy them.,u/Individual-Signal167,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xh11s/cmv_fries_and_noodles_are_the_most_disgusting/,changemyview," I’m not talking about these two combined, I mean separately. There are only 2 hyper-specific exceptions to the rule.
	
**fries**
I have absolutely no idea why this food is so beloved and popularized. Sure, potatoes taste good. However the texture of fries is horrible. Best way I can describe it as rough, 80 grit sandpaper on your tongue for almost no flavor in return. Some types of fries are softer, but still gritty. And some are even gritty on the inside! It’s horrible. The physical discomfort of eating it is not worth what you get. I don’t understand how any people manage to get through eating large containers of fries. They are so rough, have a weird tang if you crunch them a certain way, and they hurt to eat if you get the extra gritty ones. I have tried nearly every type of fry I’ve been able to find from different places, yet they still always hurt. 

McDonald’s is rough, is too thin and flavorless with too much air in the fry, and has gritty bits in the middle. Chick-fil-A is softer but the shaping causes the fry to have that ‘odd feeling’ that occurs with some textures, better flavor atleast. Burger King is a mix between Chick-fil-A and Mac Donald’s etc. I could continue all my critiques. 

I’m not sure how other people have tolerance for such texture and discomfort and the people I’ve been around claim they don’t feel any ‘odd feeling’. I’m not sure how that happens, but let’s say you had tolerance anyways. Why would you willingly eat a starchy, carbohydrate-filled, unhealthy food if it doesn’t even have flavor or taste good! The only exception to this rule is zaxby’s fries. Soft, plenty of flavor, not gritty, good size.

**noodles**: the ***BANE*** of my existence is noodles. Noodles are very diverse, so I’ve gone out of my way to try many types if I could. However, noodles also have a texture issue! I will continue below due to the diversity of noodles.

Glass noodles are thin, too slimy, extra nauseating, and have a very weird texture that feels like a bunch of tiny, slimy cloth fibers wriggling throughout your mouth just *begging* for you to gag them up. I started aggressively gaging and coughing when I tried this.

Spaghetti is too large and lacks texture to the point that it is also nauseating! The noodles feel like slurping a bunch of straws doused in gross, watery, pasta water or gross, watery, tomato sauce with chunks and small herbs that are immediately uncomfortable to touch. My reaction included keeping the noodle in my mouth and crying while punching my nose.

Rotini feels to structured, solid, and the waves don’t feel correct in the mouth. The texture feels like liking a braided stone and immediately made me claw at my arms.

Again, I’ve tried more types of noodles. But there’s a basic understanding of them. The sliminess is a certain way that almost feels uncanny. Like you’re not supposed to consume something this slimy. The noodles are always too big, too small, too short, too textured, not textured enough, shape feels weird, doesn’t go well with anything else. You can never win. The exception is a particular brand of instant 3 minute boil ramen noodles. Perfect shape, texture is not too much not too little, and it tastes good with pretty much any soup."
1,2023-10-01,"CMV: Years of potential life lost is a better metric than total deaths, for example when measuring COVID-19",u/El_dorado_au,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xh2hr/cmv_years_of_potential_life_lost_is_a_better/,changemyview,"When evaluating a health issue for the purposes of public health, years of potential life lost is a better metric than total number of deaths. Nobody has lived forever, or even more than two hundred years to the best of our knowledge, so the only thing that happens is a life is shortened.

Some causes of death rank highly by total number of deaths but not by years of potential life lost, and vice versa. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics recently released a report on [causes of deaths in Australia in 2022](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/latest-release) In the section ""Leading causes of death, Australia - selected years - 2013, 2017, 2021, 2022"", the top five by number of deaths in 2022 were (translated to plain English) heart disease, dementia, COVID-19, strokes, and lung cancer, which ranked second, not in the top 20, 12th, 10th, and 3rd by years of potential life lost in the section ""Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) for leading causes"". By contrast, the top five health issues by years of potential life lost are (also translated into plain English) suicide, heart disease, lung cancer, traffic accidents, and accidental poisonings (drug overdoses). They ranked 15th, 1st, 5th, not in the top 20, and not in the top 20 by total lives lost. In summary, dementia and COVID-19 had lots of total deaths but few years of potential life lost, while suicide, land transport accidents and drug overdoses had lots of years of potential life lost, but had few total deaths.

When commenting on this report, people usually referred to total deaths and didn't mention much years of potential life lost. I haven't yet provided examples because I don't think anyone would dispute this, and I'd prefer not to highlight individuals doing so unless required.

Points I acknowledge:

This only acknowledges death as an impact of a health risk. Some risks also result in disability, and also suffering while dying. For example, some individuals refer to long Covid, even saying that they’d rather get infected with HIV/AIDS than covid, and also say that covid isn’t a nice way to die. However, this’d also be also true of measuring health risks by total deaths.

A corrupt government could try to massage the figures to downplay the impact of a particular health risk by modifying the years lost for a particular death, but at least in Australia’s context I’m not greatly worried about that happening.

[Quality adjusted years of life lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year) may be even better than years of potential life lost, but the ABS didn’t measure that.

Calculating deaths is easier than calculating years of life lost, and is a simpler concept. However, the ABS went to the effort of calculating both, so ease of calculation isn’t an issue.

We don’t have to use solely total deaths or years of life lost, we can use both, or even other metrics.

This approach doesn’t value all deaths equally. That is somewhat tautological - any approach that doesn’t solely use total deaths isn’t valuing all deaths equally.

This approach is purely numerical and utilitarian and is totally devoid of emotion. Yes, for example it doesn’t regard health as a human right, or address whether certain health risks should be given particular priority, such as those that are the result of racial inequalities, but the same is true of counting total deaths. The ABS did reporting by state, sex, and indigenous status, some of which is concerning.

The experience that Australia has had with covid, one of the health risks assessed, is different from that of some other countries, such as those in Europe and North America.

This view is only for the context of public health, as opposed to morality or the law - if someone was to go around killing individuals with only five minutes of life left for the fun of it, I'd still regard that as ghoulish behaviour.

You argue with someone for three or four comments, then they provide a terribly flimsy argument and block you so you can't respond. Or on Imgur, they mute you to the same effect. You shouldn't be allowed to do this. Disabling all notifications from that person and hiding all future comments and replies, sure. But not preventing them from replying at all.

As a forum where anyone can see what you've said, these arguments are often used later on by others looking into certain topics. Disabling replies can leave onlookers walking away with misinformation that could have been corrected, or without counterarguments that could have swayed their opinions. And for the people who start debates and then block people, it's just reinforcing their ability to shut down others instead of engaging with them. Also it's just annoying to the other person when they say something and then someone replies with a decades-old study that has been thoroughly debunked. Most casual readers won't even read the study, they'll just walk away from browsing that thread thinking that whatever thing that person was arguing is actually supported by science.

In real life, you can always walk away from someone, but you can't prevent them from continuing to speak. You can only choose not to hear what they say or choose not to engage with it. That is how blocking and muting should work on the Internet too. If you block someone, they should still be able to reply to you. The primary reason for the block feature is to prevent harassment, but hiding all future replies and disabling any notifications related to that user will work just as well. You don't have to see anything they say, they cannot contact you at all, problem solved."

Mentally - men at extremes are drivers behind innovation, plus the fact that when difficult problems arise, women are always driven by emotions first, logic second. Here’s a proof positive: there are no women who are good quantitative traders

Morally- women are the sum of their peers, they will change who they are, what they say and do at an instant, if it benefits them socially within their peer group. On a side note they will jump ship at signs of hardship(although to different degrees between women , this is largely what drives female mate selection in general). Although the avoidance of pain takes precedence over chasing pleasure among and females, another way to phrase the point I am making is that because this applies more so to females, they are inherently, more chaotic and less morally good."

And so on. All this under the guise of 'traditional African values', as if anyone could dare to hold a monopoly on Africanness.

I say all this as an African man lives on the continent and practices the aboriginal indigenous spiritual beliefs my ancestors - a lot of what I see sometimes leaves me hopeless for the continent,

The few countries which lean more progressive on the continent, attract economic and political refugees en-masse - plenty of bigots, misogynists and homophobes would not pass the opportunity to move to a progressive country in North America or Europe or Oceania, but continue to stab the majority of Africans in the back.

Also, this doesn't include flashing-light warnings. 

Argument: In the last few years, it's become quite common to be confronted with [increasingly specific] trigger warnings at the beginning of tv episodes/ movies, and if you don't benefit from them they only diminish the viewing experience. As such, you should be able to turn the warnings on and off like closed captions and descriptive audio for the blind. 

I watched the premier episode of a new TV show this afternoon, and it began with a trigger warning about suicide. Instead of having an authentic reaction to the program, I was essentially force-fed this major spoiler, and I spent the whole episode awaiting the suicide. When the character finally killed himself, it was clearly supposed to be dramatic and shocking -- but because I was expecting it, it carried zero weight. This happens all the time lately, and it sucks! 

If someone needs TWs, taking 20 seconds to turn them on doesn't seem like a tall order. But it really harms the viewing experience to be forced to consume substantive spoilers about the show you're about to watch, and an on/off switch seems like the obvious solution."

I am pro-choice and believe in equal rights (including marriage rights for LGBTQ people). That being said, I do think excessive sexual promiscuity is potentially harmful to society and should be restricted, as long as men are held equally accountable as women.

While I do believe in individual freedom, I also realized that protect others' freedom, individual freedom comes with reasonable limits. Your right to swing your fist ends where other people's face begins. An adult is free to drink, but not free to drink and drive. This is since drinking and driving puts other lives at risk. Similarly, excessive sexual promiscuity can harm others through the spread of STDs and the erosion of normal relationships. To anyone doubting me I encourage you to read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7ma5iy/comment/drsvi7u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by another Redditor. Another tragic example occurred in Botswana during the HIV epidemic where prostitutes spread HIV to miners, who then spread it to their wives. In cases like this where adultery caused demonstrable harm, I would not be opposed to bringing back old adultery laws and letting the victim press charges if they so desire.

The main problem with purity culture in my view is that men and women were historically held to different standards. I think as long as the same rules apply to all genders, it's not necessarily bad to have reasonable restrictions on promiscuity."

I originally posted the following in another subreddit but it closed before it could get any traction, then someone reposted it online where it got a little more attention. Another user suggested I post it here instead which I thought was a good idea.

So here is my reason:

A little bit about myself:

• I am a 23 year old female. Short/Petite frame. Fairly attractive. Femininity is average I guess.

• I'm attracted to masculine men.. (ex. Idris Elba, Michael Fassbender, Mark Wahlberg etc) just for reference..

• I live in the midwest ~

My story:

I have dated 3 men in my life and believe it or not, they each turned out to be gay.

This is getting not only tiresome for me, but it's also beginning to make me extremely angry, to the point where I am beginning to deeply resent gay men. And also fear all men in general for the simple fact that I think they are all secretly gay.

I search in google ""I am a girl. Why do I attract closeted gay men"" and 99% of the results are along the lines of: ""I am attracted to men. Should I leave my wife?"" Or ""sex with married men as a gay man"" or ""I've built a life with a woman but I'm gay""... What the fuck.

I am so angry because honestly, I see the chemistry between men. They understand each other in a way that women cannot (and the same goes for women yet for whatever reason, most women still hate each other...)

I used to watch a ton of gay porn (strictly research purposes) and saw all over amateur gay sex videos most of them were titled ""pegging or getting pegged by my not so straight friend"" or ""his girlfriend caught us"" and a lot of ""he fucks me while his gf is away"" .  And they were all homemade...

Men just respect each other on a whole other level. In all the gay movies and gay couples I meet in real life, the bonds they create are so strong and promising. And when a guy is gay, it's like there is absolutely no chance at him ever being attracted to a woman. Yet the same.. ""Stigma"" does not apply so much to a lesbian woman, who is much more likely to end up leaving the girl for a man.. It's like men really do have each other's backs. Their bonds are seemingly unbreakable and at this point I just think to myself..yeah, why would a man ever want a woman when a man could give him everything he needs sexually AND emotionally? Yikes...

And another thing: my ""gaydar"" is A-1 at this point. It's kinda always been. It's like every where I go I see gay men. I catch onto their body language and see how they change when they speak to other men. There's this strong connection between them like no other. It is TERRIBLY obvious to me when a man is gay. Whether he be top, bottom, switch, bear, IRON CLOSET etc...

At first I thought I was just insane/paranoid, but after busting the last guy I was with, my closest (first) cousin, a couple of my uncles, and even a guy one of my girlfriends was with, I realized no.. I'm not so insane after all. And to top it off, I reached out to one of my high school crushes last week after coming across his number in my phone. He had a big crush on me too back then but he was so shy for a variety of reasons. Well, come to find out that he is gay, and I had already braced myself for this because of my aforementioned experiences.

Needless to say that a vast majority of my other high school crushes are now gay. It's as if EVERY single guy I talk to ends up being gay. When I was searching for a community to post this in, nearly every other post I saw in each community was a gay confession, many which involved losing interest in a girlfriend. (ps if you don't believe me, I screenshotted a few)

All of the girls I know always come to me when they suspect a guy is gay because they say it's what I'm best at.. Wow. How's that for talent.

This is the shit that makes me think..were men EVER attracted to women at any given point in time? And how the hell could you date/marry someone you KNOW you don't like, then turn around and still do gay shit behind her back, hurting her in the process. I swear a lot of them just do it for the thrill of having a ""secret life""...  But some say it's because he is afraid of how society will react to him.. but at that point, he is no longer the victim because he deliberately dragged somebody else into his life and deceived them. And also, that doesn't apply anymore for the simple fact that the whole world is becoming significantly more liberal each day. You say anything against gays today and you get bashed by every soul in the vicinity...

I have no idea the meaning of why this is happening to me. I am so fucking confused and nonetheless scared. And pissed. I've never felt so undesirable in my life. I just feel like whatever man I choose will eventually come out as gay. It feels like a curse. And I am so terrified to date now because of this.

IMO even art of it should be banned, it also doesn't matter if its drawn you are still jerking off to it. Change my view"

1,2023-10-02,CMV: Derivative works made using AI are no different from derivative works made by people in the form of fanfiction/fanart,u/heibai-wuchang,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xpcs0/cmv_derivative_works_made_using_ai_are_no/,changemyview,"Is someone making money out of it? For fanworks, not usually, it's just posted for free in places like AO3. But there are people who take commissions for bespoke fanworks - you're not paying for the source material, you're paying for the talent of the guy who's making the fanwork for you. Similarly, you're paying for the talent of the developers who made the AI model who made the AI-generated fanwork.

Did the original artists consent to their works being used to create the fanwork? IIRC, there was a massive issue with Fanfiction.net hosting Harry Potter works because JKR did not want HP fanfiction to exist. I think, it could have been a different fandom. 

Will the original artists make money out of the money generated by the derivative works? No, in either case. Going back to HP: I'm not in that community, but I'm sure there's tons of ""character realizes they're trans"" HP fanfics. I'm sure she'd love to earn the money out of that. /s 

""Just draw/write what you the derivative work that you want to make."" Fun fact: Shit's fucking hard. It takes a lot of talent just to make good fanart or well-received fanfiction, and anyone who says otherwise clearly never tried doing either. Or their impression of fanfiction is just the majority of Sonic fanworks, My Immortal, or 50 Shades of Gray - in which case, they're also very uninformed. I distinctly remember a Star Wars prequel fanfic called Manifest Destiny that seems to have been deleted entirely from the internet and basically rewrote the prequels with one plot twist - it was about the length of a typical novel and it was much better than the actual Star Wars prequels (...not a high bar to begin with, but you get the idea).

Is it going to eventually replace works of art made by ""actual"" writers and artists? AI can make pretty pictures, but it can't make meaningful pictures, that's where the human touch comes in, it gives something context. A camera can make pretty pictures. Someone's 5000th selfie might look meaningless, but if it's the photo of someone who died the next day from a freak accident, it means something. Someone can write a 5000-word character study on an obscure character from a video game or something. It might be gibberish to most people, but it's meaningful to someone who has actually played the game.

""AI's output is garbage."" Humans can make garbage, too - regardless if it's derivative or original.

If anything, AI-generated derivative works just allows people to imagine things that the original creators won't create, or won't allow to exist. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to ask ChatGPT to write me the Sonic the Hedgehog/Star Trek: The Next Generation/My Little Pony crossover special, featuring a graphically explicit romance between Shadow and Data, where they battle Discord and Q (who bonded over how much they like the sound of each other's voices). No one's going to write it, and I'm not good enough to write it, so I'll use a tool to entertain myself and my niche interests."

as hurt as one's feelings may be (been there), feeling victimized and seeing another through the eyes of the guilt you've put on them, is simply the worst thing you could probably do- it usually goes a little something like this: 

""you caused me pain/ignored me/ghosted me/didn't answer my calls ect. so now, because you've caused me pain, i am going to villainize you to some degree, feel entitled to some kind of desperate apology, assume poor things about your character and heart in a bitter and frankly very ugly and unbecoming way; but the bottom line is that i'm going to feel especially entitled to you feeling incredible guilt in some way, because I am entitled to whatever hit you were supplying me with (whether that be validation, a listener, reassurance, ect)...and therefore use the fact that you ""ghosted"" me, to get more of aforementioned hit, and best of all, *your guilt*, because *you did something bad*, by way of exerting completely valid free will and not  communicating, therefore causing me to feel some sort of uncomfortable emotion...so you're *punished* ""

(^ not referring to ""narcissists"" here- this is just the way ive observed most people relate to these situations)

see what im getting at? we're all a lot more narcissist-like than we like to think, no matter how much you, subconsciously or consciously, see others as some kind of perpetrator

if any person causes you any kind of pain, *they are in pain* - and it's not their job (nor do they probably have the capacity) to give you some kind of hit, reassurance of their good character, or fill some kind of need like they're some kind of utilitarian object you need a refill of

you can all claim to ""love"" people until the cows come home, but if the moment someone gets quiet or disappears, you immediately get sour and start making assumptions denigrating, doubting their character, or the degree to which you believe they care about you, pray for you, ""love"" you,

that's not love at all- the coldness and betrayal you're feeling isn't coming from the person you falsely claim to love unconditionally. it's coming from your own complete lack of legitimate and dedicated loyalty to (and honest faith in) the goodness and wholesomeness you think that you identify with, and the other person, is the one suddenly or habitually damaging

you're looking in a mirror.
do some thinking-
i say this with love."

\- His popularity has fallen literally 10% since he was elected, into the low 40s, and he won 51.3% of the vote in 2020. I don't see him doing nearly as well in 2024, given only 41.3% like the way he's handling his job by now.

\- Trump is polling better against him than he did in 2020 when he lost every poll to Biden, and even Hillary in 2016 always stayed ahead faintly on average in comparison to Biden in 2024 where he loses sometimes while winning in other polls.

\- He's just an incompetent mess at the job itself, and his priorities are consistently those of white collar white professionals (especially wine moms in the suburbs) about barrier breaking, CHIPS, infrastructure, and such-- rather than what he was sold to the public and primary voters as this figure who could heal the polarization + bring the nation together.

\- He treats his core base (POC) and the base of the party with incredible disdain, neglect & contempt in comparison almost all the time, failing to pass voting rights legislation for the group that most put him in office (Black men + women), the border in general has become a bipartisan mishandled situation, as well as inflation still present. 

He won 306 EVs in 2020, but I see him winning 290 at most this time & I also seem him not winning 50% of the popular vote or more in a re-match vs Trump (but I do think he will win the popular vote against Trump)."
1,2023-10-02,CMV: If you are not gifted in school/booksmart and don't have strength needed for labor jobs you are basically screwed,u/lights6969,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xqu59/cmv_if_you_are_not_gifted_in_schoolbooksmart_and/,changemyview,"I'm essentially writing this for me pertaining to my situation but I am sure there are other people who have gone/are going through the same thing currently and don't have a solution as well.  
Since I was a kid, school was relatively easy going until about my sophomore year of highschool where I failed the state geometry math exam 4 times. The first couple of times I thought it was just a lack of studying and misunderstanding of the material but after the 3rd attempt while taking the exam I realized I was not able to retain and put forth the information I studied needed to pass. And as I continued high school and the work got a little bit harder each year I realized slowly that I wasn't on par with my classmates. Now I wouldn't call myself slow by any means, I was still passing almost all of my classes with high 70s/low 80s, but I could tell something wasn’t right and I wasn’t getting as good of grades as I wanted. I was literally just coasting by. Fast forward to college and now the work is getting even more difficult and I am clearly not handling well with it. I’m starting to receive D’s and F’s in my classes and my studying isn’t really studying because I am unable to retain anything I’m reading and each word I read is just words that don’t form coherent sentences and literally go from my eyeballs right out of my brain. This went on for about 2 years, and I tried switching majors about 3-4 times during that time span thinking it was my lack of interest in each major but I just could not store and pay attention to relevant school material in my head and got distracted by anything by me, and also start thinking about things that are irrelevant during my time studying. 

Fast forward again till now, I graduated college but with a near useless major because I just wanted to get it done with and I can’t find a job anywhere in my field after about 6 months of applying to jobs. So now I’m at a wall because I WANTED to study something more marketable like an engineering or comp sci degree but I was not physically able to. I also met with a neurologist during my time in college who suggested I might have a mild form of ADHD and prescribed me with adderall which did absolutely nothing for me except cause heart palpitations. Each time I went back he would prescribe a little higher dosage and imply about a sleep study to get to know my sleep patterns but I was assured that my sleep wasn’t the problem at hand. So after the 30mg dosage was prescribed and tried, I stopped going back. I know the type of person I am and I know I won’t last more than a pay period doing something along the lines of a trade such as construction, or electrician, etc. being that I hate getting dirty and being outside. So with that all being said, is a person in my place that experiences the same problems I do basically doomed with no hope in achieving a well paying career?

1,2023-10-02,CMV: The war outlook is bleak for Ukraine,u/invertedBoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xs1lc/cmv_the_war_outlook_is_bleak_for_ukraine/,changemyview,"I really hope someone more informed than me can cmv but I'm getting increasingly pessimistic about Ukraine chances winning the war, as customary in this sub I'll divide my argument in different points, although they are obviously interconnected.

1 - War front: I know next to 0 about war strategies, so I'll keep this brief. However it looks to me that this has become an attrition war, and (as many analysts predicted) the limited amount of modern tanks, etc that Ukraine received are not enough to dislodge the Russians.  
Russia may have issues building sophisticated ""smart"" weapons but won't run out of shells, mines, barb wire, soldiers, etc.. Is also safe to assume that Russia will not run out of cheap drones thanks of its allies.   
The limited drones and missile attacks inside Russian territory may be good for Ukraine morale but are not going to change much. The war is still solidly fought on Ukraine territory. 

&#x200B;

2 - Home front: despite all the news articles that predicted Russian economic meltdown, widespread revolts or even oligarchs hiring hitmen to take Putin down (!), is quite clear that Putin is riding the rough waves quite well. Russians have flocked to holiday resorts this summer, unemployment is low and general quality of life is still acceptable for most Russians, even the initial exodus of young males has died down quite quickly.  
""The largest package of sanctions ever deployed"" have failed in their objectives, either thanks to the help of China/India and other countries or thanks to the duplicity of western companies.     
Putin can even afford to increase military spending and (as mentioned above) his supply chain of tanks, ammunitions etc... will be able to sustain a ""20th century style"" war for a long time.  
Even that sort of coup form the Wagner group is yesterday's news. Putin looks pretty much in control imo.

3 - International allies: We've already seeing some worrying cracks in the west coalition resolve. With so many democracies involved, there's going to be a never ending stream of elections and the temptation of using Ukraine as an issue to get votes will be very temping as time progresses, especially if an economic downturn happens in the west. 

On the other side Russian allies will probably feel more and more emboldened as time progresses and I guess they even get more and more explicit in their support for Russia if they start to smell western blood (figuratively speaking), a struggling west is good news for them. 

To wrap it up this looks like a boxing fight between an underdog and a much bigger opponent, Ukraine and the west have given it their best shot and have managed to stop Russia but have also felt short of defeating them in the first few rounds. Now the war is about manpower, factories output and political will. And I don't think Russia will have any problems going to the distance.

My bet is that Putin knows he can afford to go on for quite some time and that eventually Ukraine will start loosing its allies or (more realistically) that Ukraine will be force by its own allies to accept a peace plan on Russian terms.

1,2023-10-02,CMV: I hate the modern Internet.,u/SinopeLycanthrope,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16xs4t8/cmv_i_hate_the_modern_internet/,changemyview,"I sorely miss the 90s and 2000s. I even miss the early 2010s. Anything is better than what we have today.  
  
In 2023, neutrality is non-existent, and freedom of speech is a fucking fairy tale. You must pick a side, and it must be the right side. If it isn't, you'll be banned from all social media, or be drowned out by the echo chamber of riskless, objective trash. Want to make a site where you can express your viewpoints freely? Better download TOR. Google won't support it, and neither will most server hosts and ISPs. Good fucking luck, chump.  
  
The internet is the most boring cyberpunk dystopia possible. It's now one giant click-farm, a glorified ad where the only views you can express are those of the elites and the only content you can make is dumbed-down clickbait dreck catered to idiotic brats addicted to their mother's iPad.  
  
You want to make original, interesting quality content on YouTube? Well, then you're gonna have to compete with cringy overacted Fortnite videos and creepy kids songs that garner millions of views and likes, hoping and praying that the algorithm will throw you a bone and you'll show up in some 9-year-old's recommended. The YouTube algorithm doesn't show you quality content that you're actually interested in anymore. Instead it shows you ""I SPENT 200 MILLENIA INSIDE A BLACK GUY'S ASSHOLE!!!! \*PRANK\* \*GONE WILD\* \*GONE SEXUAL\*"" because absolute raw sewage makes YouTube more money than actual content. So instead of seeing the topics you'll actually like, you see lazy creepypasta videos, Shane Dawson, Pewdiepie, Sidemen, and other absolute wastes of oxygen making videos like ""$1 HOOKER vs. $1,000,000 HOOKER!!! WHO SUCKS DICK THE BEST???!!!"" or ""CAN 200 WHITE GUYS FIND THE SECRET BLACK DUDE???"" or ""1,000 CHILDREN ON MY BILLION DOLLAR ISLAND!!! \*KISSING\* \*GONE SEXUAL\*"".  
  
Most of the content on the YouTube home page is idiotic at best and offensive at worst. I just use the site for music and I get recommended wild shit, like a room full of black guys trying to find the secret gang member.  
  
Other video-hosting sites have the exact same problems, and the content has much less quality. On YouTube you might find good vids, you just have to dig through all of the racist and offensive shit churned out for views. On other sites, the best content is mediocre in comparison to 2000s YT.  
  
You want to go vent on social media about how shit the internet is? Well, fuck you then. Nowadays, social media is more monitored than a maximum security prison. The Spanish Inquisition is constantly beating down people's doors because they posted something heretical. You can't say the wrong opinion, and you can't be more than the corporate hand lodged eternally in your anal cavity, forcing you to speak words that were never yours or else you can't use the Internet to be social anymore. Actually, you might get thrown in jail. People have been arrested for digital data concerning abortion, proving how Orwellian the net actually is. You are not a person on social media. You are an ad for the corporate POV and the fucked-up morality of the shitlords in government backed by big corporations. If you want to be a rebel, if you want to be the guy chanting ""Fuck Arasaka!"" outside the tower, then you will be drowned out by the NPCs in the echo chamber at best. At worst, you will be thrown in fucking prison.  
  
And it's not just social media. Entire sites have either been purged of everything that made them interesting or straight-up taken down because they refused to conform. Keep in mind that most of these sites relate to NSFW content, but they are symbolic of a greater concept. Porn is why the net was born, as the song goes. It is representative of freedom to express whatever the fuck you want, and it has been ripped away from us. They took away our porn, and in doing that, they took away our freedom and showed how Puritanical they really are. Tumblr isn't worth shit anymore, and neither is Pornhub or XVIDEOS. Most, if not all of the content on these sites got taken down years ago. These purges were just like the ones of the New Founding Fathers-only the rich benefitted. The rest were left to suffer in silence.  
  
Now the only porn you can watch is the corporate-approved sheer minority of the content on Pornhub and XVIDEOS that raked in the majority of the cash. All of the amateur, non-triple A porn that made up most of the content on porn sites got completely removed. These sites are min-maxing, just like YT. Minimum quality, maximum profit. I don't even like watching porn anymore. It's all cringy, overdone, and clearly fake. All of the models look the same, and most of them look like grotesque, barely human plastic surgery disasters. And most of the content on these sites are ads for official sites of big porn studios-these official sites always requiring memberships to view their content. Porn is now in bed, pun definitely intended, with Netflix. Netflix shows and modern internet porn are practically the same: overpriced disgraces so detached from the beautiful things they are trying to imitate that they seem more like grotesque parodies than the real thing. Modern porn is not the same as the stuff I watched as a kid. Similarly, Netflix Witcher is nothing like the books I read in middle school.  
  
And Tumblr really got the short end of the stick here. Most of the platform was porn, particularly communities based around kink and queerness. Tumblr was, in its entirety, content your corporate overlords wouldn't like, so it got completely purged. A site that was once a safe haven for queer folks, a site once worth billions of dollars, is now worth jack shit.  
  
Moving away from porn here, the modern net is now devoid of safe spaces for all kinds of communities, not just queer people. The reason that fringe groups like the alt-right, radical feminists, and antivaxxers are so vocal nowadays is because they have no safe spaces to voice those opinions freely, so they flock to mainstream sites hoping to carve out a place for themselves. 8chan got taken down years ago because big corporations didn't like it, and in doing that, they created a wave of virtual refugees that swarmed to popular sites like Twitter, causing more problems than 8chan ever did. And these are not people that will rethink their lives and change their misguided, racist, homophobic viewpoints because they got banned on Twitter. They'll just make another account and continue harassing people.  
  
We're not seeing the fringes becoming more vocal. We're just seeing more racists, because Pandora's box has been opened so some Wall Street cunt can buy a new yacht. Reddit's sitewide bans are an example of this problem. Taking down subreddits that can't make Reddit money and banning legions of people from the site entirely isn't fixing the problem, it's just making it worse for other sites. You can't fix racism. If we could, we would have already. You can't make a site-wide echo chamber like this. Some opinions won't make you money. Deal with it and give these people their own little bubble so they aren't causing problems on other subreddits or other platforms.  
  
The corporations' entire logic is flawed. The internet is not a farm for cash, and they are trudging on our rights and shooting themselves in the foot for thinking that. I am not an advertisement for the ""right"" thought. The internet was not made to be an echo chamber full of soulless dreck. It was made for people to be free. It was made to be an untamed frontier where anyone can voice their opinions. The plot of Red Dead 2 must have been based on the sterilization and fall of the internet in recent years. The corporations came in and removed our God-given right to freedom of speech for profit. They set up a virtual fascist regime where you are practically called a witch and burned at the stake for daring to speak the wrong thoughts.  
  
And nobody gives two shits."

I'm not talking about sanctions targeting the state (e.g. financial reserve, import of dual purpose tech and export of products bringing revenue to the state) or government members and affiliated enterprises. But the ones targeting the prople living in Russia simply based on the fact they live there (or even don’t live there but have  Russian nationality) and restricting their movement abroad, can ultimately have an opposite effect. 

You know that according to Russian laws it's a criminal offence not to support the war and not to serve in military. So, for the people to avoid that, moving abroad is often the only option. Restricting this (by not issuing visas, blocking their accounts or money transfers, suspending postal services and transportation, and recent ban to travel by car registered in Russia) will ultimately end up with more people stying in Russia, because they cannot leave. And then, they will contribute their labor and taxes to Russian economy, and might have to join the military and go to war in Urkaine.

P.S.: I know that the first thought coming to mind of someone living in Europe or US would be: ""Why don't they just protest and the government will listen to them?"" Well, as I heard, this also qualifies as ""not supporting the war"" and is a criminal offence with up to 10 years of jail sentence. And many prisoners were recruited to this war from jails.

P.P.S.: please do not turn this into discussion of the war or in any sort of nationalism, I know it’s a hot topic for everyone, but my post is only related to effect of certain sanctions."

If you were a genuinely loyal person you would know that you and other genuinely loyal people cannot be seduced into cheating because that's what being genuinely loyal means. In fact you would even think of thanking a homewrecker for exposing your spouses true nature as a non loyal person who is capable of being tempted into cheating. Truly loyal people understand this and so they don't have a hatred of homewreckers.

I honestly do not understand what people mean by capitalism in these cases. On a really high level, I think capitalism means private ownership of most assets and somewhat open competition between individuals in the market. Most democracies meet this definition, and the USSR and PRC did not. People seem to be using a very expansive definition of capitalism that seems clearly nonsensical when you compare it to the staunchly anti-capitalist countries of history.

E.g. ""The USA is trying to grow GDP at the cost of the environment, capitalism sucks!"" The USSR and Mao's China tried super hard to grow their GDP, they were just less successful than the more capitalist countries. They certainly didn't care about environmental consequences to economic growth; look at the complete disappearance of the Aral Sea. Overall it seems that every society wants to be rich, and nobody cares about the environment until a certain level of poverty is overcome.

E.g. ""The military industrial complex is driven by greedy capitalist shareholders who don't care about the wars they enable."" The USSR spent a higher fraction of its GDP on the military than the USA did. Both parties in the US are mostly supportive of funding Ukraine's war effort. Because it makes money for arms dealers? Is that why Russia is funding their side of the war? Obviously not.

You can CMV by defining an expansive capitalism that fits these common complaints, but also cannot be applied to these anti-capitalist countries."

How Stop-Start Systems Work

If you are not familiar with this system, simply put, when you come to a stop, like a red light, the engine shuts down, but essential other components continue to run, like the air conditioning system, power steering, brakes, sound system, etc.  When you take your foot off the brake to press the gas pedal the engine restarts and you go on your merry way.  In a vehicle with a manual transmission, the system operates from the clutch pedal instead of the brake. Why was this even invented?

I loathe Trump and his cronies.  He is a threat to civil liberties and yearns to violate the constitution.  January 6th was an outright attack on democratic values.  So a Republican victory will be horrible on many levels.

With that said, I don't buy that if Biden loses, the republican will become a king who never steps down until they die or that it will be the death of American democracy.  I find that to be a ""sky is falling"" attitude.  Trump already served one term and while so many bad things happened, he did not become the next Hitler.  

It just seems absurd for the third-largest country in the world to go completely belly up (or at least its democratic values) in this day and age.  America has endured so much, from a Civil War to presidential assainations to 9/11.  

Don't forget that the overwhelming majority of  Americans are not hateful fascists.  The midterms last year in the aftermath of Jan 6 and Roe being overturned are evidence of that.  Will it be an uphill battle?  For sure!  That doesn't mean America becomes an absolute monarchy."

I pretty frequently see how killing civilians in WW2 makes the Allies (specifically the US) “just as bad” as the Axis. While the ethics of specific attacks can be debated, the idea that strategic mass bombing was unnecessary screams “Modern Terminally Online Naïveté” to me. Though, I may be the stupid one. 

I believe that with the current level of media scrutiny and expectations of minimizing civilian casualties, the Allies would not have defeated the Axis. 

Part of what stems this belief is watching Ukraine fight Russia with different rules, though not to the extreme of WW2. 

For example: If the United States and China went to war, and China began striking civilian population centers, the U.S. would have no choice but to respond in kind. Or vice versa, and the US strikes civilian centers first.

I’d even go so far as to say that there are many types of wars that are no longer winnable with modern ethics. (A different discussion).

I know you guys are going to argue whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, because Redditors can’t stick to a single argument and instead have to debate a straw man. That said, I only care about the Allies v. Axis claim. 

BLUF: If one country is going full Total War, the other can no longer fight with modern ethics and win."

**Status quo:** AFAIK, High school math courses spend a considerable amount of time going over conic sections and their equations, with usually several months devoted to studying them in the third year of high school or so. This is on top of prior courses covering parabolas and circles in-depth. Meanwhile, statistics is only taught to a cursory level. Students learn about mean, median, and mode, plus basic probability and combinatorics.

**My problem:** To me this makes no sense. What's the point of spending so much time learning about ellipses and hyperbolas, and how to turn their equations into standard form and such? In STEM, they are useful to know about but very niche compared to statistics. Outside STEM, they're near-useless to understand on a mathematical level, whereas statistics is very helpful for everyday life and many (most?) non-STEM fields of study.

Instead of having 2-3 months focused on conic sections, revise the curriculum to spend that time on statistics and statistical reasoning. To me that seems like a much more useful skillset for the general population."

It's about reactions, or more like redditors reactions playing armchair psychologist and judges. As I'd never see anyone IRL shameless enough to say something like ""the husband is worse than the wife"" IRL without being seen as an alien and treated as a worthless trash by their peers.

\- So it happens, rarely but it does. From this point, it's better for it to happen to men who will stay in the children lives and be a dad.

Deep enough that they might go to great length like sacrificing, completely destroying their mental health in order to ensure the children well-being. 

It's a win for the children, which seems to be the highest priority by far for them to be able to write such comment. Be a good dad as it seems to be your priority. By their own standards them enduring this should be seen as ""good"" as it means the happiness of the children.

&#x200B;

\- The pure lack of empathy and going the extra length to write/say it leaves me with only disdain, a light but deep one so I have no qualm wishing them this situation. And why should I ? 

&#x200B;

\- Nothing stops them from being happy, nothing they couldn't think of before writting such things.

 They could lead a great life, keep being an amazing dad to the children and have a pool of happiness to swim in for the rest of their lives. I don't necessarily wish for their doom, although i'd be fine with it. It's a balance, if they are able to be as amazing as they were harsh to the ""husband-ghost"" then while empathy isn't their best point they are still amazing, so just congrats.

Homelessness has a negative connotation, but that's by design. It's necessary to call it what it is, otherwise it will be seen as a non-issue by those who would have otherwise done something about it. The only way to move people to take action is to convey the harshness of the situation that homeless people have to go through. The term houselessness is similarly just beating around the bush. It's not just that some people have no house, some people have no *home*; nowhere to go for safety, comfort and privacy, nowhere they can rely on for shelter. Homelessness is emotionally charged, but it has to be that way for anything to be done about it."
1,2023-10-02,"CMV: Conservatives decide which viewpoint to hold on an issue by first checking to see which stance liberals are holding, and then automatically opposing it.",u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16y3qhp/cmv_conservatives_decide_which_viewpoint_to_hold/,changemyview,"This sort of viewpoint is impossible to prove, given that there are no surveys or polling on the issue (and even if there were, there's no way to get people to respond honestly,) so it's simply my hunch, and I'm open to people changing my mind on it.

There are many issues in politics today - particularly Ukraine and Covid - on which it's pretty clear that the only, or main, reason that conservatives are opposing Thing XYZ is simply because they see liberals supporting Thing XYZ.

Let's use Covid first. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, many conservatives actually went along with the pandemic protocols, and America actually saw a brief dip in infections (this is around the March 2020 time.) That's because Covid hadn't become ""politically sorted out yet."" 

But as time went on, and mask-wearing and social distancing became seen as a ""liberal"" thing to do, conservatives thought, ""Okay, now that libs are doing it, we have to start opposing it, otherwise we wouldn't be conservatives"" and so they started opposing vaccines, masks, distancing - for no good reason other than that libs were doing it and they felt ""If Team Blue does it, then Team Red must oppose it."" There was no **inherent** reason why conservatives should assist a virus' spread and see America suffer heavy death tolls, other than that the libs were fighting against the virus. 

Same with Ukraine. Republican support for Ukraine was actually quite strong at first, around March 2022. But as time went on, and supporting Ukraine became seen as a ""Democratic"" thing to do, conservatives began opposing it. Bear in mind, again, that there's no **inherent** reason why conservatives should oppose helping Ukraine - not only was the cost of doing so extremely cheap, but historically, opposing Russia has been the Republican stance - just look at Ronald Reagan, the ""The-Soviet-Union-is-an-Evil-Empire"" president. So, again, with Ukraine, it was a case of conservatives watching liberals supporting Ukraine and thinking, ""Hmmm, if they support it, we must oppose it.""

I'd even go so far as to say that **if liberals had opposed Covid anti-virus measures and opposed helping Ukraine, that conservatives would then, reflexively, have supported those anti-virus measures and supported Ukraine - out of sheer opposition to Team Blue.**

So, that's the stance I am trying to get changed - that many (but not all) conservatives today, especially the Marjorie Taylor-Greene type, are not basing their stance off of any true principle or pillar of reason, but rather, simply because they automatically oppose whatever Team Blue supports - even if Team Blue is supporting something that's **good**.

In some ways, Liberalism is a victim of its own success when viewed through the lens of any liberal individual's lifetime. At some point, all your definitions of right and wrong will be upturned and I think this is how older conservatives are created; not through some deep-seeded desire as a child to champion the ""old ways"", but getting too comfortable with existing ideas.

Sometimes when a discussion online treads into the topic of race, someone says something about the Egyptians being not white for example, folks will simultaneously claim “Race is a social construct” whilst at the same time claiming the ancient Egyptians were white Europeans. Or getting upset at anyone saying they were black because they were in Africa, ignoring things such as the Arab conquests. Same with ancient Jews, before Europeans were even made aware of Judaism or before any of them converted.

You never hear similar things about the ancient Chinese. Oddly enough. Everyone agrees they were Asian.

When the same thing happens in respect to Ancient Romans or Greeks, I can understand why. First they’re “White” because they’re in Europe, the irony being lost of course. But I’m hearing that Ancient Greek people were genetically much closer to Persians (An obviously not white ethnic group) than any European ethnic group. In addition, Romans were heavily influenced by Greeks and emulated them.

Because of this, I feel like they are considered “White” nowadays because during their history, particularly the Romans, they basically colonized and terrorized much of Western Europe for centuries. So much that they inflicted a sort of cultural Stockholm syndrome on them. When Rome fell, rather than ceelebrating, they fought eachother of who was the “true” Roman Empire. Emulated them. Overtime identifying with them.

Italy and Greece today are allied with NATO and the collective west against nations like China, India, and countries in Middle East and Africa. Europe’s colonial conquests. I’d say this further pushes the “White” label on them.

I say this applies to Mediterranean societies in general. As well as the Bible, Christianity and such. I do not know how Europe became acquainted with Christianity and Judaism, but I’d assume like the Romans, they began to identify with it and rile themselves up on it. Eventually believing the folks of those days to be white like them. Falsely believing the middle East to be their “Ancestral Homeland”, then we get the crusades and now white majority in Israel terrorizing natives in Palestine.

I fully believe that they should.

- The current borders were drawn mostly arbitrarily by colonial authorities a century ago
- These borders dont respect cultural or geographic divides at all (-> drawn with a ruler)
- Therefore I wouldn't classify them as national borders, more like artificial administrative boundaries that could and should be changed
- There have been countless civil wars that I believe could have been avoided if the respective ethnicities had a single country

A good example of this is Somaliland. Long story short, the Somali government failed and Somaliland created their own mostly stable government. However, because of aforementioned colonial history Somalia still claims the entire territory.

&nbsp;

To go even further, when reading about Somalia, I read this paragraph: *""Anthropologist Spencer MacCallum has identified the rule of law during the period as that of the Xeer, a customary law indigenous to Somalia. The law permits practices such as safe travel, trade, and marriage, which survives ""to a significant degree"" throughout Somalia, particularly in rural Somalia where it is ""virtually unaffected"".*

So basically, Somalia reverted to a sort of tribal government. Why do they need to build a government consisting of a national parliament, prime minister, lower and supreme courts etc. with international support, if what *actually* governs the land is the traditional, (pre-colonial?) tribal form of government?

Tl;dr: I feel the current borders and states are arbitrary administrative divisions and don't reflect at all how Africas borders would look like if they represented actual nations and should therefore be changed. CMV"

I hear politicians, and many others with the view saying, ""We have our own problems right now, we should be spending money on X not Ukraine"". Is it just me or are they misrepresenting the actual facts about what the aid is and what it costs the government? 

The US isn't spending any money in this situation, they are only giving up the opportunity to sell it, and the cost of shipping. By shipping these weapons away isn't the government actually saving money on the upkeep required on vehicles? In a weird way this can even be seen as advertisement, which is proven by how US arms sales to NATO members have dramatically risen since the war began. 

Politicians keep repeating that it's costing too much money but what are we really losing if the majority of those weapons were sitting in storage for x years just waiting to be sold or a major conflict to kick off. The defense budget is still through the roof, it's even gone down since 2018. 

I just feel like this aid is being really misrepresented by media and the politicians. Of course, when you present something that COSTS 100 billion dollars people are going to start getting upset. But saying it costs that much is disingenuous of what is actually happening. Ukraine is being credited with money to acquire equipment, the older equipment which has been sitting idle for years is being sent to Ukraine. Sending weapons to Ukraine helps reduce the escalation of risk of the US entering into a conflict and thus needing said equipment at a later date? 

So logically, there is little to no downside of sending aid to Ukraine. The US saves money on upkeep, they lower the threat that Russia poses to other NATO members, and it's not as if the government is running super low on equipment because sales are booming to other countries. "

Individuals who hold the belief that a world without solutions is not acceptable may find themselves disillusioned by the lack of offerings of the left. Similarly, the right does not provide viable solutions, although it is inclined to fabricate false remedies that instill hope. While the left may easily disprove these proposed solutions, it often fails to provide alternative avenues, resulting in a sense of despair. 

For example, there is presently no established legal framework to enable individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to accumulate sufficient wealth to secure financial independence. The right suggests curbing immigration to create job opportunities for Americans, but this solution is not feasible. However, the only alternative is enduring an arduous existence of living paycheck to paycheck for a staggering sixty-two years. 

Choosing not to address this issue isn't doing the left any favors. It's now to the point where right-wing charlatans are now waging war on democracy itself. They never would've been able to gain as much power as they have if not for the willingness to lie. 

Although the left may lack immediate solutions, there exists a cohort of opportunists ready to exploit this vulnerability. In order to inspire hope, the left must also be willing to present alternate narratives, even if they deviate from the truth.

I in no way mean to imply that VAR is a catchall solution for officiating, bad calls still happen and I don’t mean to contest that point, I just feel they happen less often under the eye of VAR. I feel as if I’m missing something in my analysis that makes other fans of football/soccer vitriolic towards it.

He founded an online market called the “Silk Road”, and with that, he removed many of the negatives associated with street dealing. In real life, a dealer can just mug you and take ur money. But on the Silk Road, there was a bitcoin “escrow” system, which made such scamming hard to pull off. Also, in real life, you have no clue if a dealer sells quality product. But on the Silk Road, each dealer had a rating and reviews tied to their account. You could scroll through 100s of people’s comments and see if the dealer sells weak shit or cuts drugs with something else entirely. Furthermore, the darknet market removed much of the violence associated with black market trade. Because everything was so anonymous, killing competitors was near impossible. The only way to deal with competition was the way it would be dealt with in any legal market; provide the best service, prices, etc.

All of the aforementioned problems in the drug trade are only present because drugs are illegal. That’s what happens when you make a drug illegal. People get scammed, low-quality products get sold, and violence proliferates. Ulbricht solved all of these problems on his own, even without corrupt governments repealing their tyrannical drug laws. And in return, he got two life sentences. Absolutely insane. Free Ross Ulbricht."

Many things called ableism are quite bad, but I believe ableism is ill defined in ways that make it so sometimes just saying something like ""It's better to have two arms than one"" will be considered ableism, and be placed in the same category as saying ""people with birth defects are cursed for their past lives and should be killed"". 

The social model of disability is definitely helpful in many situations, but there are definitely certain disabilities that are pretty hard to fit in that. Say brain damage that makes it impossible for you to comprehend language, I think the medical model works substantially better for that.

I believe because there are certain abilities that one can make such a good claim that they are just objectively good to have, and the ill definedness of whether that fits in makes ableism not a useful concept

I consider it by contrast to be such that racism and sexism and many other prejudices are more well defined.

I am not saying that behaviors categorized as ableism are good or acceptable, just that the term as it is used now is vague and can be applied to almost every belief system without negatively reflecting on the belief system. The term must be either narrowed down in its usage or replaced altogether."

For example, I posted a comic strip that was *maybe* worth a smirk or a smile, and a vastly more talented artist wrote a comment that said: ""I nearly fell out of my chair laughing!"" Later on, I did a comparison of my art from eight weeks prior and the present day, and a vastly better artist said, ""Your art has grown by leaps and bounds!"" and ""You're doing great!""

But here's the problem: *Some have admitted they were lying to me.* Some of these people told me they were patronizing and flattering me because they wanted to respect my effort—even though I made it clear that if people left a comment, it would be great to receive constructive criticism. 

When people pay me a compliment, I want to believe them. After all, if someone gives a sincere compliment, it's a gift. And obviously, just because I've been patronized before doesn't mean the next person will patronize me. But after years of being ignored by 99% of superior folk and being patronized by a sizeable chunk of the 1%, it makes me very uneasy about taking others at their word—not just online, but at work, in my social circles, even in my family and friends. If someone is more talented, intelligent, or accomplished than I, I don't want to share my talents or knowledge or achievements with them for fear that I'll be lied to again.

To start with this post is only really to show my opinion that the true definition is flawed. Other definitions such as freedom of speech only gives you freedom from legal consequence have many practical restrictions so are not true freedom.


I think that the definition itself is contradictory in application. The example I will give is with a (ridiculous) statement like ""in my opinion all immigrants should be deported"".


This statement would be covered under free speech. However I know that if I said such a thing people would then use their freedom of speech and rightly criticise me. This brings me on to the contradiction.


I would argue that ANY potential criticism to my statement violates the definition of free speech as it would be a form of ""restraint"". Restraint meaning ""a measure or condition that keeps someone or something under control"". 


The fear of criticism is what stops many people from saying things they may have said otherwise. Therefore, criticism is a means of keeping someone under control and so violates the principle of being able to say something without restraint.


Freedom of speech allows me to say my opinion -> free speech allows others to criticise my opinion -> fear of criticism acts as a restraint -> my speech is restrained and so is not true free speech


Therefore freedom of speech is fundamentelly flawed as the definition contradicts the application of the definition."

The fact that they are alone is actually a great thing for society at large, because up until they change their mindset and stop feeling sorry for themselves, any woman spending any romantic moment with them will be robbed of joy at best and abused at worst. 


To be nice is to be polite, pleasant, and agreeable. Being nice is neat, don’t get me wrong….But it’s not enough to make anyone likeable. It should absolutely not be your best attribute. And why should it be? Anyone can be nice. Hell, most serial killers are nice. But to be kind? To be altruistic? Now those are great traits. You’re no longer simply nice, you’re now legitimately good. 

But even still, you need to be interesting. You need to be *fun*. To have passions, to be well-versed in any topic of interest, to be relatively smart, to be able to listen and take interest in others, to be curious, adventurous, and bold, and finally, you need to be a bit funny. To be a silly goose sometimes, to do and say whacky things.

For the most part extra lanes are unnecessary. Most roads should have only one lane in either direction for consumer vehicles, with important routes perhaps having extra for trucks transporting goods. All other lanes should be retrofit for pubic transit and emergency vehicles or dug up and made into pedestrian areas. The benefits of this include better access to public transit and emergency services, and less car exhaust causing green house gases and contributing to asthma and heart problems. You could even plant trees in the pedestrian areas to make things even better.

Potential arguments against:

> This would increase traffic way to much.

Perhaps initially, but in the long term there is no evidence of that. In fact, there has been research finding that when more lanes are added, it does _not_ reduce traffic.

It is a long term goal. It would be cheaper than you might think though, because billions are spent each year on road maintenance which would no longer be necessary. And many roads already have public transit on them which would only need to be expanded."

It's this bit about ""the experts have said the world will end in 10 years"" that I find highly suspicious, and it is my view that this information likely came from a NON-expert, in a casual context, without citation of actual evidence and research. I think the average conservative just heard one of their friends, someone who isn't a scientist and doesn't have a good grasp of the data or even really know how to explain the science behind climate change, say something like ""dude we gotta stop driving cars or the world will be over in 10 years"" and they just took that and ran with it.

Basically I attribute this to shoddy and irresponsible research on the part of conservatives. Did you verify that these claims came from *actual scientists*? Did these claims come from respected institutions or at least a person with decent credentials, something better than a bachelor's degree and hopefully employed with the likes of NASA or NOAA? Because I doubt it.

When conservatives say they heard these claims, I just straight-up do not believe that they came from a credible source. I've followed what respected scientists and respected institutions have said about climate change, and never have they said anything along the lines of the strawmen that conservatives regularly state, things like ""the world will LITERALLY END in X years"" or putting world-ending timelines on a scale of something like 10-20 years.

Keep in mind, respected scientists HAVE said things along the lines of ""in 10-20 years, we could reach a *point of no return*"", which is NOT the same as saying ""the world is, at this point in time, literally over and done with"", but it IS saying that we've reached a point where it will no longer be possible to save ourselves. We can reach a ""point of no return"" in a timeline of 10-20 years and still have another 100-200 years until the consequences of that become so severe that people start to die simply because of how inhospitable the planet is, but clearly that's saying something very different, right?

Conservatives, convince me that you've ever actually been told this doom-and-gloom from a RESPECTED source and I'll take this seriously. But it is currently my view that anyone parroting this line of ""oh but they've told us the WORLD WILL END IN 10-20 YEARS"" is just parroting bullshit that was never said by an expert and is ultimately just a strawman you've conjured up to excuse yourselves from having to take climate change seriously.

I am not a theologian, I'm not a philosopher, not a linguist or an active feminist (unless atm, perhaps). Also, I'm not a Christian, per say, but I do  consider myself spiritual.

That said, is it not not silly to assume the hierarchy of a God came from the idea of the superiority of men over women? How do we do this day use a language that puts one over the other (well, in all honesty, it does make sense to me but I'm of a newer generation so I feel that helps with perspective)? That's pretty much the entirety of the question. 

Another fair thought would be ""Why not?"". Why couldn't a God be a He. I feel like that would propose the idea that sexism in this fashion isn't actually ill-will but simply a rule of nature.

Perhaps it doesn't seem like a thing of influence on our psyche, but honestly (having been raised Christian-ly) I think it, along with other factors, does facilitate a subconscious thinking of natural inferiority in women. 

So my question still is:
Is it sexist to refer to the Christian God (you may expand into any religion though. answer freely) as He?

And if not:
What would that mean? 

Have a jolly day.

Just because you take control of a government building, it doesn't mean that the power now belongs to you. If you go to King's Landing and capture the room with the Iron Throne, you don't become a new king. Power is an abstract concept, and taking control of a building and vandalizing it is not how you seize power.

If you seriously call jan6 a coup, then you need to call [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Occupied_Protest) the second American Civil War.

""In July, a 23-year-old Honduran woman told the authorities that she was sexually assaulted in a bedroom closet by a smuggler who had helped her and her sister cross into the South Texas city of Mission. The following month, a sheriff’s deputy in San Antonio was charged with sexually assaulting the 4-year-old daughter of an undocumented Guatemalan woman and threatening to have her deported if she reported the abuse. In 2017, a guide leading a group of migrants through the Tohono O’odham Nation’s reservation in Arizona raped a woman from El Salvador twice during a seven-day desert hike, threatening to leave her stranded if she resisted. “I hope I leave you pregnant so you have one of my kids,” he said, the woman told the authorities.  
In 2016, a migrant woman fled a stash house in the South Texas city of Edinburg, where she said she had been raped by a smuggler who brandished a machete....

...Experts say the actual number of sexual assaults is almost certainly much higher than those documented by prosecutors and the police, because most attacks are never reported. And such attacks don’t end at the border. Women have reported being assaulted in immigration detention facilities, and the federal government over a recent four-year period has received more than 4,500 complaints about the sexual abuse of immigrant children at government-funded detention facilities.""

by DHS

""The OIG received at least 1,016 reports of sexual abuse filed by people in detention between May 2014 and July 2016, meaning that the OIG received on average more than one complaint of sexual abuse from people in detention per day during this time period. We found that the OIG investigated only 24 of those complaints, or 2.4% of the total.""

""The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States climbed to a high of 130,000 last year — three times what it was five years earlier — and this summer is expected to bring another wave.  
These are not children who have stolen into the country undetected. The federal government knows they are in the United States, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring sponsors will support them and protect them from trafficking or exploitation....  
...While H.H.S. checks on all minors by calling them a month after they begin living with their sponsors, data obtained by The Times showed that over the last two years, the agency could not reach more than 85,000 children.

1,2023-10-03,CMV: I do not think current executives (or any employees) of oil companies are bad people,u/Eli-Had-A-Book-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16yuqyk/cmv_i_do_not_think_current_executives_or_any/,changemyview,"So what do I mean by bad people? That’s the kicker since not everyone’s moral compass points in the same direction.

Regardless of where you stand on climate change, for the sake of this debate, let’s say it is happening. And let’s say every employee is aware that their product they help put out (directly or indirectly) is causing climate change.

I still do not think they are morally wrong for doing so. I do not think they have “dirt” on their hands. I do not think they are responsible for destroying the earth. I do not think they need to pay up for damage done.

I say that because I think most (if not everyone) is not responsible for this situation we are in. The situation I am referring to is that the world *NEEDS* fossil fuels to operate.  It is a *NECESSITY*. If we all woke up one day and there was no coal or oil for us to burn, billions of people would absolutely hate the situation they found themselves in.

Before horrible weather and following consequences would destroy the earth, j think civil unrest and strife would get more people more sooner. 

We are just in a situation where we need something something now that could kill us later. However, the absence of it now would also be detrimental.


The individuals who work for these companies now are not the ones who put the world economy in this situation. They did  it create the adverting strategies, they did not create the bribing (lobbying) systems or anything else that helped solidify our dependence on oil. 


Finally… the companies aim is to make a profit. And that is not a bad thing. Everyone here needs the company they work for to make a profit to continue to make a living right? If you are self employed or an owner, you need to make a profit yourself right? When someone puts on their boots, loafers, hard hat, heels, skirt, suit or what ever to go to work at an oil company, they are just in the rat race with the rest of us."
1,2023-10-03,"CMV: To eliminate racism, all we have to do is raise the marriage rate between white guys and black women.",u/tolkienfan2759,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16yv935/cmv_to_eliminate_racism_all_we_have_to_do_is/,changemyview,"If we raise it as high as it will go and keep it there, the two will become one people.  End of issue.

Now, I've given others this idea and had some interesting responses, and I'd like to share some of those as well so you'll have some idea what others have objected to in it.  Maybe you can build on those in a way that seriously challenges the idea.

But first, I'm aware that any 8-year-old could think this up, and for all we know many have.  For that matter, any college freshman could think of it, and again no doubt many have.  The hard part isn't knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get it done.  How can we raise that marriage rate without violating some fundamental precept of our society?  How do we do it without forcing anyone to do anything?  This is vital.  If you can't do that, you can't do it period.  Well, I think it can be done, and very easily; but that's not the CMV.  I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.  If it can be done, it will end the issue (basically:  I recognize that racism in other societies will still have some impact on ours).  I'm explicitly limiting application to the US only.

The first serious objection I've seen is that black people are racist within their own community, to themselves.  This is a view I've shared enthusiastically and with very good reason.  And obviously, if it's still true after eliminating that marriage barrier, there's no point.  We have achieved nothing.

My answer to the first objection is this.  The source and origin of racism is, in fact, that marriage barrier.  I can't prove it but to me, the idea hangs together so well with everything I think we know about racism that I believe it strongly.  If we eliminate that marriage barrier - and that's the CMV - THAT will eliminate racism.  What appears now to be racism is (in my view) words and behavior that implicitly evokes or references that marriage barrier.  If the marriage barrier goes away the social insult - the insult, not of a person by a person, but of a people by a people - will no longer exist, and thus it will no longer be possible to evoke or reference it, even implicitly.  The social insult will lose all its force, and the difference between a white guy using the n-word and a black guy calling the white guy a cracker will disappear completely and permanently.  And so to eliminate racism it's not actually necessary that we become one people, only that we start down the path of becoming one people - by eliminating that marriage barrier.

The second serious objection is in the work of sociologists, who have in fact looked at this issue at least a little bit, and found no evidence that rising interracial marriage rates have had no effect on reducing racism.  If true, of course my CMV goes right in the trash.  A sample work is ""Mixing races, maintaining racism?"" by J.L. Bratter and M.E. Campbell, in the Journal of Family Theory & Review from earlier this year.  I was sent a link to a de-paywalled copy but the link no longer gives access to it.  (I may have mischaracterized the article's point; I couldn't check my work since I no longer have access.)

My answer to the second objection is this.  I didn't read the whole article, but the first few pages made it clear that, as did every other sociologist whose work on racism I've seen that required the identification of what race their study subjects belonged to, it relied on self-identification of race.  I claim - and this definitely goes to the CMV - that this is a fundamental error in all or almost all that sociologists have written on the topic.  Their supposed ""mountains of evidence"" that point to whatever propositions they happen to support are all built on the sand of that untested assumption.  They're taking what people claim to think they think as though it were gospel.  And it's not.

Now, they're perfectly clear that they're making this assumption - but what sociologist has ever tried to verify it by examining behavior, in the area of race?  Any psychologist worth her salt will know that what people claim to think they think is frequently if not usually fantasy (assuming you agree that behavior is generally a better guide to motive than words), and will be able to give references to study after study demonstrating that principle.  (I am not such a psychologist, so I can't do it myself, but I'm sure it's true.)  And so this error taints everything that sociologists have done in the area, and makes all their conclusions worthless.  Because they don't know what race is really.  It's not what we claim to think we think.  It's how we behave.

In addition, I'm not claiming that rising rates of interracial marriage are going to cure racism.  I'm claiming that if we raise that marriage rate as high as it will go and keep it there, that will eliminate racism.  And obviously I'm not saying ONLY as high as it will go will work either, and even slightly less is worthless.  But let me be clear.  Racism is a group problem.  It's not something individuals do; it's something our society does, as a people.  I would expect to have to make a very serious dent in that marriage rate discrepancy (it is currently at two orders of magnitude) before any change in the level of racism in our society could be detected.

The third objection I've seen is, black and white aren't the only races in America.  If we fix black white racism, other racisms will persist.

I'd like to see some behavior-based evidence for this.  I don't believe it's true.  I think Asian Americans, Arab Americans, white Hispanics and god knows how many other so called ""races"" all observe the same marriage barrier that ""whites"" observe vis a vis blacks - and therefore those ""races"" are actually white.

I'm sure he goes to an ultra-Orthodox school, surrounded by children from the same community, but how can he be prepared for life outside the community? Is it not the responsibility of the state to ensure the welfare of all children?

2) In the absence of bike lanes, you have two choices. Let them on the road or walkway

3) There are risks on both side, there's no way around that. But it's god damn WAY less dangerous for a bike to crash into a person than for a bike to crash into a 2 ton metal tank. 

4) It is WAY easier for bikes to dodge a person than for a car to dodge a bike. Bike has way more agility. 

5) It is often a HUGE traffic inducing factor with bikes. It blows my mind that it is ok for a bike to be travelling at 5 mph and block 50 cars from moving (assuming cars cant overtake them - only one lane/other lane busy etc)

6) It is way more safe for bikes to signal danger (via bell) to pedestrians, than to cars. People in cars can't hear shit.

I spended much time on some russian gaming forums and I'm still have some PTSD.

First of, they have a very narrow gaming worldview. Most of gamers in post-soviet countries are either prefer to play competive online games (like Dota 2, you know), or late 90s and early 2000s PC games. Let's say, Heroes of Might and Magic III here is some sort of Starcraft for South Koreans. Okay, I don't have nothing against such games, but these guys are worshipping them like sacred cows. I remember how I tried to say how Gothic was overrated and outdated, and they started to roast me. They believe that Gothic is one of the best videogames ever created, and they don't give a fuck about bad controls, badly made battle system, archery and so on. These guys will say that you are a heretic (yes, gamers in post-spviet countries are big Warhammer 40k fans). They hate people who enjoy old Nintendo games (like Ocarina of Time or Super Metroid) because they are NOT REAL GAMES for them. They believe that the true ""oldfag"" should play only PC classics like Warcraft 3, Baldur's Gate 1 and Fallout 2. In other words, they are playing only those games they played during childhood/teenagehood, not the old games they mever played like Chrono Trigger or Earthbound. Damn, they are not playing early Might and Magic installations! 

As you can see, most of gamers in post-soviet gaming community are millenials who hate all new games... except for some hyped indies. Zoomers prefer to play only popular indie games, mobile games (like Brawl Stars) and Genshin Impact. And of course, some sandboxes like Minecraft and Garry's mod. Japanese games are not popular here and, sometimes, hated. Except, of course, westernized japanese games like Dark Souls and Resident Evil. The irony is that zoomers in post-soviet countries prefer watching anime over gaming overall. It's very easy to find videos on YouTube where a russian weeb analyzing anime's hidden meaning and symbolism.

Of course, you all heard about toxic russian Dota 2 and CS:GO players. Same behaviour are doing ukrainian players. Like for example, EvilArthas, an ukrainian streamer who is well know on russian internet as a toxic weirdo. Some sort of Tyler1. In my country, Uzbekistan, the situation is more sadder. Most people here, I guess, are playing mostly only one game – PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. In my country PUBG is very popular.

1,2023-10-03,CMV: Abortion should be legally permissible solely because of bodily autonomy,u/PM_ME_WARIO_PICS,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16yy4c1/cmv_abortion_should_be_legally_permissible_solely/,changemyview,"For as long as I've known about abortion, I have always identified as pro-choice. This has been a position I have looked within myself a lot on to determine why I feel this way and what I fundamentally believe that makes me stick to this position. I find myself a little wishy-washy on a lot of issues, but this is not one of them. Recent events in my personal life have made me want to look deeper and talk to people who don't have the same view,.

As it stands, the most succinct way I can explain my stance on abortion is as follows:

* My stance has a lot less to do with how I personally feel about abortion and more to do about how abortion laws should be legislated. I believe that people have every right to feel as though abortion is morally wrong within the confines of their personal morals and religion. I consider myself pro-choice because I don't think I could ever vote in favor of restrictive abortion laws regardless of what my personal views on abortion ever end up as.
* I take issue with legislating restrictive abortion laws - ones that restrict abortion on most or all cases - ultimately because they directly endanger those that can be pregnant, including those that want to be pregnant. Abortions laws are enacted by legislators, not doctors or medical professionals that are aware of the nuances of pregnancy and childbirth. Even if human life does begin at conception, even if PERSONHOOD begins at conception, what ultimately determines that its life needs to be protected directly at the expense of someone's health and well being (and tbh, your own life is on the line too when you go through pregnancy). This is more of an assumption on my part to be honest, but I feel like women who need abortions for life-or-death are delayed or denied care due to the legal hurdles of their state enacting restrictive abortion laws, even if their legislations provides clauses for it.   
When I challenged myself on this personally I thought of the draft: if I believe governments should not legislate the protection of human life at the expense of someone else's bodily autonomy, then I should agree that the draft shouldn't be in place either (even if it's not active), but I'm not aware of other laws or legal proceedings that can be compared to abortion other than maybe the draft.  
Various groups across human history have fought for their personhood and their human rights to be acknowledged. Most would agree that children are one of the most vulnerable groups in society that need to be protected, and if you believe that life begins at conception, it only makes sense that you would fight for the rights of the unborn in the same way you would for any other baby or child. I just can't bring myself to fully agree in advocating solely for the rights of the unborn when I also care about the bodily rights of those who are forced to go through something as dangerous as pregnancy.

What are you guys doing to better yourselfs, yea you, the person who has been working minimum wage for 5 plus years since high school with no ambition to even attempt an education then wine and cry that the government is keeping you down. Maybe do something with your life instead of working in weed retail cause it’s part of your stoner culture, or flipping burgers at McDonald’s. Go to college, take an online course, learn a new skill, DONT BE STAGNATE! I think minium wage is fine and it’s purpose is for highschoolers or college students to do part time.

1. Brainwash the people with the far-leftist ideals. 
2. Now many people believe in these ideals. 
3. Good, now encourage the act of recording people and cancelling them for what they say.
4. When people defend themselves against this, say ""freedom of speech means you cannot be imprisoned by the government, people can still do it!"" 

**Result:** companies controlling your content, people in real life controlling you, businesses threatening you to fire you whenever you say something against X or Y, include a bunch of protected classes in the law, and now you have people who are willing to shut up or get their life ruined.

**TL;DR:** Democrats realized that it would be too obvious to make the government do it so instead they used the media to brainwash people and let the people govern you instead.

This is not about aim. I don’t care if you’re the (M)Annie Oakley and hit dead center 100% of the time. Hitting that water aerosolizes some of the urine. It will settle other places but inside of the bowl. This is especially true for tall people. Getting micro droplets of piss everywhere is inherent to the standing position. True, it’s a minuscule amount. However, it’s a real amount and there is no practical reason that it has to be deposited. Someone has to clean it, and that won’t be the guest. This argument is about respecting the property and time of others. 

Pre-rejected arguments: 

1. *“Who cares?”* I agree, but that’s not the guest’s decision to make. 

2. *The resident needs to inform me if they want me to do something unusual or contrary to social norms*. Better, but this won’t CMV. I’m arguing that this should be the new social norm, eliminating the need for the host to request it. 

3. *Are you Karen?* No, piss however you want in my bathroom. IDGAF. My motivation is respect for others. 

4. *Bro you pee sitting down lol* Yes, in other people’s homes and I’m not apologizing for that. I’m accurate, but know I can’t avoid leaving some residual while standing. I pee outside, occasionally standing in my own bathroom otherwise. 

5. *So no one can pee standing up now?* Not what I’m saying. Of course, there will be spoken and unspoken agreements between family and friends. I’m saying that sitting should be the default position given no other information. If you can help yourself to the fridge, you can pee standing up. Roughly that level of familiarity is required. 

What might change my view: I’m making the assumption that standing does make a measurably bigger mess than sitting down. If you can prove that wrong, I have no case. Also, it’s possible that sitting causes some problem that is worse than a subtle yellow mist. You could tell me about that. I’m sure there are valid arguments I haven’t thought of, so hit me with those.

In my view, this reliance seems less about genuine need and more about poor time management skills and a subtle flaunting of status.

Firstly, let’s address the time management part. With a plethora of technology at our fingertips designed to streamline our lives and schedules, is anyone genuinely so engulfed in tasks that they can’t organize their own meetings or sift through their emails? Is the need for a PA actually a mask for an inability to efficiently handle and allocate time to mundane, albeit necessary tasks?

Secondly, there’s the status element. Having a PA has long been seen as a symbol of importance and success. “I have a PA” seems to whisper, “I’m important, and my time is precious”. However, is this not an inflated sense of self-worth? In the grand scheme, is it not part of adult competency to balance various responsibilities, no matter how trivial some might seem?

I want to make clear that this isn’t a critique of PAs themselves, many of whom are undoubtedly skilled and hardworking. My scrutiny is directed at the executives and others who feel the need to have a PA. I’m open to having my view changed, so please share your perspectives!"

The protests were triggered because he did not sign an EU trade agreement. But it could be argued that Yanukovych was actually looking out for the country's best interests:

> Yanukovych...changed his mind due to what she called Russian ""economic pressure and blackmail""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych#Euromaidan_protests

In retrospect, if we view war and annexation as very undesirable, appeasing Russia's requests was probably the smart move to maintain peace.

It seems to me like trying to move closer to the EU when you have a war-mongering and hostile nuclear superpower on your border, was a miscalculation. And instead of reacting to the President's decision with a political revolution, it might have made more sense to have a level-headed discussion about the implications. The implications ending up being: the annexation of Crimea, and a full scale war with Russia.

EDIT:

In fact, just before the Euromaidan protests, it was already apparent to the Ukrainian government that national security was at risk if they went ahead with the EU deal.

> The same day a Ukrainian government decree suspended preparations for signing of association agreement; instead it proposed the creation of a three-way trade commission between Ukraine, the European Union and Russia that would resolve trade issues between the sides.[72] Prime Minister Mykola Azarov issued the decree in order to **""ensure the national security of Ukraine""** and in consideration of the possible ramifications of trade with Russia (and other CIS countries[75]) if the agreement was signed on a 28–29 November summit in Vilnius.

If women were in equally strong bodies, decisions would not be forced upon them by men as it has been in the past. There would be true equality because men would not be able to physically impose their will and subjugate them. And because  the reality is that women are generally weaker, they have a natural inclination towards being yielding to their partners, which wouldn’t be the case if women were physically stronger. 

It’s because men have confidence derived from their physical strength, that a lot of the “masculine” qualities that good leaders  have are seen in them. Their physical strength gives them the confidence to take initiatives,make final decisions, and all the other qualities that result in them being head of the household and society in general."

Strictly Multiplayer gaming and 2. Rampant cheating that has affected almost all multiplayer games

I know the console vs PC debate is as old as humanity (jk). There are always never ending debates on whether one is superior to another. In my personal opinion however,  I'll never use PC for multiplayer gaming because of one simple reason: Cheating.

Most cheat engines change client side information to cheat in multiplayer games. As long as the underlying OS allows custom scripts/applications to run that alters your input, there is virtually no way to stop cheaters from creating cheats in multiplayer games. A client side input is always gonna be compromised no matter how good of a server side detection they put out. 

The best solution imo is consoles. Latest consoles haven't been fully jailbroken yet so cheaters are not able to add any custom scripts. Even if they get jailbroken, the system software needs to be updated to be able to play multiplayer. (You could say they can likely spoof the OS version but I doubt it is that easy). I know that there are cheats that gets installed in controllers but those are not as common and it's easier for console manufacturers to actually ban them. 

With this in mind I've told myself I'll always stay with consoles. I know PCs are powerful when it comes to graphics and I might be missing out on them but I'd rather have a fair gaming experience. CMV if I'm wrong. 

TL;DR : Choose console if you don't want to run into cheaters."

I might even experience insight into what they were thinking or feeling when they created that. But how much of that is real, and how much is in my imagination? Can I ever really know the difference?

I contend that no matter how much technology we create, even if we put machines in our brains and electronically link them together, this will still be a bridge that we cannot cross. The experience of being a person is made up of an infinite number of interwoven variables. There is no way to transcribe all of them in a language that can be read, by a person or by a machine.

1,2023-10-03,CMV: Landlords could be replaced with government rent-to-own programs,u/Vityou,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16z28t9/cmv_landlords_could_be_replaced_with_government/,changemyview,"From what I understand, the reason landlords exist is to amortize housing costs for people who can't afford to buy a house. However, the market says that rent will approach just under a mortgage, or even above, since that is what people are willing to pay as opposed to putting down a down payment on a house and paying a mortgage.

The problem as I see it is that while landlords do assume some risk, and have to provide some services, the return they are able to collect vastly outweighs any of these risks. This arises because the housing market is not the same as something like the hamburger market, since people need houses and houses are limited by space.

Landlords take advantage of this by ""getting there first"" and providing a barrier to housing that we must pay to cross. Much like a guy on a bridge collecting a toll. This goes against the nature of capitalism and competition, which I consider a net negative to society.

Instead, the owning of housing to rent should be outlawed, and the government should provide it instead. The difference I see is that the government would act exactly as the landlord would, but wouldn't have a maximum profit motive, and instead would charge a minimum (0) profit rent, which could easily be extended to a rent-to-own program when tenants choose to pay over the minimum property maintenance costs.

I'm not an economist so I'm sure there's some flaws with this, but I think the main reason it or something similar hasn't happened yet is due to the obscene amounts of wealth that have been extracted from renters being feed back to lawmakers to keep the status quo in a classic capitalist feedback loop.

TLDR: The rental housing market doesn't lend itself well to standard capitalism and competition and therefore should be run by the government."

Here is why I hate both of them. 

1. Gender affirming care is evil. Children are not sexual creatures and are highly impressionable. I had a phase in middle school where I wanted to be a girl but am so glad I didn't surgically get my penis removed and started taking androgen blockers. That would have permanently changed my body when I am not mature enough to make such a decision. If you want to be the opposite sex so bad that you are willing to threaten suicide, you have issues not relating to gender, but rather relating to depression and a identity crisis that you must talk to your therapist about. We should not be letting children decide whether they should mutilate their genitalia or not until they are 18 and are more mature about these topics. 
2. Illegal immigration is evil. Liberals are quick to call conservatives xenophobic while ignoring the fact that in Germany the majority of homeless are immigrants. In my opinion it is more xenophobic to accept immigrants and not give them proper food shelter and housing. And then they wonder why immigrants are overrepresented in violent crimes. Maybe if you control immigration and have a legal process, they would have a way to provide for themselves and properly integrate into society. Also if you support illegal immigration you are supporting their below minimum wage exploitation. And if your solution is to make illegal immigration legal, your country will be flooded with immigrants without a way to provide for them. So basically, liberals want immigrants to be exploited or homeless in a country that simply cannot provide for them. How xenophobic. 
3. Banning AR-15s makes no sense. Handguns kill way more people than rifles. If liberals really cared about the people they would do a blanket gun ban and increase the number of officers so people who have been stalked can request police escorts and so kids in Chicago can have a officer walk them to school so they don't have to worry about being shot. A blanket gun ban would have long term benefits but a short term spike in home invasions, robbery, and rape since people can no longer defend themselves unless they are in peak physical condition. This is an attack on both parties I would personally like a blanket gun ban followed by increased police presence. Also to conservatives the government has nukes as well as automatic rifles that your favorite president Ronald Raegan banned there is no way you can beat a tyrannical government. 
4. Privatization of the public schooling system would be a huge win. This would promote school choice leading to the formation of more schools with different focuses. You could have one school that preps you for a career in tech, another school that trains you in life sciences, a Christian school for the religious, et cetera. We could do what we do now with health insurance and subsidize high school for low income families. We can stop paying the bureaucrats in education billions of dollars and put that money in the hands of parents so they can personalize their students education. That sounds much better than the current system. 
5. Climate change is real and any politician who denies this is full of shit. Also fossil fuel related air pollution results in millions of deaths per year, so we really should not be supporting this form of energy. Additionally, nuclear energy is not preferable I don't know a single person who would be comfortable living near a nuclear power plant given the risk of meltdowns and transport of radioactive waste. That's why wind, solar, geothermal, hydro are the future. 
6. Raise that minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour and don't settle for less. No one should be living on starvation wages. Also make healthcare single payer and open up more hospitals to deal with longer wait times. We spend an absurd amount of money on healthcare and it has everything to do with the greed associated with business. Government should compete with the private sector on insurance and copays should be capped at 1000 per year. 
7. College applications should be blinded by race meaning name and gender should be redacted. Then, there is no room for racism in college admissions meaning no need for affirmative action. Instead of affirmative action we should give people good educations regardless of their zip code and fund alternatives to the public schooling system. Then I guarantee that there will be more diversity. I still support affirmative action in hiring because there is racism found in this process and it's impossible to redact the appearance, gender, and race prior to hiring a candidate.  

I will add more issues but that's my hot take. As you can guess I still lean left but agree with the conservatives on a surprising number of issues. "

# Idealism / Panpsychism is more likely than Phsyicalism

Descartes said ""I think, therefore I am"" - that if there was a demon so powerful that it could trap you in a dream, then you can still be sure of one thing, that you exist, because you think. We could be living in The Matrix or some simulation and all be brains in jars, but whatever is is that we are, we at least know that it exists.

We can go further than this by asking ""what do we know about what exists?""

1. We know that at least some of what exists thinks and feels like something. We can't be sure about anything else. Things that don't think might exist, but we have no evidence for the existence of non-thinking things. We only have a sample size of 1, but it's 0 for non-thinking things.
2. We know that this thing prefers some situations over others. Like, I'd prefer to eat a nice meal than be poked in the eye. I have preferences. Maybe not everything that exists has preferences.
3. We know that it makes choices, and these choices make changes in the world around them. I can go make dinner or I can poke myself in the eye.
4. It seems to be local and limited in space and time. I can't experience or change things far away or in the past. What exists is subjective and limited, not everywhere and forever.

To recap, some things that haven't proved their existence:

1. Stuff that doesn't feel anything
2. Stuff that doesn't have preferences
3. Stuff that doesn't change the world with their decisions
4. Anything that is infinite or eternal
5. An objective reality, it's all just stuff subjectively experiencing parts of itself.

# Physicalism based on Christian science can't explain the evolution of mind

Science is more Christian than we'd like to admit because it was originally a way to know God by knowing His Creation. People believed in a God that is omnipotent and gives laws, all matter in His Creation must obey His Law, and they believed in a separate soul that is immortal. If you throw out God without also throwing out God's law you end up keeping paradoxes like ""free will vs determinism"" (if what we're made of follows the laws of physics then how can we make decisions?) and ""the hard problem of consciousness"" (how can dumb matter give rise to conscious experience?).

If all matter thinks/feels and makes choices then these paradoxes go away. There is no Physical Realm, it's all a mind-matter duality. Matter is not a totally deterministic rule follower, but it does have strong preferences that make it somewhat predictable, which we call ""the laws of physics"". Consciousness doesn't magically arise from matter through some unknown process, the ability to feel and to choose is fundamentally what stuff is.

The best evidence for this is the evolution of the nervous system. Physicalism can't explain the evolution of the nervous system, it fails when we start to ask questions like ""what is the smallest organism with internal experience?"" The standard answers are ""Soul of the Gaps"" *Strange Hoop* jumping arguments from ignorance, ones that also depend on Strong Emergence - that a totally new type of thing (internal experience) is created by some unknown combination of interaction between things that don't have it. Strong emergence does not exist anywhere outside arguments for consciousness!

If, on the other hand, all stuff has preferences, then all evolutionary progress is built on matter choosing to do things that promote replication. As long as the choices of matter don't get too constrained and predictable, then it's almost inevitable that complex minds would come to exist.

# Why AI won't feel

Okay that's the preliminaries out of the way, here's the main course:

## 1. Logic gates remove the ability for matter to choose

Unlike physical stuff itself, a program running on a Turing machine is deterministic; you run the same program with the same inputs you'll get the same outputs. We build them in a way that removes all the ability for matter to choose what to do, or in a way that makes its choices have no bearing on its outputs. If a chip has variation in its outputs, we build processes to get rid of them or consider it a flaw. Like we use ECC to suppress memory errors, and we don't use circuit so small that ""quantum tunneling"" spoils the logic.

So we don't like electrons to go off-piste and do what they like, we instead force them to choose to do work for us. We can't expect high level feelings to crop up in programs that run on logic gates, we suppressed it. If everything feels like something then a circuit likely feels like charged silicon vibrating to the hum of a clock, and is deliberately isolated from the program running on it.

## 2. We do not train for preference or will

Evolution lets the brain move the body how it feels like moving, and over generations this tunes the design of brains so desire things that promote survival. So desire-controlling structures in a feedback loop with free will, preference and choice.

Neural networks are trained by looking at how wrong on average some output is compared to what we want (the loss function), then reducing or increasing the values by how much they contributed to its wrongness (back-propagation). This process is completely deterministic and the promotion of will and choice, if they were possible on transistors (which they aren't) are not a part of it.

## 3. A mind don't come for free

To think that because architectures like ChatGPT can output words that seem human, that systems like it might have minds inside, is like a cat looking in a mirror and thinking it's another cat, that a photograph will steal your soul, or cargo cults thinking that building wooden watch towers runways and doing semaphore will bring back cargo planes. Arguments for computational or mathematical consciousness are based on the magical mysteries of computation and mathematics, and applying that to the mysteries of mind.

It's not logical to think that we can put minds on silicon chips unless we do the hard work first. By this I mean build hardware that's actually compatible with consciousness, i.e. been designed to promote preference and feeling and allow it to be expressed at higher levels, through rigorous study of what matter does at the lowest levels."
1,2023-10-03,CMV: people who get blackmailed by catfish while attempting to cheat on their partner deserve to be “scammed.”,u/newadventures96,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16z64hi/cmv_people_who_get_blackmailed_by_catfish_while/,changemyview,"I’m talking about one specific method of blackmail.

A married person decides they want to cheat on their partner. “Cheat,” will be defined as anything further than, and including, intimate conversations with someone who isn’t their partner. The married person uses the internet to communicate with new potential partners. Screen shots of texts, nude photos, or proof of their cheating is collected by a “scammer.” The scammer then threatens the married person with exposure of their infidelity to their spouse unless a ransom is paid. 

In my opinion, the “scammer” is free and clear to continue their “scam” and the “victim” deserves whatever stress and hardship comes from their attempt to cheat. I believe this for two reasons, infidelity is never okay, and also the “scammed” person is incredibly stupid for falling for this “scam” anyways.

I say we treat the “scammer” like a hero. And their reward is their ransom. 

There are two exceptions to my opinion. I don’t think the scammer should be free and clear any time the ransom requested puts others in danger. I also don’t think complete public embarrassment is fair game. The married person’s spouse is the only person who needs to be involved.

1,2023-10-03,cmv: recreational porn use is better or equal to drinking alcohol or eating fast food,u/Ok-Abbreviations301,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16z64oh/cmv_recreational_porn_use_is_better_or_equal_to/,changemyview,"A person who moderates their porn use is at an extremely low risk of experiencing any of the negative side effects often touted by those who are ""anti-porn."" Thus, I believe porn should be viewed in the same light as alcohol and fast-food: Something that causes serious issues when used excessively, used at a young age, or used as an emotional crutch, but otherwise harmless or a fun recreational activity.  


* Porn: for my definition of pornography, I am including everything from softcore porn on Instagram, to extreme ethical porn (BDSM, CNC, etc) and hentai. By ""ethical,"" I mean both parties have given informed consent and are not under any extreme financial or social pressure to perform acts they wouldn't normally consent to.   

* Moderate porn use: Porn use that does not affect personal life (not socializing, missing work, spending excessive money, lying about porn use to S/O). I also do not believe minors can moderate porn use.  


I also want to address some common arguments I've seen against pornography.  


  1. Porn use often leads to ED (erectile dysfunction) and a poor sex life

  
I haven't seen many studies on this matter nor heard of any anecdotal stories where this wasn't correlated with another personal issue. I acknowledge that this is a possibility from excessive porn use, but I haven't seen anything that suggests moderate porn use can also cause ED. I would argue that those who experience ED or other physiological issues with porn simply do not know their ""limit,"" in the same fashion a person who vomits from drinking too much doesn't know their alcoholic limit/tolerance level.  


 2.  Porn is extremely available and addictive. Excessive use can reprogram your brain pathways to crave porn.

I acknowledge the truth of this statement, but I don't see how this is fundamentally different from video games, fast-food, romantic relationships, etc.   


3. Porn cannot be made ethically and/or creates a culture of misogyny.  


I don't really see how this applies anymore now that porn is such a vast genre. This was definitely true before, but now I feel like its more the exception than the rule. I would argue that those who become misogynistic because of porn either were already misogynistic or started watching porn at a young age.  


TLDR; the dangers of porn are exaggerated. People need to treat it more like fast-food/alcohol and realize it's perfectly fine when done in moderation.

I’m a 33yo male. I’ve suffered from ADHD Inattentive type all my life without knowing it, which implies Executive Functions Disorder (EFD). I was convinced I was lazy because of my inabilities to initiate tasks despite my desire to do so. I hated myself for it and thought my life was doomed. I thought I was deemed to be a spectator of my own life.

And then my diagnosis came in at 28, and I started taking Metylphenidate, a stimulant prescribed for ADHD.

The change in me was so radical, so immediate that I cried. It was like I had been seeing blurry all my life unknowingly and I suddenly had been given glasses and was seeing clear for the first time.

I could actually do things I wanted to do, whether it was playing a game, reaching out to a friend, doing exercise, or simply doing a work task I’d been putting off for month. And I didn’t even dreaded it. It was fucking as simple as willing to do it and Zap, just like that, I could do it.

I had been playing life on Hardcore mode, and all of a sudden, I granted access to easy mode.

That what 5 years ago. My life completely turned around, and I can barely believe how I was living back then.

All of this « laziness » was due to a freaking chemical imbalance in my brain that I could do nothing about despite all my will.

From this date, I don’t believe laziness exist anymore."

I'm highly doubtful that your average homeschooled child is performing significantly better than if they were in a regular school with parents who took an active interest in their education. 

Meanwhile, I have serious trouble grappling with the impact that this level of isolation and enmeshment might have. I can't help but feel, based on the homeschooling situations I've seen that it leaves kids less fulfilled or socially mature. 

The majority of homeschooling I've seen has been for religious reasons. Now, I attended 13 years of faith-based education. I'm not *entirely* against integrating religious instruction into education on principle, provided it doesn't impede on a child's understanding of basic facts. I *mostly* am, but given it's long history and integration with many education systems I'm more comfortable. 

However, I find it ***especially*** suspicious when your faith leads to that degree of isolation and inordinate levels of control over your child. 

Maybe I'm way off, and there are reasons for homeschooling I haven't even considered, but whenever I hear of a homeschooling situation I'm immediately suspicious. It seems like a fundamentally selfish, paranoid, isolating act."

Meanwhile almost no one in Tokyo/Seoul drives, or let alone even has a car. 

You cant even live in the average American city without a car. Everything is already expensive in general, but having car and gas payments on top of that just makes it even worse. These horribly designed cities make people's lives so much more difficult. 

American cities are also far more dangerous than cities from other developed countries.  So many of them are crime ridden shitholes. Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, St Louis, Atlanta, and the list goes on. American cities are absolutely filthy as well. All of the cities I just mentioned have places that look like third world countries. I've never seen a developed country besides America that has such horrible looking cities.

I'd require strong evidence to the contrary, such as verbatim admissions from the responsible party or media articles about what's really going on.  My strongest evidence would be Tim Gurner saying we need more economic stress to force workers into work.  Besides that, most of the people calling poverty deliberate did not come off as sincere to me.

I was considering a scifi subplot where a dictatorial AI openly enforces poverty, stating ""Before me, privation happened simply by accident, but it was I who realized even privation had a function."" Or something like that.  I was kinda afraid such a subplot would make me look like a tinhat."

But how does this create a greenhouse effect if the parts per million is so low.  It would have to be literal glass with a bond length of 1 angstrom.  

The only way it could work with the parts per million being so low is if photons from the sun were bigger to match the scale upsize 

Any miniature model would be in accurate because u cant change the size of a photon so a miniature model would be exaggerating the strength of a photon.  Unless the energy of the light source could be reduced to compensate"

Replication is a form of self preservation in this view. The main purpose of life is to sustain its own existence by preserving the body and by extension the culture and the environment. DNA is the perfect example where, mutations are not built into the ""design"" of DNA - it's meant to perfectly copy and preserve the organism, but because physical reality isn't perfect, mutations occur and the DNA is imperfectly copied each time. Well the same process happens in individuals and societies, where, each individual and group wants to create a stable homeostasis, but because reality is unstable, there is a continual stasis / mutation cycle to which life has to adapt.   
  
Sort of ironically, life is all about stillness, about being frozen in time. If life could perfectly achieve homeostasis and perfect balance with the environment, the organism would stand completely still because there would be no need for actions to fix breaches and disturbances of the homeostatic state. Basic bodily homeostasis include things like eating when hungry, sleeping when tired, and maintaining the physiology of the body, but also mental things and beyond.  
  
I can also imagine, having done a cursory reading of hydrothermal vents and so on, that these vents would be the perfect place for life to begin because you have a lot of movement and chemical and physical reactions interactions, and all you would need (presumably) are 2 or more processes that could mutually reinforce each others existence, and the right materials to produce a reinforcing process that would continually be exposed to the dynamic and destructive force of the vents and continual change (a sort of micro evolution in a very small area).   
  
My idea also goes so far as to say all mental and cultural phenomena are primarily driven by this self preservation need as well. So like individuals, groups and societies want to reach homeostasis, but since reality isn't perfect, there is a continual adaptation process to changes. One word about sexual reproduction. In my view, replication is a parallel process to self preservation, but it is not the dominant force. Since presumably replication is useless without self preservation, any replication process that harms self preservation would be selected out, because without preservation first, the organism would die, or the group would die, before replication could occur. So in this sense, life is a bundle of primarily self preservatory capabilities and in parallel reproductive capabilities. You would have a bias towards replication because by definition, any biological feature that helps replication will be replicated more, but only if it doesn't harm self preservation.  
  
I also think mental phenomena are primarily driven by self preservation. Like the body needs homeostasis, the brain also needs it, and the mind. And because humans are social creatures, our environment and other people have a big impact on our bodily state, and we have the brain and intelligence to recognize this fact. So ego is a primary way to preserve the homeostatic state for individuals. I always bring up extreme examples like serial killers and school shooters, to illustrate this. One reason why serial killings were popular in the 70s and 80s is because it was a way for those people to build ego. Same with school shooters. Ego is about finding out how you are different from other people, and culture gives you ""action paths"" you can take to build ego, in these cases they want notoriety, fame, and so on to make themselves feel good. That's why culture has an impact on the negative actions individuals who don't fit in can take to build an ego. This ego also comes from the idea that every individual has to contribute value and be in competition with others. If society had a different social and economic structure, I don't believe the competitive instinct would be so dominant but that's another topic.  
  
Now you may ask, what are the implications of this compared to the replication story? Is there a difference in how life evolves and functions between the two? And I think there are.  
  
1) In this view, all human conflict is fundamentally about which homeostatic state to preserve. A fundamental tension which is difficult particularly for humans is that while we always want homeostasis and no change, we also have a brain that tells us to continually be interested in novel and new ""signals"" from the environment, because we know that if there are things in the environment we are not knowledgeable about, they can impact the homeostatic state in the future. So we build technology and do science to learn about all the things we don't know, but at the same time, we are extremely conservative about this, because any novel thing in the environment could break homeostasis for the individual and group, and we don't know the impact in advance. This leads to a tension where individuals and groups have to continuously evaluate the impact of new things, while at the same time always being hesitant and scared to embrace them. This becomes a primary reason for conflict because some groups want to introduce a new thing, while others want to preserve what already exists.   
Also on an individual level, some individuals become attached mentally to a certain homeostatic state, while others dislike it, and so conflicts emerge.  
  
2) ""Reward is enough"" is not really enough because we don't really have rewards in the traditional sense. Organisms are not these animals that seek pleasure or avoid pain, but rather have actions that preserve the self. We are a little confused I dare say because some of the biological functions \_look\_ ""reward like"" (like orgasms or eating), but other ones like feelingm refreshed after sleep or fighting because you're in an argument to protect your ego, do not have this outright short term reward like character. Different biological rewards have different character and are different in kind. While for example animal predators have an instinct to bite the jugular and hold on until the prey dies, the primary function of this action is to eat the prey, not to mentally induce pain in the prey. In the same way, the reason people have fist fights is to preserve the ego, but by the same token, they need a practical physical biology to actually win the fight, and so you get aggression to help with that, but aggression is not the primary reason. That's why I want to get away from this ""animal seeking rewards"" type of thing because I don't think it's quite right. To me aggression is just like sleeping, they're all actions that evolved to helped preserve the bodily homeostasis / integrity.  
  
3) Empathy comes from intelligence. I think empathy is ultimately about having the ability to visualize the homeostasis of \_other\_ organisms (and even things), and then having a mental drive to wanting to preserve the body and mind of that other organism / thing. This is purely an intellectual thing, maybe because if you think something, you are halfway there to being that thing, and other animals as far as we know, mostly can't do this (though I'm sure this is a complicated matter, like dogs and cats).  
It also comes from the fact that because we have science and knowledge, we have an abstract model of what the ""right"" or ""most uncompromised"" version of other organisms body is. Like We know about basic physiology, biology and so on, and so if for example a man stands on a dogs leg hard, and the dog whimpers, we know intellectually that this compromises the dogs homeostatic state, and we can visualize it mentally and that it's not the ""natural"" way of things. Other animals can't know this and so empathy is learned in that way.  
Conflicts emerge in this way also because again, it is a fight about which homeostatic state to keep and which to get rid of, and so when people act unempathetically it is because another homeostatic state is more important than the one, and this is another source of tension for humans because we don't really know which state is better in the long term, or all the consequences of any particular state (especially big social/cultural change).  
  
Anyway this is the basic argument I guess - I actually don't know if it's right, I'm not claiming it is, but it makes sense to me.

""Abortion is murder,"" being the most common phrase that uses it.

However, abortion can't be considered murder. In a perfect world, abortion could simply be the cutting of the umbilical cord and the removal of the fetus. That isn't murder; it's cutting off resources that you don't fundamentally own.

Sure eventually it will lead to their death. But that's still not murder. It is the act of you stopping your charity of giving resources and the receiver dying as a result. Still arguably immoral (that's an argument for another CMV), but it cannot be classified directly as murder.

Furthermore, if an abortion does directly kill them, it also doesn't count as murder. In my moral belief, considering the fact that the fetus would inevitably die, the act of killing earlier to stop the pain (if they experience pain) cannot be seen as murder. Sure kill early by a month? Murder. But I can't blame a doctor for stopping something's suffering for the last minutes of its life.

1,2023-10-04,CMV: Guys don't necessarily need to follow both rules 1 (be attractive) & 2 (don't be unattractive) to succeed in online dating.,u/tslvsss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zimrj/cmv_guys_dont_necessarily_need_to_follow_both/,changemyview,"For those who don't know. In online dating if a guy wants to be successful according to reddit they must follow rules 1 & 2. These are: Rule 1: Be attractive. Rule 2: Don't be unattractive. The post that made me write this is the following: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/16z9bwx/for\_the\_ones\_in\_the\_back\_on\_yesterdays\_post\_who/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/16z9bwx/for_the_ones_in_the_back_on_yesterdays_post_who/)

You can see in the comments most people saying how cringy / terrible / dumb are this guy’s messages and yet because he follows rules 1 & 2 he is still successful. 

Rules 1 & 2 in my opinion are not the same rule written two different ways. My interpretation of them is the following:

* Rule 1: Be attractive. To me this means that you need to look good. Whatever that may mean to different people. Have nice photos, take good care of your appearance and so on. 
* Rule 2 however, don’t be unattractive, is completely different. Despite someone’s looks, they can still be (un)attractive to different people because of their actions and words. If you can show some interesting aspect of your personality and your life in your profile, you can still follow rule 2 and have success in online dating without necessarily following rule 1. 

So according to most comments on that example post and my interpretation of the 2 rules. The dude follows rule 1 but not rule 2. In my opinion people can have varied success by following either of these two rules.

1,2023-10-04,CMV: I think most hiphop songs are immature,u/PorkSodaWaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zjwq7/cmv_i_think_most_hiphop_songs_are_immature/,changemyview,"I will start off by saying that I am not a huge music aficionado in general. I don’t have. This vast library of music and I may be mistaken, hence the CMV. It might be just that hiphop is the most popular genre at the moment and that’s why I’m exposed to it more and notice it more in hiphop than in other music, but here we go:


I didn’t know how to phrase my stance entirely, because I didn’t want to say something generic like that I don’t “like” hiphop. It’s also not entirely true, because I enjoy listening to some hiphop artists and I actually don’t have a problem with rapping or hiphop beats like some people who don’t like hiphop say they do. The thing is though that I get tired of listening to those artists after a short while for the reasons listed below, and one of my favorite artists are in a language I can’t even understand. Which is kind of telling.


I mostly dislike the lyrics of a lot of hiphop and the closest word I can think of is that I find them immature.


1. The absolute worst thing about hiphop for me is the boasting. I have always associated people who shamelessly boast about themselves with low intelligence. It makes me cringe when I hear rappers talk about how good they are at rapping and how much better they are at it than other rappers. Even better hiphop artists will throw out a boastful one liner once in a while.


- Somewhat related to that previous point is that I hate the name dropping. Mostly of the rappers’ own names, having someone else introduce them during the song before they start rapping etc. To me this is so juvenile and again kind of cringe.


- I don’t like how during the pandemic a lot of rappers seemed to just constantly spout misinformation in song form. A lot of “consciousness rap” (is that what it’s called?) is made by people who really should speak a little less about things they know nothing about.


- Even rap songs that aren’t about misinformation still manage to insert a lot of shitty opinions the artists hold. Be it misogyny, antisemitism, or homophobia. I realize that other music genres have those elements too but in my experience no genre is about just sharing your opinion/world view verbatim like other genres are.


- I think a lot of songs in other genres are more symbolic, like they are open to interpretation or more poetic, they speak to a wider human experience than just one guy’s life story. I mean, MOST music is about a person’s lived experience but I can’t think of many rap songs that aren’t about the artist himself. Sometimes something seems like it’s interesting and I look up what the song is trying to say but it always turns out that it wasn’t symbolism or dlsaying anything but it was “about rapper X’s time working with producer X” or “about that time that rapper X was really mad at rapper Y.”


- I don’t like the dissing, “battling,” taking down other artists rather than minding your own business or supporting them.


I hope that my POV is clear. The reason why I wanted to do this CMV is that I haven’t seen most of those arguments I made satisfyingly refuted before. I don’t want to unfairly antagonize a genre, as I am at this point in my life trying to find more music to listen to, and am usually reluctant to give rappers a chance. 


If it could be demonstrated to me that the problems I mention aren’t unique to hiphop, or maybe were not always staples of the genre, or even that my critiques are unfair, then I’d be convinced to be more inclusive of hiphop in my musical journey."

* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the ""beautiful"" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: ""if I lose then it was rigged"". This is probably the biggest of them all.

The rich have all the money but aren't willing to give them out. In order to force rich people to give money out, they should be allowed to commit crimes so the state could extract funds out of rich people. Equality before the law isn't as beneficial for society as wealth equality. 

Rich people should pay a large sum of money to the victims for compensation (at least $1,000,000 for each victim) and a large sum of money to the government (at least $1,000,000). In addition to that, rich people can break any law, provided they can provide an exorbitant sum of money to the victims or the government. 

Extracting wealth from rich people makes a great benefit for the society as the victims get funds to invest in their businesses and the government get funds to invest into infrastructure. It's a win-win situation for all parties. Rich people doesn't have to suffer punishments, the victims get more than compensation, and the government gets more funds to develop the nation."

Looking back its really weird how we basically went 8 years where jokes about the government and president were non-existent. Obama and Michelle might pop up, but then the joke would be how amazingly cool they were. Theyd show up and play basketball really well, characters would gush over all the good theyve done, etc. This was particularly weird with ""all target"" shows like South Park or anti-establishment ones. 
For the record, I think he was a good president, with obvious flaws like even the best ones had. But I think crticising power is one of the main strengths comedy has. However, in the mainstream we went two terms where this just never happened.

Now comedy in the Trump era was atrocious. The same ""He has bad hair and small hands"" jokes over and over. I think this was due to three things.
1) After all that time, comedians had a target that wasnt above criticism and was incredibley, comedically flawed. So they lept at it with too much vigour and it got old. 
2) After eight years of sucking off the establishment, the criticism and jokes now felt hollow. They were no longer people outside the system sticking it to the man, they were obviously inside, being told what to do and obeying. 
3) The deification of other political leaders didnt stop and was carried over. None are saints, yet it was hard not to feel slapped in the face when comedians like Broad City started treating Clinton as this ultra altruistic, ultra cool figure ala Obama.

I think things are a bit better now. Jokes about Biden are a bit more allowed than Obama, and no ones trying to paint him as this hip cool dude. But I do still see people bristle whenever a ""He's old / He's weird around kids"" joke is made - and certainly never in the mainstream.

TL;DR: Comedians during the Obama era set up a bad precedant of being overly positive about the government - Right or Left I dont think comedy should ever be used to lift up the establishment instead of criticise it. This created bad habits and ruined their credibility, which we really started the feel the affect of once Trump was in power."

You would like me and who I was. You may even want to be my friend. You’d laugh at my jokes. You may even come to me when you’re having a bad day. Overtime though you would see how much of a rollercoaster I was. 

About my depression: 

I used to think it was normal to loose interest in doing things you used to enjoy or staying home for long periods of time unless I had to go to class or work, going long periods of time without showering. I used to think going to the park to scream in my car was normal or hitting myself when I was angry was normal. I used to think that thinking about death was normal. I would picture the funeral and the people in my life who would be there. I thought thinking about taking a lot of pills at once was normal. Or how I felt pathetic that I didn’t have the courage to end it. I wouldn’t actually do it. 
Until one day I realized all of this isn’t normal. I have depression. 

I have struggled through having depression for a very long time. I just didn’t know until a few years ago. I currently see a therapist but I’ve been going to therapy on and off since I was 19. I’ll be 27 this week. I’ve dealt with lots of trauma in my life including SA. I know I have depression I just don’t like the stigma that comes with it. I don’t like feeling broken or like something is wrong or not normal about me. I don’t like feeling more messed up than I already am. 

I tried taking medication once but stopped because I hated how it affected my self perception. I wonder if anyone can love someone like me. Even typing this is making me angry. I  don’t want to be depressed. I just want to be okay.

Recently my therapist recommended that I see my psychiatrist again because I haven’t really been eating, I was struggling with suicidal ideation (but I don’t want to die 99% of the time anymore), and dealing with a lot of issues at home. I agreed and met with my psychiatrist. She prescribed me medication but I just don’t want to take it. I just want to be fine without it. I mean I have moments of laughter and joy. Isn’t that enough? Isn’t therapy enough?"

(Some seem to think it may be an urban legend - maybe yes, maybe no, I'm pretty convinced it was real from the few sources I've looked into and military groups I've asked the question in, but I won't be debating if it's real or not here - only how bad it would be).

The punishment consists of the following:

______

""The offending soldier would be made to ride a horse facing backwards.

They would then be made to lean forward, bending down until their face was tucked up snug against the horse's backside, the tail draping over it (hence the name - ""under tail"").

He would then be bound firmly in that position and made to endure a full day's ride. Or multiple days, depending on the offense.""

______________

It was described as being the most-feared punishment in the cavalry. Worse than whippings, imprisonment, etc. Sort of the cavalry equivalent of Keelhauling in the navy, something every soldier absolutely dreaded.

I'm really surprised it could be that feared.

Sure, the position doesn't sound the most comfortable and all. And I'm sure it's not the freshest smelling environment etc, but I would think cavalry soldiers are so used to horse odors that that wouldn't even matter.

It didn't kill them or anything, and was only for a day or 2, so this wouldn't be more terrifying than other harsh military punishments would it?

Just wanna say, yes I am white. No, I do not think I am marginalized or attacked in any way, and I know that I am automatically privileged in the US as a white male. I don’t think it should be that way, but I recognize that I have privilege inherently.  

I’m my gender studies class, it was brought up that men cannot experience sexism and that white people cannot experience racism. Our professor said it’s because for something to be racism, it has to be directed at a marginalized group. Obviously white people are not marginalized, so the argument I guess is that you can’t be racist towards them. 

Did the definition of racism change at some point? I always saw it as racism being simply treating somebody worse because of their race. I know that barely ever happens to white people, but if somebody treats a white person worse because they are white, is that not racist? 

I know this probably doesn’t seem like the best thing for a white person to be saying, sort of me saying “I matter too! I can experience racism too!” But looking at it from a purely outside perspective, is racism not just treating somebody differently because of their race, no matter what that race is?"

I didn't know what being ""plural"" or ""a system"" meant until very recently. For those who are unaware, it is a term that young people are using basically to say that they have multiple personalities. This is... a very rare type of condition, and a very serious one, usually tied to severe abuse, so after an ongoing drama with my oldest child (late teens) involving similar claims, I became extremely alarmed and really tried to do my research on this one. 

I read from a great many sources on the internet, I went through through a lot of Twitter threads, I joined several Discord servers and said I was there to learn more, I read conversations, I talked to many of these people, and ultimately I have come to the conclusion that literally all of them are, at absolute best, greatly exaggerating their symptoms. At worst they're lying for clout or for some other unknown selfish reason.

Now I want to be very clear that I am not saying that these kinds of disorders don't exist. I am well aware that they do. I have a sister with schizophrenia, and I know how serious and crazy mental illness is. I am also not claiming that the people doing this are perfectly mentally healthy, they're not. I am not trying to discriminate or be hateful.

At this point, though, I am beyond convinced that basically all of people are faking their disorder. Many of them list ""disorders"" that don't exist in their twitter bio, and if you watch any videos on YouTube or TikTok (which I unfortunately did) of them, their behavior is incredibly obviously faked. Nobody is having this kind of fun with a serious mental illness. In my opinion this almost feels beyond debate- nobody is parading their severe mental problems around like this. 

However, my wife doesn't agree with me. She thinks that these people are just learning to express themselves, and feel more comfortable ""presenting as multiple people"" and that my view is ""mean."" To me this sounds overly generous, and like it is making a mockery of serious mental problems. That aside, I trust my wife very much, and so I am coming here to hopefully get some kind of middle ground perspective, from people closer in age to those who I am observing."

However, I still think that personal whole genome sequencing (and analysis) should be done on everyone as part of preventive medicine instead of diagnosis. I mean, I’d still want to know if I have the mutation for a certain disease (let’s say dementia), even if I can’t exactly do anything to prevent it from actually happening.

Granted, not everyone will agree as some people may believe that ignorance is bliss. But I think that, at the very least, it should still be explained to everyone, especially to women who are expecting, just so that everyone knows of their options.

1,2023-10-04,CMV: Liberals think there is nothing morally or inherently wrong about illegal immigration.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zvpem/cmv_liberals_think_there_is_nothing_morally_or/,changemyview,"The illegal-immigration topic is, of course, incredibly vast and complex and can't be distilled down into a 300-word post. But I'll try to focus on one aspect of it.

As I see it, the biggest reason for the intensity of the illegal-immigration debate is that conservatives think of it as a **crime**, while liberals think of illegal immigrants as simply being good, decent poor people who are trying to seek a better life but **merely lack the appropriate paperwork.**

This is why liberals will often supporting sanctuary cities, or openly say ""We embrace undocumented migrants"" (there are public colleges in California with such banners on their buildings,) in a way that is not subtle or secret in the least. And while many liberals may say they oppose ""open borders,"" they will simultaneously endorse policies that are not, practically speaking, much different than open borders (if one says that illegal immigrants shouldn't be stopped from coming here, and, once here, shouldn't be deported, then that's about the same as open borders.)

Conservatives, on the other hand, consider illegal immigration to be a crime (anyone remember all the banners that said, ""Which part of the word 'illegal' don't you understand?"") That's why the right-wing is so fierce and angry about the issue, because they think liberals are blatantly turning a blind eye to an ongoing crime. Sure, there are some liberal presidents, such as Obama, that deported many illegal immigrants, but that was perhaps more of either 1) political optics or 2) ""just following the rules.""

I am not trying to straw-man the liberal stance in any way. If anything, I think (and hope) I am steel-manning the liberal position. 

So, the viewpoint that I have, and am open to get changed, is this: **Liberals think that illegal immigrants are not doing anything morally wrong. They may have technically broken the law, but they are just good, decent, impoverished people who are trying to get a better life in America for themselves and their families.**  "

After a few minutes of ""you can't park there"" and ""mind your business"" going back and forth, McGlockton comes out, doesn't say anything to Drejka and ***shoves him to the ground***.

It was in that moment, Drejka felt compelled to act in self-defense. 

But it didn't have to come to that.

All McGlockton had to do was simply use his words. He didn't even have to be civil about it. He could just say ""Ay, what's your fucking problem"" instead of launching a man way smaller than you to the concrete. 

However, he had a 5 year old and a 3 year old. Those are prime ages at which we teach them to use our words when we're upset. That was a good teaching/learning experience that divulged into a trauma.

Had he approached him and used his words and not his hands, I'm almost certain he'd still be alive today.

I can honestly say if I got catapulted to the ground like Drejka was and I had my piece on me, I'd probably at least brandish it. It's easy to over analyze a surveillance tape 100 times, but nobody really knows what was going through his head in that instant, especially when you're upended that abruptly. It's disorienting.

In addition, the basic big movements of calisthenics are practical and commonly used in daily movements for overall body strength. Also, one of the most significsnt advantages of calisthenics, especially advanced progressions, is the unique way that your core is used, and trained to resist antiextension and rotation in order to keep the body as a stable ""pillar"", something upperbody weightlifting often neglects. Straight arm movements are also important for strengthening your tendons. With calisthenics you can regress or progress any movement to your current capability. The way that calisthenics trains you in a multitude of leverages, angles, and movement patterns causes your body to have full rounded strength in many planes of bodily movement, which is why calisthenics also has a great carryover to conventional weightlifting.

When a woman hits man people's reaction is usually ""meh maybe he did something wrong.""

Man hits a woman even in defense - ""Stop him!""

 The same reason why "" wife beater"" is a term but "" husband beater"" isn't. Even though in US and UK men make up  45 % of domestic violence victims.

Women's feelings and experiences and needs are talked about on TV, in schools, women's groups in college campuses, TV shows especially made for this.
Men don't have this. Women's international day - celebrate women, women's history, femininity.
Men's international day - nothing. Masculinity is more often called toxic rather than encouraged and celebrated.
Men have tried to create a male version of women's groups which are in college campuses, so men can talk about men's issues, like suicide etc. They were shut down. Each single time.


Quotas in jobs and education for women to get them in STEM fields (interesting how jobs where men are a majority but are shitty, tough, hard-labour jobs are not included. Only the most fancy ones) but nothing for men to help them in female dominated fields like nursing.
Men are a minority in universities. No one is having an issue with it.

Men are the majority of victims of every single crime except rape, yet we have biased laws that protect women and sometimes even ignore male victims like ""Violence against women act"" "" The Duluth Model"" and numerous trends like ""Believe Women"" which by definition says believe women on face value.


Man let's woman pay for food - people think he's a slacker

IMO, When a person votes conservatize in 2023, that person is saying to me,

 ( I want this N dead)  Yes, I have to say it like that. This is how I truly feel in my heart this how the modern Conservative views me. 

Trump is... not important to the story, but i don't associate with anyone who voted for Trump beyond at work. 

To me, A conservatize that votes for Trump also believed in the Birther movement  - (When conservatives said Obama wasn't a U.S citizen and demanded his birth certificate) is not a good person to be around and does not deserve my energy.

However..  my adoptive mom just texted me yesterday and she text, 

"" \_\_\_\_\_ I miss you, please come home. I Love You""

Damn this text made me cry at work.

I still cannot be around someone who supports overthrowing the government because your presidential candidate DID NOT win.

I miss my adopted mom so much and I miss my adoptive brother and sister, but i'm conflicted where i want to see my family again, but I cannot ever willing conversate with a person who supports Trump.  


IMO, a conservative is pro police and since police hate black people and will kill us in a instant, my mom wants me dead.

1,2023-10-04,CMV: Lack of Duty to Rescue laws represent a major hole in the legal system.,u/NottiWanderer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zzkna/cmv_lack_of_duty_to_rescue_laws_represent_a_major/,changemyview,"Two explanations first:  
  
A) A Duty to Rescue law is basically a law stating you have a legal obligation to rescue someone from dangerous or lethal situation. A more thorough definition can be looked up on wikipedia if you like  
  
B) One of, if not the primary, purposes of the law is to keep the peace and prevent people from taking matters into their own hands. To make a civil environment where, as a society, we can be reasonably certain justice was served.  
  
I believe the fact that most jurisdictions do not have Duty to Rescue laws essentially is a failure of #2. I have two short scenarios to demonstrate this.  
  
1-A dude walks into a building. He starts recording a bunch of people while punching them, says ""PRANKED!"", and uploads it to youtube with the title ""PRANKED LOL"". He goes to prison for assaults, and there was much rejoicing on his sentencing.  
  
2-This is purely hypothetical situation to prove a point so don't argue the setup, just assume it happened somehow.  
  
A 28 year old man walks into a building. It has a pool with 1,000 people alive and drowning, chained to the floor. For the sake of argument, you have a 6 year old daughter and she's in the pool.  
  
There is a button that says ""POOL DRAIN-PUSH TO INSTANTLY DRAIN POOL"" He starts recording, sees this and says ""Hmmm...NAH!"" He whips out a boombox and blares Rob Zombie songs while headbanging as people slowly drown to death. After about 10 minutes, he gets exhausted, pushes the button, calls the police to say there's a bunch of corpses and that he watched them drown, and then says ""What a bunch of fucking losers"" as he stops recording.  
  
He uploads this to youtube with the title ""PRANKED LOL"". He is not arrested, since he violated no crimes. As far as the legal system is concerned, scenario #1 is far worse.  
  
  
  
  
  
What the actual fuck? I can tell you this: This 28 year old dude is not living to see his 30th birthday, and when he does, whoever killed his ass might end up in jail, and more importantly I think a lot of people would not blame the avenger. Basically the law very definitely failed here.  
  
How to change my mind (do any of the following):  
  
Point out a major flaw in this scenario  
  
Make a comparable ""unjust"" scenario that would happen if the following law existed:  
  
""A person is obligated to do their best to their ability to prevent someone from dying or being gravely injured if  
  
\-such an action would cause no immediate danger to themselves and  
  
\-no other person is helping and  
  
\-they could reasonable have time to assess the situation before taking an action""  
  
Obviously more elaborations might need to exist, but that's my 5 minute law proposal. Alternatively, prove that scenario #2 is acceptable because a law like the above would be worse.  
  
3) Actually convince me this scenario does not represent a failure of the law.  
  
$) Do something else that convinces me Duty to Rescue laws are unreasonable."

I think the topic can be attempted to be approached scientifically, and the best experiments tend to include brain imaging and things like that, but the way most experiments are done and the way results are intepreted and distributed on the whole seems to me to be very unscientific.

The use of questionares and the broad sweeping correlation claims...it's very hard to say that it's entirely useless, but it's also hard to say that it actually says anything. I find it hard to trust self report period, for example.

Let's say someone has an issue with low self esteem, and a psychologist says ""This person has a problem with low self esteem because they weren't loved enough by their mother."" Then later on it becomes known that, well actually the person's mother did love them very much, and actually smothered them with love, then they say ""This person has low self esteem because the mother was a helicopter parent."" Both are entirely plausible explanations...that cannot be verified in anyway. If there was a way to say how much love is too much love, and how much is not enough, exactly, then it would be a science. But as far as I can tell psychology isn't at that point, and because of that I don't really see how it can be considered a science when it is clear that if we cannot pinpoint the answer to that question without wildly different intepretations that cannot be falsified, we don't really know what we're talking about.

This is also a less scientific criticism, but the biggest proponents of psychology as a science also seem to be the type of people who I would say...like to tell people what they want to hear and want to believe the most charitable version of reality. Basically what conservatives derisivly call ""woke."" I wouldn't say I'm a pessimistic person, but I want to know how the world really is, and I want to keep that entirely seperate from how I wish the world was, and I think that's important even if it has conclusions that I don't like. The majority of psychologists I've met and spoken with and challenged...don't seem to do this. They like saying ""the research suggests"" and such and such, and I'll keep saying ""well, can the research suggest anything? Or is it more the case that the research just...is?""

I also notice that there is a massive reproducibility crisis in psychology especially, and recently one author whose books I've read and enjoyed in the past, Dan Ariely, was found to be a massive fraud. 

So, if there are any good psychologists out there please try to change my mind about this field. 

I said yet because I do think there could be a way psyhology can be ""real"" science, and I think the hope of that will be if brain imaging technology becomes advanced enough that we can actually see and translate thoughts and emotions into tangible 1-1  conversions where we could ""read people's minds"" then I would probably take the field a lot more seriously and think ""ok, we actually do know a lot about the mind now."" But as it stands, it seems like it is all just post hoc nonsense and I would like my mind changed because I don't want to feel like my minor is totally useless so I can have some motivation to study.

Beyond that... The more I hear about IQ testing, the less confident I am that it's a great measure of much of anything. I think it can serve as a snapshot of certain mental abilities at a certain time in certain conditions, but I'm not sure how useful that is. 

Delving further into why I think IQ tests are not all they're cracked up to be:

-IQ tests measure ""fluid intelligence."" As I understand it, fluid intelligence was discovered when a Dean and a researcher noticed that students who performed well on some subject tests also performed well on other unrelated subject tests. There were other explanations, but the conclusion they landed on was that this correlation was due to fluid intelligence. This seems like an untested hypothesis

- IQ tests can be impacted by the same environmental factors as every other test, so a low score can be due to any of those factors. 

-It is possible to improve at every sort of puzzle found on an IQ test. 

-Basic test taking skills can help people perform better on IQ tests. For example, skipping a problem if it is too challenging, considering all elements of the problem, breaking the problem down into smaller parts, and even looking for answers with a lot in common as, on harder questions, it's likely to be one of the very similar ones. 

These are my primary reasons, but I don't know a lot about this subject and I am open to changing my view."

I as a U.S. citizen was a little skeptical of my government when they were sending military aid packages worth billions of dollars every few months but i have learned some facts that solidify my view.

1- we are not sending straight up cash to Ukraine. (Well yes actually in some ways we are but…)  We are sending our (old) military equipment that was paid for with our parents tax dollars and then left to sit and rot in a warehouse somewhere. Instead of letting it go to waste we are using it to kill our adversaries soldiers. all while not manning the equipment ourselves. 

2- as for the newer equipment that we send, our defense companies and (increasingly sketchy) military industrial complex is given a chance to use their newest toys on a real battlefield- only engineers understand the true value of being able to that. 

3- usa being the largest sonar to Ukraine has sent around  $110 billion in aid to Ukraine depending on what numbers you look at. Usa spends $700 billion on defense budget every single year. Since the beginning of the war. The military aid package we should be wary of is the one we send ourselves. If you don’t think that we should lower our defense budget because that would give Russia or China a reason to get ambitious, then we have come full circle to the original point that the few amount of billions we have Ukraine are worth it to keep our adversaries in check. 

Why should we not spend this (RELATIVELY) low amount of money to hold Russia back and also possibly China as well."

I have seen many cases where people is sentenced to 15, 20, 25 years for killing someone while DUI, i'm sorry but that's not enough, for the pain and suffering you caused for taking someone's life you deserve to have your life taken as well, if kids aren't gonna have their parents growing up, you deserve it, if parents aren't gonna see their children grow up for your irresponsible actions, you deserve it.

Is it too harsh? its too harsh for people to lose loved ones for someone else's irresponsible, reckless, preventable and selfish actions.

DUI deaths are one of the most preventable type of accidents and somehow thousands and thousands of people still die because of it, the punishment must fit the crime and currently it's not. 

I have been fixated on this point of view for many years now and I have never talked about it with someone properly, can someone change may mind or is this a broader/popular opinion?

This is taking into account the entire spectrum from far left communists, to left wing socialists, to centre left labour, centrist socdems, centre right conservative socdems, right wing neoliberal, all the way to alt right.

I would be willing to change my view if it could be demonstrably shown that the party is legislatively and ideologically socialist. Also, if it could be shown to be ideologically labourist, wanting to go further in that direction than conventional labour parties, not just further in that direction in general. I am from The Netherlands, seeing as we have the entire political spectrum represented here i will use that as the basis for comparison.

He doesn't 100% agree with my view as stated above, but respects it and sticks up for me to show his support for me.

In contrast, my ex-boyfriend only stood up for me a couple of times in our five-year relationship. His family didn't like me and excluded me from any family activities after learning that I suffer from anxiety, but that's a different story for a different day. He often defended them, or tried to make it my responsibility to repair the relationship. He didn't take any responsibility whatsoever. I strongly believe you can defeminize a woman the same way you can emasculate a man. His failure to stand up for me and tell me that I'm strong enough to stick up for myself without him made me feel like a man, not a woman.

I use the story of my ex to demonstrate my reasoning for why I believe that it's a man's job to defend a woman. I don't think that what he did was manly, but rather feminine. If I found that attractive, I could just date a woman, but I don't swing that way.

1,2023-10-05,CMV: a nuclear war can be fought and won,u/Goos_Blah_Blah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1708yle/cmv_a_nuclear_war_can_be_fought_and_won/,changemyview,"There may have been a time where the phrase “nuclear wars cannot be won” was true. But that isn’t true now. The USA’s missile defense system over time would have been  able to intercept all of Russias nuclear missiles. Vladimir Putin himself confirmed this when he unveiled hypersonic nuclear weapons in 2018, which he said were created specifically to get around the u.s. missile defense shield. According to Vladimir Putins own public testimony, there was a time where the united states could have unloaded its arsenal at Russia. Which would be even more devastating because of its naval and air power. And it would face minimum to no causalities in return even though Russia attempted a retaliation nuclear strike 

&#x200B;

general Jon hyten of the u.s. Air Force has said chinas hypersonic “around the world” stunt is a crystal clear message they are preparing for a pre emptive nuclear strike on the u.s. mainland. According to general jon hyten, china could overwhelm us missile silos with hypersonic mssiles. They could wipe out the u.s. navy’s pacific fleet within 48 hours. They could find enough u.s. Jets before they even reach china. And we would find ourselves in a similar situation. Where even if we unload our arsenal it will cause minimal to no casualties for the other side. Because we would be hit before we could hit them. And what makes this situation particularly troubling, is America has an aging old nuclear arsenal, and its sloppy attempt at hypersonic weapons will not yield a mass china or Russia like arsenal for years to come. China is building a u.s. style GMD missile defense system , and if it becomes what they want it to be within the year they can intercept u.s. Nuclear missiles with ease because the u.s. has a long way to go before it can field its more advanced hypersonic nuclear missiles

&#x200B;

the idea nuclear wars cannot be won is actually a very dangeorus threat to peace, it gives people the idea that mutually assured destruction is what it was before, and we can allow certain things to escalate or get out of control because no one will go there, a nuclear war is suicide right? But I’ve noticed this talk is from common folkS. Not the pentagon or the kremlin or the communist party in beijing, they all seem to heavily believe in the idea a nuclear war can be fought and won and they have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this very concept. by understanding nuclear wars can be won, we can make the starting point of where to negotiate and what hard truths we are ready to swallow. By pretending they can never be won, we might accidentally sleep walk into one, like with Russia and Ukraine Or china and Taiwan. As general Jon hyten once famously said “i cannot fight a 21st century war with 20th century nuclear weapons” i think he was secretely saying Americas old nuclear arsenal has opened the window for someone to fight a nuclear war against us and win. If we realized we can lose nuclear wars, maybe it would have given us the Sputnik moment general mark milley says we missed when Beijing flew its missile around the world. The event that made gen Jon hyten confirm nuclear wars can be fought and won

Male, Female, and Intersex. So there are at least 3 naturally occurring genders in the human species: Men, Women, and Hermaphrodites

Most people have the opinion that the small percentage of intersex outliers can be ignored.

But using the logic in Einstein's razor: ""The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."" Often paraphrased as ""make things as simple as possible, but no simpler.""

We know that outliers cannot be ignored. We cannot simply ignore observed data because it is rare. 

According to research, the naturally occurrance of intersex births or hermaphroditic genders is between 0.018% and 1.7%: 

[Applying this more precise definition, the true prevalence of intersex is seen to be about 0.018%, almost 100 times lower than Fausto-Sterling s estimate of 1.7%.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210424092910/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/)

At least .018% of babies are born neither male or female, but a third sex: intersex. 3 sexes exist in our natural world. 

Gender reassignment surgery was developed because doctors in hospitals needed it to cope with the 1.5% chance intersex babies are born. Just because it is rare, does not mean it doesn't exist. 

It can be your opinion that there *should* only be 2 genders. It is an observable scientific fact that there are at least 3."
1,2023-10-05,CMV: Adderall prescribed to ADHD havers or any student is cheating.

I found a friend uses adderall cause of ADHD. Then I found another friend had diagnosed ADHD and takes meds (unknown, but probably Vyvanse if I'm not mistaken).

I don't take anything. But the first friend I'm taking about is a straight A student. The second friend isn't, but could be if she tried.

The two arguements I hear is:

1) ADHD meds are like glasses for normal people. i have glasses. I can understand. But it doesn't stop me from feeling bad, because to me, even without ADHD meds, they seem cool. They could study w/o it. So it makes me feel like their grades and achievements are artificial; cheating.

Everytime I can't focus, I don't think, ""Oh, it's the undiagnosed ADHD,"" I think, ""I'm a piece of shit.""

So, I don't know, it feels *unfair.*

Why am I trying to compete with drugged people?

2) If adderall and Vyvanse is cheating, shouldn't caffeine be, too?

Listen, caffeine for me;

a) Reduces sleep I need

b) Makes workouts easier cause I'm already ""ready to go""

But adderall, according to what I've read;

a) Helps you focus better, or ""feel like you're focusing better""

b) Keeps you up like caffeine, but longer

c) Parents agree to it, so you don't have to hide it (my parents don't agree with caffeine)

I'm drugged, too. But they have ""better"" drugs. First friend takes caffeine like a coke addict.

What do I do? How do I stop giving up everytime I think of them? It's horrible. Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs. Abuse is so common. I wish we never had drugs. If you sucked, you sucked. Deal with it. ADHD to me is giving an excuse to a pathetic being that they're ""trying their best.""

Please try to change my mind. I'm trying to understand my friends, that they NEED this, that they're NOT cheating. I'm giving up. Do I have ADHD? Do I need adderall? Should I ""cheat"" just to level the playing field?

Last, is ADHD an excuse?

My friend, when off meds, act like they were coddled as a baby. Energetic and chaotic, like a teenage boy during puberty in class. Haven't seen the first one off meds. Is ADHD a popular, pathetic excuse?

Like, you can't focus? Congrats, none of us can. It's calculus. You're not SUPPOSED to like it. But you medicine for it. I get constant guilt.

How is ADHD not an excuse to act however you want? I hate it so much. SO many kids drugged around here. It's like a dystopia. I loved it when chaotic kids weren't sedated."

That's another discussion, but ultimately I don't think I've ever met anyone who thinks their life is improved by having their data harvested, so that's not really a view I feel I need to change.

This is really about data and the application of it when it comes to business, probability, studies, etc. Whether or not the data is valid, biased or objective, I don't think it ever truly tells the full story. I think it's maybe seven chapters in a hundred page book.

Example 1: Let's say that the data shows that 40% of consumers buy one particular product, making it the most popular product out of a line of 10 offered, meaning that 60% of people buy the other 9, but every product is purchased less than 40% of the time each time someone buys something. Because of it's popularity, a company will choose to highlight it: ""Our best selling widget!"" But in doing so, they're literally highlighting the thing that makes them less than half of their revenue. Proper application of the data would show that they should highlight every OTHER item. Put the popular item back a bit and make the other 60% easier to purchase. THAT is what will end up increasing revenue further. In fact, highlighting the popular thing that gets purchased less than the combination of the other things will likely result in decreased revenue.

Example 2: Leadership. Any study would show that there are fewer leaders than individual contributors at an organization. Application of that data would show that it's more likely for someone to be an individual contributor than a leader. Further application of that information could be to say that it isn't worth trying to get into leadership because it's so unlikely. What the data doesn't show, then, is quality. Surely there's another study that lists out the most common qualities of leaders, but if you don't go out of your way to find that then you could reasonably get to a point of thinking ""what's the point of trying to move up?"" Well, the point is making more money, doing more fulfilling, higher-level tasks, learning from other leaders, getting on a career path for further growth, etc. Despite it being less likely to be a leader than an individual contributor, it's still worth trying, even if it could result in disappointment and/or humiliation.

I think people talk about data and mean popularity, and equate popularity to validity. I think it's highly probably that my view on this is flawed in multiple ways, and I'd prefer that to be the case, because if I'm right then how we're applying data is hurting a lot of people."

Take a classic Computer Science programme. You need:

1) To pass 40+ classes 
2) A final project
3) An industry placement (6 months) 

for a Level 8 Honours degree in Ireland. 

If you are a working software engineer with a formidable portfolio, you fulfill the last two requirements. 

If you somehow take and pass the final exams all together in a month without ever attending the college, you still deserve the same level of recognition as other students. The fact that other students did it in 4 years in a particular structure adds nothing to the conversation. 

I look at it as the same way as a Bar Exam. If you pass, you are a lawyer, you are in. You fulfilled the same criteries as everybody else. 

It's gonna be a exteremly hard task to pass so many classes in less than 3 years anyways. So it would be exteremly rare. But if you can do it in a week, then no need for 4 years of college. You can just kickstar your career or do MSCS or whether. 

Most countries already allow for fast-tracking your degree. So this is just a step further but I am open to hear your arguments. You may not attend classes already and just ace exams, so why not just cut the added years and just hold general exams for BSCS so people can fast track their career if they want to?"

Oftentimes I find that the word seems to be used to deflect from someone's hypocrisy. To me, if you're going to make such accusations towards someone's morals, it's rather hypocritical if you're conveniently ignoring your own. Usually their argument on this is ""well, x is worse than y"" or ""it's easier to speak up about x because how can you survive under capitalism without consuming y"", etc.

I personally don't even consider somebody a mature adult until they're 25. 18-25 year olds are ""young adults"" to me. I'm only 26. Having just turned 20 is fresh in my memory.

Thus I am talking about US laws (both state and federal but I will only be mentioning federal as if a state has any competent false advertisement laws the companies that falsely advertise just won’t set up their HQ there).

Also, the FTC has on their page titled “Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road” that “Advertising must tell the truth and not mislead consumers”. The keyword there being “mislead”, not “lie to”.

Basically, there are many companies that are getting away with misleading, if not straight up lying to, consumers. I’m mainly focused on three different types of lying companies:

- Mobile game ads that show a completely different (popular) game, say you can make real money (showing hundreds of dollars being earned in seconds) by playing games, or literally lying saying it doesn’t require an internet connection when it does.
- All the fake health ads that show a video of random crap involving food, or the bedroom, or whatever is vaguely related to the topic while explaining that “everything you know about X is wrong”. They proceed to send you to a site where you need to watch yet another video (often titled that it’s a certain length when it’s much, much longer) and then try and make you buy a pill that does nothing.
- All the fake OBD2 “plug and drive” bullshit. That port does not affect your “gas mileage”, your “emissions”, etc.

All three of those have one thing in common. They have super long “terms and conditions” that make disclaimers and normally say you need to use arbitration.

The FTC includes this about general offers:

- “A claim can be misleading if relevant information is left out or if the claim implies something that's not true.”
- In addition, claims must be substantiated, especially when they concern health, safety, or performance.
- Disclaimers and disclosures must be clear and conspicuous. That is, consumers must be able to notice, read or hear, and understand the information. Still, a disclaimer or disclosure alone usually is not enough to remedy a false or deceptive claim.
- Demonstrations must show how the product will perform under normal use.

Thus all three groups I mentioned definitely falsely advertise. While I don’t know if it’s a lack of enforcement or a lack of a severe enough punishment but something needs to be done that makes companies that falsely advertise 
stop."

I never once received a penny from the state bureau that handles paying unemployment. I would only get $600 a week anyway, which is anemic in comparison to what I was making, and the fact that it takes this long to pay me my money is ridiculous. I had bills I had to pay, I had $0 in my account, and I'm told there's a backlog dating back to COVID. 

First things first, there needs to be payments automatically made instead of waiting months.

Second, the amount you receive should start off as your full wages, then diminish by 1% each week so that way to incentivize you to look for a job.

Another topic of the matter is that the same bureau that handles unemployment compensation should also handle whether or not a termination should be allowed.

Every termination, whether they're fired after a day, a month, a year or 40 years, needs to have sufficient documentation to substantiate. The concept of employment at-will still remains the same. You can still fire someone for any reason, but just saying ""you're not a good fit"" or ""this isn't working out"" needs to be substantiated.

Substantiate with the following:

* Document what specifically was causing employee to ""not work out."" Ex. attitude, hygeine should be documented, ditto with any KPI reports that indicate employee as cause.
* If they're terminated due to rule violations, cite the rule in your employee handbook and provide preponderance to the evidence that terminated employee violated said rule
* Termination due to punctuality/attendance can be substantiated by clock punches (or lack thereof)

If the unemployment bureau deems the reason/documentation to be insufficient or irrational in nature, they should have the authority to disallow the termination, putting the employee back on the payroll with back pay (if applicable)"

Regardless of the likelihood of bad things happening. And/or he’s suffering from mental health issues to no fault of his own.

We’re familiar with the stats. The actual rate of false rape allegations is only a mere 2%. Rape is the most underreported crime. Only 37% of rape victims end up reporting it to the police. Most victims stay silent out of shame, self-doubt and fear of retaliation. Out of 1000 SA perpetrators, a whopping 975 end up walking free. Sure, an accusation in itself (before any evidence has been presented) can be enough to destroy a man’s career, his social network and his self-esteem. But statistically speaking, that accusation is FAR more likely to have merit than to be false. So logically speaking, if a man has done his due diligence to be good, it is irrational for him to be so afraid of being falsely accused that he refrains from dating and sex altogether. Right?

But here’s the thing…Our bodies don’t logically respond to trauma. We are by nature emotional beings. Exceptional levels of stress can significantly alter the central nervous system and cause people to be irrationally afraid of certain people and situations. In many cases, all it takes is ONE bad experience with an awful person to develop lasting trauma. Most men are decent. Yet we don’t shame the women who regard men as being generally predatory and dangerous. Why? Because we understand they must have had an awful and unfair experience with men in their past  that led them to their current feelings. Instead, we empathize with them and take it as a reminder to respect their boundaries and not do anything to make them feel unsafe. So why do we as a society shame and alienate men who are most likely suffering from unresolved trauma?"

There are homophobic people yes. And I’m not talking about those ones. It’s cruel to hate another human. 

The ones I’m talking about are those that don’t hate homosexual people, but don’t particularly support that way of life. These kinds of people understand that even an homosexual person can be a great friend, father, mother, brother, sister etc, and respect them as a human. But they can choose to not support the homosexual way of life. 

And as long as these people are not a threat to life of homosexual people, to their life or wellbeing, then they shouldn’t be chastised. Their religion and their religion beliefs are their way of life, as much as homosexuality is the other person’s “way of life” (so to speak).

Respect goes both ways, so if the religious person respects them as a person, as a human, but just doesn’t support an homosexual way of life, we should also respect the religious person, even if we aren’t in support of their religious way of life."

Cooperative ownership of a workplace looks something like this: all workers in an enterprise hold a comparable, if not identical, stake in the enterprise. The distribution of profits is determined by worker vote. Sale of personally-held stakes *may* be subject to a vote, such that workers cannot independently sell their stake in an enterprise without permission from the enterprise.

In this way, democracy and cooperative ownership go hand-in-hand. To have one, you need the other. One of the problems this creates at the outset is that of conflicting interests between the worker roles in the enterprise, for example, the conflict of interest between supervisors and subordinates, or between sectors of an enterprise who overvalue their own work at the expense of others.

Democratic co-ops typically solve this problem by rotating workers voluntarily between roles. I'll spend some time talking about this because I consider it essential to the democratic cooperative model.

""Voluntary rotation"" looks something like this: if there are 90 manual jobs and 10 supervisory jobs, but 30 workers wish to take part in supervisory jobs, workers who volunteer for supervisory service are rotated between manual and supervisory roles such that they spend about 1/3rd of their time in supervisory service. Workers who are happy to hold a role for which there is not greater worker demand than slots to fill are not required to rotate out of it. And, of course, what roles exist and the details of how to fill them is determined democratically. There are several upshots to such a system. Here's three that come to mind:

1. workers are no longer defined by their specific job position, but by their individuality as people. You're no longer ""junior technician Carl"", you're ""Carl, who's good at such-and-such.""
2. workers gain holistic insight into the enterprise, enhancing solidarity, cohesion, creativity and empathy
3. workers are trained in several skills, increasing their value and autonomy and diversifying their workplace experience resulting in a more interesting work life

But voluntary rotation creates a concern about specialization: rotating people with no programming experience into programming positions would be a disaster. The danger of such a mistake is mitigated by the collective stake all workers have in the enterprise. Because absurd role allocations would harm everyone, everyone has a stake in preventing these.

A problem facing co-ops in the real world is competitiveness in both growth rate and specialized hiring against private totalitarian enterprises, which are the standard in the world today. This CMV presumes a ""magic wand"" solution that converts virtually all enterprises into co-ops overnight, such that competition against dictatorial enterprises is not a concern.

A problem facing democratic organization, not just of workplaces but in general, is the problem of critical mass. An organization with so many voters that none feel as though their vote matters can suffer from apathy and deliberative inefficiency, and ultimately recreate a quasi-oligarchic power structure (see modern liberal states). This is not so easily solved. If the sizes of co-ops were small enough to ensure every worker can meaningfully vote and contribute to deliberations, these enterprises may not be able to profit as effectively from economies of scale. I'm inclined to believe that the general social uplift of widespread democratic cooperative work will vastly outweigh whatever reduced productivity may come along with it. After all, we find ourselves today facing crises of *overproduction* more than underproduction.

My view could be changed by effective arguments that:

1. Democratic co-ops are so much more inefficient than private totalitarianism that the majority of us would find ourselves less able to meet our needs than we are now
2. Democratic co-ops are inherently unstable and will almost inevitably devolve into either the private totalitarianism we currently have, or something worse
3. Working at a democratic co-op actually sucks harder than working under private totalitarianism
4. Widespread democratic cooperative organization at work would exacerbate negative externalities (for example, climate change.)

My view is not concerned with, and so will not be changed by, arguments that:

1. There's a better way to organize labor than private totalitarianism *or* democratic co-ops (see: ""life would be *better*"")
2. The handful of extremely rich people who prefer the current system would be disenfranchised (see: ""the vast majority of us"")
3. Some enterprises cannot effectively function under the democratic co-op model (see: ""virtually all"")
4. Democratic co-ops cannot grow to see widespread adoption (see: ""magic wand solution"")"

Individual agency can also be complicated by the fact that humans are inherently social beings.  We tend to overlook our interconnectedness and prefer to create myths about individual success and accomplishment.  For example, just look at the iPhone: most people never even think about the fact that the core technology of an iPhone was actually developed by the military, funded by taxpayer dollars.  Every US citizen who paid taxes during a certain period of time basically invested in the iPhone, and on top of that there is an untold number of scientists, engineers, administrators, etc., all of which contributed in some way to the development of the iPhone.  There’s no logical reason why we can’t continue to trace the chain of contributions down to even the “lowest” levels, like the janitors who kept offices and labs clean, the food service workers who kept people fed, the sweatshop laborers who assembled the parts, the drivers who transported materials, etc.  If you actually take this into consideration, then the contribution of someone like Steve Jobs seems terribly overblown.

But it goes even deeper than just how we arrange material production.  On an existential level, every human being is just a reflection of the human beings around them.  Everything we have is given to us by others – our language, our symbols, our ideals, the models according to which we live our lives.  There is absolutely nothing about the individual that is sovereign, or rather the only sovereign act of the individual can be the self-sacrifice of individuality itself.  We all exist as mirrors in a massive hall of mirrors, and we all pretend that we emit light when all we really do is reflect light that comes from a source which nobody can identify, let alone own.

People might argue that even if I am correct in some abstract sense, it is still better for people to believe in individuality because with individuality comes individual responsibility and the ethics that follow.  I would argue that in reality the myth of individuality leads to atomization, and atomization leads to a complete lack of the only responsibility that matters: *collective* responsibility.  For example, think about how every individual is convinced that recycling matters; everyone identifies their individual responsibility for the environment as something that they can do as an individual, but even if every individual takes on that responsibility the environment is still going to be destroyed.  And we can’t just increase the moral responsibility of the individual so that everyone is responsible for protesting against politicians or corporations, because these people (politicians or corporate leaders) will also just tell you “we are just individuals, we don’t have that level of control”.  In reality, because we have bought so fully into the myth of individuality, we no longer have any political center that we can appeal to for some implementation of control.

I believe that the only solution is to embrace a completely radical form of collective identity, one which completely overrides common notions of individuality.  We need to treat each others’ accomplishments as our own, such that a janitor has the same sense of pride and accomplishment as a CEO.  We also need to treat each others’ moral failures as our own; we need to treat each others’ suffering as our own.  If one person has an ethical responsibility to do something good, then we all have the same responsibility.

One final point I would make is that I recognize how naïve it sounds to expect this new radical subjectivity to emerge.  Subjectivity itself is naturally a struggle rather than something settled; we are constantly trying to figure out who we are by balancing concepts like the individual against the collective.  But I think what has happened is that we are struggling to maintain our individuality *against* everything that would force us to conform.  This has always been the *easier* attitude to adopt, because it narrows the scope of our world and makes us feel more settled, like we are at the center of our own personal universe.  I would argue that the place to start is to reverse this struggle, such that we struggle to *overcome* our individuality in favor of recognizing our interconnectedness rather than suppressing it.  Individuality has always been the path of least resistance, but it’s time to start taking the more difficult path that leads beyond ourselves.

1,2023-10-05,cmv: You cannot be intellectually honest and be in favor of abortion only certain specific circumstances like abortion,u/AstridPeth_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/170ti5h/cmv_you_cannot_be_intellectually_honest_and_be_in/,changemyview,"I was reading a text in the WSJ about Rep. Nancy Mace. This piece found my eye:

>Voters in Mace’s wealthy coastal district tend to be fiscally conservative but more socially liberal, and Mace has made changing the way Republicans talk about abortion a priority. **While she said she opposes the procedure, she believes Republicans need to support exceptions, including for rape, incest and the life of the mother.** She has also been adamant that the party offer alternatives so there are fewer unwanted pregnancies, including access to birth control. 

There are two vectors in one opposition or defense of abortion: weeks of pregnancy and situation. To me it's clear that the value of human life is up to debate in the week vector: it's as intellectually honest to defend a zygote up to a 9-month fetus are or aren't worthy of protection. 

But it doesn't make sense at all to me to think abortion should be forbidden (and potentially be criminalized) at say, 20 weeks of pregnancy and say, ""but if it's rape, that's ok"". Either that is an admission that actually fetus is lesser of a life than an human being and less worthy of rights, or it's an admission that all humans aren't equal. Same goes to protect the rights of a mother.

Here in Brazil these are basically the situations here abortion is legal: rape, risk to the mother's life, and anencephalic fetus. I understand our Supreme Court making this decision: they aren't the legislative, Congress decided that abortion is crime, and they need to make compromises that aren't intellectually honest (as they do most of the time, jurists aren't intellectually honest)

For me, I am pro-abortion up to a date, that I don't know. 6 months or whatever, whenever the fetus is ready to be viable without the mother. I think that the fetus is lesser than an actual human being, but that's me. But to me, particularly as a legislator, you're being intellectually dishonest saying that abortion is bad, but not if it's to save the mother's life.

In any other situation it'd be legal to kill someone to save another live, even if by not killing, you end up with two deaths. Imagine a scenario where there is a cave, a very slim person inside, and a fat man stuck in the only entrance to the cave. There's no way to remove the fat man without killing him. No one would think that one should kill the man to save the slim person that would fit through the passage. The only way you can think abortion in case of risk to the mother's live is ok, it's if you think the fetus is lesser than the mother.

I'm not dunking on Mace here. Perhaps she's pro-choice but can't say aloud to keep getting re-elected. Perhaps she prefers fiscal austerity more than rights to women, idk, that's her right to make compromises."

Plan: pay people to give birth. Not just paying to raise kids, this is a separate payment for the actual pregnancy and giving birth. (I've written this from an american standpoint, but I actually think its a plan that would work better for countries like China/Korea, who need it more and arent relying on immigration)

Market economies reward people for their work (in theory) with money. But they fail to reward people for doing the very very important work of carrying, birthing, and raising babies. So, if given the option, most women stop doing that stuff. Within a capitalist or welfare-capitalist system, you have a few choices

* provide payment for this work. Kindergelt, UBI for kids, or even just flat-out pay for ""birth mother"" as type of employment. (this would include payments not in ""money"", but in access to free childcare or food, for example).
*  enslave or partially enslave women, force them to preform this work for free (either directly, taliban style, or indirectly, by preventing them from participating in the paid workforce)
*  keep entire countries/populations poor, so they keep having children for free, and import their best and brightest as immigrants

Of these options, the first one seems like the best choice by far.   
  
I think theres some resistance to this idea because we don't like the idea of counting ""giving birth"" as quantifiable market ""work"" (raising kids as ""work"" is somewhat more acceptable, though theres still some resistance.) But from a personal and economic standpoint, it absolutely is! Dangerous work, too— easily up there with high-mortality jobs like logging and working on oil rigs. It can and I suspect \*will\*, be subject to capitalism-- I'd rather have it out in the open than hidden in ""adoption fees"" to poor countries

This plan focuses primarily on paying people for *giving birth* (or carrying a baby if it miscarries, I guess), since that's where the bottleneck is. paying for raising children is alright as well, but it can be done through a much wider range of methods, by a much wider range of people. The population able to actually carry a pregnancy is the limiting factor. 

Some objections I can think of

* **We have already tried paying people for having children.** no we havent. We've tried making childraising/birthing *cheaper*, no one has tried making it actually *pay money, as a job.*
* **wont that be super expensive?** not more expensive than running out of kids. I figure we ramp up the prices slowly until we reach stable birth rates-- depending on where we reach equilibrium, it might require some serious restructuring of the economy
* **Women will have a bunch of crack-babies to get money:** this is why I think it should be done openly-- so it can be regulated and given mandatory pre-natal care etc. You don't get paid if you drink, take drugs etc. Pay enough that non-crackheads are willing to do it. 
* **Who will take care of them?** Adoption demand for newborns is already very high-- that should cover most of it. I would also bundle this with a lot of really good welfare for people raising kids-- whether or not theyre the same people who gave birth, coupled with very very good open adoption policies. That should handle it.
* **people wont want to give birth even if you pay them** sure they will. Surrogacy is pretty common. Presumably different people have different levels of reluctance, so you just need to find a level where it reaches equilibrium in finding enough people willing to have babies. Rough estimate, somewhere in the range of a 100-200k per kid in a developed country.

1,2023-10-05,"CMV: Chinese languages/varieties (漢語/汉语/中文), especially Mandarin and Cantonese, don't have what they take to be potentially dominant, universal, or widely used languages worldwide, especially in writing, text, and speech",u/gho87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1710qfa/cmv_chinese_languagesvarieties_漢語汉语中文_especially/,changemyview,"Sure, the Mandarin language has been spoken by 1.5 or 1.8 billion people, but most of them reside in the mainland China... and Taiwan... and Singapore. Outside those areas, it's not widely spoken. Maybe Indonesia, Malaysia, or Vietnam, but those countries haven't officiated any Chinese language variety (漢語/汉语/中文) yet, and I don't see that happening in the future.

Despite big numbers in mainland China and Taiwan, I don't think Cantonese, Taiwanese or any other Minnan dialect, Hakka, Shanghaiese or any other Wu dialect, or any other Chinese language variety can compete with Mandarin language to become universal, dominant, or prevalent languages in the way that... English is.

First of all, I don't think many youngsters are interested in learning Chinese... or Mandarin, especially in colleges or high schools. In college, students must enroll in such courses to learn the language, but then there are other languages for them to learn. Learning the language becomes an option.

In courses, students were taught basic greetings, grammar, and whatever. However, as a student, I had a difficulty remembering how the languages grammar works.

Second, the written language itself isn't easy to write or understand, especially by locals themselves.... unless you're an artist who can see words as pictures or drawings?

The Written Chinese was somewhat dumbed down simply by... turning from Traditional Chinese (漢語) to Simplified Chinese (汉语) in mainland China. Of course, Simplified Chinese is useful especially to illiterate people, but I can't help wonder whether it helps the Mandarin language be the most feared language to learn. Actually, I don't think Simplified Chinese is enough to make most non-Chinese people interested in the language. Rather recent politics make the language one of languages to avoid, methinks.

Furthermore, hearing the language verbally isn't easy either. To learn or understand what one person is saying or singing in Mandarin, Chinese text is also needed. Chinese subtitles have been frequently used in Chinese-language media, especially in the 21st century. Of course, Closed Captioned system doesn't technically support Written Chinese. Rather some system to show subtitles has been used.

Third, I have recently read that Chinese language [hasn't been neutral very much](https://www.aiatranslations.com/amp/is-chinese-really-set-to-become-the-dominant-language-of-the-internet). The author who wrote the article about the language's potential admitted that locals seek English language as alternative to their native yet non-neutral language, especially on internet, and that even English is an appealing universal language, despite predictions about the US and the UK.

Fourth, transliterating (or romanizing) the language isn't easy either, even with pinyin as more used transliteration system than any other. Sometimes, those reluctant to learn the language make fun of it, especially by intentionally mispronouncing it.

If pinyin replaces Written Chinese as a way to write Chinese, then meaning would be potentially lost.

Look at the Vietnamese language: chu nom ([字字]喃) was replaced by Vietnamese alphabets in early 20th century. (Oh wait, the French colonists banned chu nom from being taught and made the language latin-ized.) I couldn't understand the modern Vietnamese language and couldn't figure out the deeper meaning of the language until I discovered that the Vietnamese language was heavily dependent on the writing system influenced by Written Chinese before the colonist era.

Fifth, even Koreans and Vietnamese no longer have used Chinese-based writing systems, Hanja and (again) chu nom, (in my opinion) hampering the Written Chinese's potential to be an influential and dominant language system. It also affected the Chinese varieties' potentials as well to imperialize the language geographically or act like a domino effect to other neighboring countries.

Even the Japanese writing system doesn't fully use Written Chinese but rather mix Chinese words and scribbled native ones (hiragana and katakana) simply as a way to communicate their own language.

Sixth, culturally, the Chinese songs, animated materials, movies (except kung fu and *Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon*), etc. don't have global potential in the way that Japanese ones and Korean ones do. Not to mention American and British pop culture. Furthermore, many Hong Kong (and certain Taiwanese ones) songs, especially ones before 21st century, were derivatives of Japanese ones. I don't know whether international Chinese stars and directors count, but I've yet to see a successful global Chinese singer attracting Western listeners.

Seventh... well, I don't know whether there is seventh. I might wanna include purging or execution of intellectuals from centuries or millenia ago, yet Chinese languages still have survived. However, I wonder whether those intellectuals would've made the Written Chinese a stronger universal language, yet they came from one of eras when Classical Chinese was highly prominent. But that's my guess about intellectuals.

I welcome different opinions, but I don't know whether they can change my mind about obstacles to the language."

There are several reasons why it would be better, IMHO, for many people to win a smaller prize than for one person to win a huge prize:

&#x200B;

First off, at a certain point, having more money doesn't make much difference. If you win $1.5 billion, your life is ludicrously rich, just as if you won ""only"" $500 million. The extra billion makes almost no practical difference.

Secondly, by spreading out the wealth this way, many more families would benefit. If 150 families, or people, could become greatly wealthier, that would be better for society as a whole than if only one person won.

Thirdly, this increases interest and allure for the lottery. It's not as exciting to play the lottery when you hear that your chances of winning are 1 in 200 million or something like that. But if the odds were, say, ""1 in a million,"" that becomes more believable and hope-able (although still, of course, super low.)

Fourthly, this makes things safer for the lottery winner. When only one lucky guy wins the $1.5 billion Powerball, he has a bulls-eye painted on his back for the rest of his life (especially if he's in a state that does not allow anonymity.) But if 150 people each win a big prize, the fame is greatly diluted and each person gets much less attention (and hence, threat and danger.)

Fifthly, even though the Powerball has million-dollar prizes, a prize of $10 million is much more of a life-changer. A million-dollar prize alone in itself, after taxes are taken out, may not let you retire, but anyone who wins a $10 million prize (even if it's ""only"" $4 million after you take the lump sum and taxes.) You can send your kids to any vacation or grad school, go on any vacation, buy a house of almost kind of you want, retire for life, etc.

&#x200B;

So, of course, the question would be, how do you do this? I propose that, instead of drawing one lucky number to win the grand prize (be it $1 billion or whatever,) the Powerball should draw as many numbers as there are multiples of $10 million. So, for instance, if there is $800 million in the pot, the Powerball should draw 80 lucky numbers."

***Art is incredibly important to society***: Humans have been making art for about as long as we have existed. Art, music, writing, and other forms of media give meaning to peoples lives and is incredibly important to societal wellbeing. 

***Creation process is key to meaning in art***: I also believe that meaning is fundamentally tied to the *human* thought, effort, purpose, and emotion that is put into the process of creating art. I believe that AI guts all of this, and therefore devalues the ""art"" that is produces. 

***AI in Social Media:*** I also believe that AI is going to get more and more attention/likes on social media as it improves. Soon, unless companies start heavily implementing alerts, its going to be hard to tell the difference between a real photograph or an AI one, or a real painting or a fake one. I believe that this will be disorientating, suppress real human content creators, and reduce meaning in our lives.

***AI in Music***:  I believe a similar thing will happen with music, because AI models will get better at predicting what people like in music and create songs that will mathematically appeal to peoples interests. this will also make it harder for real people writing real songs to become popular/garner attention.

I heard a rumour, which I'm not sure it's true, that there's going to be a live action How To Train Your Dragon and Astrid,  a white female viking character, were going to make her a black character. Some were upset, including me, because there aren't ever any black vikings (I'm not sure, correct me if I'm wrong.) and some girls who liked Astrid because they looked like her were also upset. 

Blackwashing a character isn't going to solve the less amount of POC representations on TV. Making a new characters is more of a proper way to do it. More TV shows and movies are doing it and it's brilliant!

Now some may argue that POC have years of enduring offensive misrepresentation instead of white people, but it's still racist. Why would you want to repeat the mistakes of history? Why would you want to cover up a different character's race because there's a lack of representation?  That's just blatant racism. 

I'm tired of people telling me blackwashing doesn't exist, but it does! Genshin Impact is a game full of light and pale skin characters. People complained that there's no black representation or tanner skin characters but it's an Asian game, full of Asian characters! Which was made by a Chinese company! (I don't play Genshin Impact, so correct me if I'm wrong.) People 'fixed' some of the characters by making them black which it's right!

Equal rights mean equal rights! Discrimination to anyone is still damn wrong! We all want a fair, inclusive society. Not bigoted people, or people who desperately want only Non-white people. I understand where most of the people are coming from and I would be willing to see both sides of the argument but it kinda rude and upsetting when people wouldn't hear me out of call me racist and a white bitch. (I'm not white.) 

Every race and ethnicity deserves every same amount of respect, care and sensitivity! 

Thank you.

1,2023-10-06,"CMV: when someone asks how far away something is, it’s more efficient to answer them with the duration of the journey instead of with the distance to their destination.",u/newadventures96,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17185uy/cmv_when_someone_asks_how_far_away_something_is/,changemyview,"I had this argument with a foreign friend. He pointed out that outside of the US, if he asked another person how far away the library was, that person would answer with a specific distance. But in the US, when he asks how far away the library is, that person would answer with the duration of the journey. He said that we’re dumb, and the most specific answer is the distance, therefore distance is the most correct. He said the rest of the world can’t be wrong if we’re the only ones doing it. I think that logic is flawed. If that were true in all cases, innovation wouldn’t exist. 

Illustrations of the difference when asking the question, “how far away is the library?”

Outside of the US: “The library is about 2 miles away.”

In the US: “The library is about 15 minutes by car, or 20 minutes by bike.” 

While he’s right, to answer in miles (or whatever) is more *specific,* it isn’t necessary the *clearest.* You have to consider the intent of a question in order to come up with the best answer. When someone asks “how far away is x,” most often they are asking prior to planning a journey to said place. Other variables come into play, like traffic, construction, delays, crossings, speed, etc. Answering with a specific distance won’t satisfy the intent behind the question. Someone might be able to do the math in their head to come up with how long it might take to get from A to B if you give them the distance, but they also might not have all the data, hence asking “how far away is X,” in the first place. 

By giving the duration of the journey, you’re giving a clearer and more complete answer. Yes, the rest of the world doesn’t do this. However, I think this is one of the few times the US does something better. Our other systems of measure are completely back asswards, but this one makes sense to me."
1,2023-10-06,CMV: There should be a cap on residential real estate ownership.,u/BrokkenArrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1718dex/cmv_there_should_be_a_cap_on_residential_real/,changemyview,"This post is just about residential real estate (i.e. homes, houses, apartments etc), not commercial real estate. 

Basically, it's a fuckload harder for young people to buy a house today (disclaimer: I own multiple houses myself and am very conflicted about it). Prices are magnitudes higher than they've been in past decades, and after years of underbuilding, housing stock is also low. 

There should be a cap on how many residential properties individuals can own (not sure what the right number would be but let’s say two properties is enough for anyone.) 

There should also just be a blanket ban on investment firms buying up residential real estate. It’s hard enough to find a house without pools of capital in the hundreds of millions dedicated to vacuuming up all the available homes for some greedy fund manager.

Homes are, I think, unique in their value to a person, and in their ability to secure their financial future (you can invest in your own life rather than in some landlord’s). It’s fundamentally unfair that some people (and I include myself in this) can buy up a bunch of houses, making it nearly impossible for others to even get one."

Through editing the human genome, enhancing positive genetic traits, implementing positive genetics into subjects that lack it and eliminating negative genetics could theoretically advance the human species into transcendence. Turning ourselves into a superior form of our old selves. We could  become resistant to disease, be emotionally and intellectually supreme, physically craft ourselves into super athletes and so much more. This could also bring an end to silly things that divide humans like religion, ideology, race, ethnicity etc and unite humanity once and for all. If the human species continues in the trajectory it currently is we will undoubtedly send ourselves and the rest of the planet into a great extinction event. Poor human behavior and genetics are a huge reason for this. Human genetic enhancement is the key to true liberation for ourselves and our planet. Cybernetics could also be a valuable tool and if our minds become transcendent we could theoretically eliminate the need for advanced AI and that threat as well. Illogical current human morality should not get in the way of the advancement of the human species and I don’t understand why logically human genetic enhancement is widely outlawed around the world. In China a scientist created human embryo that we’re immune to HIV and was given 3 years in prison as a result. I am convinced that a lot of the world governments fear this technology and it’s possible influence and challenge to the status quo. Recently the human genome has finally been fully mapped, it’s time to use it to our advantage."
1,2023-10-06,"CMV: Life is counter-entropic, replication is entropic",u/noxbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1718jfs/cmv_life_is_counterentropic_replication_is/,changemyview,"I created this thread https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zh3al/cmv\_life\_is\_primarily\_about\_self\_preservation\_not/   
2 days ago but I wanted to refine my argument a bit in new terms.

  
Basically my idea of self preservation boils down to is that it's about entropy. Self preservation is a counter-entropic force and replication is an entropic force. But the key thing is that the only replicated biology that survives is the counter-entropic forms that are able to sustain themselves. But because replication (and by extension the biology) creates entropic side effects, as well as the universe itself, the self preservation counter-entropic biology selects for all the processes that can counter that entropy. And that's why life could said in this way to be about self preservation first, and then replication is the universe creating entropy that is to be selected for.  
  
The organism then is an accumulation of counter-entropic processes to sustain itself, while the genes are the entropic force that created the diversity and different iterations.  
My main argument is that no organism-level processes can be primarily entropic. Because those will die out and not be able to sustain themselves, so only the self preservatory processes are the ones that are replicated.   
  
The other thing which is super speculative, but also part of the intuition, is about how life started. Now my intuition was that however it started, it had to have been a counter-entropic process, and not an entropic one (like replication). And then whatever that force is, it discovered replication which then bootstrapped the whole thing. It's way more important \_what\_ gets replicated, rather than the replication itself. Replicating a counter-entropic / self reinforcing/sustaining process is the real ""juice"" as far as my intuition goes.  
  
Also finally, in the earlier thread I didn't have enough time to process the responses, which were all great, but it made me realize we were discussing the entropic side effects of life vs the counter-entropic forces, but not making a distinction between the two.  
The reason human life is complicated is because a lot of the things we do and produce are entropic, but we are inherently counter-entropic and have to always make that balance. Like if we create a technology to solve an illness (illness is entropic), then the technology itself is counter-entropic (its goal), but the side effects can be entropic (not intended by us). And so any introduction of new technology creates entropic side effects, and our brains are complex enough that we have to take all that into consideration in a way other animals can't and don't. But I'll refer to the other thread for all the other arguments, if you're interested, regarding the social/cultural issues, don't want to repeat them here."
1,2023-10-06,CMV: School should not teach life skills,u/Sharklo22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1718u74/cmv_school_should_not_teach_life_skills/,changemyview,"The idea that school should teach useful life skills, like filing taxes, home budgeting, even cooking (in the school kitchen, as you do), rather than useless abstract knowledge seems to me relatively widespread. 

I am here to be convinced that this is not, in fact, a terrible idea. 

My points are as follows. 

These are generally not skills proper, they are methods. The proponents of what I'll now call ""life school"" usually list punctual tasks as skills to learn, such as filing taxes (one I see very often). This is not a skill; assuming you have been taught to file taxes in year 2023, nothing guarantees you'll still be able to do it by 2030, 2040, 2070... It is also very unlikely that this will be useful if you decide to work abroad, or if you switch states, or if your fiscal situation is very particular. 

An obvious rebuttal to this is to say ""yes but there are some common principles you can learn by example, even if the process is not universal"". Indeed there are common principles to taxation, such as progressive rates. But these are already taught, it is called a piecewise affine function and taught in Mathematics. Or maybe tax rebates. Well, these are often used as a tool to direct the economy or individual behaviours, and I would be very surprised if they are not mentioned once in History classes. 

So, in fact, the common principles are already taught. What is not taught is the practicalities: do you go on a website, do you print a form and send it, to where, what do you put on it precisely, what does this acronym mean?

Practicalities are very inefficient to teach. There is a great deal of minute details in every practical aspect of life, especially administration. You can of course restrain the ones taught to those pertinent to the most common cases (say a couple with one child earning wages), but then a single mother with two children, free-lance revenues on the side, health expenses and a dependent parent is back to square one, and has wasted time in school to learn practically useless methods, instead of advancing her reading comprehension so she can understand the information she needs. 

**TL;DR** 
Without listing all life ""skills"" commonly advocated for in teaching by life skill proponents, I'll conclude by saying that school already teaches most useful common principles to those, and that teaching these ""skills"" would either be extremely lacklustre, or it would take an inordinate amount of time at the detriment of actually useful intellectual advancement like reading comprehension or rigour in arithmetic."

1,2023-10-06,"CMV: Event tickets should be sold via single price auctions (like US Treasuries) to guarantee a market clearing price, deter scalpers, and eliminate bots and queues from the process.",u/acvdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/171bu3h/cmv_event_tickets_should_be_sold_via_single_price/,changemyview,"I believe that the best way to sell, eg hot concert tickets would be a to use a single price auction, similar to how US Treasuries are sold. In this system everyone would have a reasonable amount of time to enter their bid for a particular type of ticket, and then the bid for the last available ticket would set the price for all of them.

So for example, if there were 20,000 floor tickets to a concert, the top 20,000 bids would get a ticket at the price of whatever the 20,000th highest bid was.

This means that the people who are willing to pay the most get tickets at the market clearing price. There would be a very limited secondary market because all of the people who are willing to pay the most for tickets would already have one. Those willing to pay less wouldn’t then go buy them on the secondary market.

In addition, it would maximize revenue for the event due to it allocating tickets to those willing to pay the most and recapture all of the (economic) rent from any secondary market dealers.

It would also avoid things like waiting in real or virtual queues, bots, lotteries, and websites getting overwhelmed because there’s no reason you couldn’t have several days to enter your bid.

The only downside of this that I can see is that some people would no longer end up with below market value tickets through essentially sheer luck, but ultimately a lottery based economic system is not good because it is inefficient and enables rent seeking."

1,2023-10-06,CMV: All schools should have school uniforms.,u/Character_Safety6719,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/171ct9a/cmv_all_schools_should_have_school_uniforms/,changemyview,"By school, I refer to any educational institution where there is typically an educator, who educates the student in a classroom (not lecture) setting. Therefore, you can take this to apply to any institution before university (i.e. secondary school, junior college etc)

The reasoning for this is

1. It promotes a sense of common identity, because you all wear the same dress, thus, you foster school camaderie.
2. In public settings, it is far easier to identify troublemakers or students playing truant wearing the school uniform, and subsequently complain to the school or relevant authorities (particularly if a crime or misdenamour has been committed) in order to *identify* them and subsequently *rectify* behavior. I admit that this can be allievated by simply changing out of the uniform, however, to some extent it does provide an addition hurdle to such behaviour.
3. Uniforms prevent, or at least alleviate, bullying and the class divide--it's far harder to bully someone for the uniform choice (while still possible) than for not wearing a branded shirt, for instance. This is made more prominent by the fact that one's shirt or pants etc is on a far more visible area and is hence a larger target for mockery. This could be extended to standardising shoe brands or banning branded shoes.

Let's talk about common arguments against uniforms and standardised clothing

1. Freedom of self expression: I should be able to wear what I like.
2. Uniforms promote conformity and dissuade invididuality(an extension of point 1)

a) You can express yourself (which is a primarily artistic decission) outside of class, in your own free time. By definition, you are in school to learn, not express your inner artistic style/thoughts/anything like that.

b)Conformity is not bad in and of itself. Let us assume that one of the primary goals of school is to prepare a student for the workplace/adult life. In adult life, you have to dress professionally at work--after a certain style, following a certain dress code. Even if you believe that this dress code is restrictive and should/will be abolished, if it *were* to be abolished, transitioning from a formal to informal dress code is far easier than the opposite.

3. School uniforms are excessively costly. Due to this cost, nepotism/favouritism can occur where school uniform

This is actually the only legitamate argument I have heard of so far. let's analyse this on two tiers

a) This cost can and should be subsidised by the educational district--it is implausible that there are no financial aid schemes to help students with the cost of uniforms, books etc.

b) It is not actually more costly to buy a school uniform, considering that 1) these clothes are likely to be worn over a long period of time--6 years for primary school, for instance--and therefore will be used to the fullest extent and 2) Assuming that there is no insane markup on school uniforms, which either the free market or governmental regulations should control for, there is no functional difference between buying a school uniform to wear to school and buying casual clothes to wear to school.

Let's talk about nepotism and profits on school uniforms

a) Again, government control and whistleblowing: if the contract was not made public to all stakeholders and fairly considered, one can report it to the school.

  
b) If the level of governmental control is so low that you can't even enforce antitrust and antimonopoly laws, ensuring market fairness, then it is unlikely that the government would have the similar amount of control to implement mandatory school uniforms.

c) School districts/cities/provinces etc can institute mass-bidding for a particular grouping of contracts to produce school uniforms, condensing it into 1 or 2 large contract biddings. Therefore, by the directive of the free market, if we accept the premise that every company will want to gain a contract (since it is profitable for them), then they will bid for it, driving prices down. If there is collusion to ensure only 1 guy (i.e. a friend/family of the mayor or whatever) gets the contract, these companies have an incentive to sue to 1) weaken rivals and 2) secure the profit.

TLDR: mandatory school uniforms pls

Archaeologists have found abundant evidence that creatures similar to these really existed. Even today there are some dragon-like creatures such as Komodo dragons, gila monsters, giant snakes, and crocodiles. But in the past, there were truly giant reptiles, some of which had wings and maybe even feathers.

This is an educated guess of what a pteranodon looked like: 

[https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/museum/public/ingensmount.html](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/museum/public/ingensmount.html)

How is this creature objectively different from a dragon?

Or this creature with an incredible 40-foot wingspan, aptly named Quetzalcoatlus?

[https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/12/07/fleshing-out-the-bones-of-quetzalcoatlus-earths-largest-flier-ever](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/12/07/fleshing-out-the-bones-of-quetzalcoatlus-earths-largest-flier-ever)

It is probable that our ancestors had some knowledge of these creatures. In China, dinosaur fossils were often referred to as 'dragon bones'. The fossils of pterosaurs, winged dinosaur-like creatures, have been found on multiple different continents. 

To change my view, you would have to convince me that there is no animal, living or extinct, that could be accurately characterized as a 'dragon'... or that the fact that dragons existed was *not* part of the reason that dragon myths are so ubiquitous.

1. Bans adblockers.

2. Gives you a way to avoid the advertisements.

Given that these companies are providing you a service, it's entirely moral for them to demand that they in return receive some value from you as a user. So, if they provide it to you for free and demand that you provide value by watching ads, I don't see how it's immoral.

If the ads are unacceptable, there's almost always the option of paying in good old-fashioned money instead of your time. Or not using the service.

Now, I get it. I use adblockers too. I would really rather not have to watch ads or pay. It's not in my interest if companies block adblockers. But I recognise that they have every moral right to do so (and legal right if they made adblockers against their TOS, which YouTube has).

It's asinine to me that people would consider banning adblocks so a moral evil, *especially* when they currently provide no value to the company. Am I insane? Is there some angle I'm missing? Why is it evil of a company to demand that users provide something of value to them in exchange for use of their services?"

""Citizens with economically left-wing and culturally right-wing views vote less and are less satisfied with politics""..

I can imagine there are working class people out there who who support healthcare, taking care of the elderly, social support etc. Perhaps even being straight up anti-capitalist, which can be argued to be bad for rural areas and encourage stuff like prostitution and big corporations rather than local businesses passed on from father to son. Yet these same people might hold culturally conservative views, like being again abortion and being proud of their nation without being accused of being nationalists or racists.

I don't think these views are niche at all. In fact you could argue this is one of the most common views worldwide. The west is not very religious, but the rest of the world is, combined with strong healthcare being viewed positively in most nation. I think the average person dislikes communism from a standpoint of terrible authortiarian things like the Holodomor and state atheism - they don't like socialism from an economic standpoint. 

As I write this I think it would make sense for Christians, Jews and Muslims to be socialist economically, but conservative culturally and socially. Hmm.

Anyway, I think there is a lack of meaningful parties that can appeal to the description described above in the Western world.

But curiously, the vast majority of these people fall silent when suicidal people advocate for the legally codified right to the most fundamental form of bodily autonomy that there is - the right to decide that life is not worth the cost of maintaining it.

I am defining the ""legally codified right to suicide"" as the legal right to obtain access to an effective and reasonably painless and dignified method of suicide, free from government intervention. This doesn't necessarily entail that the government has a positive obligation to provide me with the means to suicide, it just means that it wouldn't have the power to interfere with my ability to obtain these means from a source that was willing to provide it. So examples of this could include being able to buy chemicals online, or better still, use an 'exit booth' specifically designed for the purpose of enabling a painless and risk-free suicide through the means of inert gas asphyxiation. It is my contention that all of the arguments commonly used to support the right to an abortion on the grounds of bodily autonomy should also logically apply to suicide, and in many cases, lend even stronger support to the right to die than they do to abortion. I also intend to demonstrate why the arguments used against suicide could also be applied to the case of abortion. I will conclude by showing that people who call themselves 'pro-choice' but against the right to die (or support the right to die only in fringe cases such as terminal illness) can be regarded as equally as Draconian and regressive in their views towards suicide as the most illiberal opponents of abortion are on that subject. So let's consider some of these arguments.

* *Denying a woman the right to an abortion forces her to use body for something that she does not consent to. Forcing her to give birth makes her a reproductive slave.*

A living person has needs and desires which they have to exert effort in order to fulfil, without any guarantee that they will ever be fulfilled to an extent that this individual deems to be acceptable. To deny a person the right to suicide forces them to continue to work towards satisfying needs and desires, and suffer the consequences of failing to have these adequately satisfied. To prevent me from committing suicide makes me a slave in the most fundamental sense of the word, as all of the effort that I will have to expend in order to keep my needs and desires satisfied could have been avoided if I had been allowed the right to die. 

**Why this line of argument more strongly supports the right to die than the right to abortion:**

If forcing a woman to carry her pregnancy through to term enslaves her, then it enslaves her for the 9 months of the pregnancy (and there may also be lasting physical impacts of the abortion which extend beyond the birth of the baby). To deny someone the right to suicide makes them a slave for the entire duration of their life beyond the point where they have requested to be allowed to die; as none of the things that they have to do to maintain their life beyond that point are being done to serve their own interests, but rather to satisfy the implacable demands of society that they continue to live. Moreover, in the majority of cases where an abortion is sought, the pregnant woman has knowingly and consensually engaged in activities that she knows may carry the risk of procreation, whereas nobody came into existence because of a decision that they willingly and consensually made - all of us came into existence without our consent. Therefore, there is a stronger argument for being allowed to extricate oneself from a situation that one was entered into without one's knowledge or consent, than there is to be allowed to extricate oneself from a situation one found oneself in as a result of deliberate risk-taking behaviour. This can be considered akin to the legal protections that you would have in the event that you signed a contract after reading all the terms and conditions versus a situation where either your signature was forged on the contract, or you signed the contract, but without being given access to the terms and conditions beforehand.

Additionally, when a woman makes the decision to abort, she makes a decision that kills another entity (albeit an entity with debatable moral standing). A person who commits suicide does not make a decision on behalf of any entity other than oneself. 

* *To ban abortion prodecures is to police the womb of a woman*

To ban substances from purchase on the grounds that they can be used for suicide is to police what private individuals are allowed to put inside their body.

* *People already have the right to commit suicide. They commit suicide all the time without being stopped. You just don't have the right to have someone help you.*

Prior to the laws being changed to allow abortions to occur in a medical setting, women got abortions all the time in back alley procedures by practitioners without medical qualifications. As a result, a high number of these abortions had undesirable consequences for the woman, and everything had to be concealed from the view of law enforcement authorities. Similarly, people have gotten away with suicide without the authorities having somehow been alerted in time to prevent the suicide. But successful suicides form a tiny minority of the outcome of suicide attempts. In many cases where suicide has failed, there is an extremely undesirable outcome for the person who has attempted, and no legal recourse to escape the irrevocable consequences of the failed suicide. For example: [https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/26/mums-heartbreaking-photos-of-son-starved-of-oxygen-after-suicide-attempt-7028654/](https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/26/mums-heartbreaking-photos-of-son-starved-of-oxygen-after-suicide-attempt-7028654/)

To date, I have yet to come across someone who considers themselves ""pro-choice"" on the issue of abortion who would be content to apply the same standards to abortion as they would to suicide. On the subject of abortion, no ""pro-choicer"" would ever venture the argument that, as long as a woman can somehow manage to find access a wire coathanger, then this means that they have a ""right to abortion"". But yet, many people seem to think that the fact that a tiny minority of suicide-attempters have succeeded in their attempt to end their life, constitutes a ""right to suicide"" and therefore there is no reason to codify anything into law to explicitly establish suicide as a human right.

**Why this argument lends even stronger support to the right to die than it does for abortion:**

Whilst abortion in many cases requires surgical intervention (i.e. in cases where pills alone are not sufficient), suicide can be completed without anyone directly being involved in the procedure by permitting access to effective suicide methods that do not require another party to administer them. The best example of this is Philip Nitschke's Sarco pod: https://www.exitinternational.net/sarco/

* *Anti abortion laws relegate women to the status of second class citizens*

If one takes the arguments of abortion opponents on their face,  their rationale for opposing abortion is to protect the life of the defenceless entity inside the womb of the pregnant woman, and taking away the woman's right to choose is simply the unfortunate price that has to be paid in order to protect that life. This doesn't necessarily entail that those who oppose abortion (many of whom are themselves women) see women as a class of people unworthy of bodily autonomy rights; they simply believe that the woman's bodily autonomy rights don't extend to being allowed to terminate the life of another human entity, even one that is being incubated inside the womb of that woman.

**How this argument lends stronger support the right to suicide:**

People who are suicidal are automatically deemed to be incapable of making rational judgements concerning their own welfare. And instead of temporarily giving suicidal people time to reflect on their decision before permitting them access to the means by which to end their life, there is currently **no** legal pathway by which one may obtain access to an effective suicide method (i.e. one that doesn't carry with it heavy risks of failure and doesn't inflict unnecessary pain during the process) unless one lives in a country with legalised assisted suicide, **and** happens to fit into the very narrow list of criteria whereby they would be eligible for the procedure.

There is **no** process whereby someone can contest the claims of the authority that they are mentally incapable of making this decision for themselves. Although suicide opponents frequently cite the purportedly high proportion of suicide attempts that were precipitated by an impulse or an acute state of crisis; they **do not** seem to be willing to entertain any kind of a compromise whereby the government is allowed to intervene in the initial attempt and temporarily block access to effective suicide methods, in order to reduce these impulsive suicides and ensure that those who do go through with suicide are more likely to have had a settled and longstanding will to do so. They **do not** tend to support any kind of process whereby a suicidal person might have the right to contest the summary presumption of mental incapacity. The argument concerning impulsivity is therefore a fig leaf for imposing their ideological views on a defenceless victim. A mature adult who has been unwaveringly suicidal for 30 years gets exactly the same suicide prevention schemes thrust upon them against their will as a teenager who has been suicidal since breaking up with his girlfriend last Tuesday, but was fine before that. 

Across mainstream media, women are allowed a platform to advocate for why they should have the right to an abortion. However, there is no mainstream media publication that seems to be willing to afford any such platform to suicidal individuals to advocate for their right to die, unless they happen to  fit the very narrow and circumscribed list of criteria wherein there is demonstrable broad public support for an assisted dying law. Instead, what we have is mainstream publications (even ones considered to be progressive) such as the New York Times ([https://archive.ph/PUGSo](https://archive.ph/PUGSo)) promoting nanny state suicide prevention schemes, without permitting suicidal people any form of a right to reply, deliberately choosing only to seek out the voices of suicidal or formerly suicidal people who advocate for paternalistic suicide prevention laws. If you compare and contrast this to the case of abortion, not even the most far-right publications would dare to systematically deny women the right to weigh in on a matter that intimately pertains to their bodily rights.

If this isn't relegating a group of people to the status of second class citizens (not even being allowed the right to advocate for yourself and overturn a summary judgement that was based on prejudicial assumptions), then I don't know what could possibly be. 

* *Humans have a fundamental survival instinct. Therefore, if someone fails to obey this, this is proof that they aren't in the right frame of mind to be able to make any kind of major life decisions for themselves.*

This is an argument against suicide that commonly comes up in the debate, and takes a teleological perspective; whereupon the *telos* of the survival instinct is to serve our rational self interests by motivating us to preserve our lives.

**Why this argument is fallacious, and at any rate, could also be used to oppose the right to abortion:**

Firstly, it needs to be noted that this argument only makes sense when predicated on a framework of intelligent design - i.e. that we have a survival instinct because it is good for us to live, rather than because it was evolutionarily advantageous in some way. It makes no sense to think that the unintelligent processes of evolution *just so happened* to give us a primal trait that *just happens* to always coincide with what is in our rational self interests. As a suicidal person, I can also attest that it is untrue that suicidal people have an impairment to their survival instinct. My own continued survival is a testament to the robustness of my survival instinct, although the laws preventing me from accessing an effective suicide method have played no small part.

But if we're accepting primordial instincts as evidence for what is in our rational best interests, then women have a natural evolved instinct towards mothering, and pregnancy is nature's way of perpetuating the species.

Those who oppose the right to suicide on the grounds of an unproven and unfalsifiable presumption concerning the mental capacity of the individual (and one that the individual labelled as mentally unstable has no legal avenue to challenge, once it is rendered), are utilising the very same tactics that were long used to justify denying women the same legal rights as men. In the Victorian era (and in many parts of the world today), men could have their wives committed to an insane asylum based on the fact that they exhibited behaviours which defied gender norms (to read more about this, see here: [https://time.com/6074783/psychiatry-history-women-mental-health/](https://time.com/6074783/psychiatry-history-women-mental-health/)). As a man, they had more credibility in the eyes of authority, compared to a woman. A similar or even wider credibility gap exists today between a suicidal individual asking to be allowed to exercise bodily autonomy, and a psychiatrist who has rendered an unfalsifiable diagnosis of mental disorder (unfalsifiable because there is no way of objectively testing for these so-called 'disorders', and therefore no way of disproving them...therefore the person occupying a position of perceived authority is the one who will always be believed). Women who support the right to abortion but oppose an expansive right to suicide are therefore endorsing the same mechanisms of social oppression to be used to take away the rights of another group of individual, that once would have been used to keep them subjugated.

*  *Suicide causes devastation to other people and can cause contagion. Abortion does not have such profound effects on society.*

To respond to this one, I would refer back to the 'slavery' argument earlier. If someone is to be forced to stay alive for the sake of sparing others from suffering, or even from suicide, then that person is a slave to what society demands of them. They are forced to remain alive not because it is in their own interests, but because society's faith that life is worth living is a house of cards which is liable to collapse if even one card is allowed to be removed.

If society's interests form a valid ethical reason to withhold effective suicide methods from an individual, then it is also a valid reason to withhold the means of abortion from women. Many men are devastated when their partner chooses to have an abortion, as they have staked their hopes and dreams upon being a father. Abortion also causes great consternation within certain segments of society, as evidenced by the fact that the abortion issue continues to form an enduring fault line within society. Signalling that abortion is acceptable by permitting it to occur with the approval of our legal system is also likely to have the effect of making it appear as an acceptable option to other women.

* *Many people who attempt suicide and fail are glad that they survived.*

Firstly, this doesn't justify such a rigid approach to suicide prevention as advocated by many opponents of suicide (which include many who would describe themselves as ""pro-choice""). Requiring a waiting period to be completed prior to allowing unrestricted access to effective suicide methods would help to deter people from acting impulsively. Also, merely having the option available would mean that many suicidal people would have sufficient peace of mind to be able to postpone their suicide indefinitely (an option that would not be viable in the case of abortion, which is strictly time-sensitive): [https://news.sky.com/story/ive-been-granted-the-right-to-die-in-my-30s-it-may-have-saved-my-life-12055578](https://news.sky.com/story/ive-been-granted-the-right-to-die-in-my-30s-it-may-have-saved-my-life-12055578)

Additionally, many women who have had abortions bitterly come to regret their decision. Such women are highly sought after by anti-abortion campaigners and media outlets; just as formerly suicidal people who advocate for nanny-state suicide prevention laws are highly sought after by media outlets across the spectrum, whilst those who continue to wish that they were dead are roundly ignored by all.

This list of arguments may not be exhaustive and I may have missed some arguments off my list. These are simply the ones that I have thought of just now. It seems to me that those who are 'pro-choice' on the issue of abortion (with the stated rationale of bodily autonomy) but pro-life on the issue of suicide either haven't thought their position through fully, or they only approve of bodily autonomy in cases where they have a personal use for that form of bodily autonomy, and it doesn't conflict with their moral beliefs. In the first case, the person may not necessarily be a hypocrite, however if they resist the right to die after hearing the arguments, then they should explain why their position is not logically inconsistent. In the latter case, then I do not consider these people's objection to abortion to have any kind of principled basis at all. They are either just looking out for their own interests, or they merely wish to signal affiliation with a particular group within society (for example Democrat voters, or social justice activists) To change my view, please point out anywhere that my logic breaks down, any angles that I may have missed in my analysis."

I'm not talking about morality or what should be. 

But there was, in the past, and still some in the present that say marriage should be between one man and one woman because its natural. That to divorce is to go against nature. That if we were to have orgies that would be going against nature. 

That does not make sense to me. Falling in and out of love with someone happens all the time. Even without love animals mate differently too. On the contrary, marital certification is unnatural. Only humans are the ones with marital certifications and laws. 

Now if you are someone who recognizes dating different people is natural, than it makes no sense to claim that divorce on the other hand is unnatural. 

Now I don't believe in god so maybe that's the disconnect. But everyone who said the ""liberal, godless ways"" of ""orgies, cheating or polyamory"" as unnatural are Christian or Muslim. 

Women sleeping around is natural. My final point on that is that there are some that are less civilized (I don't mean this in a bad way just people who are more nomadic) have very free women. same with men. There are tribes in Africa and south america that do this. Everyone is free to fuck whoever they want. (With consent) 

So final two points..this is not an argument that monogamy is unnatural. I myself want a monogamous life. This is also not an argument of how we should behave"

The current “crisis” in the US is born of nothing less than thinly varnished bigotry.

Furthermore large segments of the US economy are utterly dependent on immigrant labor to perform work that Americans simply will not do. We’re we to actually enforce the current prohibitions we have on the books the results would be catastrophic.

So, my proposal: Israel should take control of the Gaza Strip again. They should remove every man, woman, and child who currently lives there and send them back to Jordan. Anyone who commits an act of violence should be treated as a terrorist and shot on sight. Same goes for anyone who is linked to Hamas. Israel is entitled to assuring their own security. No western nation would tolerate its citizens being murdered and their cities bombed. When it happened in the US, we invaded and decimated a large portion of the Middle East. 

Now before someone says that it’s not feasible, it absolutely is. It will take time and conflict, but remember the goal isn’t to root out Hamas. It’s to remove all non-Israeli’s from Gaza. 

So, change my view."

The masochistic tendencies among russian population are programmed in their culture. For example, orthodox church institute is a good instrument for government. Unlike ukrainian orthodox church, which is more divided from government, russian orthodox church is obeying government, and uses it's ideology to brainwash people. Then, russian culture is famous known for depressing literature like Dostoevsky's works. Maybe I'm not agree with many Daniel Rancour's statements (especially the russian bath part), but it's true that russians are, sadly, moral masochists. Even russian opposition is mostly contains of people with wrak willpower who prefer to hang out on kitchen and blaming silently Kremlin. Just look how russian serfdom existed very long. And many russian leaders are actually foreigners. Stalin was a georgian, Rurik was a scandinavian, Catherine II was a deutsch. 

Russians can hate their government and do a little of protests, but mostly they lrefer to put their cheeks for beating. Many smart russians are just leaving their shithole country and assimilate with foreigners.

I believe that Russia could have a better outcome if it was occupied by a western country, like USA did with Japan. I believe that USA and NATO countries should intervene much more into russian politics during 90s and put someone from Europe on president chair. Sometimes, I wish to live in a lifetime where Napoleon conquered Russia, or Poland conquered during Trouble Times."

I argue that there **is no reason** for someone to be able to drive fast. You have an emergency? Someone chasing you? Have diarrhea?

None of those things should be an excuse for you to put other peoples lives at greater risk. That’s simply selfish. 

Yes some people can still drive recklessly at 50 and kill someone. But taking the possibility of going 110 on a public street is better for everyone. On top of that, the usual highest speed limit is ~70/75mph. So what’s the point in even allowing vehicles to go 30/40/50 mph faster than that? In the rare and few cases where the speed limit is 85, so be it.


So give me a reason why someone should have the ability to drive 90+ miles per hour on public roads?"

There's always a fine line but if you want to get to the bottom of it, et all, you must ignore this line temporarily. Some of you may or may not know but recently it was 'discovered' that in our hunter-gatherer societies it turns out the 'women' were the bigger, more aggressive and more  hunter-gatherer oriented than the men, who were sitting around campfires. This came as a shock and it does reflect our society today where men would rather sit around and play videogames/work than chase and women are going after the universities like no tomorrow. It's also interesting to note the only video footage of a sasquatch is one of a female with big tits, over 50 year old footage and it hasn't been bested. Presumably the mens were all sitting around a campfire and couldn't be arsed to walk

We live in an increasingly complex society where everyone's increasingly entitled and if women are to be entitled to be the dominating gender, to fulfill thier genetic potential as science says they are the real hunter-gatherers now, then men are entitled to be respected more than they are now, as they are now playing the submissive role. Men cannot be simply seen as ""the lesser"" gender forever simply because women are the more ""go-getter"" type. It's only recently that women in hunter gather societies played the ""alpha"" role (I hate that term too) . If women are to be true leaders and take the mantle then they ought to do the role justice and respect men's entitlement to be heard, listened and cared for with respect. "

The Republicans, MAGA, and conservatives are all in for prosecuting Hunter Biden for his crimes, and he hasn’t worked a day in the White House, or in elected office.

NATO should form a coalition to make the Russian military retreat back to Russia, similar to what happened to Iraq in Kuwait. That will be the objective, not making the Russia government surrender or anything, just retreat back to Russia. The overall mission is protecting Ukraine.  

I think NATO is extremely weak, putting up with this war in their neighborhood. Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya established the precedent of NATO getting involved in conflicts. The alliance is just money, with the US and Turkey being the most important members, many members are useless, since they don’t even get their 2% spending on the military. Both the US and Turkey have experience with wars, so I’ll trust them to lead the coalition in Ukraine against Russia. 

Unlike the three countries I mentioned, Ukraine actually wants a coalition and NATO to get involved, so that’s legal there. Ukraine government will be willing to work with NATO. Russia government will obviously object, and Dmitry Medvedev will say his 100th threat. 

No fly zones also could have been useful in Ukraine’s counterattack."

The first being the recent hate she has gotten by her interactions around various social media. 

Recently she has been in the hot seat because of defending her relationship with some accused of sexual harassment. I am not defending him or how she treated her fans. Doja has retaliated against fans who have been upset at what she does in her personal life. This means that the fans have a sense of connection that is one sided and not consistent. I believe her responses are lethargic because fans have and will always have inconsistent views. You can plan a pretty picnic but you can’t predict the weather. 

The second argument is if fans were relating to the music, they wouldn’t pay attention to what she does in her personal life. Hip Hop has always been at its core, controversial. Her recent album, Scarlet, is confrontational and is the embodiment of Hip Hop. It directly addresses fans while expressing her relationship. 

I view her work speaks for herself and is congruent to how she portrays herself on social media. Controversial and Confrontational. We should not condemn her based on her social media or choices because it’s consistent with her work.  Please change my view because I have biases towards Hip Hop and believe she is a strong talent within the Hip Hop ecosystem."

I am not going to pretend that my 400-word post here can do it justice, and I'll preface by saying that anything I post here is, out of necessity, going to have to be gross oversimplification:

 The Israelis frequently condemn the Palestinian side (such as the current ongoing Hamas attack) for terrorist attacks and whatnot - unsurprisingly so, given that Israel is their side (just like how America, of course, condemned the 9/11 attacks.) **But I am not convinced that, if the roles were reversed, that the Israelis would be behaving any differently.**

Say that Israel were squelched and prevented from being a formally-recognized nation state on terms that it wanted (yes, the Palestinians have been offered two-state solutions, but none that they found satisfactory), and also that it was facing continuous blockade, in poverty, were under the control of a much bigger, stronger, richer opponent of the opposing religion, and that this went on for decades with no end in sight. 

I don't believe, for one moment, that the Israelis would say ""Well, we'll just be content and stay like this forever and always pursue peaceful solutions even though we've found that peace gets us nothing."" The Israelis would be doing something just like what Gaza Hamas is doing right now. **And in fact, that's similar to what Israel did, in fact, do. The Lehi (Stern Gang) used terrorist attacks to help get the nation of Israel formed in the first place, back in the 1940s.**

So the viewpoint I am trying to get changed is this: If the Israelis were in the shoes of the Palestinians, they'd behave the same. And in fact, most people in the world would, too."

It might be able to write hundreds of files of code based of asking something specific. 99% of a programmers time will be typing the specifications and AI can just spit out everything that you want. The final product would just be pages of plain English describing what you want for your application. There will no longer be programmers but ""AI Users"".

1,2023-10-07,Cmv: all men are homosexuals,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172esg5/cmv_all_men_are_homosexuals/,changemyview,"I've suspected this for a long time now. I originally posted the following in another subreddit but it closed before it could get any traction, then someone reposted it online where it got a little more attention. Another user suggested I post it here instead which I thought was a good idea.

So here is my reason:

A little bit about myself:

• I am a 23 year old female. Short/Petite frame. Fairly attractive. Femininity is average I guess.

• I'm attracted to masculine men.. (ex. Idris Elba, Michael Fassbender, Mark Wahlberg etc) just for reference..

• I live in the midwest ~

My story:

I have dated 3 men in my life and believe it or not, they each turned out to be gay.

This is getting not only tiresome for me, but it's also beginning to make me extremely angry, to the point where I am beginning to deeply resent gay men. And also fear all men in general for the simple fact that I think they are all secretly gay.

I search in google ""I am a girl. Why do I attract closeted gay men"" and 99% of the results are along the lines of: ""I am attracted to men. Should I leave my wife?"" Or ""sex with married men as a gay man"" or ""I've built a life with a woman but I'm gay""... What the fuck.

I am so angry because honestly, I see the chemistry between men. They understand each other in a way that women cannot (and the same goes for women yet for whatever reason, most women still hate each other...)

I used to watch a ton of gay porn (strictly research purposes) and saw all over amateur gay sex videos most of them were titled ""pegging or getting pegged by my not so straight friend"" or ""his girlfriend caught us"" and a lot of ""he fucks me while his gf is away"" .  And they were all homemade...

Men just respect each other on a whole other level. In all the gay movies and gay couples I meet in real life, the bonds they create are so strong and promising. And when a guy is gay, it's like there is absolutely no chance at him ever being attracted to a woman. Yet the same.. ""Stigma"" does not apply so much to a lesbian woman, who is much more likely to end up leaving the girl for a man.. It's like men really do have each other's backs. Their bonds are seemingly unbreakable and at this point I just think to myself..yeah, why would a man ever want a woman when a man could give him everything he needs sexually AND emotionally? Yikes...

And another thing: my ""gaydar"" is A-1 at this point. It's kinda always been. It's like every where I go I see gay men. I catch onto their body language and see how they change when they speak to other men. There's this strong connection between them like no other. It is TERRIBLY obvious to me when a man is gay. Whether he be top, bottom, switch, bear, IRON CLOSET etc...

At first I thought I was just insane/paranoid, but after busting the last guy I was with, my closest (first) cousin, a couple of my uncles, and even a guy one of my girlfriends was with, I realized no.. I'm not so insane after all. And to top it off, I reached out to one of my high school crushes last week after coming across his number in my phone. He had a big crush on me too back then but he was so shy for a variety of reasons. Well, come to find out that he is gay, and I had already braced myself for this because of my aforementioned experiences.

Needless to say that a vast majority of my other high school crushes are now gay. It's as if EVERY single guy I talk to ends up being gay. When I was searching for a community to post this in, nearly every other post I saw in each community was a gay confession, many which involved losing interest in a girlfriend. (ps if you don't believe me, I screenshotted a few)

All of the girls I know always come to me when they suspect a guy is gay because they say it's what I'm best at.. Wow. How's that for talent.

This is the shit that makes me think..were men EVER attracted to women at any given point in time? And how the hell could you date/marry someone you KNOW you don't like, then turn around and still do gay shit behind her back, hurting her in the process. I swear a lot of them just do it for the thrill of having a ""secret life""...  But some say it's because he is afraid of how society will react to him.. but at that point, he is no longer the victim because he deliberately dragged somebody else into his life and deceived them. And also, that doesn't apply anymore for the simple fact that the whole world is becoming significantly more liberal each day. You say anything against gays today and you get bashed by every soul in the vicinity...

I have no idea the meaning of why this is happening to me. I am so fucking confused and nonetheless scared. And pissed. I've never felt so undesirable in my life. I just feel like whatever man I choose will eventually come out as gay. It feels like a curse. And I am so terrified to date now because of this.

1,2023-10-07,Cmv: today's events in Gaza is another lavon affair,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172ftmp/cmv_todays_events_in_gaza_is_another_lavon_affair/,changemyview,"Gaza is an open air prison. The area one of the most heavily surveillance places in the world,that revivals even china. It's impossible for them to have been caught off guard to this degree. And like magic, netenyahu has announced for all Palestinian citizens to leave because they will be entering Gaza. Just coincidentally getting them to do what they wanted to do most, have a justification to expand. It's another lavon affair.

The Lavon Affair, a covert operation by Israeli intelligence in 1954 that aimed to sabotage U.S.-Egyptian relations through a series of false flag bombings, serves as a compelling historical lesson in skepticism and the importance of thorough investigation before taking action. This event, while decades old, offers valuable insights into the world of espionage, politics, and international relations, reminding us of the need to question official claims and delve deeper into the truth.


The Lavon Affair, also known as Operation Susannah, was a clandestine mission conducted by Israeli military intelligence (Aman) in Egypt. The operation involved a group of Jewish Egyptian citizens recruited by Israeli agents to carry out bombings targeting Western and American interests in Cairo and Alexandria. The intent was to frame Egyptian nationalists and undermine relations between Egypt and the United States.

Several of these bombings were executed, but the mission ultimately failed when one of the operatives was arrested. The Egyptian authorities quickly unraveled the plot, leading to the capture and trial of the operatives. The Lavon Affair's exposure strained relations between Israel and the United States, with Israel initially denying involvement but later admitting to the operation.



The Lavon Affair underscores the critical importance of skepticism when evaluating claims made by governments and intelligence agencies. In this case, the Israeli government initially denied any involvement in the bombings, leaving the United States unaware of the true perpetrators. It was only through rigorous investigation and the pursuit of the facts that the truth came to light.

Skepticism is a fundamental tool in the realm of international relations and intelligence. Governments and intelligence agencies often operate in secrecy, and their actions may not always align with their stated objectives or official narratives. Skepticism prompts us to question, probe, and critically assess the information presented to us, guarding against the manipulation of facts for political or strategic purposes.



The Lavon Affair also highlights the need for investigative vigilance, not only by the affected parties but by the broader international community. When suspicious events occur, it is crucial for impartial investigators to delve deep into the details, seek corroborating evidence, and strive for transparency.

In the Lavon Affair, the Egyptian authorities played a pivotal role in uncovering the truth. Their commitment to a thorough investigation ultimately exposed the false flag operation. This incident serves as a reminder that investigative diligence can unravel even the most complex web of deception, holding those responsible accountable for their actions.


While the Lavon Affair occurred over half a century ago, its lessons remain relevant in today's complex geopolitical landscape. In an era of information warfare, disinformation campaigns, and covert operations, skepticism and investigative vigilance are more critical than ever.

The Lavon Affair encourages us to question official claims and narratives, especially when they involve allegations of wrongdoing or acts of aggression. It reminds us that governments and intelligence agencies may not always be forthright about their actions.

When confronted with significant events or allegations, it is essential to engage in fact-checking and verification. Relying on multiple sources, examining the available evidence, and seeking independent confirmation can help discern the truth.

The Lavon Affair demonstrates the potential role of international organizations and bodies in investigating and resolving disputes or suspected covert actions. These entities can provide impartial oversight and help prevent escalations based on false or incomplete information.

The Lavon Affair reinforces the importance of transparency and accountability in international relations. Governments and intelligence agencies must be held accountable for their actions, particularly when they engage in covert or deceptive operations.

Ultimately, the Lavon Affair reminds us of the paramount importance of promoting peace and diplomacy in international relations. Covert actions and false flag operations often lead to mistrust and conflict, while open dialogue and negotiation offer pathways to peaceful resolutions.



The Lavon Affair serves as a historical testament to the power of skepticism and investigative vigilance in a world where misinformation and covert actions can have far-reaching consequences. It teaches us that even in the shadows of espionage and international intrigue, the pursuit of truth and transparency must prevail.

As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, we should carry the lessons of the Lavon Affair with us. We must remain vigilant, demand transparency, and question official narratives to ensure that our actions and decisions are based on a foundation of truth and integrity, ultimately contributing to a more just and peaceful global community."

But I have seen people on Twitter saying what Hamas did was perfectly justified, and people were  celebrating in the streets handing out candies in honor of what happened in Tehran and Nablus.

Hamas snuck into Israel, stabbed and shot hiding civilians, stripped and raped naked women, while dancing around and singing and posting that online, kidnapped and beat up kids, soldiers, elderly and women alike, burned people alive, cheered at the death, and slit the throats of kids, laughing about it the whole time.

You can talk about all the crimes Israel has committed against the Palestinians, Apartheid, Ethnic Cleansing, etc, but none of that justifies this. Even if Israel was intentionally killing children (which I don't think they do) don't these people hate Israel because of that? So why is it okay if the Palestinians do it now?

Even if it was Nazi Germany, I don't think the Jews had a right to go into their cities and kill civilians, tourists, kids and elderly, raping and torturing them, some of which hadn't even supported the Nazi party. And Nazi Germany did much more crimes to the Jews than Israel to Palestine.

What, if anything, can actually be used to be said that people that support this aren't evil themselves? I don't see how it's possible to actually think Hamas was in the right here. Yet I've seen Twitter and Reddit flooded with people saying they were just defending themselves."

What if somebody were to be diagnosed with a severe unrelenting mental illness forcing them to be dependent on their parents for the rest of their lives, unable to get in a loving relationship like they always dreamed of having, be stuck with gigantic student debt that they are unable to payoff because they can’t hold down a job and are unable to even enjoy the simple pleasures in life because their neurochemistry is so screwed up beyond repair?

Then I learned to party and have had much more fun ever since.

1,2023-10-07,CMV: Being on the top 1% of any given category isn't a big achievement at all.,u/My_Wholesome_Acc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172j0yr/cmv_being_on_the_top_1_of_any_given_category_isnt/,changemyview,"People often obsess with ""the 1%"", specially when it comes to income (but also when it comes to attractiveness, intelligence and so on), but being the top 1% doesn't mean that much.

For instance, in my high school's senior year (in my country this is called ""terceiro colegial"") there were two classes with 50 students each, for a total of a hundred.

If you assume that my school was representative of the population (not in terms of income, but in terms of intelligence, height and attractiveness, as it'd have no reason not to be), that means that the hottest, tallest and smartest people in senior year was likely on the top 1% of hot, tall or smart person.

And that could hold true for any other school. And there are thousands of other schools.

Therefore, being on the top 1% of these things doesn't mean a lot.

And when it comes to income, even though the highschool analogy wouldn't be as adequate, given that the most expensive schools are most likely to concentrate the wealthiest people...

If you think that the world has 8 billion people, that means that 80,000,000 people are on the top 1%.

Many people who earn enough to be in that percentile are just mediocre earners from wealthy countries.

Also, in many countries (such as mine, Brazil), most people on the top 1% are still technically working class. They are high-paid workers or even executives, but they don't own the means of production, have money to lobby on the government, etc.

Really rich people are gonna be on the 0.1% or even on the 0.01%.

That also holds true for beauty.

For instance, in any given day you see several hundred people. Still, the ""hottest"" person you see on a given day is usually completely unremarkable.

That's because are rarelly gonna memorize seeing some hot person as a memorable event, as one needs to be much better positioned than the top 1% to be that remarkable."

Also, the desire to stay in power or to have their party stay in power further elected Congressmen from the population's wishes.

If average citizens were selected at random to serve a term on the Legislative, they would, by all chance, better represent the population. They wouldn't necessarily be less technically competent than current Congressmen (given how incompetent these are), and, with the aid of legal experts, they could do as good of a technical job as today's politicians, while being more loyal and representative of the population's desires."

It's insanely optimistic to the point where I think they literally have had their heads in the sand or they just don't ever actually cite power figures when they explain their optism


A nuclear war is going to happen. And we need to be reminded what that looks like. We need to see russia test their Satan nuclear missile so we can see if we are really willing to uphold article 5 for Estonia. And russia needs to see our trident missiles so they can decide if a total end to their society is what they want. We all need to see china fire a nuclear missile around the world and have it explode in a Chinese desert. So Americans can know full well no matter how good we are at kicking china's ass at least 2 or 3 of those hypersonic missiles are going to pierce our defense system and bring us pain unlike any we've had before. We need to see what that looks like before we are willing to commit to protecting taiwan

It's really insane how uneducated and undereducated people are on how much the nuclear threshold has been lowered. This is going to happen even the Un general and the people agree the world is collapsing and we can't have conversations and debate and etc etc anymore we need to just fire these bad boys because black and white mushroom cloud videos just aren't doing anymore.

I suspect the same would happen if, for example, Pelosi was dumb enough to allow one person to vacate the chair and she included Manchin’s permitting reform in some kind of continuing resolution. 

The broader point is that we as Americans hate each other. This is my takeaway from everything that’s happened over the past seven years. As another post said, we’ve run out of things in common. One side thinks that the history of this country is irredeemably sinful, the other side thinks it’s squeaky clean perfect. Look at the movie industry. Now it’s just “Why isn’t this character gay?” vs. “Oh my god, this character is gay!”. Foreign adversaries are viewed more positively by partisans than a president of the opposing party-look at how how Democrats view Kim Jong Un and Trump, and how Republicans view Putin and Biden. One side believes that gays want to make everyone gay. The other side believes that men will soon go to jail for wearing pink or leaving long hair. This is no longer an “I disagree” thing: it’s about having two different world views that are opposed to each other. One is religious and traditional, the other agnostic and liberal. And socio-political viewpoints are becoming the “cornerstone” of our daily lives, whether it’s where we eat out (Whole Foods vs. Cracker Barrel), where we shop at (Jerry’s vs. Jeremy’s), what movies we watch (Barbie vs. Oppenheimer), what beer we drink (Bud Light vs. Coors Light), what social media we use (Reddit vs. X), where we get fast food (Everywhere else vs. Chick Fil-A), etc. Remember how during the Civil War, slavery was the “cornerstone” of Southern society?

For people who say that we are too comfy to fight a civil war, our quality of life is deteriorating: in 2014 we are 14th in quality of life, now we are 26th. More and more people have nothing to lose, whether it’s millennials buried under student loan debt or Rust Belt workers who had their factories closed. Both parties know this but they are just training their fire on each other and doing nothing to solve the problem.

As someone who would be absolutely devastated by the Union dissolving in any way, shape or form, unfortunately the Union is falling apart and either a National Divorce or a civil war would happen. The next election will only accelerate the disintegration of the Union. We’re segregating ourselves politically, and the lack of conflict in your daily life doesn’t prove that “we’re not as divided as we seem”. Most of us live in political echo chambers, whether in person or online. Try and find someone you personally know in your community who disagrees with politically (not like “I’m a progressive Democrat and you’re a slightly less progressive Democrat” kind of disagree, but “I’m a Democrat and you’re a Republican” kind of disagree) and if all of you manage to get through a 20-minute political discussion without shouting (if you could even find anyone at all) I will instantly delete this post. Sure, we want Unity, but our concept of unity is “either agree with me or shut up”. But we’re Americans, and given how free speech is in our Constitution we ESPECIALLY HATE being told by others to shut up. So the other side refuses to shut up. What happens next?

Already most people don’t have faith in elections to solve our most pressing political and social problems. That is half of Democrats, and most Independents and Republicans. And increasingly people are looking outside of the political process for solutions to our problems. Depending on how you look at it, you have a pool of up to 50 million Americans willing to fight physically for their beliefs. You won’t want to see what happens if only 1% of those people act on it. With people increasingly having nothing to lose, it’ll probably be more than that.

I strongly oppose a national divorce. But I fear we’re running out of options very quickly. Maybe a better option would be to give states more power, but that may just only end up eroding what’s left of our common identity as Americans. Might as well just give up. We could give certain states to Democrats and Republicans and give the 66 million voters in the “wrong” state, say, 20 years and a lot of incentives to move to the “right” state, with restrictions on freedom of movement and trade gradually phasing in. I would hate for this to happen, but it’s probably the only way we’ll avoid mass bloodshed."

I'm not a go-green guy either. I couldn't care less environmental issues. But geez, the poor animals. I've always thought hunting was pretty abominable. I was taken hunting before when I was younger. It feels barbaric. I always felt that local free-range farms were a much more human alternative.

If I try to put myself in the hoofs of an animal, I think I would accept a deal whereby I am to be harvested in exchange of unlimited food, protection from predators and a decent lifespan. The last point is the biggest one for me. We could take about the quality of mass produced farms all we want. Going organic/local seems like an obvious solution. And it is, for a large part. It would be awesome if the government put a ban on mass produced animal farms and somehow worked out the logistics of local farms fulfilling all our needs. Maybe that could happen one day, who knows. But it still doesnt change the last part... we aren't just cutting their lifespan in half. We're taking like 6/7th of their possible lifespan. There is an obvious grade of beef and poultry that is most tasty and nutritious in younger lifestock. 

It seems like regardless of our efforts to provide these animals with a good quality of life before we eat them... it's not exactly futile. It's better than nothing. But why not be a vegetarian? Of course, I'm not an idiot, I know becoming vegetarian won't stop anything. Which leads me to my titled statement: we should all be vegetarian. It probably won't ever happen. But it seems like the most moral thing to do. I'd honestly like for someone to change my view. Don't get me wrong. I'm not struggling with guilt or shame. I honestly just feel bad for the animals. And I feel powerless that I have no tangible solution besides becoming president and forcing strict farm laws and forcing everyone to eat old cows."

I am not really educated on this topic so I wanted to write a post about this in order to get some info,

As I know, For last several centuries Palestinians were living in these lands and were rightful owners. However, before that, Jews were the ones occupying the said territories. As Palestinians got displaced in 20th century, so did the Jews who were living there before them. 

Why are people condemning Israel for returning and taking these lands back, when Palestine was the original conflict instigator?

I thought about this more and came up with interesting hypothetical: If Native Americans gained enough military power to take back their lands of America, Would they be wrong to do so? There will be a lot of  bloodshed, but so was in the past when Americans genocided the natives.

If we say that it would be wrong because american crimes were in the past and natives taking back their lands would be new bloodshed in the present, Wouldn't that also apply to Israel-Palestine Conflict? That Palestinians shouldn't take their territory back and let it stay the way it is now, since a new conflict will cause more bloodshed? "

Teenagers are just starting to do things for themselves. Many teens get their first jobs and make their own money for the first time at this point in their lives, which naturally leads to an overinflated sense of independence. They're starting to perceive themselves as responsible adults in general, and start chafing at seemingly unfair parental expectations. I'm definitely not saying they're correct to think their parents are putting too much on them, but I do think it should be expected that they don't fully get the division of labor but still want things to be ""fair"". This point in one's life is also where most parents start putting pressure on their kids to start preparing themselves for leaving high school, whether they're planning on going to college or getting a job. Those lofty expectations can also contribute to the seeming unfairness of their parents' expectations. 

I would also argue that a 12-16 year old *not* having this entitlement might be a sign that their environment isn't ideal. A child who is very aware of how much their parents do for them is likely not a child who feels secure in what they have, whether due to poverty or less than stellar parenting. A parent who constantly reminds their kid how much they do for them is a parent who might be guilt-tripping their child. It could also be a parent who doesn't have the resources to take care of their child's needs, in which case it's not an issue with the parenting but still an issue with how the child is raised."

1,2023-10-08,Cmv: yesterday's events is another lavon affair,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172zlz7/cmv_yesterdays_events_is_another_lavon_affair/,changemyview,"

The Lavon Affair, a covert operation by Israeli intelligence in 1954 that aimed to sabotage U.S.-Egyptian relations through a series of false flag bombings, serves as a compelling historical lesson in skepticism and the importance of thorough investigation before taking action. This event, while decades old, offers valuable insights into the world of espionage, politics, and international relations, reminding us of the need to question official claims and delve deeper into the truth.


The Lavon Affair, also known as Operation Susannah, was a clandestine mission conducted by Israeli military intelligence (Aman) in Egypt. The operation involved a group of Jewish Egyptian citizens recruited by Israeli agents to carry out bombings targeting Western and American interests in Cairo and Alexandria. The intent was to frame Egyptian nationalists and undermine relations between Egypt and the United States.

Several of these bombings were executed, but the mission ultimately failed when one of the operatives was arrested. The Egyptian authorities quickly unraveled the plot, leading to the capture and trial of the operatives. The Lavon Affair's exposure strained relations between Israel and the United States, with Israel initially denying involvement but later admitting to the operation.



The Lavon Affair underscores the critical importance of skepticism when evaluating claims made by governments and intelligence agencies. In this case, the Israeli government initially denied any involvement in the bombings, leaving the United States unaware of the true perpetrators. It was only through rigorous investigation and the pursuit of the facts that the truth came to light.

Skepticism is a fundamental tool in the realm of international relations and intelligence. Governments and intelligence agencies often operate in secrecy, and their actions may not always align with their stated objectives or official narratives. Skepticism prompts us to question, probe, and critically assess the information presented to us, guarding against the manipulation of facts for political or strategic purposes.



The Lavon Affair also highlights the need for investigative vigilance, not only by the affected parties but by the broader international community. When suspicious events occur, it is crucial for impartial investigators to delve deep into the details, seek corroborating evidence, and strive for transparency.

In the Lavon Affair, the Egyptian authorities played a pivotal role in uncovering the truth. Their commitment to a thorough investigation ultimately exposed the false flag operation. This incident serves as a reminder that investigative diligence can unravel even the most complex web of deception, holding those responsible accountable for their actions.


While the Lavon Affair occurred over half a century ago, its lessons remain relevant in today's complex geopolitical landscape. In an era of information warfare, disinformation campaigns, and covert operations, skepticism and investigative vigilance are more critical than ever.

The Lavon Affair encourages us to question official claims and narratives, especially when they involve allegations of wrongdoing or acts of aggression. It reminds us that governments and intelligence agencies may not always be forthright about their actions.

When confronted with significant events or allegations, it is essential to engage in fact-checking and verification. Relying on multiple sources, examining the available evidence, and seeking independent confirmation can help discern the truth.

The Lavon Affair demonstrates the potential role of international organizations and bodies in investigating and resolving disputes or suspected covert actions. These entities can provide impartial oversight and help prevent escalations based on false or incomplete information.

The Lavon Affair reinforces the importance of transparency and accountability in international relations. Governments and intelligence agencies must be held accountable for their actions, particularly when they engage in covert or deceptive operations.

Ultimately, the Lavon Affair reminds us of the paramount importance of promoting peace and diplomacy in international relations. Covert actions and false flag operations often lead to mistrust and conflict, while open dialogue and negotiation offer pathways to peaceful resolutions.



The Lavon Affair serves as a historical testament to the power of skepticism and investigative vigilance in a world where misinformation and covert actions can have far-reaching consequences. It teaches us that even in the shadows of espionage and international intrigue, the pursuit of truth and transparency must prevail.

As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, we should carry the lessons of the Lavon Affair with us. We must remain vigilant, demand transparency, and question official narratives to ensure that our actions and decisions are based on a foundation of truth and integrity, ultimately contributing to a more just and peaceful global community.



Gaza is an open air prison. The area one of the most heavily surveillance places in the world,that revivals even china. It's impossible for them to have been caught off guard to this degree. And like magic, netenyahu has announced for all Palestinian citizens to leave because they will be entering Gaza. Just coincidentally getting them to do what they wanted to do most, have a justification to expand. It's another lavon affair."

According to a survey, of the 1/3 who did not vote, 20% said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates.  
https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why  
Here is my view: If you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them, you might as well vote for someone else.  
A lot of people say ""a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for (insert name of Democrat or Republican candidate)""  
By definition it is not. It is a vote for someone else. And this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone.  
People say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won't win. But something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5% of the vote. They become eligible for federal funding in the next election.  
https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm  
This is certainly not impossible. In 2016, both Clinton and Trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson, got 3.3% of the vote.  
It's too early to say for sure, but I'd wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for.  
So if a potential voter's reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them... why shouldn't they vote for someone else instead?  
This is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the 'lesser evil'. My statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.  
In an ironic twist, due to the way the electoral college works, in deep red or deep blue states, voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates. One vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88% or 88.0001% of the vote in a particular state... or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4.99999999% or 5% of the vote nationwide."

Asians, particularly East Asians, statistically exhibit lower crime rates compared to other races. There is also a prevalent stereotype that Asians are raised in supportive and academically focused households. According to the Census Bureau, the Asian median household income in the U.S. is even higher than that of Whites.

People of Asian descent often experience social privileges, such as reduced police profiling and fewer instances of people feeling uncomfortable around them. When others encounter an Asian person, there is a greater chance that their initial impression is not influenced by negative stereotypes associated with criminal behavior. 

I acknowledge the existing disadvantages of being coined model minority, such as being disproportionately affected by affirmative action policies and facing higher societal expectations.  Despite these challenges, I can't help but think that, on average, a normie like me benefit more from being labeled as a model minority."

I was always staunchly pro 2A, until around 18 when I started doing third party delivery driving.


I delivered through several apps, mainly food, but also did small packages for Walmart. By 20 I racked up several thousand deliveries, and also some pretty unpleasant encounters with gun owners.


First one was the scariest. Delivery at 2 AM to very nice neighborhood. This one was through doordash who gives constant texts and updates of when the order is about to arrive. I dropped the food on the porch, took a pic, and walked away. As I was walking away with my back turned to the house I here some guy scream ""turn around, don't move"" I look back and there's a guy pointing a pistol at me. I yelled ""I am With doordash."" The guy immediately put his gun down and apologized. When I saw him I first figured I must have gotten the wrong house, but no he said he got drunk and forgot he ordered! I was glad he apologized, but what he did was batshit insane. Even if I wasn't invited to his front door it still would be insane to point a gun at someone walking away. If he thought I was a threat, he should have stayed inside, and then shot if I started trying to bust down his door or something.


Second encounter was during broad daylight, in a normal suburban neighborhood. This time I was delivering a Walmart package. While I was setting the package down the door bursts open and this guy just had a gun in his hand. At least he didn't point it at me.. He said in a threatening tone ""what the FUCK are you doing dude?"" I just pointed to the package and said ""did you order Walmart?"" And he said, oh well why aren't you wearing a uniform then? I just said well Walmart doesn't give us uniforms. He said ""okay whatever"" then slams the door. No apology.


Those two were the only two encounters where I actually saw a gun at a house. but I was threatened another time. This time it was more rural. Where GPS isn't accurate. Pulled towards the end of someone's dirt driveway at around 10PM to get a look at the house number. I didn't pass any gates or no trespassing signs. This guy comes around from his backyard, and I was thinking ""oh great this is the right house and he's coming out to grab the order from me. Nope, he said ""get the hell off my property right now unless you wanna be shot."" 


After these encounters, I was way more cautious. I stopped delivering past 10, I put a bunch of delivery bumper stickers all over my car, and if I wasn't 100% sure that I'm approaching the right house, I called and asked. I also stopped taking package batches anymore, because people are less likely to know I'm coming, and they are probably used to Amazon or USPS, or USPS people who do have uniforms. I also didn't follow crazy directions like ""oh please come to my backyard and deliver to the side door."" I eventually stopped delivering and now have a much better job in a grocery store.


This is not even mentioning road rage situations I was in. I don't even drive anymore, but I admit at 18 I was pretty stupid. I flipped people off and honked. One time it caught up with me. The car was wanting to make a right turn on red, in a normal lane not right turn only, and I was in front, going forward. They honked once, I ignored it, honked again, ignored it, honked a third time, I flipped them off. Then the light turned green and they follow me (guess they weren't in such a hurry to make that right turn after all). I just pulled over by a crowded road, and they passed me fortunately, but they yelled ""fucking dumbass"" and flashed a gun out their window. 


Besides that last guy, Its very likely that all these stories involved legal gun owners. These were all high income neighborhoods. I accumulated all those stories from just 2 years of being a delivery driver. If it's possible for this stuff to happen with such frequency, it's clear that the bar to own a gun legally is not high enough. Also, I will mention, I'm a white guy. I'm sure delivery drivers who are minorities have this stuff happen even more. I'm not sure what the solution is, but clearly the bar is just not high enough. There needs to be more vetting/training. And probably a general culture shift amount gun owners."

1,2023-10-08,Cmv: Restorative justice is not actually that great and has many flaws.,u/Ok-Autumn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1734tq9/cmv_restorative_justice_is_not_actually_that/,changemyview,"I have tried to make myself agree with this and I am usually all for socialital change and progressiveness. But this is the one thing I just cannot agree with. Everything I read about it or anything similar (like conditional cautions and community resolution orders) just comes across to me as very rose tinted and leap-of-faith thinking. But a lot of people I have spoken to in real life do support this so I feel like a bit of an asshole for not being in favour of it myself. But I feel like I can justify my view pretty well. 

Let's face it, restorative justice is a flawed, emotional concept based on highly flawed principles, and I will outline why I think each one is flawed.

The first of which is relationships.

Rather than seeing a crime as ""a law has been broken."" Like traditional justice does. It sees ""A relationship has been damaged."" But 46% of victims of violent crime did not have relationships with their perpetrators in the first place. (.I.e. The perpetrator was a stranger or a neighbour or classmate they barely knew.) And that statistic is only for violent crime. I imagine it would only get higher and higher as you factored in sexual crimes, fraud/scams, property damage and vehicle theft. Thus in more cases than not there is no relationship to restore.


The second of which being Respect.

Two flaws there, it assumes the perpetrator has respect for the victim, which, is unlikely considering they offended against them in the first place. (Obviously there are a handful of exceptions here, like if someone was suffering from a particularly horrible mental health crisis and did not realise what they were doing, or their brain tricked them into thinking they were doing it for the greater good. And also in cases where the perpetrator was too drunk or high to notice or be fully aware of what they are doing. *In* **these** *cases, it would be a viable solution*). But in the grand scheme of things they are pretty uncommon. Most offenders do know what they are doing. 

And furthermore, this implies that the victim ""owes"" their offender respect. Which is just not the case. And not only is it an unfair mindset, it is a dangerous one. If for example the victim was an offender of trafficking, sexual abuse, domestic violence or really any kind of violence, or child abuse, trying to make them show respect to their abuser, especially in the event they did already once respect their abuser is a recipe for the abuser to work their way back into their victims lives through manipulation and re-offend.


Responsibility - 

Assumes that all offenders are willing to take responsibility. I know of some cases of people who are in prison for life or on death row who still do not take responsibility, in hopes that the police force who investigated them intially will get accused of corruption and their case will be re-examined by someone who may be fooled into buying their innocence. And even in more common, less severe cases, many people believe their crime was ""justified"" or ""It can't have been that bad for the victim."" And they refuse to plead guilty, instead pleading not guilty hoping to be able to fool a jury and/or judge into acquitting them. And it also indirectly implies the victim must have some kind of responsibility to take too (Which obviously can be the case. But often it is not. And this is victim blaming).


Repair - 
Assumes that the harm can be repaired. Which is relatively unlikely. And even if it is possible, it is unlikely the offender will be the solution to it. Unless it was something like graffiting a slur over someone's house, where the offender could personally clean it off or the offender happens to have the financial means to cover the costs of damage to a stolen car or hospital bills to a victim they are repsonbile for injuring (in such cases it *could* be viable.) We cannot pretend that the majority of damage caused to people by crimes can be fixed. And the majority of offenders can achieve this. If the pyschological harm done by a crime such as sexual assualt or attempted murder is going to be reversed, it will be by months of therapy, familial and friendship group support, support groups and love and understanding/empathy directed at the victim as well as just time itself. Not by meeting with the offender (in fact, that has a relatively high chance of making it worse - re-traumatizing victims by causing them to relieve their trauma upon facing the offender.)


Reintegration - 

Is viewed as a positive thing. But is blatantly overlooks the fact that it could just as easily be unsuccessful and simply be taken as another chance to re-offend by the offender instead of putting the effort into being law abiding citizen. As well as the fact that the community may simply ***not want to*** take the offender back, if what they did was severe enough (I.E. kidnapping a child or killing someone for example) or if they have already re-offended multiple times and shown a behaviour pattern of criminality (.E.G. multiple instances of GBH or rape.) If this is the case, then from a utilitarian perspective, shouldn't the community not have to?

I started studding criminology a few weeks ago and have already been conditioned to take statistics with a pinch of salt. I remember being told in school that 90% of victims are satisfied after Restorative justice. But might I highlight, this is only representative of the opinions of people who willingly chose to participate. To the best of my knowledge no research has been done directly I to the types of victims more likely to accept Restorative justice, but I imagine there would be similarities in attitudes, personalities, upbringings and backgrounds. 

This is speculation on my part but perhaps a victim who has never experienced trauma would be more sympathetic to an offender, if said offender had experienced trauma and been more accepting of the fact that that may have played a huge role in making them do it. Whereas perhaps a victim who had already experienced childhood trauma before the offense, would be more likely to want to avoid the offender at all costs and seek prosecution, thinking ""I had a hard life as a child and I never did anything as bad as what you did to me. I am not letting you hide behind your childhood as a justification if there is anything I can do about it."" Or maybe it is the opposite of that, and victims who had already had a pre-existing experience of trauma, may be able to relate to the offender's story more and feel sympathy for them and their ""justifications"". But the fact still stands that even if 90% of participants are happy with the results, it does not cover the views of those who chose not to take up an offer of restorative justice, nor their reasons for not doing so. So if there was 500 victims, and 100 participated in resortative justice, and 90 of them were satisfied and agreed with the outcome, 410 victims could potientially disagree with it entirely.

1,2023-10-08,"CMV: Saying that sex is a physiological need is not only wrong, but dangerous.",u/Utopia_Builder,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1734zi4/cmv_saying_that_sex_is_a_physiological_need_is/,changemyview,"Sexuality has been a major and contentious topic for as long as there have been humans. Depending on your environment, sex-related topics are omnipresent in news, media, businesses, households and more. Many people think about sex on a constant basis; to the point that their urge for sex is more important than the urge for homeostasis or security. Some have even included that sex is a basic need that the human body needs to function, but that simply is not true.

Food, water, oxygen, thermoneutrality, and sleep are actual physiological needs. Being free from deadly viruses or injuries is also a physiological need. If a human being, or any other animal for that matter, goes without any of those needs being met for a relatively short amount of time, they die. As great as sexual intercourse is, it is not a need. It might be an innate biological urge, but it is not a need. Many people have gone their entire lives without ever having sex. Catholic nuns don’t have sex. Buddhist monks don’t have sex. Eastern Orthodox bishops don’t have sex. Hindu/Jain ascetics don’t have sex. Eunuchs and people with missing genitals don’t have sex. Asexuals obviously and generally speaking, don’t have sex. Some of the greatest thinkers in the world like Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Immanuel Kant, and more probably died virgins. [At least 14% of American men](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/health/who_are_the_40-year-old_virgins_/1839675/) over 40 are virgins, and sadly that number is more likely to increase as time goes on.My point is that you don’t need a sexual experience to have a long, fulfilling, and exceptional life. Nor are you some bottom-tier unlovable wretch if you reach X age without having a sexual encounter. If nobody around you wants to fuck you, that sucks but you will definitely survive. If somebody or some government/organization starved you or dehydrated you or asphyxiated you, they wouldn’t be just denying your human rights; they would be outright committing murder. And people would justifiably do whatever they can in order to not get murdered.

Hopefully, you now see why equating sex with a physiological need is dangerous. If sex truly was a need, than incels and lonely people wouldn’t be silly and immoral for feeling entitled to sex; they would be the morally righteous ones. If sex truly was a need, than society doing nothing to help sexually satisfy them and instead shaming them would be a human rights violation! The idea that a man needs to have sex in order to be a real man, and any man that hasn’t had X sex partners by Y age is some pathetic loser who should just rot, is one of the most harmful thought processes in the modern world. That thought process leads to increased rates of depression, suicide, homicide, mass shootings, sexual assault, human trafficking, and many other horrifying phenomena. If sex is a need, virgin shaming is essentially no different than ridiculing famine victims or drought victims, and said victims would understandably be extremely resentful to those who insult them.

If you’re in a romantic relationship and your lover has a lower sex drive than you; I sympathize, but this thread is not for you. This thread is about those who feel sexual activity is essential for a human life, and/or think that demographic decreases in sexual encounters is a major catastrophe. To change my view, you have to prove that sexual relationships are a necessity for a healthy individual’s existence. And for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, DO NOT cite Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. That theory has been criticized for decades and lacks supporting evidence."

Despite being included in the DSM-5 I think there is good reason to doubt the condition's validity.  Also, disclaimer, I am a layperson, I am not a mental health professional, nor do I have any background in psychology outside of reading a few books and articles.  If I am wrong about anything, please correct me. 

My main issue with DID is the premise, that is to say, that a single person can have more than one personality.  The way I view it, personality is probably a function of both nature and nurture, nature being things like genes, our brain chemistry, hormones etc. and nurture being things like early childhood experiences, major life events, trauma, etc.  When you think about it, this already sheds doubt on many claimed cases of DID.  If I, an adult, claim to have one personality that a child this does not make sense because children and adults have different brains and different hormones, both of which effect behavior and personality.  If I claim to have one personality that is a police officer, it does not make sense either because I am not a police officer, and so I do not have the memories or experiences of one, and so those things cannot in turn effect me in any real way.  Of course, it is probably true that most people have personalities that shift gradually over time, however the notion that this is enough to make someone's personality bounce back and forth between 2 or more distinct states seems suspect to me, since generally, our biology and life experiences are pretty stable day to day.  Barring any sort of illness major life event, when I wake up tomorrow, I will have 99.9% of the same nature that I did yesterday, and 99.9% of the same nurture, and so I can expect my personality to be 99.9% the same.  

My second big issue with DID is the claim that it effects 1% to 1.5% of the general population, A stat I have read on both Wikipedia and The New York Times  (The article is titled ""What Does it Really Mean to Disassociate""), with the NYT article speculating that this is probably an underestimate.  My intuition tells me that this stat is not in line with reality.  Think about that for a second; DID is on one hand so poorly understood and was virtually unheard of before the 1980s, and yet so common that most people should probably know at least one person who has it.   Of course, if this figure is incorrect, it does not necessarily prove that all DID is fake, but it does at the very least make us wonder if maybe groups like the APA are wrong about it in some fairly major way

In my title, I put the word ""real"" in quotes.  This is because though I do not think DID is real, I do not think that people diagnosed with DID are necessarily pretending to be sick.  In my opinion, it is likely that people who have DID have some sort of other mental health condition which would allow us to explain DID behavior without needing to resort to Freudian woo-woo about a splintered psyche.

I consider myself a leftist, and it seems like most other people on the left are very supportive of Palestine. However, everything I’ve researched seems to point me towards supporting Israel.

First of all, it seems like Israel obtained all of its land legitimately. It legally purchased much of its land from land owners in the area, and the rest it obtained after winning it from a war which the Arabs and Palestinians started. The controversial aspect comes from the fact that it initially became a state from a UN vote on British colonial territory, which was undoubtedly wrong. However, almost 80 years have passed since then and Israel is now an established state. I don’t believe it is feasible or right to abolish Israel and force its Jewish inhabitants to leave. 

Additionally, Israel is currently the only Jewish state in the world. Comparatively, the entirety of the Middle East as well as parts of Africa and Southeast Asia are majority Islamic. There have been multiple attempts at a two state solution, but the Palestinians say they won’t rest until they have all of Israel’s land. But why do they need all of that land when they already have the whole continent? They say they have nowhere to go, but I would argue it is the Jewish Israelis who are trapped on all sides by hostile states. Plenty of Arabs live peacefully on Jewish-owned land, but how many Jewish people can live peacefully in Islamic states? 

I will concede that the Israeli military and government are far too aggressive towards Palestinians, as is evident by the fact that there have been significantly more Palestinian casualties than Israeli ones. And I lack much knowledge when it comes to Netanyahu and his corruption. However, the recent attack by Hamas just makes it more difficult for me to not support Israel. If anyone can change my view, I’d love to hear counter arguments!"

I know almost nothing about any other religion. So I cannot give adequate coverage of the other religions, all the more so given that 4,000 religions exist. I can only paint with a broad brush.

One central teaching of Christianity is that those who die unsaved will be suffer in Hell as their rightful outcome for not believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior. (Now, of course, many Christian denominations have different interpretations, but that's the overall gist of it.) 

And one argument that many Christians use is, ""God has made His existence clear and obvious to all, along with salvation, so we have no excuse on the day of Judgment.""

Indeed, a Bible verse, Romans 1:20, even says that explicitly: ""People are **without excuse** (for not believing in and knowing God.)""

Islam says similar things; that hell awaits the unbelievers.

The problem with all this, of course, is that 1) even if God exists, His existence is not obvious at all - the very fact that mankind has been debating His existence for millennia proves that it's not obvious - and 2) there are thousands of religions in the world. How are we supposed to know which one is correct?

To add a third point, **what religion one believes in is heavily influenced by geography and one's local culture.** If you were born in Iraq, you're almost certainly going to be a Muslim; if you were born in the Bible Belt in the USA, chances are you'll be a Christian, if you were born in Thailand, you'll likely be Buddhist, if you were born in India, you'll likely be Hindu, etc. So how is someone who was born in Iraq supposed to correctly ""deduce"" that Jesus is the one true Lord any more than someone born in Oklahoma or Alabama is supposed to think that Allah is god?

So the viewpoint I would be open to being changed is this: T**here isn't sufficient evidence for any one religion - out of 4,000 - to clearly and obviously stand out as the correct one - if religion is even the correct way to go at all (how do we know atheism isn't the right path?) And as such, it is unfair for God to throw someone into Hell for not drawing the correct religion-lottery number - correctly choosing the one out of 4,000.**

Some examples as follows.

1. **Commercial Influence**: Businesses and advertisers have permeated nearly every facet of our lives. From the products we use to the content we consume, there's often a commercial agenda behind it. Even seemingly innocuous activities, like scrolling through social media or watching TV, expose us to advertising messages.

2. **Branding and Personal Identity**: People often define themselves and project their identities through the brands they associate with. From clothing to gadgets, individuals use products and logos as a form of self-expression and identity creation.

3. **Consumerism Culture**: The pervasive culture of consumerism encourages people to constantly desire new products and experiences. In this context, even personal achievements or milestones can be seen as advertisements for the consumer lifestyle.

4. **Social Media and Self-Promotion**: Social media platforms have turned individuals into personal advertisers, showcasing their lives, interests, and accomplishments. The curated images and stories shared on these platforms often serve as advertisements for a desired lifestyle.

5. **Cultural and Societal Values**: Advertisers frequently tap into societal values and cultural trends to promote their products. In doing so, they subtly influence our perceptions of what is desirable and valuable in our culture.

6. **Environmental Considerations**: Environmentalists argue that even our choices related to sustainability and eco-friendliness can be seen as advertisements for a more responsible way of living. Brands often use environmental messaging to market their products.

7. **Influence on Decision-Making**: Advertising not only affects consumer choices but also influences political opinions, public discourse, and social movements. Advocates of this theory argue that even political and social campaigns can be seen as advertisements for certain ideologies or causes.

8. **Subliminal Advertising**: Some proponents of the theory go as far as to suggest that subtle subconscious messaging in various forms can manipulate our choices and behaviors, making everything, including art and entertainment, a form of covert advertisement."
1,2023-10-08,CMV: Pro-Palestine supporters who refuse to condemn even the worst atrocities performed by Hamas can be considered terrorist-supporters and are people who condone and celebrate raping of innocent people,u/MentalAir,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/173dzb1/cmv_propalestine_supporters_who_refuse_to_condemn/,changemyview,"Full disclosure: I’m an European, who tries to understand the complexity of the topic.

 And this is what I do not comprehend - I see so many Pro-Palestinians celebrating civilians deaths and rapes. It would be so easy to say that both Hamas raping civilians and IDF beating Palestinians are wrong. You can support one side without supporting ALL their actions. But deep down they enjoy it, they love the perceived revenge. That’s why every time someone asks them “how do you feel about this woman being raped and killed” they ask “well how did you feel when..”. No, answer the question and then ask another one. They don’t regret these atrocities and it says a lot about their personality - they’re not fighting for land they’re fighting by for blood.

Take the Russia/Ukraine war - where almost everyone is on Ukraine’s side - I’m confident that if the Ukrainian army would randomly rape and kill Russian citizens most of their supporters would condemn their acts, and calling it “self defense” would be considered deranged"
1,2023-10-08,"cmv: religiosity is alive and well, including among those who reject the supernatural.",u/Accomplished_Mess243,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/173e8n5/cmv_religiosity_is_alive_and_well_including_among/,changemyview,"By religiosity I mean patterns of thinking which resemble those associated with the traditional big religions, regardless of the belief or otherwise in anything supernatural.

Happy to acknowledge that I may have used the word religiosity wrongly, but I think I've made my point clearly enough. 

I'm not having a dig at leftwing people here by the way - I think this way of thinking is a universal facet of human nature. What I would say is that on the right this instinct is more often fulfilled through adherence to trad religions, whereas on the left it's more likely to be through secular belief systems.

A lot of that comes from very complex arguments about intelligence. A ton of which have contradictions and mostly hinge on humans having higher intelligence, thus being held to a higher responsibility than other animals.

Animals like deer for instance are opportunists and will eat baby birds if given the chance, even predators like cats eat vegetation to clean their teeth and for gut health.

Animals do not carry the same level of higher intelligence and thus are not beholden to our ethical conundrums. A predator in the wild, or an opportunistic omnivore might eat another animal when they typically do not. Nature is cruel afterall.

Though we are omnivores, I feel we can partake in this cycle and eat meat. I don't however condone unethical or cruel treatment and death to animals. I think since we hold a higher level of intelligence we can use both our empathy, and our better understanding of how death works to both raise farm animals and slaughter them. I also feel it is dumb and ecologically pointless to eat larger animals such as pigs, and cows. I'm not talking from a point of intelligence on that one - I speaking from a health based PoV. Red meat is straight up unhealthy and hard on our bodies. Where as poultry and fish contain lean meat and healthy fats.

I do realize that a VAST majority of our meat industry around the world is unethical and morally wrong, but you can try to eat as ethically as you can, and change your habits when you learn news that what you've consumed may not be ethical.

There are smaller countries and societies that do not have as easy a time obtaining protein from alternative sources, and I don't think they can be faulted for eating animals.

I understand some people view animals as creatures we shouldn't interfere with, but I don't think that's 100% reasonable. Animals would and do kill people everyday. Hikers die to wildcats, and bears etc. etc. Sure maybe not as food, but there are carion eaters that will eat us later.

To me it comes down to a pascifism argument. Would you fight a cougar to the death if it was attacking you?

Would you interfere in another animal hunting, or a territorial spat?

Eating animals to me is fine. We NEED to do it as ethically as possible, but this is not and never will be a black and white problem. I see callous meat eaters who show little respect or candor to the animals they eat, and I see vegans who completely condemn even the act of pet ""ownership"" which is a whole other complex issue where there are clearly wrong ways to do and right ways to do it.

To many people zero in on a core solidified set of beliefs divide themselves with lines rather than looking at the complexity of a problem (ESPECIALLY WITH ANIMALS!)

I have tried to eat vegan and find it hard to maintain muscle in doing so. Protein is a very important macro nutrient that we use for basic regenerative processes. Without a large amount of it manual labor becomes harder, we get hungry more often, and we recover slower.

We can obviously source it through beans and the like, but the amount is no where near as good a source of protein.

I like to think people would be able to step outside themselves and discuss these ethical problems, with more nuance than ""eat meat = bad person"" or ""not eating meat is boring give me all the steak!""

I have yet to meet anyone who can have a well meaning discussion without moral extremes or absolute apathy.

And honestly it's just made me hate people more and more.

I'd like to see if there is anyone out there who can have a sane and regulated discussion about good ways to eat meat in as ethical a way as we are able. I post this knowing full well that I'm not exactly making this easy to do, and that I'm asking for somebody to see my side here, but who knows maybe I can be turned into an apathetic red meat crazed carnivore, or maybe I can be converted into a completely pacisfistic vegan who has to juggle nutrtition everyday and pay out the ass for food that doesn't fill me.

I doubt it.

I mostly just want to see if there are people who view these ethical problems as complex iasues that they actually are."

I agree it's selfish but I also feel like they overstate how much it'll ""bother"" the person getting the confession.   I feel like if I were on the receiving end (as in I'm the person in the relationship), I'd definitely feel sad for my friend and account for that and put the necessary distance, but I wouldn't be losing sleep over it.  On the other hand, I'd feel like the friend who confessed to me now had some ""release"", and at least it won't be hanging over them as long.  And assuming I'm in a good relationship with my partner anyways, I think my partner will trust me.  I feel like the alternative of them holding it in, hurting and letting it spiral, and me hanging around them not knowing how they feel would be worse.  Even if they took the third route and just slowly ghosted out of my life with no explanation, I feel like \*that\* would be more hurtful, but yet ppl seem to think that's the better approach."

1. The position that zionists and jews take towards christians as blasphemers and gentiles. Remember, Christians and Muslims see the world peoples as one body, united under God. Jews on the other hand see themselves as divinely gifted, gods chosem people, meant to lead the rest of the gentiles as basically cattle are led by a farmer.

2. The jews and Israel have played the key role in the utter destruction of chrisendom. If you don't even know what ""Chrisendom"" is , that's  evidence of the subversion. Chrisendom is what we called the countries of the west for centuries, before the west was reconstituted after world War 2 as a globalist, multicultural, antichristian, antiwhite melting pot, used as a power base for Israel.

\- If you believe the Hamas escalations are justified based on whatever happened in the past, then you should also expect that any retaliation from Israel can also be justified with the same reasoning. Eye-for-an-eye, cycle of violence, all that. Israel can raze Gaza to the ground with this logic.

\- If you believe the Hamas escalations aren't justified, then Israel is still justified in matching the escalation, which will still likely involve the invasion of Gaza to remove Hamas completely.

Also don't give me the ""Israel is the occupier"" crybaby story. Gaza had an independent government for almost 2 decades, their citizens' wellbeing is not really Israel's problem. If they bought some books instead of the missiles and weapons they'd be much better off right now."

I can understand why palestinians were cheering for the death of israelis, the hatred doesnt come out of nothing.
Every palestinian has had atleast one or more family members that have been killed by the israelis.
Israelis hate palestinians aswell, and alot advocate for the eradication of Gaza, but it is expected for palestinians to hate them much more,afterall they killed them and kicked them out of their land

At the end i see people everywhere on reddit waiting for idf to eliminate the entirety of gaza, for what happend 2 days ago
Why werent people waiting for hamas to strike back after israel murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent palestinians and kicked them out of their homes?

Iam truly sad for what happend to these israeli civilians aswell, but it all started in 1948 when you murdered the families of these people.

1,2023-10-09,cmv: a benevolent god would appreciate non-believers more than believers,u/_ynic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/173pei2/cmv_a_benevolent_god_would_appreciate/,changemyview,"Pre notice: my religious knowledge is limited. I have a Christian background but do not personally believe in a god, but I obviously don't mind people who do believe in a higher power.

My argument is based on the fact that from my own personal point of view I don't see any point in believing in god, however I understand that different people have different values and that even if my point listed is correct for most people that doesn't mean they should stop believing.

Whenever I talked to people in my direct and indirect cycle about beliefs (yes possible in a friendly and respectful manner) I never really received a counter argument to any extend.

My claim is, imagine you are god (please don't treat this as a superiority complex) if you look over humanity, as a all knowing or not being, we can say ""wise"" father figure - he is literally described as such in Christianity from what I was taught in church. 

Would you be more prouder of someone who is a good person when they don't believe in you versus a person who is similarly as good but do believe in you.

Now in order for that to make sense you need to take up the hat of a parental figure. You tell your kid what is right and they listen or don't. Maybe you tell them don't steal your brother's toys. Would you feel more proud of your child if they didn't when you were watching over them and they knew you were observing or would you be prouder of your child if they didn't steal their brother's toys when you didn't watch them and they had the chance to do so without you knowing.

Now my argument is that a father figure would be prouder of anyone being a good person when not believing in god, because there is an argument that good people who believe act that way because they know/believe that God is watching.

There is also the argument of the after life. While hell is not really a part of the Bible that I learned in church, it is certainly a big part of today's believers or at least the loud minority's.

Aren't your efforts to be a ""good person"" worth less when done in service of avoiding eternal damnation or in order to get into heaven? 

I don't think if you believe in God your actions can be counted as 100% selfless. If you believe you will be rewarded for your good deeds they become investments.

I understand I am generalising a lot here. What does it mean to be good and how can people be equally good. However that is needed in order for my thought experiment to make sense.

If you are a bad person, you are a bad person, doesn't matter if you believe in God or not, however my argument refers to the fact that I never saw any point in believing in god from a moral and philosophical perspective, since I am a better person by my own values but not doing so.

Again I understand that those represent my values in life and I don't judge people who have different values."

Trump actually did a lot to curb COVID.  
  
He started the project to get us vaccines.  
  
At first news of COVID, he stopped all flights to and from China, which makes sense.  
  
Democrats then said this was racist and came up with ""Hug a Chinese person"" day or whatever it was called (don't quote me on this!). Regardless of nationality, hugging spreads germs!  
  
Since March 2020, the states that were locked down the most were democrat-run states. The lockdown itself and the abrupt unavailability of resources was what caused the ripple problems, especially domestically and mentally.  
  
Initially, we were all under the impression that this lockdown would only last two weeks. However, THEY KEPT EXTENDING IT, making things far worse. Worse on unemployment, worse on the supply chain, worse on inflation, worse on mental health.  
  
The same crowd who criticized Trump for ""doing nothing"" would also have criticized Trump had he said ""let's everyone stay home for 2 weeks to contain this virus. No going anywhere, just stay home."" Because they'd be saying stuff like ""Trump can't tell me what to do! This is tyranny!""  
  
No, the democratic governors are the tyrants who lied to us about ""2 weeks"" and overstepped their boundaries to shut us down until they felt like it. This was not Trump's fault. Trump was trying to keep the country running. Initially, he didn't think COVID was serious. None of us did! We got virus scares all the time, like West Nile, SARS, Hantavirus, Avian Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola, HIV, but we never crippled the economy because of them.  
  
Those protesters who protested lockdowns in April 2020, I supported them 100%, especially in Michigan and Pennsylvania.  
  
That and also, it's the 21st Century, so he had sound reason to believe that contagious diseases were not a serious health issue anymore. It's not like we're still dying of Cholera or Diphtheria like it's 1900. He knew a vaccine was the best defense against a virus, which is why he undertook Operation Warp Seed.  
  
After this, I'm thoroughly surprised any democrats hold any power after they did this to us in 2020."

Should a collection of attributes that form a term in other context describing something you‘re born with be solved, or embraced? Or does my question come from misunderstanding?

I hope to get a better understanding of the connections of culture, personal identity, and attributes you are born with, specifically how these things inform a definition of a self identity.

This won‘t be an attack on as an example trans people, and how „they shouldn‘t allow the operation to transition“, since this is just embarrassingly silly by now. The outcome of my questions won‘t change the fact that only very very few regret transitioning, and they do probably because of a large variety of reasons. Not because „they realized they are wrong“.

Simone de Beauvoir said that a woman isn‘t just something you are born into, but that through make up, dresses, and everything society has as a picture of a woman, one becomes a woman by adopting those traits (passively, or actively). I‘d dare to say that this counts not only for other genders, but also for some other things like ethnicity. In times of even more stereotypes this also concerned sexual orientation, until about two decades ago, where sexual orientation finally got separated from the other attributes it was brought in connection with. (You can be gay without needing to be flaming gay around everyone.) This brings me to my next point.

The first time I heard Simone de Beauvior‘s definition of womanhood, I thought the following should be done: Make language completely gender neutral instead of inclusive (I come from Germany where every noun is either maskuline, feminine, or neutral.), and overcome these attribute collections, by making each attribute that can form a personal identity possible to anyone, effectively destroying these social pictures, and using male, female, neutral, black, white, etc. only for the aspects they were born with for stuff like visual descriptions, or biology class and stuff.

But this was not apparently what everyone thought. I see far more the reaction of making it possible for everyone to be in the collection of attributes they like.

So this is my first question: Which option do you think is better? Or did I already now misunderstand something?

My second question is a little more general, and still will probably have a more personal aspect for many: What should make your personal identity?

Me being born with white skin color and having the male sex is not important to me. It probably is a partial cause for some of the attributes that I define myself with, but when I want someone to know me, I mean that they should know my character and my actions, not my gender or skin color. I want to treat people based on their decisions, so that is how I identify myself.

But that is an extremely subjective view. Others might find these qualities quite important to define themselves and their treatment of others! Also: Me having the male sex makes it more possible to identify me, since that description excludes around half of the population, so it definitely is part of my „objective“ identity. I just don‘t consider it important to my personal identity.

Is one view of looking at it better, and healthier than another?

What are your thoughts?

Sorry, if I offended anyone! It definitely wasn‘t intentional if that happened. I am just interested in sophisticated thought behind all this, to get a better view. I hope this was all OK."

The reason most crappy laws get passed is because congress is full of geriatrics who won't live long enough to see the impact of their crappy laws.

A ripe range for public office should be between 35 and 65, and all public offices on every level should be subject to two four year terms. That way we have fresh ideas and circulating young blood and might lower the tap on corruption in congress.

I mean, the reason politicians stay in office for 30+ years is because we keep electing them, but there needs to be young blood circulating so that way we don't have the stale corrupt state that we have of congress and elected officials in general.

A perfect example of this was Syria, which was secular, had a booming middle class, and state of the art nationalized college and healthcare. The people there/ the Arab spring movement in Syria genuinely wanted a natural evolution to democracy through peaceful protest, but over 60% of the rebels we armed were violent religious extremists who were ideologically aligned with Isis.

Iran, Iraq and Libya all were secular or at least much more secular before the US intervened. Syria would have been the next to be overtaken by Sharia law, and it still could be.

Also, probably the clearest example of this is Israel, where they mistake our arms deals and the worlds acceptance of them as god given states' rights. There are many videos of Zionist CHILDREN chanting ""death to all Arabs."" Now I can understand the argument that Iran would fund and give weapons to HAMAS but in such a scenario as the world police force and ""peacemakers"" we should be spending our resources stopping that from happening, rather than just funding the other side in a race to see who can bomb the most people first. As Israel is thinking that their power of their bombs comes from God, when it is really coming from weapon manufacturers, and the world allowing this type of arms dealing to take place.

Saudi Arabia has committed the worst genocides in our century, and one of Trumps wildest moments was showing a recycling looking infographic with red arrows pointing from a pile of guns, to Saudi Arabia, to a pile of money, to the US.

Sorry! Just throwing that out there because I don't want anyone accusing me of soapboxing or being unwilling to CMV if the responses aren't convincing. I do want to hear people out of course, but that doesn't mean it'll be good enough to CMV.

I hear the term ""facts don't care about your feelings"" thrown around a lot due to a variety of reasons, but I hold the personal belief that this is false and I'll be numbering my points to explain it.

1. Humans have feelings, and they mean way more to us as individuals then facts do. This is why humans have been religious for countless, countless years. The idea of death is scary, so people subscribe to myths that deny what we know of reality today to cope with that. And in my book that's perfectly okay and apart of human nature (as it's literally been observed for countless years).

2. Of course, I know that alone won't make my viewpoint strong enough. So my second point is, if someone were to subscribe to an idea that's as absolute as ""facts are more important then feelings,"" then you'd also have to subscribe to some very *very* unethicle practices because the reality is that facts are *cold*.

For example, let's state some facts: humanity would benifit from a stronger genepool, the ability to monitor genes, putting computor chips into literally everyone and monitoring every human, there's more I can say but I bet you get the gist of that now.

So, I'm willing to bet that most of you disagree that these facts should be implimented. Why? Well, it's simple: because it's *highly* unethicle and immoral. If you could somehow debunk an example I gave as something that could benifit humanity, I'd implore you to think of a fact that would be extremely unethicle to implement.

So, what we've established is that ethics and morals are the driving force in saying ""no"" to these facts. Where do ethics and morals come from? Our feelings and emotions. There's no real logical basis to deny the facts I've stated besides the fact  that you would be emotional over your special needs brother getting killed for a ""stronger gene pool,""or your child secretly having their genes changed. Which, is a perfectly reasonable reaction to facts like those.

So, in conclusion, I don't subscribe to the notion that facts are more important then peoples feelings because if that notion was taken to it's logical extensions, then the only thing stopping us from being cold and heartless is our feelings."

Billions were allocated to the IRS which was not favorable by one of the parties. These funds were for many things, including the hiring of new IRS personnel (they would replace and expand the work force). 



*“I direct that any additional resources – including any new personnel or auditors that are hired – shall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels,” she (Yellen) wrote in a six to Rettig in August.*

So with the new funds, the IRS was supposed to target higher earning individuals and businesses (along with updates to systems and other things). 

But I’m sure as you all know, the IRS lowered the dollar amount for reporting income earned on apps like PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay and so on. If you acquired $20,000 or more in transactions, you would have to report that to the IRS. That has been lowered to only $600. 



$600 over the course of the year is absolutely nothing to median earners and those earning under a quarter million a year. 

Can someone make that make sense? They claim the new people would be for people and businesses earning close to half a million or more…

BUT!

They lower the requirements for reporting from $20,000… to $600, encompassing millions more of Americans (who would more than likely would never send $20k+ in that manner). 

So come tax time next year, I think millions of Americans will be surprised when they get a letter from the IRS noting that they didn’t mention the combined $1,000 your dad, mom, grandma sent you for your birthday. Or the combined $800 dollars your friends sent to you over the year for paying you back for dinner. 

Good think thing the IRS will start to have more personnel over the decade to handle this. 
Coincidence? I think not."

In fact, it's counterintuitive.",u/SmartestElf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/173ztlj/cmv_kids_dont_need_to_be_so_sheltered_by_their/,changemyview,"I believe the degree to which most people shelter their kids is insane, and extremely harmful in some cases. Don't get me wrong, I think there is certainly a kid friendly and non-kid friendly way to share info with children, but some people outright refuse to tell their kids about entire aspects of the human experience. I've seen it most in majorly Christian circles. They don't even want their kids to know that other mindsets or ways of thinking exist. It causes their children to be completely unprepared for and unwilling to accept anyone else's views. I also think the majority of society shelters kids too much from a lot. They don't want their kids to know sex exists, death exists, evil people exist. The extent most kids see if whatever is in their fictional movies and books, but they are completely sheltered from any real world issue. A lack of sex education leads to high rates of teen pregnancy, STDs, sexual assults, sexual injury, etc. People think by not talking about sex with their child, they are keeping then from having it. In reality, they're preventing their ability to have it safely. Let's be real, some teens start being interested in and having sex earlier than most people wanna think about, but it's reality. Stronger education means hopefully less issues. Kids are sheltered from murder, crime, politics, and any other ""scary"" or ""inappropriate"" thing. Obviously there is only so much a child's brain should be subjected to, but having them completely oblivious and unprepared for how fucked up the world is seems counterproductive. I believe if more and more of reality was exposed to the youth, that gradually over time we would evolve as a species and be better at dealing with the bad parts of life. Again, I do think there are things not appropriate for children, but the complete lack of exposure I've seen personally is just as problematic. I believe kids should be protected from the bad things in life, but not ""protected"" from the FACT that bad things exist. I think it largely has to do with a lot of people wanting to be ignorant themselves. They are scared of reality, so they ignore or refuse to educate themselves, then pass that on to their children. I don't think it's ever to early for education, just how you go about it is important. I do hope I'm articulating my thoughts properly. It will help once people reply and I can clarify certain instances of how and why I think things would be better as a result."

$140000 for the project ""RAIN""(that appears to be just a dubious presentation long after the funder has forgotten about their money)  
and several hundred thousand dollars more for other ""research projects"" related to AI ethics and transparency.  
The funniest part is that he claimed on a number of occasions that he has been cleared of the accusations by NPOF(a Swedish institution investigating academic misconduct) but NPOF writes the following:

>  
Thank you for your inquiryWe received a report regarding Andreas Theodorou and his dissertation in 2020. Theodorou made the dissertation in the UK. The dissertation is not made within Swedish jurisdiction and can not be investigated by Npof.Kind regardsRegistrator

  
and his alma mater for obvious reasons refuses to investigate him.  
All the while he is being aggressively promoted and protected by V.D a self-promoting AI-ethics professor who among academics is considered highly proficient in academic politics.  
As a linguist I consider this case plagiarism but I think it's extremely unlikely that any action will be taken for the official investigation of the case as the accused has amassed a number of institutional qualifications making it improbable that any institution will take action against him without some sort of formal certificate(as such certificate will protect them from any negative reaction against them) of his misconduct which will not happen.

The African-American population has its origins from ethnic groups that belonged to various tribes in their homeland. One of these imaginary tribes are the Aleab people. The Aleab people make up only 0.5% of the African American population, but are extremely wealthy. They own 70% of all American capital. Each Aleab person lives in a palace made of pure gold and has 100 permanent servants.  
  
In contrast, non-Aleab African Americans live in extreme poverty. They have a literacy rate of only 20% and are often starving to death. They often even have to cannibalize their own children just to survive.  
The Aleab people are counted along with the non-Aleab people as black or African American. Thanks to the enormous wealth of the Aleab people, the average family income of the entire African American population is significantly higher than that of other races. Afro-Americans are represented in all positions of fame and honor (of course only Aleab Afro-Americans.)  
  
Would it be fair to say that non-Aleab African Americans are privileged? Isn't it audacious to talk about black privilege in this scenario?  Certainly only the Aleab people are privileged in this scenario, African Americans as a whole are underprivileged.  
  
A similar, although of course much less crass, scenario also exists in the real world.  
White people are often said to have privileges, economic privileges. “White Privilege” is often mentioned in this context.   
  
But just like in our fictional scenario, there is only a small sub-group of whites who are overprivileged: Jews. If Jews are excluded from the education, company ownership and income statistics, white people are somewhat underprivileged, i.e. underrepresented relative to their share of the population.

How did people find out, you ask?

By the fact that their emergency alert messages went off on their cellphones.

Now, if a grown adult wants to put their own life in danger just to appease an insane demand from an insane community, they have every right to, as much morally as they do legally.

What they do *not* have the right to do at least morally; and shouldn’t legally; is the right to either bring a child to such a community, or have kids in such a community and keep them.

What is the best case scenario for such a community? You’re using smuggled cellphones so you can receive emergency alerts. Congratulations, you just taught your sons and daughters to associate deceit with safety. And for what? To avoid only one flaw in that community’s worldview? If they’re wrong about that one, what *else* could they be wrong about?

And in practice this could create incentive to leave the cellphone at home when going to venues that search belongings. In which case you might not get the info to save your life in time… or that of your child.

Adults consent to this risk, but children do not. If your community forbids cellphones, even used to receive emergency alerts, children should be removed from that community by the state on account of reckless endangerment and given to any of the many couples out there that are willing to adopt."

So I’m 22 and kinda struggling with dating right now, as I’ve been for the entirety of my life and I’m getting to a point where I think incels are seeming more correct than not correct. I wouldn’t call myself an incel as I can see that there’s a lot of misogyny present in incel groups, but I don’t see how a lot of what they’re saying about modern dating is wrong.

So the foundation of incel beliefs is the black pill, that because of the way certain people are born, they are not going to be able to be sexually or romantically successful. Which I don’t understand how that’s false. First, it’s just nature. Males with desirable genes are able to attract females while males with undesirable gene dont. I don’t see why that isn’t the same for humans. Men who are tall, handsome, healthy and masculine will pass down their traits. Those men are the men who are able to attract the most women.

I’m aware there are outliers, but overall if you take a guy that’s 6’2 blonde hair blue eyes 210 with a low body fat percentage, he’s going to attract significantly more women than a guy that’s 5’8, and missing those other factors. This isn’t to say personality doesn’t matter, I’m sure it plays a role, but I doubt it plays as big of a role as looks. And I don’t see how that misogynistic to think so.

I think from that basic level incels are right and it branches out to other aspect of incel beliefs."

It's my believe that israel should consider embracing a one-state solution with power-sharing arrangements similar to those seen in Lebanon to promote stability, inclusivity, and long-term peace in the region.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has endured for decades, with no comprehensive resolution in sight. The traditional two-state solution, which envisions separate Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting side by side, has faced numerous challenges, including territorial disputes, security concerns, and the status of Jerusalem. As a result, some proponents argue that a one-state solution could provide a more sustainable path to peace.

One of the key principles of the proposed one-state solution is power-sharing, mirroring Lebanon's approach to religious diversity. In Lebanon, the presidency is reserved for a Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament is a Shia Muslim. This system helps balance the interests of the country's diverse religious groups and prevents one group from dominating the government. Israel could adopt a similar model, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches divided equally between Israelis and Palestinians.

Advocates of this approach argue that it would address several longstanding issues:

A one-state solution would offer equal citizenship to Israelis and Palestinians, granting them the same rights and responsibilities. This inclusivity could foster a sense of belonging among all residents, regardless of their ethnic or religious background, and promote a shared national identity.

Combining the security forces of both communities could lead to more effective cooperation in maintaining peace and stability. Joint security efforts could help prevent violence and terrorism, reducing the need for military interventions and checkpoints that have been sources of tension.

A unified state could create a larger, more diversified economy with greater potential for growth. The pooling of resources and expertise from both communities could lead to economic development that benefits all citizens.

A one-state solution might gain broader international support compared to the contentious two-state proposal. It could be perceived as a more just and equitable way to address the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.

A single state would necessitate the negotiation and agreement on the status of contested territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Such negotiations could lead to a more comprehensive, lasting solution to territorial disputes.

A power-sharing arrangement that respects the diverse religious traditions of both communities would help protect the religious rights of all citizens, ensuring that no one group dominates or discriminates against others."

Their reasoning was quite sympathetic: African Americans had been ripped from their homeland and sold into slavery, and the prospects for a life of free and equal dignity in the United States looked slim. So they decided to return to their ancestral homeland and found a new nation.

Unfortunately, there were already people living in Liberia when the Americo-Liberians built their colony there. The Americo-Liberians had been changed by their time in the United States - they spoke English, wore Western clothes, and brought Mainline Protestant religions with them. In many ways, they had become foreigners in Africa. And they looked down on the ""indigenous"" inhabitants of Liberia, denying members of the indigenous ethnicities living in the area birthright citizenship until 1904.

[This page](https://jewishstudies.washington.edu/israel-hebrew/why-israel-isnt-a-settler-colonial-state/) tries to argue that Israel isn't a settler colonial state, and its first argument is that settler colonialism requires a metropole, a mother country, which supports the colony. But Liberia provides the counter example. Americo-Liberians had no metropole - they hailed from the United States, sure, but the United States didn't recognize Liberia until 1862, and it was private organizations like the American Colonization Society that supported the formation of Liberia very early on.

Now, much like the Americo-Liberians, I believe that the Jewish people had a sympathetic reason for wanting a Jewish nation state. After the Holocaust, it wasn't unreasonable to believe that the Jewish disapora would remain forever vulnerable inside of hostile gentile nations.

However, much like the Americo-Liberians, the Jewish settlers displaced the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine. The [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba) occurred in 1948, and saw the flight of 700,000 indigenous Palestinians. Sure, you could say that both the Americo-Liberians and the Jewish settlers had some claim to the territories they settled - Americo-Liberians, as African Americans, hailed from Africa in the past, and Israel is the ancient homeland of the Jewish people.

But just as the Americo-Liberians had been made foreign by their time as African Americans, the Jewish people coming back to Palestine were not the same as the Jewish diaspora of yore."

His reign is accompanied by a general increase in political polarization across all sides of the (US) political spectrum.

2020: COVID happens, which disrupts life all over the globe, and ruins China-US relations even further (and honestly, China-alotofcountries relations as well). Around the same time, China wins in Hong Kong.

2021: Biden becomes POTUS, withdraws US from Afghanistan after too long.

Early 2022: Russia goes crazy and invades Ukraine. US + NATO support Ukraine. Russia doesn't do so well at first, thank goodness, but gosh, it seems that they're persistent.

Late 2022: ChatGPT comes out. Beginning of the Great AI Revolution or whatever you wanna call it. We are probably underestimating the ramifications of this on the economy.

2023, present: Palestine invades Israel. Lemme check, looks like Russia is still invading Ukraine. Sigh.

*2024-2030, future: China invades Taiwan? Realistically it'd probably go even worse than Ukraine, but the million dollar question is, would that honestly stop China from trying? Definitely even more political polarization.*

I just don't really see a positive way out of this. On top of all of the above, rents are rising, the economy is suffering, climate change is wreaking havoc, and people are simply losing motivation and becoming less rational around the world.

Will nukes be involved? I sure hope not. But nukes or no nukes, it definitely looks like a storm is brewing across the horizon."

I agree, Israel has committed many war crimes over many years and that is unacceptable. But the attack on Israel was never going to have beneficial results for anyone living in Gaza. Experts believe the attack was in part to undermine the Israeli-Saudi deal. I won’t comment on that, that deal can be halted and undermined so that HAMAS can maintain power or gain influence. If that is not the route to peace that HAMAS wants, fine. But the way they went about it meant they knowingly sacrificed their own population. 

I’m not saying Israel’s response is just or okay. But it is not at all unexpected. HAMAS knew that the people they are supposed to be representing and fighting for would suffer as a result of their attack. That bomb after bomb would rain down and kill children and the elderly and everyone and everything. But they did it anyway. Not for freedom, not for clean water, for economic power. 

And I’m not even going to comment on the morals of that. I am only commenting on the people who are celebrating HAMAS for fighting back, this is not a fight for the Palestinian people. It is a fight by HAMAS, for HAMAS.

All wars are devastating, I know that. But this war was a surprise to Gazans, too. And I keep hearing people who have no relation to any of this applaud it simply because they hate Israel. I am all for Palestinian liberation, but this is not the event anyone has been waiting for.

Even worse  anti-immigration laws and efforts only cause problems.

For example, if you build a wall, that will drastically slow down the rate of immigration, but simultaneously cause a bottle neck of people that results in chaos and criminality.

People that would have come in, work, pay taxes and use good and services like the rest of us, are now being smuggled, hiding and breaking the law. They can't even pay taxes for their work! How dumb is that?

Another example is that people that are not allowed to work resort to lowering their prices to be able to compete with legal workers.


The one and ONLY reason people want to stop immigrants from working is fear. 

fear of competition.

fear of people that look different than us.

That's it. There is nothing but irrational fears

 Fear then becomes hate and hate translates to even more immigration laws and even more problems for all.


If there are any population problems, a certain area already has too many people, then locals should pay a lower tax rate and immigrants a higher tax rate in those places with a chance to eventually earning the ""local"" label.

[Wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) is a term frequently thrown around to describe a situation where employers maximise profit by keeping wages as low as possible. However, unlike actual slavery, in ""wage slavery"":

* You are legally allowed to quit your job, albeit at a financial risk to yourself
* You can't be traded between employers against your will
* You have the rights of a worker (which admittedly varies widely between countries), and your employer isn't allowed to physically or sexually abuse you

To call it ""wage slavery"" is equivalent to the [gun owners wearing yellow star badges](https://www.timesofisrael.com/website-offers-yellow-star-patches-for-persecuted-gun-owners/) \- sure, the gun owners are entitled to their opinion that they are losing their gun rights, but their action cheapens the suffering of Holocaust victims. 

Me saying that the term ""wage slavery"" cheapens the suffering of actual slaves is not a dismissal of the huge economic problems we have to fix. To replace the term ""wage slavery"", we should be talking of stagnant wages, wage theft, unaffordable housing and inadequate social safety nets - and we should be taking action to relieve those problems."
1,2023-10-10,CMV: Israel has no choice but to annihilate Hamas.,u/Hatook123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174gslq/cmv_israel_has_no_choice_but_to_annihilate_hamas/,changemyview,"First I want to say what this post isn't about - I am not here to talk about History or what led us to this situation - mostly because it's a much more complex topic than people often realize, but also because I doubt any of you can change my mind regarding the history of the conflict, frankly I believe I heard it all. In my view, the fact is that there are over 10 Million people from both sides that have nowhere else to go and have to learn to live with each other, the history of the conflict just doesn't matter all that much. 

For context, there are at least 900 dead and over a hundred taken captive - most of which are civilians. 
In past conflicts, where the number of deaths were limited to few dozens at most, and the sense of security of the general populace wasn't severely damaged - the government could easily contain the conflict. They would shoot down a few weapon caches, and killed a few Hamas opperatives to show they mean business, but essentially they didn't change the geopolitical situation, colleteral damage was limited, and it was only a matter of time until the next conflict.

Now that Hamas killed so many, and essentially proved without a shadow of a doubt that they are the Islamic terrorists Israel has always feared, there is just no way the geopolitical situation can remain the same - I mean if they were actually the freedom fighters they claim to be, they could have decided to target military targets and spared the hundreds of civilians that ran for their lives. The sense of security Israelis had is long gone, and there is no way the country can just let it go - add to that the fact that Iran and Hezbollah are watching, can Israel really afford showing the rest of its enemies that it just doesn't care about something of this magnitude? 

Now, here's why I want my mind changed - overthrowing Hamas government in Gaza will result in many, many deaths. Since understandably, Israel cares more about its citizens and soldiers than the Gazans - they will carpet bomb entire neighborhoods to minimize deaths when going in for ground assaults. 
Keep in mind that Hamas leaderships are based in bunkers, and that any Gazan could be a terrorist waiting for them as far as Israel is concerned. 

I really don't see a realistic way for Israel to handle this situation that doesn't involve tons of collateral damage. And as sad as it makes me, I honestly don't feel like I care anymore - not because it isn't horrible, but because I don't think there is much of a choice here. Hamas has to be annihilated, and the collateral damage is a given, especially when Hamas goes out of its way to put civilians in harms way.

My only hope here is that this war will result in turning Gaza into more of Japan after pearl Harbor, rather than it turning to Afghanistan after 9/11. I still don't see an alternative choice either way."

What can't people condemn the attack by Hamas and look for the reasons why such an abhorrent attack took place, and why don't they criticise the Israel blockade of the Gaza, which brought this killing spree?
People really have a myopic vision here. They are really happy that America is going yo supply weapons to Israel to help kill Palestinians, and USS Gerald R. Ford will make sure this is done in a smooth manner? How does that show that you have a better mentality than those terrorists?

The majority of the Palestinians are young men, and unlike Israel, they have been displaced from their homes and brutally murdered before. Why can't we focus on their education and removal of the blockade?
Has Europe forgotten the history lessons from the past that when you Corner a person and take everything away from him, you have essentially provided them the tools for violence. Just imagine yourself living in a place that is cut off from the rest of the world, and in your lifespan, you have been placed into a confined area and monitored. Your parents have been killed. Your brothers and sisters don't have anything to eat and are being starved to death. You want to go, but you can't leave. How can you not develop hate and lose the meaning of life?

My stance of fans service in anime have long been ""I understand people are uncomfortable with various sexual topics but other people might also enjoy those. As long as people understand that it's fine.""

Then I saw a video essay on some early new milliemum cartoon when a line came out saying there was a long strench of time where cartoons were heavily sexualizing teenagers. I had to pause because I couldn't quite deny that. 

Teens do get sexualized a lot in cartoons. I started to watch old episodes of Clone high in prep of the reboot and that theme song straight out has the term ""sexy teens."" This is a trend, from family friendly entertainment of Disney (Jamzine age 15) to adult shows (Seth McFarlane's profile include Roberta Tubs age 15 and Meg Griffin who's only been 18 in recent seasons and was 16-17 before.)

This isn't even touching the murky water that are live action high-school dramas , which are usually people in their 20s portraying teens for the extent purpose of allowing sexualization.

And just all that existing doesn't bother me. I understand that those are the stories the writers wanted to tell and it doesnt reflect their real life views (hopefully). What bothers me is that I didn't even notice it before.

For the most part people don't bring this. It's normalized. Opposite of anime fan service which is very openly mocked by people including myself.

When I say xenophobia I don't mean strictly mean hostility because it's foreign but more that anime is not really Main stream as other forms of entertainment. Even more niche vs cartoons.

Why I want my view changed or how to change my view:

The fact that a video pointed the issue out to me means that maybe more people are aware of this then I am. Maybe if I was shown awareness the situation would settle better with me.

There is also a possibility that this is all a matter of time. I personally grew up with Disney and Seth McFarlane shows so maybe those are just older. I have seen some things tone down a little in Family Guy, specifically around Quagmire's character. So it might just be older media having not caught up with social change and that we no longer do that. 

You could also show that the sexualization is different in some way."

Why can't people condemn Hamas' attack while also seeking to understand the reasons behind such a horrific act? Why is there no criticism of Israel's blockade of Gaza, which has contributed to this cycle of violence?

Many seem to have a narrow perspective on this issue. There appears to be support for America supplying weapons to Israel to combat Palestinians, with the USS Gerald R. Ford ensuring smooth operations. But how does this mentality differ from that of the terrorists?

The majority of Palestinians are young men who, unlike their Israeli counterparts, have been displaced from their homes and subjected to brutal violence. Shouldn't our focus be on their education and lifting the blockade?

Has Europe forgotten its history? When you corner someone and strip them of everything, you essentially equip them with tools for violence. Imagine living in a place cut off from the world, confined and under constant surveillance. Imagine losing your parents, watching your siblings starve because there's nothing to eat. You want to leave but can't. Wouldn't such conditions breed hatred and despair?

While I sympathize with the innocent Israelis affected by this conflict, I hope for an end to further bloodshed and believe that Palestinian lives should be valued equally. No life should be considered superior to another."

The Republicans are not even trying to hide their intentions to turn the US into a theocratic illiberal dictatorship.

GOP is literally Evangelical Taliban. The Republicans tried to carry out a coup on January 6, 2021, they want to abolish women's rights, they dehumanize LGBT-folks and people of colour.   
The GOP will flood American education with Christian extremist propaganda.   
  
Project 2025, Trump’s open threats to execute a general for following the Constitution, and to begin political repression against the Democrats. Republicans clearly intend to never transfer power if they win in 2024. They know that they are a minority saved only by the electoral system, that the Christian Boomers are dying off and their fate is sealed in a fair game. They want to break the system and rules, establish an illiberal dictatorship. This is what both Trump and DeSantis want.

  
Trump is very likely planning to withdraw from NATO and destroy Western Unity. Go to isolationism and allow dictatorships to divide the world into spheres of influence. A weakened and demilitarized Europe will be forced to capitulate to Russia. Russia will swallow Ukraine and thereby undermine international law. Taiwan's fate will also turned grim.   
This will also give impetus to the far-right fifth column in the EU countries, which has also been gaining strength all these years. Trump's victory in 2024 is literally Hitler's rise to power in 1933. This will be the end of NATO and will put the EU on the brink of collapse under Russian-Chinese-Iranian pressure.  
This will be the collapse of the Liberal world order, this is the end of international law and the principle of the inviolability of borders. This will energize autocracies around the world. They will vigorously attack democracies, knowing that the liberal hegemon and world policeman is no more.  
Trump's victory is the end of human rights as a principle in international politics.  
  
And in these conditions, when the extremist essence of MAGA, although let's face it: GOP, is publicly voiced by Biden and progressive politicians, it is absolutely not clear to me how one can talk about any rules and fair play. Democrats must be willing to play dirty like Republicans do, or they will become worm food. Even the establishment of a dictatorship by the Democratic Party and/or actual theft of the election results (the 2020 elections were completely fair) is a lesser evil than allowing far-right extremists to seize power in the United States. Democrats won't be the same as Republicans if they do this.  
  
Remember the tolerance of Paradox. Tolerance of intolerance leads to the collapse of tolerance."

The only reason to apply any caveat to a blanket rejection of the kidnap, torture, and murder of civilians is that a person feels that they would act the same way if placed in the situation of a terrorist. However, most people would not be willing to intentionally kill civilians no matter how bad the conflict. The reason such an intention is psychopathic is because there is no logical link between such an action and any potential gain, especially when there is reason to believe that the other party will reciprocate. The only reason left to attack civilians, or to believe that there is justification for it, is that it fulfills some psychological needs that you have."

No one else has inflicted such horrific acts against humanity as much as the collective West. The West has caused devastation, suffering, and pain to billions of people. No one else can match this devastation.

Starting in the 1400s with the genocide of native populations of Americas and Australia. Millions of vulnerable people wiped out so Westerners could steal their land and resources.

In the 1600 Westerners also invaded the Middle East, Africa, East Asia, and Indian subcontinent in its hunt for further exploitation of resources/people. They committed mass atrocities and set up puppet regimes to exploit the vulnerable native populations. They kidnapped millions of Africans by force to exploit the labor in the Americas. To this day they treat the black offspring of the slaves as second class citizens. 

They started WW1, WW2, are the only people to ever use nukes against other humans.

Created the artificial ethno colonial state of Israel at the expense of the Palestinians. To this day the Westerners have  refused to acknowledge the existence evils of the Nakba. The genocide of the Palestinians continues with the full support of the West.

I’m not expecting westerners to admit any of this. Can you change my mind?"
1,2023-10-10,"CMV: The method described in this post will raise the marriage rate between white guys and black women, in a socially acceptable way, enough to eliminate racism.",u/tolkienfan2759,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174nesx/cmv_the_method_described_in_this_post_will_raise/,changemyview,"I submitted a CMV a few days ago on whether raising that marriage rate would actually eliminate racism, and most people seemed to think it would work if I had a good plan, although everyone wanted to know how I was going to do that.  Forcing/pushing bad!    
  
I agree.  Forcing/pushing bad.  So the CMV today is not if we raise that marriage rate will it eliminate racism, it's will this method raise that marriage rate enough without forcing/pushing.  And maybe we should discuss the possibility that this is genocide, as well, since we're discussing whether the method is socially acceptable.  
  
The method is really quite simple:  all we have to do is get the Republican National Committee to add a plank to its national political platform, to the following effect:  The problem with racism in this country stems primarily from an inability to tell the truth about it.  The truth we need to tell is this:  if, while you're growing up, at some point you become aware that you are unable, or unwilling, to fall in love with, and potentially marry, a black woman, then your heart is broken.  Your heart is not working properly.  And you need to fix that.  
  
If we tell the kids that this is the problem, guess what:  they will fix it.  Psychologists know:  people work on their hearts, and make progress, all their lives.  They can do this, and they will.  
  
Now obviously if the Democratic National Committee were to add this plank to its own national political platform it would have a very similar effect.  If both were to add the plank simultaneously it could be regarded as official across the board.    
  
But the reason I suggest that the Republicans should be the ones to begin is because they are the only ones who stand to gain politically from the spread of this understanding and the consequent elimination of racism.  Because once it becomes clear that the elimination of racism is in train and actually going to happen, all the millions of black voters that currently vote reliably Democratic will have no reason to continue doing so, except for whatever appeal the rest of the Democratic platform may have for them.  They will suddenly have a new reason to seriously consider the appeal of conservative and Republican values, and they will suddenly discover that those values are not nearly as senseless as they have appeared to many in the past.  Many if not most of those voters will switch to the Republican side, and this will destroy the Democratic Party as we know it.  
  
The crime rate will probably come down too, as our government suddenly acquires much more legitimacy with millions of black citizens who have previously not really been members of the club.  For those who are inspired by MAGA dreams, America will once again lead the world morally and politically.  And who knows, that may have a good effect on our pocketbook too.  It's all related.  And so, for Republicans and conservatives, there's really no downside.  
  
So what do you think?  Is there actually forcing or pushing in this plan, or is it all perfectly consonant with freedom of choice on all sides, as I believe it to be?  And if we implemented it, would it actually raise that marriage rate dramatically enough to begin, for the very first time, to actually eliminate racism?

I also want to talk a little about genocide.  In my previous post a number of people made it very clear that serious and thoughtful people might regard this activity as genocide.  Apparently the UN Convention on Genocide, to which the US is a signatory, includes as one of its definitions of genocide ""Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group"" if these measures are committed ""with intent to destroy, in whole or in part"" a racial group (among others).

The biggest problem with this idea, to me, is that a procedure so completely voluntary on both sides, if it is defined legally as genocide, really calls into question whether we have the right legal definition.  And so my first response would be, if this is in fact genocide under the UN Convention, then the UN Convention has the wrong definition of genocide.

And you may claim, and I actually have said in the past, that this would destroy the black community.  There are a few different responses to this.  First, there are two different common understandings of what will happen, if we implement this procedure.  One is that we will taint white people out of existence here in the US.  The other is that we will assimilate black people out of existence.  They cannot both be true.  And they're such similar arguments that in fact, if either is not true (and they both cannot be) then neither can be true.  Neither of those things is true.

Second, the intent cannot be to prevent births within the group, since one common understanding is that all the births that will result will be black.

Third, we're not trying to eliminate the black community; we're trying to eliminate racism.  Racism, in my formulation is defined by that marriage barrier.  If the marriage barrier comes down, which it must do long before the two ""peoples"" are fully mixed, then the objective has been achieved at that time.  Whatever happens after that (which no one actually can predict with any certainty) cannot be the intent.

And fourth, we don't know what will happen.  Maybe the resulting people will see itself as black.  Maybe it will see itself as white.  Maybe it will see itself as a new racial category (distinct from adjacent communities like the Canadians or Europeans or Mexicans).  We can't know and therefore that cannot be the intent.

I would also add:  when Italians assimilated, here in the US, was that genocide?  When Irish did?  Plenty of peoples have migrated to the US and assimilated.  I'm sure the intent, when we let those people in, was that they would assimilate.  If that intent makes assimilation genocide, then we're already guilty of it.  I don't think that's possible.

Sorry, too long, I know."

Palestine was never a country, but a region, United Kingdom gave settlement to the agrarian Arabs there, remember, ""there were always Jews in that region"", when Jews increased immigration  into the region in 1930's, the arabs were mad because based on their estimation, number of Jews will over take Arabs by 1940's.

Then they conspired with UK to limit number of Jews arrival, a quota on a region that they had no right , imagine, with Jews being killed in Europe by Hitler, they didn't give a slight help to take them as refugees, even though there were rightful Jewish settlement there and was already under  oversight by UK.

When the UK left the region by dividing into Israel and Palestine, a war ensued from 1943 to 1948, you know who made that happen, Palestine and the Arab League, but Israel prevailed, and for national security they annexed necessary land.

From that point forward Palestine kept attacking Israel and killing innocent Israelis, and Israel as retaliation annexed more and more land obviously for national security, which is what's war is about isn't it? sympathize with them, look at the stark difference between Israel and Palestine.

Palestine needs to stop destroying itself, it needs to accept the fact that it'll always be Israel, and negotiate a better deal, but ofcourse there are 6m Palestinian, I don't understand what even these people are thinking.

More land doesn't mean more success, Israelis made Israel from a desert to an advanced economy, look at even Dubai, this religious righteousness should stop, I stand with Israel.

As the previous Israeli president said ""If only the arabs loved their children more than they hate the jews, Middle East would have been a much safer place"""

It's not just the tin hats on YouTube.  
  
2- Perhaps the most supportive evidence of the simulation hypothesis comes from quantum mechanics. This suggests nature isn't ""real"": particles in determined states, such as specific locations, don't seem to exist unless you actually observe or measure them. Instead, they are in a mix of different states simultaneously.  
  
This is very much how video game simulations are done now. Things change based on what is being observed because why would you waste processing power on something that isn't being observed.  
  
2- The Fermi paradox. This paradox states that given the vast amount of universe we can observe we should have found extraterrestrial life. Not even just a bit, a lot of it. Where is it then? Well if we are in a truman show simulation then everything else could just be empty out there. Or even even really there.   
  
3- The smallest thing we know of is a planck. Plancks are like pixels. Tiny, tiny pixels that make up everything. If an atom was the size of the earth, a planck length would be smaller than the size of an atom. That's how tiny. A hydrogen atom is about 10 trillion trillion Planck lengths across.  
  
4- The speed of light. The size of the observable universe is so absurdly large compared to the maximum speed you can travel. This ensures that no matter what, we can never actually reach what we see out there. So essentially the simulation only has to fully render what's close by and then just make it look like everything out there is as detailed as we are.

I know everyone is going to pull that out, but I don’t think you can get an accurate measure of this. Why? Because people don’t like to admit to things like this, even anonymously. There’s a reason why we don’t trust self reported statistics on things like penis size. 

So I feel this way for 3 main reason, first is the commonly observed nature of how men vs women choose partners.

So I think a common belief is that women are willing to date men that they’re less physically attracted to if they have a nice personality, is wealthy, has a high social status. So if this is true, we’re acknowledging that women are widely more likely to sacrifice physical and sexual attraction in a long term relationships. Knowing this, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to suggest that some women eventually feel that something is missing. Which is why most couples report a decrease in the frequency of sex after the one year mark. I think this opens the door to cheating. If when you get horny and the only person you can have sex with is someone who doesn’t turn you on, or someone you don’t see as physically attractive, you’re going to get curious about what else is out there and I think this leads women to cheat.

Men on the other hand, typically put physical attractiveness pretty high up, and while they’ll sleep with a woman who’s not attractive to them just to get off, they won’t date one. So when men in relationships get horny, they can go to their partner because their partner turns them on.

I think this also leads into my second reason, it is SIGNIFICANTLY harder for men to find a woman to hookup with than vice versa. Women have a near infinite amount of partners to sleep with. And as I mentioned early, men are 100% willing to have sex with a woman they don’t see as that attractive just to have sex. If a woman desires a hot guy, chances are she can have sex with him if she wanted to.

And if you sacrificed physically attraction to be with your partner and you see a hot guy that gets you going, I think you’re going to be more likely to at least want to have sex with him. For men, it’s so much harder to hookup with women. For men it’s finding a yes. For women, it’s waiting until you have one you wanna say yes to.

My last point is how common this fantasy is in media that caters to the female gaze. Think about it, how many shows, movies, books, etc are about the wife that married to a nice guy that treats her well but doesn’t turn her on like the hot guy she works with, or the hot ex, or the hot douchebag frat guy. Like it’s so pervasive in media targeted at women and they eat it up.

This isn’t to say that media like that is non existent for men, but the idea is significantly less common. 

So if a shit ton of women are walking around with the fantasy of having a steamy one night stand with a random hot guy behind her husbands back, doesn’t that say that women are going to be more likely to act it out?"

1,2023-10-10,Cmv: one state solution is the best idea,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174riep/cmv_one_state_solution_is_the_best_idea/,changemyview,"Adopting a one-state solution for Israel and Palestine is a highly contentious and complex issue, but it offers several potential advantages if implemented carefully. It's my believe that israel should consider embracing a one-state solution with power-sharing arrangements similar to those seen in Lebanon to promote stability, inclusivity, and long-term peace in the region.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has endured for decades, with no comprehensive resolution in sight. The traditional two-state solution, which envisions separate Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting side by side, has faced numerous challenges, including territorial disputes, security concerns, and the status of Jerusalem. As a result, some proponents argue that a one-state solution could provide a more sustainable path to peace.

One of the key principles of the proposed one-state solution is power-sharing, mirroring Lebanon's approach to religious diversity. In Lebanon, the presidency is reserved for a Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament is a Shia Muslim. This system helps balance the interests of the country's diverse religious groups and prevents one group from dominating the government. Israel could adopt a similar model, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches divided equally between Israelis and Palestinians.

Advocates of this approach argue that it would address several longstanding issues:

A one-state solution would offer equal citizenship to Israelis and Palestinians, granting them the same rights and responsibilities. This inclusivity could foster a sense of belonging among all residents, regardless of their ethnic or religious background, and promote a shared national identity.

Combining the security forces of both communities could lead to more effective cooperation in maintaining peace and stability. Joint security efforts could help prevent violence and terrorism, reducing the need for military interventions and checkpoints that have been sources of tension.

A unified state could create a larger, more diversified economy with greater potential for growth. The pooling of resources and expertise from both communities could lead to economic development that benefits all citizens.

A one-state solution might gain broader international support compared to the contentious two-state proposal. It could be perceived as a more just and equitable way to address the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.

A single state would necessitate the negotiation and agreement on the status of contested territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Such negotiations could lead to a more comprehensive, lasting solution to territorial disputes.

A power-sharing arrangement that respects the diverse religious traditions of both communities would help protect the religious rights of all citizens, ensuring that no one group dominates or discriminates against others."
2,2023-10-10,CMV: Exercise ought to be encouraged to the same extent that personal hygiene is.,u/ifitisntconnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174rns9/cmv_exercise_ought_to_be_encouraged_to_the_same/,changemyview,"Personal hygiene is something almost all of us are taught from a young age- things like brushing your teeth, washing your hair, taking showers, trimming nails, etc. We encourage these behaviors not only because of aesthetic and social benefits (i.e. smell better, look cleaner, so on) but also because they play a huge preventative role against diseases and deterioration of our bodies. If we stopped brushing our teeth, we would likely develop plaque or gum disease. If we stopped showering, we would begin to stink and accumulate dirt, grime, and bacteria on our bodies. 

As a society, we tend to encourage these behaviors fairly regularly, and often shun those who avoid these behaviors, and while I’m not trying to encourage bullying, I think this type of social correction is important to keep people clean and healthy.

However when it comes to exercise, the attitude seems to be a lot more focused on doing what you feel like as an individual; if you want to work out that’s cool but it’s totally acceptable if you don’t. This is the point I think needs to be adjusted.

Exercise is just as critical for health and appearance as hygiene is, with a sedentary lifestyle being just as bad as smoking, if not worse, when it comes to increasing the risk factor for debilitating and chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancers, and even depression. It also has the secondary benefit of increasing confidence and making a person look nicer.

Now I don’t want to suggest that everyone should become a bodybuilder, or work out with the intention of being a skinny legend, but we as a society ought to encourage and promote exercise to the same extent as hygiene, if not more. There are so many types of physical activity, many of which are available at no cost other than a little time (30 minutes a day or every other day) and little to no cost. 

I feel like the carefree attitude many have with their bodies and physical fitness is harmful as it normalizes sedentary habits instead of encouraging everyone to be active in whatever way they can."

I’ve noticed several posts on social media lately about parents with disabled children. These children have significant disabilities and will essentially require care throughout their lives.

Most of these posts present the situation from the parents' perspective. They often mention that they were aware their child would have a disability, but they didn't see it as a limitation. They express their commitment to provide their child with as much love and care as necessary to enable a life as normal as possible.

However, these posts rarely discuss the child’s perspective. Having experienced chronic illness myself and spoken to others in similar situations, I understand that while life may be challenging for the average individual, it's exponentially tougher for someone chronically ill. It's a continuous emotional and financial burden. There's a profound quote by Confucius that encapsulates this sentiment:

""A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.""

If you're considering having children but know they will be born with a disability, please consider other options. Adoption or pursuing methods to ensure your child's health are viable choices."
1,2023-10-10,"CMV: The next recession will be influenced by the extreme inflation of ""convenience"" costs",u/Coldbrewaccount,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174siz7/cmv_the_next_recession_will_be_influenced_by_the/,changemyview,"The easiest example I can give is air travel. 

Clear and precheck are relatively recent additions to the airport experience. For those that don't know, you can pay $179 a year to be escorted to the front of the line. For the last few years, it was a great thing well worth the money. In recent times, the lines have gotten longer and longer. Other conviences like airline lounges and priority customer service have gotten less convenient. We've already begun to see some examples of some companies dramatically increasing the overal cost assosciated with these conveniences. 

There are plenty of other examples of this if you sit down and think about it. It's not just that buying a car is more expensive. It's also that getting a service appointment takes much longer and replacement parts are on backorder. We're already seeing some dealers ""throw in"" priority service, and it's just a matter of time before that becomes a monetized line item. The popularity of subscription services across EVERY industry is growing, and the benefits are increasingly including ""priority"" service of some kind. Think about Ubers, food delivery, moving companies, hotels, concert tickets. So many available options to skip the line or have things take less time.

&#x200B;

Of course, economics 101 says that companies should either increase their costs in accordance with demand or increase their supply. The problem is that it's becoming increasingly rare to see a company increasing their supply when it comes to furnishing a more convenient experience. This is unsustainable on a macro scale for one reason, the psychology of added convenience costs.

&#x200B;

If you don't increase the supply in response to higher demand for straight-up goods, as an example, people will choose a cheaper product. They might choose the basic eggs and not the free-range eggs, not get a fancier cheese, or buy a cheaper TV for the same manufacturer. The situation would have to get out of hand before people stop buying those things. 

&#x200B;

Convenience is entirely different. People switch brands if the experience is inconvenient enough. People stop patronizing an entire industry if it's painful all around. I can't think of a time in the last few decades where entire industries have been bold enough to able to post record profits while not expanding their infrustructure and staffing. It's because they've made the ingenious move of segmenting their customer base; making money off people willing to pay to not be exposed to it. It is inherently unsustainable, however. As the ""regular"" customer experience gets worse, the ""premium"" experience becomes more of a necessity, the demand for the ""premium"" experience grows, companies  must increase the price to keep the ""premium"" experience ""premium"", and more of their customer base is exposed to an increasingly intolerable ""regular"" experience.

&#x200B;

Put it this way (and this is meant to be a thought experiment and not the only specific example). If you had to fly every week for work, your experience is dramatically worsened if you go from a 5 minute security experience to a 40 minute one. Either you or your company will pay for the ""premium"" experience, because otherwise you may not want to keep a job that requires you to spend that much time in a line. But what if it becomes completely unaffordable? How much money is too much? $1000 a year? $2000? If it came down to it, I promise you that there is a level of inconvenience in air travel that would cause you to pick a job with less compensation just to avoid it. This isn't a hypothetical situation, there are entire labor sectors that are dramatically understaffed because the compensation doesn't cover the pain.

&#x200B;

If entire industries continue down this path, people will simply find alternatives or literally just save their money. People always say ""but people will always need x,y, or z"". This simply isn't true. The pandemic is the perfect example of this. People saved their money because those services were just unavailable, but they will also save their money if those services are simply more painful than not using them. 

&#x200B;

The end result of all of this will be that the entire stock market will take an ever bigger shit than it is now. Service industries will begin to panic and lower their prices, preferring to operate at pre-pandemic margins than go in the red. Their stocks will slump quickly as they release their earnings calls, and since it will be industry-wide, it will affect the entire market. There will be massive layoffs, decreased buying power of the consumer, and reduce spending everywhere. If it was a simple matter of lowering prices, it would be a fluctuation. Remember, though, convenience is different as it isn't just about affordability. It would be simple to just reduce the cost of goods and services, because all you're doing is decreasing margin. It would be a massive investment to bring staffing levels and product quality up to pre-pandemic levels, and industries just won't have the capital."

1,2023-10-10,CMV: Israel likely isn't bound by the Geneva Conventions when fighting Hamas.,u/LysenkoistReefer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174tj0u/cmv_israel_likely_isnt_bound_by_the_geneva/,changemyview,"My view in this case is that Israel is likely not bound by the Geneva Conventions when fighting against Hamas.

**Facts:**
 
Starting off, I’m going to lay out some facts, as I understand them, that this CMV is based upon. 

* Israel is a High Contracting Party, hereafter referred to as a signatory, of the Geneva Conventions. Specifically the treaties of the Conventions not necessarily the protocols. 

* The “State of Palestine”, quotation marks omitted hereafter, while being an unrecognized state that only maintains UN observer status, is also a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. 
The State of Palestine is generally synonymous with and controlled by Fatah/the Palestinian Liberation Organization, hereafter referred to as the PLO. 

* Hamas is the ruling party in the government of the Gaza strip, based upon its plurality victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Election and victory in the Fatah-Hamas conflict culminating in the Battle of Gaza.

* Hamas is not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. 

**Conventions:**

So now that those facts have been stated, I’ll make the case for why I believe that Israel is not bound by the Geneva Conventions when fighting Hamas. 

Common Article II of the Geneva Conventions states, 

> Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.

Breaking that down sentence by sentence,

> Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations.

My reading of this is that in a conflict between more than two parties, signatory parties must abide by the provisions of the Conventions dealing with each other. So for example in a conflict between one signatory party on one side and one signatory party and one non-signatory party on the other side, the signatory parties would be bound by the provisions of the Geneva Conventions when dealing with each but not necessarily be bound by those same provisions when dealing with the non-signatory party. 

>They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.

My reading of this is that in a conflict between a signatory party and a non-signatory party, the signatory party is bound by the provisions if and only if the non-signatory party “accepts and applies” the provisions of the Conventions.

**My View:** 

Israel is clearly a signatory party to the Geneva Conventions. Hamas however is not. While the State of Palestine is also a signatory party I think a distinction exists between the State of Palestine and Hamas. As mentioned earlier, I view the State of Palestine as synonymous with the PLO. Hamas is a different organization, which acts only with its elected and conquered authority over Gaza not over Palestine as a whole. Since Israel has not declared war with the State of Palestine in general or with the PLO in specific but only with Hamas I think this distinction is apt. As I understand it the PLO does not maintain that it is in a state of war with Israel after Israel’s declaration of war with Hamas and does not maintain that Israel’s military actions against Hamas are also military actions against the PLO/State of Isreal.  

Given this situation, it seems clear to me that Israel is at war with a non-signatory party to the Geneva Conventions. So now the important question is whether Hamas “accepts and applies” the provisions of the Conventions or not. 

I believe it does not. Hamas has clearly violated dozens of the provisions, from the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Conventions. From intentionally targeting civilians, the taking of hostages, and the treatment of its prisoners of war Hamas is clearly in violation of the provisions of the Conventions. I am also not aware that Hamas has at any time maintained that it does accept and apply the provisions of the Conventions.  

Based upon this I believe that Israel is a signatory party in a state of war with a non-signatory party that does not accept and apply the provisions of the Conventions. I believe this means that Israel is not bound by the Conventions when prosecuting its war with Hamas. 

**Scope:**
 
I’d like to define the scope of my view in this case. My view is based solely on the ongoing conflict between the state of Israel and Hamas, starting with the Hamas surprise attack on October 7th, 2023. While the past 75 years of conflict may inform this view I don’t view it as relevant to the underlying law contained within the Geneva Conventions. 

**What I’m Not Arguing:**  

This view is solely focused on the relevant law relating to the Geneva Conventions. I’m not making a moral argument about the actions of any party in this conflict. I’m also not making any arguments about the actions of any of the parties in any previous conflict. I’m also not making any arguments about any other treaties or provisions of international law that the parties in this conflict are parties to. I do not have a comprehensive view of international law in its totality and am not making an argument about any violations of treaties or laws that aren’t the treaties of the Geneva Conventions. I’m also not arguing about the Geneva Protocols. As I understand it the State of Israel is not a signatory to Protocol I or II and Hamas isn’t a signatory to any of the Protocols. 

**Possible Counter-Points and Responses:**

I have anticipated some counter-points to my view, though this is by no means an exhaustive list.

The first counter-point I anticipate is the claim that Hamas is a party contained within the State of Palestine and is thus, its behavior not withstanding, a signatory party to the Conventions. I’m not convinced by this view. As stated above, I draw a distinction between the State of Palestine and Hamas. I’m not aware of any of the relevant parties claiming that Hamas and the State of Palestine are the same entity or that by declaring war on Hamas Israel declared war on the State of Palestine. 

The second counter-point I anticipate is that this war is not a conflict of international character and thus Article Three of the General Provisions of the Geneva Conventions apply, so Israel is bound by the provisions therein contained. I believe that this war falls under the definition of a conflict of an international character. Both the State of Israel and Hamas maintain that Gaza is a separate state from Israel. Therefore I believe this is a conflict of international character and the restrictions contained in Article Three do not apply. 

**Why I’m Making This Post/ Why I’d Like My View Changed**

As the war continues I’ve seen many people with various views on this conflict. Specifically, I’ve seen several people saying that Israel is committing war crimes and specifically citing Israel’s blockade of Gaza as a war crime due to it being a violation of the collective punishment section of the Geneva Conventions. As it’s my view that Israel cannot be in violation of any provision of the Geneva Conventions since it isn’t bound by them in this conflict I’d like my view changed by the provision of evidence that it is in fact bound by the provisions of the Conventions in the war. To be clear I’m not asking for evidence that the blockade does represent collective punishment or a violation of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. That’s outside the scope of this CMV.

1,2023-10-10,"CMV: ""AI addiction"" is going to be reasonably commonplace in the near future",u/NutInButtAPeanut,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174ub2c/cmv_ai_addiction_is_going_to_be_reasonably/,changemyview,"What exactly would it mean for someone to have an AI addiction? Roughly speaking, the same thing it means for someone to have a television addiction or a video game addiction, except with AI-generated content.

Why do I think this?

One of the main considerations that has led me to this position is the potential for choose-your-own-adventure-style stories. Perhaps the intuitive appeal of this is not immediately obvious to everyone, but I think I can explain the appeal. Have you ever played Dungeons & Dragons? It's fun, right? Now, part of the fun is hanging out with your friends, but there's an element of fun in tabletop RPGs that goes beyond the social aspect, and that is the fact that you essentially get to be the main character in your own work of fiction. And D&D might not be your particular cup of tea, but I think this ""main character"" element will probably appeal to many people who like engaging with fiction generally (whether books, television, or games). For example, a lot of people enjoy reading romance novels. For many such people, I think part of the appeal is in imagining yourself as the main character. I think this same premise is inherent to *most* video games, in which one goal of the game is to have the player identify to some extent with the player character.

Now, I don't think that generative AI is going to *replace* these forms of media, but rather supplement them. For example, imagine Bob. Bob is a big fan of The Lord of the Rings universe. He has consumed a lot of content from that universe. What value can generative AI offer Bob with regard to his love for LOTR? Well, here's something: imagine Bob has access to a powerful large language model called Story-Bot. Bob says to Story-Bot, ""Hey, please curate a CYOA-style story set in the Lord of The Rings universe, in which I am the main character.""

""Why would anyone want that? Would it even be good?"" you ask.

Well, at this moment in time, probably not. GPT-4 is already *pretty* good at running CYOA-type stories (and future AIs will only continue to improve at the task), but there are a few important limitations which would prevent you from living out your own story in the LOTR universe:

1) It's expensive. Using a personal GPT-4 API to do this at present would be prohibitively expensive.

2) The context window is too small for the LLM to remember everything that has happened within the LOTR canon and within your own story.

However, both of these things are likely to change in the very near future: 

1) As the technology improves, the cost of inference will drop substantially, and if nothing else, there will no doubt be companies offering this as a service for a reasonable fee. 

2) Context windows are ever-increasing, and some research has already demonstrated the possibility of context windows up to 1 billion tokens. In the future, you will be able to have a discussion with an AI that can hold Tolkien's *entire* corpus in its memory. Such an AI would be able to reproduce his writing style perfectly while keeping in mind *every* established fact in the canon. 

""Fine, I can see how that might be fun for some people, but I don't think anyone's going to get addicted to it. No more so than people are addicted to books, at least,"" you respond.

Alright, but have you considered **porn**? Imagine Joe. Joe says, ""Dear Story-Bot, please curate a CYOA-style story set in my favourite fictional universe, in which I am the main character and the universe runs on porn logic and everyone of my preferred gender(s) wants to have sex with me.""

""OK... but that's not *porn*, per se, that's just erotica. Most people don't get addicted to erotica,"" you object.

Alright, then. Bob says, ""Dear Story-Bot, I really enjoyed that scene we just finished writing, but I'm a pretty visual guy. Please generate a series of high-resolution, pornographic images depicting the scene. In fact, better yet, just generate a short pornographic video depicting the scene.""

I rest my case."
1,2023-10-10,CMV:I am not going to be shedding much tears for Israel,u/OldLie929,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174unja/cmvi_am_not_going_to_be_shedding_much_tears_for/,changemyview,"While I obviously condemn any attacks on defenseless women and children, I cannot in good conscience join the bandwagon of ""standing with Israel."" Let me say this first: if you are not Jewish, Israel is not a democracy and it is not a free country. Israel is a country that has brutally bullied, oppressed, intimidated, and ignored its Arab minority for decades, with little to no international consequences to the Israeli government. Groups like Amnesty International have extensively documented Israel's blatant disregard for human rights when it comes to its Palestinian settlers. To say that this attack was ""unprovoked"" is a bit foolish and naive if you know anything about history. When you subjugate a group of people to the point of desperation, they will resort to violent means. Violence begets violence. I am NOT saying this is right, I am simply saying human history has proven that these atrocities are almost inevitable to occur in complex conflicts such as this. Israel is an apartheid state that uses violence to subjugate minorities it doesn't like, that is a simple fact. Israel has refused to grant equal rights to its Arab neighbors, and they are now experiencing the consequences of these policies that they have deliberately chosen to follow. Israel brought this on themselves. Do you think violence like this just comes out of nowhere? 

&#x200B;

Women and children probably have nothing to do with the conflict, but when the government that represents these women and children, backed by at least a plurality of their country's voters, makes decisions that refuses to treat its neighbors as equals, that refuses to give its neighbors freedom of movement, that refuses to give its neighbors homes, that refuses to give its neighbors access to simply see their family members, there will be bloodshed, and much of that bloodshed will sadly most acutely be felt on the most innocent of victims. That is an ugly reality of war, and it is an ugly reality of human nature. "

In hindsight, compared to MAGA Republicans and Trump, the George W. Bush administration seems tame vs. what we're seeing today like openly calling for the execution of your political opponents. And I absolutely believe that Putin's actions in Ukraine amount to him being a war criminal who should be held to account as soon as feasibly possible.

But 20 years now, not only is there significant evidence that the Iraq War was based on straight up lies,(and openly admitted to by significant players in the George W. Bush administration like Colin Powell), a lot of Americans seem to have this rosy picture of a harmless former president who is into painting. He's been welcomed with open arms by the media, including late night hosts in recent years.

The War in Iraq has led to irreversible destabilization of the region, and there are numerous verified reports of war crimes committed by the US government and military in Iraq, which we invaded essentially unilaterally even after the UN came back with no evidence of biological or nuclear weapons in Iraq at the time. I doubt he will ever account for his crimes or at minimum cooperation in the Iraq War, but I can't help but feel like the post-presidency narrative that the media has of George W. would be very different if the people impacted were majority white and Christian like the people of Ukraine."
1,2023-10-10,CMV: Jews are indigenous to Palestine,u/Few_Confusion5330,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174xy4p/cmv_jews_are_indigenous_to_palestine/,changemyview,"The topic of indigeneity and ancestral connections to land is a complex and often emotionally charged one. In the case of Jews and Palestine, I strongly believe that Jews are indigenous to this region. My assertion is based on historical, archaeological, and cultural evidences that tie the Jewish people to the land of Palestine from the *inception of their identity*. Here are some key points to consider:  
  
Historical Origin: The Jewish ethnicity and religion originated in what is now Palestine over 3000 years ago. The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, central figures in Judaism, lived in Canaan, an ancient name for the region encompassing modern-day Israel and Palestine. The historical and archaeological record supports the existence of early Jewish kingdoms, like the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah, in this region. In other words, the first Jews were 'Palestinians.'   
  
Continuous Presence: Even amidst numerous diasporas and persecutions over centuries, a Jewish presence in Palestine has persisted. Throughout various periods of foreign rule including by the Romans, Ottomans, and others, Jewish communities have continuously lived in the region.  
  
Cultural and Religious Connection: The deep spiritual connection Jews have to Palestine is epitomized by significant religious sites like the Western Wall and Temple Mount. The Hebrew language, which is central to Jewish liturgy and identity, also originated in this region.  
  
Legal Recognition: International bodies like the League of Nations and later the United Nations have acknowledged the historical connection of the Jewish people to Palestine.  
  
I understand that the term ""indigenous"" carries a lot of weight and the political backdrop of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict adds a layer of complexity to this discussion. However, I am firm in my belief that the historical origins, cultural connections, and continuous presence of Jews in Palestine substantiates their indigeneity to the land. I'm here to engage in a constructive dialogue and am open to having my view challenged or refined."

Heteronormativity has served society well for so many years. It provides society with stability and familiarity. Straight marriages are the cornerstones of civilizations, and encouraging marriages and child rearing is only beneficial. Straight relations are necessary for populating society, and healthy marriages are ESSENTIAL for healthy rearing environments. Child-parent structures, typically with both a mother and father, define society and promote morality. This is not to say that gay people must be marginalized: they shouldn't. Homosexuality is not evil and should not be shunned, but heteronormativity, which promotes positive family values, should still be maintained. When looking at a gay family, the kid in that structure is still the product of heterosexual activities. Society would not exist without heteronormativity and the repopulating and familial morality that come with it."

The only position that seems morally coherent as an outsider is the support of civilian life regardless of ethnicity. 

The events did not happen in a vacuum and the people in that area have been at odds for decades. Anyone can see how the conditions that the Palestinian people  have been put through would spark hatred and retaliation but the murder of people who have no power in the situation is deplorable. The response to the attacks are equally as deplorable but are also equally as predictable  given the history of the conflicts. The only side to take would be the civilian side and any position supporting Hamas or Israels government seems absurd. 

Biden just tweeted that Israel had the right to blow a place that is majority teenagers and young adults to smitherines is justified. How can anyone support these actions carried out by hamas or the Israeli government?"
1,2023-10-10,CMV: The Democrats are a party that holds their base hostage. The GOP is a party held hostage by their base,u/Kalvin-TL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174zd3s/cmv_the_democrats_are_a_party_that_holds_their/,changemyview,"The democrats have the ability to hold their base hostage because people on programs, trans people, and so many other parts of their voting base are at risk of what will happen to them if they lose. The true social and moral base is filed with relatively comfortable people who deeply care about those vulnerable groups more than their own: Non profit directors, professors, public defenders, etc. But the Democratic Party itself is essentially the “good cop” that manages the expectations of their base and mainly serves as a bulwark against the “bad cop”. They would much rather negotiate with the republicans to have a slightly less brutal austerity than try and pass Medicare for all. It’s against their interest to play the parliamentary hard ball of McConnell or up the authoritarian, Latin American strong man act of Trump because that would make the poorest parts of their base expect more of them. 

We see this manifest in how Kamala was forced onto the ticket when no one likes her at all. They ran a full court press to stop Bernie and the Bernie fans overwhelmingly cowtowed and voted for Biden anyway because they see Trump as a danger that must be stopped. If the Republican Party does end up having the balls of denying Trump the nomination by such underhanded means, they will pay for it dearly. I promise you. 

We can see the GOP is the opposite in almost every theater of politics. Every Republican speaker of the past few decades has had to deal with brewing revolt in their own party. No one in the squad has dared to pull the bullshit that Gaetz and Co. have. They haven’t even come close. The squad is completely housebroken compared to the freedom caucus. Nancy Pelosi could slap AOC across the face and AOC would apologize for it. 

 The GOP also isnt doing the “everyone drop out so we can stop this guy” that the democrats did to Bernie and that they should do to Trump. Even if you agree broadly with the GOP policy goals, it’s unarguable that someone like Hayley has a better chance to win a general election. Trump can win but he should not be your first choice if your goal is to beat Joe in the general. But they insist on nominating the man that has perhaps irrevocably alienated suburban women and countless other key demographics. Republicans get their favorite special boy despite all the baggage and damage he’s put on their brand. Democrats would never. It’s why a “liberal version of trump” is a non starter. 

They also can’t help but try to run up the score at the state level with regard to abortion in the post Dobbs era. The GOP base will keep trying no matter how many ass kickings it earns. Hayley is the only one on that stage that can admit that abortion is a loser issue and they wont have the votes for a federal ban. 

The problem is that being an “electability cuck” is not in the GOP dna. Putting up some professional politician who manages the expectation of their base is not who they are. This is all Democrat shit. The entire history of the post WW2 American politics show the right wing establishment being consistently replaced with their more radical base. The left has seen the opposite trend. Clinton and Obama are firmly to the economic right of the new deal democrats. Biden too. Republicans get their red meat even if it costs the party dearly. We’ve seen the undeniable truth of this dynamic in recent years. 

After a historic, humiliating defeat such as 2022, a party should make a sharp course correction. Instead they keep beating the drum on trans people and Hunter Biden’s penis. They keep letting chucklefucks like Kari Lake run again. Democrats are a more professional, disciplined party apparatus - for better and often for worse. They would not let this happen. They make fuck up in a different way, but not like this. I mean for fucks sake - Is any state Democratic Party in the country as down horrendous as the Michigan GOP right now? 

On top of this, it seems clear that the GOP radicals are a graver threat to elected officials of all stripe. If Mitch gets assassinated, it’s just as likely to be Q guy as a left wing radical. Much more likely, actually. 

In conclusion, democratic politicians have their voters cowed while Republican ones are cowering over their own voters. They have to tiptoe and be careful when criticizing Trump despite the manifest harm he’s done to them. Chris Christie is the exception that proves the rule because his campaign is asking for democrats to vote in early primary states for him. It won’t make him win but I can conceive of resistance lib types doing that because of “civic duty” or whatever bullshit. Republicans voters would never do that kind of thing. Not in a million years 

When Nancy Pelosi said “we need a strong Republican Party”, she was chastising her colleagues across the aisle who are every day resembling zookeepers caged by their monkeys. Democrats, on the other hand, can openly and flagrantly take their voters for granted and give them deep Catholic guilt over the idea of staying home or not coming out to vote for a Hillary Clinton type. It shockingly cost them in 2016 because of low turnout in a select few states, but they knew it was only a matter of time before the GOP insanely overplayed their hand and that’s the situation they’re in right now."

My response to this is yes, and there should be no inhibitions on their use on humans whatsoever.

Firstly, genetic engineering can be used to help those who carry the genes for genetic diseases such as cystic fiborosis to have children free from the disease. People want the best for their child and having the choice to do so also means letting their child be free of the disease, so having access to the ability to raise children free of their family history would be the one of the best options to give to their child.

&#x200B;

Secondly, if we allow genetic engineering to be used on humans, we can also help shorten evolution and allow us to adapt more easily to different conditions by allowing us to select traits and apply them without the inconvience of hundreds of milennnia to millions of years. This could be useful in expanding beyond our Earth as different planets need different adaptations and having the ability to edit genetics in real time would be beneficial.

There is a decade-long continent vide persecution of an ethnic/religious group in Europe whose end result is 6 million dead men, women and children. After the defeat of a country that in its attempt to ethnically cleanse an entire continent of Jews, the countries that defeated it decided, just a few years later, that the best course of action was to send the Jews to another continent.

Now you can't blame the Jews for accepting that after surviving a genocide but if you disregard the whole religious reason for the chosen place for a Jewish state, you would see that it was the worst possible choice. 

We are going to give you a tiny piece of land, the only downside is that there are some people already living there. But no worry there are not a lot of them there since most of them live outside of that piece of land, they have lots of land in fact. These guys live in an area the size of Europe, 2,000 km west of this land and 1,000 km south and east of this land everything is just these guys so they won't mind this tiny piece. If they say we promised them that tiny piece of land 30 years ago ignore that as you should ignore that they outnumber you like 50 to 1 and surround you on all sides except for the sea.

It seems to me that instead of trying to live together with the people they unjustly persecuted for centuries, the great powers in Europe decided to just get rid of them with the excuse it was for their own good. In doing that they set the Jews up to be in a constant state of war against every surrounding country that they just pissed off by taking that small piece of land and displacing the people previously living there.

1,2023-10-10,cmv: The Ukraine conflict coupled with the Gaza conflict WILL spark WW3,u/kibblerz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1751evs/cmv_the_ukraine_conflict_coupled_with_the_gaza/,changemyview,"1. Covid. This has led to the current state of the world. The global economy is in limbo, and war is profitable. WW2 ended the Great Depression. So war's and imperialism are spiking to gain $$$ and loyalty among their citizens during the coming economic issues. Poverty is a great motivator for war. 
2. Ukraine. Russia embracing its imperialistic views to claim land that's been lost for some time. So far, we've avoided stepping foot there, but will we be able to avoid direct intervention against Russia if we place our troops in Israel? Probably not. Interests will collide, and alliances will take precedence in the area. Especially if we fight with Iran.  

3. Gaza-Israel. Considering the sudden burst in violence with the conflict after a relatively peaceful time, this isn't random. Iran is gonna support Gaza. The US will land troops in Israel.  

4. Religion. The US will not stay out of conflict. The US is highly religious, if Israel falls, then the prophecies of revelations will be moot.  Their entire religion will become unfeasible if this occurs. So this is a matter of Religion, not politics ultimately. Many christians anticipate the apocalypse of revelations as a validation for their beliefs, without it, their entire worldview is crushed. So they WILL fight, because if they don't, their faith will be compromised.  

5. Taiwan-China. If the US is in the Middle East, occupied with both Israel and Ukraine, it'd be the opportune time to take Taiwan, and a good PR stunt for China's citizens. War encourages patriotism and discourages dissent.  

6. Small actors like North Korea will join in the good old alliance action. WW2 on repeat."

The internet has a hate for child predators and always are talking about how they should never get out of jail, and should be under the jail. A hypothetical to my thinking:

Say there is a man who draws inappropriate pictures of minors and sells them to people. I don't think it matters that these children don't exist, the guy is feeding into a fantasy which can embolden someone to go commit this act irl. It doesn't matter that he hasn't harmed any children, I think legally and morally people would still identify him as a child predator.

Now we move on to who is Diana Deets (idk if that's how it's spelled). She was an OF 'creator' with something like 6 million fans. She was clearly older, but claimed to be 24 online, but she would post content with filters that clearly make her look like a kid. And I'm not talking the hypersexualized adult role playing as a kid typical to porn, which is also weird, a literal kid. Like if I walked into a middle school I would see this kid. She faced a lot of backlash for this online and ended up deleting herself from existence. 

There's a few articles that are sympathizing with her and talking about how it's so sad and a beautiful woman was lost. But why? She's a literally a child predator. There's no way she didn't know what she was doing, not only because it's so obvious to any sane adult it's not right, but people were calling her out on it, apparently for a long time not that that matters. Additionally she had a kid or kids as well and it makes me question how she viewed them or how much lower she would've sunk to make more money.

Maybe there's something I'm missing about the story but from what i've gathered she's just another predator. If predators don't deserve sympathy why does she?"

It was as cringy as hissan Minaj doing the White House correspondents dinner without president trump in attendance, i want to say it almost defeats the whole purpose of having a debate.

im going to quote one of the participants from the most recent republican debate, Nikki Haley, who said vivek ramaswamy makes her feel more stupid every time He opens his mouth. Because Donald trump was not at this debate, the spotlight had to go to the second most controversial person running for president. Vivek is not only crazy and outrageous in the views he puts out there, he’s also incredibly cringe and nowhere near as charismatic as Donald trump . Although i personally think Donald trump is a Russian manchurian candidate who is also the right hand of satan, Donald trump is a wildly colorful and entertaining figure that can make me laugh in the same sentence he makes me angry. vivek is nothing like that, there’s a reason Nikki Haley respects Donald trump and not Vivek. She understands instead of their debate gaining the massive attention Donald trump brings, they instead have to yield to someone who raps eminem lyrics in a very disturbingly cringy manner

i don’t know what the goal was here, but literally no good goals were met. republican voters were not impressed by them, and republican voters have almost certainly made up their mind Donald trump is going to be the person they vote in as their nominee. By holding that debate without Donald trump, they all confirmed they are second class acts beneath any serious consideration other than people having time to watch tv and having nothing else to watch at the time the debates are held. the former president not participating in a debate about who’s going to be president next is as cringe and room filled with cricket noises as hissan Minaj roasting donald trump without actually having Donald trump present at the White House correspondents dinner. It’s honestly crazy donald trump was scratching his balls eating Big Macs while some of these people were answering questions about Donald trump without Donald trump having to lift a finger. As much as i hate Donald trump, he’s a master of media manipulation, and by holding the debate without him they all confirmed they are nothing more than an extended platform of his campaign. There’s something wrong with a picture where the guy who scratches his balls and doesn’t participate in the debate walks out the winner. This isn’t healthy for our democracy, republican candidates need him in the debate or find another way to exchange ideas in a collective platform

However, it is important to acknowledge that despite the moral dilemma, abortions are a necessary option in today's society. This is primarily due to reasons such as safeguarding the physical and mental health of women, preventing unsafe and illegal abortions, and addressing situations of rape, incest, or severe fetal abnormalities. Safety and legal access to abortions protect women from medically unsafe procedures, reducing maternal mortality rates. Moreover, providing legal options ensures proper medical care, psychological support, and counseling for women facing difficult decisions. Restrictions on abortions have shown a direct correlation to an increase in illegal procedures, placing women in greater danger. Allowances for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or severe fetal abnormalities demonstrate empathy and provide solace to individuals navigating incredibly challenging circumstances. Balancing moral convictions with the necessity of providing women reproductive choices is integral to upholding women's health, their right to autonomy, and societal progress.

I’m not arguing about the practicality of how this could be implemented. It would be a historically massive and unprecedented undertaking. Just drawing a parallel to the logic used when creating/maintaining the nation state of Israel. (Perhaps, as with the Jewish diaspora in Israel, Native American tribes should be able to buy land in these cities/areas and once they reach 10-20% of the population and own 8-9% of the land area begin to take over the these areas and become a sovereign entity or nation state? That’s essentially what happened in Ottoman/British Palestine.

Side note: Hamas/Palestinians definitely have reason to hold a grudge but at this point they’ve exhausted any goodwill and understanding they may have once deserved. Each side has committed heinous, genocidal acts. Neither can claim the moral high ground any longer and Israel has a right to defend itself against these recent atrocities."

Why does someone care if another person plays Minecraft with an rtx 4090 and no other games? That person spent their own money on something they wanted, to play what they want to play, why do you care?

Why does it matter if someone doesn't like movies pre-2000 when they were considered better? Why does it matter if I don't like some black and white movie that is considered the greatest of all time?

Personally I am a pro lifer but I also support the death penalty. I whole heartedly agree that abortions should be legal in cases such as rape or incest,if that is the mothers choice, and if the mother or child’s life is in danger/ not sustainable. I am not religious so a god doesn’t influence my opinion on pregnancy and babies. My reasoning is that the majority of the pro choice movement says that no one should be forced to use their body for a baby they didn’t want after engaging in consensual sex. Their body their choice. My issue is that a fetus isn’t a part of your body it’s an entirely separate individual and no innocent life deserves to be taken because you feel they are unwanted or will not be properly cared for even if by others. I also think systems need serious changes to actually help the people in need in those situations. My stance on the death penalty is that most of the time the individual is a repeat offender who committed heinous crimes for their own gratification. These individuals are beyond reform and don’t deserve to continually torture the lives of those who have been harmed by their actions. They can write appeals and books and do interviews forever which only adds more suffering to those already harmed who deserve comfort and support. They in my opinion forfeited their rights by causing such harm to the people around with absolutely no regard. The death penalty rights wrongs in the only way for permanence especially in a way that life in prison doesn’t. 


TLDR: abortions revolve around taking an innocent life as a form of birth control because you were horny. The death penalty allows for wrongs to be righted in a permanent way for heinous crimes committed out of selfishness."

On the current-events level, the fact that people are currently celebrating and chanting free Palestine in the streets is ridiculous, and also barbarous given that their response to a thousand murdered civilians was to celebrate some notion of ""revolution"". To me, this shows they do not actually support Palestinian People's right to any land or self-determination, but rather that they are anti-Israel as their whole actual stance/understanding of the conflict.

If they supported the Palestinian people, they would have been against the atrocities committed by Hamas in Gaza against Palestinians for the last decade. Hamas has, for years and years, misappropriated funds from Israel AND from foreign aid, millions of dollars that were meant for infrastructure, water, education, and used them to build rockets buy weapons and dig tunnels. The people are not suffering for lack of global effort, they are suffering in a cage because their own leaders have turned Gaza, which is an independent recognized piece of land belonging to the Palestinians, into a nightmare. 
Hamas instigates terrorist action, and uses Gazan civilian sites as bases for operations and weapons, so that no matter how careful in its targeting g Israel is, civilians will always be casualties. Israel does not target civilians, Hamas props up their own people as targets. 

Where are all these people who shout free Palestine, when Gazans suffer daily? They do not make any attempt to bring the world's might down on Hamas, but rather scream at Israel to fix it. How?

Additionally, if they were for the palestinian cause, they would be crying in horror at what Hamas has done, because they would know that Hamas has instigated a war they can not win, and has put Palestinian lives in immense danger! They would beg hamas to stop, to call for a ceasefire, because they would know that this was not an act of anti-colonial revolution, but an act of stupidity and aggression that will see Palestinians killed en masse, because after such a historically massive slaughter of israeli civilians, israel can and should put it's boot down on Hamas. 

No, after reading everyone's responses to this war online and seeing the pro-palestine protests in the streets, its made it clear that none of these people give a shit about the palestinians, they only care about the vague notion of palestine (land) and could give less of a damn about the people of Palestine. 

It seems that the people who care most about Palestinian lives are Israelis, because despite their capacity to flatten Gaza and end it all, despite their justified horror and rage , they instead aim for individual targets, they opt to put their soldiers, their OWN youth, on the ground, so that the fighting can avoid mass damage. They are risking their own lives , not responding as any other country would (lets be honest any other country after undergoing such a massive attack would carpet bomb the city where the terrorist cell resides).

Tl;dr most people who make a show of being pro palestine do not care about palestinians but are just anti-israel"

Civilisations were hierarchical from the start.

The first gold/silver coins, used as general purpose money, appeared in Anatolia (now Turkey) in the 6th century bc. This was the start of free market economics. International trade already existed before then, and there had already been civilisations organised around trade (eg the phoenicians), but it was based on barter (including the exchange of relatively large lumps of precious metals).The idea of the “businessman” and private ownership of property was already well established in ancient Greece, the whole history of the Roman Republic is that of a class war between the aristocracy, rich businessmen, and the “plebian” ordinary people. Banks or money lenders already existed at this time, as did the concept of charging for lending money (ie interest, usury, rent-seeking). Usury was frequently banned or restricted, either by limiting who could legally do it, or setting maximum limits to interest rates. Or there were “debt jubilees” to stop borrowing from getting out of control.

These things all took a back seat during the millenium of Catholic hegemony, but started re-appearing again in northern Italy in the 12th century. The main centres were Venice and Genoa – cities which developed an independent culture, resisting the power of the Holy Roman Emperor, and progressing in literature, art and proto-science. These “free cities” started to develop big trading networks and would eventually spawn the rennaissance.

Then came the Black Death in 1346-1353, which took out half the population of Europe. This led to a severe shortage of labour and a sudden over-supply of land and other physical resources, which in turn forced a free market of labour into existence and encouraged the development of labour-saving technologies. These included the printing press in 1440, and so to bibles printed in German, English and Dutch. This in turn led to the Reformation and the “protestant work ethic”. This is the idea that hard work is good for your soul, and being successful in business is more important than enjoying yourself – therefore you should seek profit to invest back into business, rather than take time off and spend it having fun.

All of the above led to the slow decline of feudalism and the enclosure of common land, forcing the rural poor to head for towns and cities in search of work which was usually badly paid and in poor conditions. This process was then supercharged by the scientific and industrial revolutions. In 1776 Adam Smith's “Wealth of Nations” argued that the “invisible hand of the free market” worked in the favour of the whole of society.

It wasn't until the mid-19th century that there was organised intellectual resistance to all this. First Charles Dickens wrote about the plight of the poor, then John Ruskin argued that consumerism is bad for both people and environment, that factories make loads of stuff that people don't need, and money should be made and spent ethically. Then in 1867 Karl Marx claimed that capitalism is a “mode of production” based on the exploitation of labour, and leads inevitably to a concentration of wealth in the hands of the owners of the means of production. Marx claimed that this was a temporary era, and that this system would eventually collapse due to is own contradictions, or be brought down by a working class revolution.

In the 20th century we had communist revolutions in many places, none of which can claim to be successful. Some went disastrously wrong, others collapsed, one or two limp on. China's system is a sort of authoritarian post-communist quasi-capitalism. In its current western manifestation “capitalism” became neo-liberalism in the 1980s, which would have collapsed in 2008 if the free market had been allowed to do what it naturally does. Instead, the system was put on life support (QE and low interest rates) and now the western world is deep in debt and facing long-term stagflation.

It seems to me that if “capitalism” doesn't mean what Marx meant by it, then we're left with no clear definition at all. Clearly Maoist China and Stalinist USSR weren't capitalism, and neither is present day North Korea. Those systems rejected pretty much everything I described above – they involved a complete redesign of society, economy and money itself. When people say they want capitalism to end, this presumably isn't what they have in mind as a replacement. Which means they aren't much use in constructing a definition of “capitalism”.

I am forced to conclude that “capitalism” isn't a clearly defined thing at all, and that is a major problem if you truly believe that capitalism is the main explanation for what has gone wrong in the world. The only definition of “capitalism” that makes sense to me is  [Alf Hornborg's: “the aggregate logic of human decisions about the management of money. “](https://journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu/jpe/article/id/2017/)

If so, the only way to get rid of capitalism is to get rid of money. But that seems to be incompatible with civilisation itself, which means in fact our starting point ought to be a complete redesign of money, which will required a complete redesign of society. But that redesign cannot just be along Marxist/Communist lines, partly because that has already been tried and failed, and partly because it  predates the current ecological/sustainability predicament. I think what I am saying is that maybe we need to radically rethink capitalism rather than replacing it. Or maybe we need to get rid of the term “capitalism” altogether and replace it with something else such as “growth based economics” – which is much easier to define."

Economic reason: offering a price lower than market price encourages people to seek job opportunities in a different city, encourages tourism, and decreases the time cost (public transport like High Speed Rail and Metro tend to be faster than driving). Overall it's a net positive for the economy even if the transport system itself runs at a loss. 

2. Environmental reason: lowering the price of public transport indirectly discourages driving and lowers carbon emissions. Flights and Driving emits dozens of times more carbon than trains or metros. 

3. Ethical reason: The market price is currently too high for working class people. They also deserve to travel. As the average net profit margin for transportation is 7% and it's 28% for railroads, simply making it -12.5% (lose one eighth of money) would reduce the price by 20% and 40% respectively and make them much more affordable. Canadian Railway had a profit margin of 30%. Making it -12.5% would cut the price almost in half. Chinese Railway has a profit margin of -9%, which makes it the most affordable high-speed rail system in the world. The reduced price is subsidized by the state. Or even better, make them state-owned or worker-owned."

In the final analysis, the State of Israel was created because during Hitler's time he managed to use the Jews as a scapegoat. At the time, the Jews were a richer minority than the average population linked to high finance and he managed to convince himself that they were keeping the rest of the population poor with their activities and high loans to desperate families. In addition to being of a different religion, Hitler used Jewish money to finance his reforms and distributed a lot of Jewish property as housing and land to the German population, especially the families of combatants, but also in the territories of present-day Austria, the Czech Republic, etc. so that the population would be more complacent about the barbarities that were taking place.  
  
  
  
When the war ended and the many Jewish family homes were all occupied, the Jews had nowhere to go and nobody (whose country had already been torn apart) wanted to take in so many refugees, so the idea of handing over a state to Israel came up, and who gets screwed? The people of Palestine who already live there. They were two peoples with different ethnicities, religions, cultures and languages who would now have to share the same space. After that, Israel occupied even more land and expelled more Palestinians from their homes over the years.  
  
  
  
Faced with this situation, if one day something similar happened to Muslims and they created a Muslim state in your country... would we accept it without violence? would we accept it without violence? Again, I understand both sides and their anger at this cycle of repetitive violence that I'm convinced will only end when one or the other is expelled from there, but I don't understand that anyone is 100% on one side or 100% on the other when this is something full of nuances."

1,2023-10-11,CMV: Israel likely isn't bound by the Geneva Conventions when fighting Hamas.,u/LysenkoistReefer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175g5ml/cmv_israel_likely_isnt_bound_by_the_geneva/,changemyview,"My view in this case is that Israel is likely not bound by the Geneva Conventions when fighting against Hamas.

**Facts:**
 
Starting off, I’m going to lay out some facts, as I understand them, that this CMV is based upon. 

* Israel is a High Contracting Party, hereafter referred to as a signatory, of the Geneva Conventions. Specifically the treaties of the Conventions not necessarily the protocols. 

* The “State of Palestine”, quotation marks omitted hereafter, while being an unrecognized state that only maintains UN observer status, is also a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. 
The State of Palestine is generally synonymous with and controlled by Fatah/the Palestinian Liberation Organization, hereafter referred to as the PLO. 

* Hamas is the ruling party in the government of the Gaza strip, based upon its plurality victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Election and victory in the Fatah-Hamas conflict culminating in the Battle of Gaza.

* Hamas is not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. 

**Conventions:**

So now that those facts have been stated, I’ll make the case for why I believe that Israel is not bound by the Geneva Conventions when fighting Hamas. 

Common Article II of the Geneva Conventions states, 

> Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.

Breaking that down sentence by sentence,

> Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations.

My reading of this is that in a conflict between more than two parties, signatory parties must abide by the provisions of the Conventions dealing with each other. So for example in a conflict between one signatory party on one side and one signatory party and one non-signatory party on the other side, the signatory parties would be bound by the provisions of the Geneva Conventions when dealing with each but not necessarily be bound by those same provisions when dealing with the non-signatory party. 

>They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.

My reading of this is that in a conflict between a signatory party and a non-signatory party, the signatory party is bound by the provisions if and only if the non-signatory party “accepts and applies” the provisions of the Conventions.

**My View:** 

Israel is clearly a signatory party to the Geneva Conventions. Hamas however is not. While the State of Palestine is also a signatory party I think a distinction exists between the State of Palestine and Hamas. As mentioned earlier, I view the State of Palestine as synonymous with the PLO. Hamas is a different organization, which acts only with its elected and conquered authority over Gaza not over Palestine as a whole. Since Israel has not declared war with the State of Palestine in general or with the PLO in specific but only with Hamas I think this distinction is apt. As I understand it the PLO does not maintain that it is in a state of war with Israel after Israel’s declaration of war with Hamas and does not maintain that Israel’s military actions against Hamas are also military actions against the PLO/State of Isreal.  

Given this situation, it seems clear to me that Israel is at war with a non-signatory party to the Geneva Conventions. So now the important question is whether Hamas “accepts and applies” the provisions of the Conventions or not. 

I believe it does not. Hamas has clearly violated dozens of the provisions, from the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Conventions. From intentionally targeting civilians, the taking of hostages, and the treatment of its prisoners of war Hamas is clearly in violation of the provisions of the Conventions. I am also not aware that Hamas has at any time maintained that it does accept and apply the provisions of the Conventions.  

Based upon this I believe that Israel is a signatory party in a state of war with a non-signatory party that does not accept and apply the provisions of the Conventions. I believe this means that Israel is not bound by the Conventions when prosecuting its war with Hamas. 

**Scope:**
 
I’d like to define the scope of my view in this case. My view is based solely on the ongoing conflict between the state of Israel and Hamas, starting with the Hamas surprise attack on October 7th, 2023. While the past 75 years of conflict may inform this view I don’t view it as relevant to the underlying law contained within the Geneva Conventions. 

**What I’m Not Arguing:**  

This view is solely focused on the relevant law relating to the Geneva Conventions. I’m not making a moral argument about the actions of any party in this conflict. I’m also not making any arguments about the actions of any of the parties in any previous conflict. I’m also not making any arguments about any other treaties or provisions of international law that the parties in this conflict are parties to. I do not have a comprehensive view of international law in its totality and am not making an argument about any violations of treaties or laws that aren’t the treaties of the Geneva Conventions. I’m also not arguing about the Geneva Protocols. As I understand it the State of Israel is not a signatory to Protocol I or II and Hamas isn’t a signatory to any of the Protocols. 

**Possible Counter-Points and Responses:**

I have anticipated some counter-points to my view, though this is by no means an exhaustive list.

The first counter-point I anticipate is the claim that Hamas is a party contained within the State of Palestine and is thus, its behavior not withstanding, a signatory party to the Conventions. I’m not convinced by this view. As stated above, I draw a distinction between the State of Palestine and Hamas. I’m not aware of any of the relevant parties claiming that Hamas and the State of Palestine are the same entity or that by declaring war on Hamas Israel declared war on the State of Palestine. 

The second counter-point I anticipate is that this war is not a conflict of international character and thus Article Three of the General Provisions of the Geneva Conventions apply, so Israel is bound by the provisions therein contained. I believe that this war falls under the definition of a conflict of an international character. Both the State of Israel and Hamas maintain that Gaza is a separate state from Israel. Therefore I believe this is a conflict of international character and the restrictions contained in Article Three do not apply. 

**Why I’m Making This Post/ Why I’d Like My View Changed**

As the war continues I’ve seen many people with various views on this conflict. Specifically, I’ve seen several people saying that Israel is committing war crimes and specifically citing Israel’s blockade of Gaza as a war crime due to it being a violation of the collective punishment section of the Geneva Conventions. As it’s my view that Israel cannot be in violation of any provision of the Geneva Conventions since it isn’t bound by them in this conflict I’d like my view changed by the provision of evidence that it is in fact bound by the provisions of the Conventions in the war. To be clear I’m not asking for evidence that the blockade does represent collective punishment or a violation of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. That’s outside the scope of this CMV.

If you actually read the mission statement of many universities it states their mission is to educate the population, further research, and foster learning. The idea that a university degree is similar to a vocational education is an idea perpetuated by many high schools across the country. 

Yes, a university degree can absolutely help you get a better job. However, the main goal is to educate you in a field and often to prepare you for further research and education. The correlation between education attainment and income is clear to any economist, yet, if you break it down by field this varies greatly. It more so happens that some, but not all, high paying fields require advanced education. 

This idea has led to tons of unprepared applicants into pursuing fields that they may enjoy, but aren’t financially viable. Even if the student enjoys their field it can be difficult to find a job with the saturation of many common “good degrees” which are seen as job tickets. In my opinion, one needs to understand that what they learn won’t always be job applicable.

University is great, but the path shouldn’t be painted as the only viable one. Not everyone is made for it and that’s okay. Competition is high and it can be unrewarding to some."

1,2023-10-11,CMV: It’s checkmate on humanity,u/Altairs-Paradox,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175i0kx/cmv_its_checkmate_on_humanity/,changemyview,[removed]
1,2023-10-11,"CMV: The tradition of hiding your pregnancy from people until the odds of miscarriage or abortion are better is a ridiculous, dated tradition that only worsens the already misunderstood reality of childbearing and motherhood.",u/cmoriarty13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175i6he/cmv_the_tradition_of_hiding_your_pregnancy_from/,changemyview,"\**TW for anyone who had a miscarriage, abortion, or otherwise traumatic childbearing process.*

Let me first clarify that it is always the women's choice to do as she wishes, especially regarding pregnancy, and I will never judge that. Just because I have this opinion doesn't mean I judge anyone who feels differently.

It is extremely common for women to wait until the risk of a miscarriage or abortion is low before announcing their pregnancy to the world. I believe this is a ridiculous, dated tradition that only contributes to making the reality of child bearing more taboo/misunderstood than it already is. 

I had always reinforced this tradition because it made sense to me: why would couples tell the world they are pregnant if there is still a high risk of losing that pregnancy? However, my wife, an avid feminist and very outspoken on motherhood, actually changed my mind on this when she began advocating against this tradition during her pregnancy.

The only reason we feel that miscarriages and abortions should be private is because of this dated tradition. It really makes no sense. The reality is that a significant number of women experience these traumatic events (10-20% of pregnancies end in a miscarriage, and the abortion ratio is 198 documented abortions per 1,000 live births, making both extremely common), and by reinforcing this notion that we should hide it from everyone, we are only creating a silent majority where the women who need the most support are made to believe they are alone when that couldn't be less true. Even worse, we are completely skewing the reality of child bearing.

And the reality is that these things happen, they're normal, they're common, though traumatic, and we shouldn't treat them as things that should be shut in a closet and forgotten. That only adds to the trauma these women experience. 

Pregnant women and mothers deserve support, certainly more support than what they currently get. They deserve to be able to talk openly about how they're feeling and what they're going through, not hiding it to protect other people from difficult conversations. I can't tell you how often, as a response to my wife struggling with her pregnancy or raising our children, she was gaslit and told, ""Don't feel that way, you should be thankful and soak in every moment because it's all worth it."" Of course it's worth it, but that doesn't mean we have to ignore the fact that pregnancy can absolutely suck, being a parent can be fucking brutal, and most importantly, that it's okay and totally normal to admit it. 

Anyways, to get back to my point, the main reason women feel the need to privatize their pregnancy experience and shelter the people around them from the reality of it is because of the taboo and misinformation that western society has constructed around pregnancy and motherhood, despite them being literally the most natural things that exist. 

Finally, I understand that many women wait to announce so they don't have to be pitied or looked at differently if they have a miscarriage or abortion. They just don't want people only thinking of that when they look at them. I get that. But the only reason people would pity her or look at her differently is because of this notion that we have built that miscarriages and abortions are abnormal and ""wrong."" When, in reality, chances are that out of every 10 women you see, 2-3 of them have experienced it, so why are we judging people for it when we should be supporting them?

I believe that announcing a miscarriage should be just as normal as announcing a pregnancy. I am not belittling the gut-wrenching sadness and trauma of a miscarriage or the joy of pregnancy, I'm just saying we should normalize them."

I don’t believe Religion is the sole, or even the main cause of this atrocity, however I believe that religion; specifically the main three Abrahamic religions and organised religions of any denomination should not have any part in governance and law.

Should people wish to practice their faith, that’s fine but it should be equal to supporting a football team - a recreational activity that has no bearing on life and death"

1,2023-10-11,CMV: Establishing a Palestinian State is not smart policy,u/Far_Introduction3083,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175iyhv/cmv_establishing_a_palestinian_state_is_not_smart/,changemyview,"I think they deserve human rights but absolutely reject Palestinian nationalism and it has nothing to do with racism.  
My main reason being the Palestinian leadership class, the Palestinian authority, is worthless and I think any Palestinian state will be a failed state. It will be an Islamic state not a secular one. Ignoring Hamas, I don't even think the PA has the legitimacy to broker a peace deal. Mahmoud Abbas won his election to a 4 year term in 2005 and hasn't held an election since. He polls in the teens as far as approval ratings go with the Palestinian people. He hasn't held an election since then as Hamas beats him in every poll. It's a farce that he has the legitimacy to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians and sign a peace deal. His job is to misappropriate aid money and build a 13 million dollar presidential palace while Palestinians wallow in misery.  
Let's ignore this and say a deal is brokered and a Palestine is created. It would be a failed state. The international community would be involved and let's be honest the international community has a horrible track record with nation building in the middle east. Why will Palestine be their first success? The PA doesn't function now, it doesn't hold elections now, it doesn't invest in infrastructure now, what will change? If past is prologue what gives anyone faith this state will be successful?  
What happens if it goes wrong? Israel invades and kicks these people out? A war breaks out and these people just flee? Civil War between Hamas and Fatah?I think outflows of Palestinian refugees could destabilize the entire region. Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt are in no position to take in refugees. Europe doesn't want them either. How much more right-wing will Europe get with 9 million Palestinians on their doorstep? Remember the Lebanon civil war was primarily caused by Palestinian refugees throwing off the demographic balance.  
The sad truth is less Palestinians are dying in the status quo than will in the likely outcomes of establishing their state. Everyone bitches about the status quo, but the middle east is a case study in how things can always be worse. Don't Like Gaddafi, well he's gone now how do you like those open air slave markets and warlords in Libya? Don't like Saddaam , how did you like ISIS? How did that arab spring go for you, oh a military coup in Tunisia so no democracy anywhere in the middle east? The risks of establishing a Palestinian state are just to much. 

I'm not sure what to do with the Palestinians but giving them a state just seems like a recipe for disaster."
1,2023-10-11,CMV: Boomers did nothing wrong,u/pavilionaire2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175j5zf/cmv_boomers_did_nothing_wrong/,changemyview,"I'll take it as a given that millennials and gen-Z have a tougher time of it. College is more expensive, home prices are out of reach, and saving enough to retire at 65 seems like a fantasy. Younger generations seem to blame boomers for this, but I have yet to see an explanation of what boomers did that could have anticipated these outcomes. It seems to be an anger mostly based on jealousy. We have it bad. They had it better. They should have done ... something.

Economy

I've seen a lot of graphs showing multiple economic indicators taking a turn for the worse around 1980. Many people blame this on Reagan. I agree Reagan undid a lot of regulations and cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. That probably exacerbated economic inequality, but this argument is mostly based on correlation and isn't terribly strong. In any case, not all boomers voted for Reagan.

My view is that the US post-war economy was a sweet spot. After WWII, much of Europe was devastated, leaving America best positioned to supply the world with technology and manufactured goods at a time when a lot of the world was developing. What we're seeing now is regression to the mean. Formerly developing countries now have manufacturing of their own and, increasingly, even technology. The realization of the American dream of a suburban single-family home for every middle-class American might have been the exception, not the new normal.

Climate

Okay, boomers bear responsibility for not doing anything to stop greenhouse emissions. But later generations haven't really accomplished much more. Climate change will more negatively impact later generations, but is not more to blame on boomers than anyone else.

Other?

I'm not aware of any other problems boomers get blamed for, but feel free to fill me in."
1,2023-10-11,"CMV: We need to force auto insurance companies to pay for lawyer, appraiser, etc. fees for not-at-fault accidents",u/leapingfro9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175jp7u/cmv_we_need_to_force_auto_insurance_companies_to/,changemyview,"In my opinion, people involved in not-at-fault accident should recover their losses with 0 hassle. Unfortunately, these people have to deal with greedy insurance companies whose job is to collect money by promising to pay for claims and then do everything they can not to give out payments once the claims are filed. They are only willing to pay fraction of what people deserve unless those people hire external helpers like lawyers and appraisers. They do this because ordinary people are easy pushovers but lawyers and appraisers are not. What a despicable attitude. 

&#x200B;

Let's say a client hired a lawyer after giving up the insurance company to pay the fair settlement. The lawyer gets involved and the insurance company now pays multiples of what they offered initially. Who is the loser in this case? The insurance company? No, because it just paid the fair settlement. The loser is the client who has to pay nearly half of his/her settlement that they deserve to the lawyer. The system in which ordinary people have to pay money just to get their fair settlement needs to stop. The only way to do so is to force auto insurance companies to pay for lawyer, appraiser, etc. fees which will make them to pay out fair settlement even before external help is hired."

I'd also like to point out that I am a POC (person of color) myself:

&#x200B;

From what I've generally seen, conservatives think that almost every problem that racial minorities face to be something **internal** \- something self-inflicted. If minorities are suffering, it's because they're lazy, prone to crime, undisciplined, refuse to study and work hard, and hence it's their own fault that people regard them as criminals, or that they do badly in school.

Needless to say, that's an oversimplification, and also doesn't take into account that racism and discrimination is a very real thing. Conservatives seem to think that we live in some sort of genuinely color-blind society.

But I've also seen liberals embrace an equally extreme and also equally unhealthy viewpoint: Namely, that they think nearly every problem racial minorities face is **externally** caused. If racial minorities are doing worse than others, it cannot possibly be because of any character flaw or lack of motivation or lack of discipline or bad culture - it must be because of racism or discrimination from white people, society, etc. Liberals often react very strongly against the idea that racial minorities are even partly to blame for their own woes.

That's an equally unhealthy extreme, and it basically absolves racial minorities of any self-responsibility or self-accountability. 

So, that's the viewpoint I am open to being changed here: Namely, that conservatives err too heavily on the extreme of ""It's almost all minorities' fault, there is almost no racism"" while liberals veer too heavily towards ""It's almost all racism, it's almost never minorities' fault.""

On its face, this is ridiculous, of course. No teacher anywhere has ever been the cause of a child being LGBTQ. Neither does the mere mention of homosexuality turn children into homosexuals.

Instead, Christianity is using this manufactured ""controversy"" as an opportunity to secure the loyalty of the next generation. They do so by deleting information that proves the existence of alternatives to the singular prescribed path of Christianity. When there are no alternatives, children don't have a choice. They have no means to exercise autonomy or critical thinking, and so they lose both. It is perfect for creating generations of people who cannot conceive of disobeying the people they have been trained to follow. 

That is the definition of indoctrination. A person is so afraid of being punished for wearing the wrong clothing that are compelled to punish others for anything and everything out of line. It has been the MO of Christianity ever since emperor Constantine declared it the official Roman religion. And it is so effective that all of Europe lived without question for over 1000 years in poverty, disease, illiteracy, war, and slavery all while the monarchies and clergy lived wealthy lives

The enlightenment broke that trend. Scientists were no longer sentenced to death. Artists were actually patronized by the monarchy and clergy. And it was clearly a huge mistake because almost immediately afterward came the French and American revolutions. And almost immediately after that came the abolition of slavery, women's voting rights, doubled life expectancy, and massive medical, technological, and industrial marvels.

Education isn't important for teaching useful skills. It is important for teaching critical thinking. The more choices get presented and discussed, the more capable their critical thinking becomes, the less likely they are to accept authority for authority's sake. Exactly what prevents indoctrination

Watch it becoming blatantly dismantled:

1,2023-10-11,CMV: Israel are Indigenous peoples taking their land back from the Palestinians that colonized it,u/uwantallofdis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175lkb5/cmv_israel_are_indigenous_peoples_taking_their/,changemyview,"Before I begin, I want to make it clear that both the Israeli government and Hamas have committed terrible wrongs. But, both groups' actions do not justify the atrocities committed on Jewish or Palestinian individuals. Both Israel and Palestine have a right to defend themselves and we should denounce all war crimes and violations of human rights.

But it is fact that the Jewish culture/religion identity originated in the land that is now the home of the Israel/Palestine conflict. This predates the origin of Christianity and Islam. The Jewish nations (Israel and Judah) we're conquered and ruled by various powers: the Babylonians/Syrians, Greeks, and Romans. The Roman Empire then dissolved and the Byzantine Empire was in control of the land. They were then conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in the 6th century, an Islamic/Arabic society from the Arabian Peninsula. That is when the Palestinian/Islam identity began to be associated with the land. The land remained under the control of an Arabic/Islamic society until British colonialism/intervention after the fall of the Ottomons. Then the Zionist movement made way to the modern Israeli/Palestinian conflict. 

According to the UN, ""Indigenous peoples have in common a historical continuity with a given region prior to colonization and a strong link to their lands. They maintain, at least in part, distinct social, economic and political systems. They have distinct languages, cultures, beliefs and knowledge systems. They are determined to maintain and develop their identity and distinct institutions and they form a non-dominant sector of society."" (https://www.un.org/en/fight-racism/vulnerable-groups/indigenous-peoples) 

The Jewish identity fits this definition. Despite persecution, Jewish people have always had a minority presence in Israel since they were the dominant society in antiquity until the recent Zionist movement brought displaced Jews back to their homeland. At a population of around 10 million, Jews are no longer a minority in Israel, but they are still a minority in the Middle East with a large Muslim/Arab majority. And while Jewish society today looks very different from ancient Israel, they still maintain and acknowledge their ancestral and cultural ties in modern times. 

Note that genetically, both Israelis and Palestinians have equal claims to the land (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/). However, that is not how Indigenous identity is determined (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837598/). 

As a result, Israel is not stealing land from Palestine. Palestinians have lived on the land for the past 1400 years, but they are not the original inhabitants, the Jewish people are. They settled the land after conquering it. Jewish people maintained a continuous presence in Israel for over a millenia as the minority Indigenous people (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)). As a result, the Jewish/Israeli identity has a stronger claim to the land than the Palestinian/Islam identity as the Jewish people can trace their connection to the land further back in time than a Palestinian society can. 
 
Sidenote: Archeological evidence suggests that the Canaanite people predated both the Jewish people and the Palestinian people. I'm not aware of adherents to that culture making a claim on the land, but if they were, I would accept that they have a stronger claim than any successive group. If they were making a claim, then they would be the Indigenous group and any successive society would then be colonizers. However, the absence of an earlier society in the modern day conflict than the Jewish one makes the Jewish identity the Indigenous group and original inhabitants of the land."
1,2023-10-11,CMV: Israel does not need and the US should not provide them financial or military aid to deal with the attack by Hamas.,u/DivideEtImpala,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175luzy/cmv_israel_does_not_need_and_the_us_should_not/,changemyview,"
In the aftermath of the attack on Israeli civilians and military by Hamas, Israel is conducting heavy aerial bombardment of Gaza and will possibly conduct some type of ground invasion. In the US, there are calls from both sides of the aisle to pass a multi-billion dollar aid package very quickly. I don't think this is necessary or prudent. 

On necessity, Israel is a rich country with the most advanced and capable army in the Middle East, while Hamas is little more than a militia with small arms and a limited number of inaccurate rockets. If we give Israel nothing, they will still be more than capable of responding however they see fit. 

On prudence, this is not a situation like Ukraine, where a cessation in US aid will leave them unable to defend against a numerically and militarily superior force. If there is military equipment Israel requires they can buy it from our weapons manufacturers. The US already provides several billion dollars annually in military aid, and does not need to provide more. There is no actual urgency to respond with aid, and the calls to urgency remind me of the period after 9/11, where in a time of trauma we allowed our government to pass draconian laws and launch a misguided global war on/of terror. 

Furthermore, if we provide offensive weapons they will be used on attacks that kill civilians, even if unintentionally. 

****

Caveats: Humanitarian aid for the victims of the attack is fine and I think should be provided, and most use of  US military or intel assets to support Israel and deter other countries from attacking is also fine (such as the CSG we brought into the region). My objection is to giving additional money or military equipment to Israel at this time."

This is not a good thing, but in my view it's completely understandable. Love (romantic love) is a critical element of life and humans are biologically hardwired for it (yes there are rare exceptions but the vast majority of people are hardwired for it.) When people can't fulfill their biological desires, it can take a toll on them.

People get bitter and angry about not having a nice enough car or house. Shelter, water, food are biological needs. A large house is not. So given that people will don't liks their neighbors solely because their neighbors are wealthier or have a nicer house, I don't understand why people are surprised when people who haven't found love, a biological desire, dislike those who have. (Or at least they seem to act surprised.) 

Many women who have never found love are bitter about men/women. Many people who have the basics but not much more are bitter about rich people. And somebody could say ""well the bitterness is because they screwed over poorer people"" but that's often not true. And the people who are bitter about rich people often get triggered by *displays* of wealth. It's impossible to know whether a given rich person displaying wealth has screwed over poor people or not. People are jealous because somebody else has something they want. 

As for the idea that bitterness about men/women has lead to violence while bitterness about rich people has not and that's why society treats them differently- that's demonstrably untrue, given all the revolutions there have been. 

Obviously the people who commit mass shootings and other acts of terror because they are lonely and bitter are evil and those acts should be condemned. There is no justification for that. And it is possible to live without love, although the quality of life will be reduced. 

I want to address one other thing, because I think it's important to put everything out there: the idea that it's sex, not love, that people desperately want so not getting it is like being denied a rollercoaster ride and having to play roller coaster tycoon instead. If that were the case, that's something else entirely. But as somebody who has spent time on these internet boards (never joined but I've been lonely myself before) while that is the case for some people many of the people on these boards express the desire for love. 

There are many parallels between these two things (lack of money and lack of love) Conspiracy theories, ideologies, warped worldview. But it seems one (bitterness over lack of money) is more acceptable than the other (bitterness over lack of love) even though money is a societal construct and love is a biological desire. 

That's my view, but I'm open to changing it!"

I believe Jews have a claim to the land of Israel because Jerusalem has existed since biblical times and this region was predominantly jews (Jesus was a born Jew).  They have been prosecuted multiple times; Israelites were slaves of egyptians, they crossed the red sea to first settle down in Israel. Their temples were destroyed multiple times by Romans. The Holocaust. Arab wars(when muslim nations did not accept UN borders)  

Palestinians who are majority muslims even started to exist 700 years after bible mentions about jerusalem. During holocaust jews were very less in number in israel and it was predominantly muslims, but if we are going back in time to tell jews as occupiers when the context is the recent 75 years, why cant we go 2000 years ago to say it was originally the land of jewish faith and whoever came after that were the occupiers. 

So is it right for me to think jews need to have the place, and all the nations who want to see the end of isreal and jews are filled with hatred?"

This is gonna sound like a rant but it’s my opinion based on all that I have learned and read about so far. Israel is absolutely responsible for all this at the core and from the beginning. Say what you will about Hamas, a lot of Hamas members are some straight up psychopaths and for a reason so I agree that Hamas is pretty close to or could be called a terrorist group, but we can’t ignore the elephant in the room that is Netanyahu and what he represents. They refused to respect the customs and wishes of the people who originally lived in the region as new settlers and now they are slowly paying the price. Hamas did a lot of damage within the first 48 hours of the attack with probably only 10,000 or so troops. They were just raiding and pillaging the Israeli countryside that whole day, I was genuinely surprised they planned up to that. Anyways the police and IDF eventually got their shit together and pushed them right back to Gaza and that's where we are right now. This is a very scary situation if you think about it. Take the music festival attack for example. Imagine a Hamas militant who has lived their whole life in basically an open air prison where the most popular contraband is firearms and the prison he grew up in was guarded by some of the most powerful militaries in the world. They likely grew up without parents because of Israeli policies ( but of course they’d hate to admit that ). 


They were growing up when the IDF tried going into Gaza in 2014 which was pretty scary until they left. And this whole time they were being raised by the mosque and Hamas or at least saw people in these organizations as father figures ( because yet again not many parents around for kids in Gaza ). These men who have been training for this for years probably expecting to face heavily armed police and military along with defensive constructions sees the people that have been making him and everyone he knows life a living hell essentially taking their time off from oppressing his people by throwing a EDM music festival with a bunch of pride flags and hippies literally 20 miles away from the open air prison they grew up in. A lot of them probably felt insulted and a little humiliated along with the irony of it all. It’s not surprising that they killed some of those people and took the rest as hostages to use as bargaining chips. That's probably also how they saw a lot of the Israelis they captured. 

If what Hamas did in Israel was bad it’s gonna look like a cake walk compared to what could go on if Israel invades the strip along with the current bombardment. It would be like the Hamas raid but every single day and in a much larger densely populated area made up mostly of women, children, old men, but some fighting age young men with literally nothing to lose since they can’t imagine moving all 2 million of their countrymen to Egypt or the West Bank. They also have been building defenses since 2008 this could easily turn into a bloodbath for the IDF even with the experience. Gaza and the rest of Israel / Palestine have always had shaky relations and i'm sure a lot of people familiar with the area knew this was gonna happen someday in some form. When i say “ always had shaky relations “ i mean before the city was destroyed by Alexander the great and Gaza was a predominately Greek settlement. The people living there were already labeled as one of the antagonists in the torah. Yes there are points in history where Gaza was occupied by the Israelis but they were never incorporated.

The only way Israel could completely annex gaza in the near future would probably involve some crime against humanity needing to be committed against a good portion of the population because people don’t give up as easily as we like to imagine here in the comfy west, a lot of these people are also blissfully religious so the possibility of dying in battle or being executed won’t phase many of these gaza militants they’ve been ready for this. You have to also keep in mind again these fighters have not much to lose except their modest homes and family at this point which are now under threat of being torched by the same invaders the 5th or so time around.

If Israel does occupy Gaza and institute their dystopian policies among the population now completely devoid of 20-60 year old men. It will show how Israel and the west truly feel about Arab muslims the other Arab and muslim nations aren’t just going to sit by and do nothing while theirs a genocide against muslims going on in their own homeland. I could see Iran and Afghanistan cooperating just when it comes to uniting against Israel. We’ll definitely see a much more radical and extreme and possibly even more armed Palestinian government in the west bank along with the civil strife among Arabs living in Israel right now.

I believe the best option is for the UN and/or the neighboring Arab countries to tell Israel to calm their ass down and not invade Palestine and to stop bombing the strip and don’t cut off their electricity, food, and water. It’s a nation of mainly women and children but with a vocal minority of dedicated fighters and the latter will be affected the least by these actions; this only serves to infuriate those involved in an already very volatile situation and make Israel look even more like the obvious bad guy they are to the muslim world. It doesn't help that the IDF is starting firefights with all their neighbors while this is all going down. This should be common sense. These assholes don’t know what they're doing. I wouldn’t like this scenario that much but I hope and pray the UN or the Saudis or some type of treaty can be organized soon or we might see fighting in Jerusalem maybe not soon but eventually."

However, I think the fact that the world pretends to be one way or preaches certain behaviour and attitudes which it clearly doesn't follow drives people mad. For example, the coexistence of religion and non-religion becomes strained over contentious issues. This is because, for either side to see itself as right, it *really* needs to include everyone or noone (though people try to deny or avoid that fact fiercely). Similarly, people have strong emotional knee jerk reactions to incels, but they will not accept that a more highly sexualised society has clear losers who will inevitably be miserable. Yes, incels' rage is childish and driven by envy and a bruised ego, but invalidating their experience and frustration by doubling down is the exact reason why this issue continues to worsen. If people just said, yes you're ugly and people don't want you, that must be shit and I hope you can find some other purpose and fulfilment in life, those people would have no answer. Similarly, good straight edged people are quite right to be annoyed when they are walked over because of the lies which society tells about its prevalent values about work, relationships etc.
If people insist that you can do or be anything, they should not be angry when people turn to the selfish behaviour they see being rewarded all around them, just because they find it unpleasant. 

In general, all of human suffering comes from a longing for rules and structure to be imposed upon them, which is constantly wrestling with their other inner urge to be free and selfish."

1,2023-10-11,"CMV: Anyone who claims that ""renting a home can be better than owning"" is either delusional, in a very specific life situation, or is a blatant landlord shill",u/FrenzyEffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175rai9/cmv_anyone_who_claims_that_renting_a_home_can_be/,changemyview,"Throughout my life, especially more recently, I've seen posts and articles about how sometimes renting can be better than owning because allegedly it is ""cheaper"" because you ""don't need to do maintenance"", but I genuinely can't see how this can remotely be the case, and that is speaking from the perspective of someone who owns their own condo and not a jealous non-owner. 

I pay approx. $1150 per month in rent and condo fee/utilities, and the average rental in my area is $1600 for a one bedroom of similar size. While admittedly I have a low interest rate due to buying during COVID-19, I have done the math and I would only be paying $1350 with modern interest rates. That is still $300 per month cheaper than the average rent, for an above average unit with many features such as air conditioning.  
  
Furthermore, the majority of my money spent on my mortgage is going towards my equity, which may as well translate to going nowhere at all, as I will get that money back plus potentially much more upon selling in the future. Compare that to renting, where you will be throwing your money into someone else's mortgage and will never see any of it back. That's an absurdly higher objective expense compared to having a mortgage, which allows you to essentially bank a large percentage of your monthly fee.  
  
Repairs, obviously, can cost money, however they are relatively to extremely infrequent unless you buy a known fixer upper, and renovations will both increase your future value and allow you to make changes to the space that you personally value, which is another advantage over renting, though not a cost advantage strictly. Also, half the time landlords don't give a shit and would rather leave the space to rot no matter how much you ask, because they know people are desperate for homes and will pay anyway. There are some good landlords who care, but there are just as many who will sit and make you pay for things they should be responsible for if you want it fixed in a timely manner.  
  
The only real argument I see in favor of renting, is if you are someone frequently moving around and need an explicitly temporary property, or if you are already a homeowner and renting out your existing property or between selling and buying. While these are relevant cases, they aren't terribly common and are situations that don't apply to the vast majority.  
  
I dunno. I'm just having trouble seeing how renting can EVER be better than owning, provided you are in a situation where owning is possible. Renting seems like a complete and utter scam. It's the difference between your monthly fee paying off an asset and building a future in addition to serving as shelter, and paying off someone else's mortgage at a higher price with more personal restrictions and literally no benefit to you. How can anyone say this is better unless they are either delusional or shilling for landlords?"

In that time, multiple states have shown how toothless the current court is with a slew of unopposed AWBs and similar laws being made in defiance of the bad opinion put out by clarence. Not one of these bans is being even remotely considered by the supreme court, as many are or are about to go into effect with zero opposition shown by them. They have the ability to stop them and yet they won't. Curious. Might it be because they agree with them? 🤔

This tells me that currently, the way forward for those of us who don't want to see our kids and friends killed by lone wolf incel weirdos is to ban the weapons they use entirely, from sale and possession without the right and proper registration with the government. Ban assault weapons. Ban assault weapon attachments. Ban assault weapon parts. Ban everything you can and cite the decrease in mass casualty events as proof that they work.

 Your average overweight, white, AR-toting, beard-having, Oakley-wearing, redhat moron labe gun nut will throw a fit but they'll capitulate in the end when faced with criminal charges because they have lives and families to feed. Illinois is the perfect example of this working as millions of gun nuts are rushing to register. Where is their precious court in all this? Nowhere to be found and the gun freaks getting twerked on in their absence.

Debating down these nuts when it comes to owning assault weapons is as easy as asking them a singular question that they never have an answer to.

""What will you do when The Stack rocks up?"" 

Gun nuts do everything in their power and twist themselves in knots to avoid the question. They constantly scream for people to stack up but, like I said, they're objectively paper tigers who know they have no reason to be allowed to own assault weapons. This singular question could defeat all the smug grifters, like colion noir and that failed politician brandon herrera. This is why I believe AWBs will stand, as the scotus is too cowardly to take them and instead GVRs them again and again, waiting until they get to retire so we can reinterpret the 2A to be more liberal.

My reasoning? Well the economy, despite inflation, has seen an improvement since 2022 and now appears to be getting better (as far as I know and have researched). Trump has now faced multiple indictments and his ties to the January 6th insurrection and support for conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and his liability in a sexual assault case is enough to turn off quite a large portion of independent and undecided voters. Plus with things seemingly getting worse for Trump by the day I would honestly not be surprised if he dropped out sometime early next year.

The other republican candidates also don't have much traction and would likely be weak candidates against Biden in a general election. Ron DeSantis goes far too much into the ""woke"" crap and his anti-LGBT record will definitely make LGBT voters turn out in droves for Biden, Vivek Ramaswamy only gains traction with the far right and a majority of voters have never even heard of him, Mike Pence would dissapoint MAGA republicans due to him not supporting Trump, Chris Christie would also dissapoint MAGA and those voters would likely stay home. 

So overall, if Biden and Trump have a rematch in 2024, I believe Joe Biden would win by a large margin, Trump is simply too controversial of a person and his rhetoric and indictments will make him lose support among many voters."

1,2023-10-11,CMV: I believe non ionizing EMF radiation may be contributing to my chronic fatigue and brain fog issues,u/Cs21000,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175uk42/cmv_i_believe_non_ionizing_emf_radiation_may_be/,changemyview,"
I know there have been some threads in this sub on this topic and that both science and logic seem to make it clear that there is no risk associated with exposure to non ionizing EMF radiation from things like cell phones, wifi, Bluetooth, transmission lines, etc. But I have a personal experience that I am struggling to explain. This is a long post, but I believe the context is important with a topic like this.

I have struggled with pretty intense fatigue and brain fog for a long time. I have found some things that help, but I still struggle to make it through the day without a nap and still battle the brain fog on a pretty regular basis. Over the years I have seen countless doctors and specialists, had many examinations, blood tests, stool samples taken, etc. All come back saying I’m perfectly fine. I have tried all the lifestyle modifications they recommend including diet, exercise, limiting screen time before bed, getting 8-9 hours of sleep, abstaining from drugs and alcohol, but they have never helped. I am always left with the answer that nobody can figure out why I am having these issues.

I used to see a chiropractor for a back injury.  He is a pretty wacky guy who preaches about holistic and alternative medicine practices. I never paid much attention to this, but continued to see him because the adjustments helped my back. 

Somewhat out of desperation, I went back to see him about my fatigue and brain fog issues. He assessed me, and came back saying that he thinks I am sensitive to Lectins and EMFs. (Lectins are a protein found in some foods, no other doctor had ever recommended avoiding these because there is very little scientific evidence to back up the claim they can be harmful). 

I decided that trying the lectin free diet was harmless and worth a shot, although I thought the EMF theory was ridiculous so I ignored this. 

Well, the lectin free diet actually ended up helping. A lot. Over the last 5-6 years of suffering from these issues it is the singular change that I made that helped the most. I wasn’t completely cured, but noticed a dramatic reduction in both the brain fog and fatigue. 

About a month and a half ago I moved into a new apartment. After a few weeks, I started noticing that my fatigue and brain fog were more noticeable than they had been. I had stopped being incredibly strict with the lectin free diet so I first tried going back to this, and while it did help a bit it didn’t help as much as the first time I went lectin free. 

I couldn’t help but notice that there was a low voltage transmission line directly outside my window in the new apartment. All the science says these are perfectly safe and do not cause a threat to human health, but I couldn’t stop thinking about how the chiropractor also said EMFs from this kind of thing could be contributing to my issues. I know it sounds ridiculous, I know it goes against what science tells us, but he was the only one that had been able to help me to this point. So I decided to buy an EMF monitor, hoping it would show a normal reading so I could put this crazy worry to rest. 

The EMF meter shows that my bedroom has a reading of 2.6 milligauss when I measure the frequency of the standard magnetic field. Pretty much every source I can find online says this is far below the threshold of concern and that this is perfectly safe. However, the consensus among the holistic health community is that a reading about 1.0 mG can contribute to issues like fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety. 

If you had told me 6 months ago that I would be genuinely concerned about something like this I would have said lock me up in the looney bin. But I’m desperate to feel better, and everything this chiropractor has advised me on so far has checked out, as ridiculous as it all sounds.

In past threads on this topic, many people have cited double blind studies where people who think they are EMF sensitive are unable to tell if they are being exposed or not. I don’t think these are particularly relevant, because it took me 3 weeks in the new apartment to notice my symptoms were flaring back up. I also don’t think this is placebo, because I noticed the fatigue/brain fog flare up again before I became concerned about the EMFs from the transmission line.

Is it possible that a small percentage of the population actually is sensitive to these EMFs? And the percentage of the population that is sensitive is small enough that no studies have been able to conclude this yet?

Anyway, thank you to anyone who read all of this and has any thoughts to offer. I’m not a conspiracy theorist or one of those people that believes every crazy thing they read online, Im just a guy who’s been suffering for a long time and wants to explore every possible avenue to understand what may be causing my issues."
1,2023-10-11,CMV: The most Pro-Palestinian thing you could do is be against Palestinian nationalism,u/Far_Introduction3083,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175v51a/cmv_the_most_propalestinian_thing_you_could_do_is/,changemyview,"I am Pro-Palestinian that is why I reject Palestinian Nationalism. Palestinian nationalism, the idea they deserve a state and engage in resistance whether violent or non-violent is contingent on the idea they deserve a state. I don't believe they deserve a state and its counterproductive to their wellbeing and the wellbeing of the world for everyone to continue to pretend they do. My argument is below, please try to dissect it.  
I know at this point I'm pretty black pilled on the matter. I don't want genocide and I think Palestinian civilians deserve human rights but I absolutely reject Palestinian nationalism and it has nothing to do with racism.No ethnic group is entitled to a state as a consequence of existing. This includes both Jews and Palestinians but also lots of other groups see Tibet, Kurdistan, Catalonia, the Uighurs, Hmong, Assyrians, etcetera. I want to say this also includes ethnic groups with established states like Vietnamese or Egyptians or any other state recognized by the UN. Arguments can be made why these various groups deserve a state, but deserve has nothing to do with it. No one deserves self determination, they have historically taken it and other groups have historically taken it away. As an example, see half of Crete being occupied by Turkey or Nagorno-Karabakh being taken by Azeris, both moves I disagree with, but the fact I dislike these actions is meaningless.  
On the Palestinians, I think the idea of international actors such as the US or UN applying pressure in order to give them a state is well bad policy at this point.  
On violent resistance, Palestinians have the ability to go down this path, Israel has every right to use force to continue having the self determination they currently have. I don't see the Palestinians ever winning this struggle for various reasons. Israel doesn't need to have a right to exist, but rather it exists axiomatically. Perhaps one day Israel will fall but I doubt it will be at the hands of Palestinians and their continued insistence on trying to do this violently just results in the misery of their own people. See Hamas and the current situation.  
Israel also has no obligation just because international bodies like to virtue signal to extend Palestinians any form of citizenship or rights. For this same reason, no Arab state is jumping in to take Palestinian refugees in the current crisis. In my mind all Palestinians need to be resettled elsewhere and I honestly don't care where that is. You can yell at me if you want and scream ethnic cleansing but Vae Victis.  
Back to Palestinian nationalism, my main reason that I reject their nationalism is the Palestinian leadership class. Ignoring Hamas, the Palestinian authority is worthless. I have no faith in them to build a state that's a decent actor on the world stage. I think any Palestinian state will be a failed state. It will be an Islamic state not a secular one. I don't even think the Palestinian Authority has the legitimacy to broker a peace deal. Mahmoud Abbas won his election to a 4 year term in 2005 and hasn't held an election since. He polls in the teens as far as approval ratings go with the Palestinian people. It's a farce that he has the legitimacy to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians and sign a peace deal. His job is to misappropriate aid money and build a 13 million dollar presidential palace while Palestinians wallow in misery.  
Let's ignore this and say a deal is brokered and a Palestine is created. It would be a failed state. The international community would be involved and let's be honest the international community has a horrible track record with nation building in the middle east. Why will Palestine be their first success? The PA doesn't function now, it doesn't hold elections now, it doesn't invest in infrastructure now, what will change? If past is prologue what gives anyone faith this state will be successful? What happens if it goes wrong? Israel invades, kills a bunch of people and creates a giant diaspora? A war breaks out and these people just flee? Civil War between Hamas and Fatah? I think outflows of Palestinian refugees could destabilize the entire region. Not only do Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt not want Palestinian refugees they are in no position to take in refugees. All the aforementioned Arab states social stability is precarious to be charitable. Remember the Lebanon civil war was primarily caused by Palestinian refugees throwing off the demographic balance. Europe doesn't want them either. How much more right-wing will Europe get with 9 million Palestinians on their doorstep?  
The sad truth is less Palestinians are dying in the status quo than will in the likely outcomes of establishing their state. Everyone complains about the status quo, but the middle east is a case study in how things can always be worse. Don't Like Gaddafi, well he's gone now how do you like those open air slave markets and warlords in Libya? Don't like Saddaam and Assad, how did you like ISIS? The Arab spring sound like a good idea? Look every Arab state is more oppressive now. The risks of establishing a Palestinian state are just too much.  
Also as a side note, I also reject the premise that having an ethnic state is a way to achieve civil or human rights. Lots of Ethnic states exists and the ethnicity the state exist for have no rights in them. For example, Persians have no rights in Iran, Cubans no rights in Cuba, Koreans no rights in North Korea. On the other hand, a Chinese person has more rights in Canada than China. A Syrian has more rights in the US than Syria. Any Palestinian State will oppress it's citizenry in a similar manner to the ethnic totalitarian states listed above. Hamas already does this in Gaza."
1,2023-10-11,CMV: Israel rightfully deserve their territory.,u/Tottie3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175v85w/cmv_israel_rightfully_deserve_their_territory/,changemyview,"This Israel and Palestine thing has got my head hurting. I’m seeing a lot of people saying that Israel are colonisers and Palestinians deserve to get back their homeland. I want to be clear in that I agree that the Israel treatment of the Palestinian civilian population is horrible and inhumane.

What confuses me is the idea of Palestinians being “colonised” when the Jews are some of the earliest settlers in that region. Like yeah the Israelites did technically “settle” in that land from the Canaanites, but that was in 12 BCE, 3000 years ago, and then they established the first kingdom to ever exist in the area by 900BCE. Surely then that makes them the verifiable living descendants of the earliest living peoples in that area and not the Palestinians that took that land from someone else, who took it from someone else etc…
I’m not sure if this makes sense, but in 3000 years time if America still exists and they get colonised by Ireland, would we consider a native American attempt to recover their ancestral land from the Irish as colonisation on their part for retaking what was theirs? Because if we say “no they’re the originals” surely you’d be advocating for Israel? And if it’s a yes because the sheer amount of time that has passed, why the christ do we still care about the native Americans that got colonised 600 years ago? How many years are allowed to pass before we no longer give a shit about who was there first? I have lots of liberal friends (I am too) who support giving the non native Palestinians their land back and also giving the natives Americans their land back, these two ideas don’t seem to match with me.

What matters more, the most recent inhabitant or the earliest indigenous group? What if it’s discovered that there existed a group before the natives but were massacred by them, therefor no longer making them the indigenous population we believed. Would we then still treat them as indigenous or would we have go ahead to define them as colonisers and settlers too?

Also what confuses me is why the Jews that moved to Palestine are treated unfavourably when their entire existence for 3000 years has been riddled with persecution? Since losing their homeland in 70CE to the Romans, they’ve been persecuted in Europe, Asia, Africa AND the Middle East. 3000 years of being the worlds whipping boy, being enslaved, exiled and displaced. Why is it so wrong that they have a safe space, back in their “promise land” where they can feel secure and clearly they need it, no? In the UK, 20% of religiously motivated hate crimes were against Jews despite making up only 0.5% of the population, compared to 40% against Muslims representing 6.5% and 8% against Christians representing 46% of the nation. Being 7 times smaller than Muslim community but still receiving half the total crime compared to them kinda shows that nothing has really changed, has it? Also in 2021, 50% of all religious hate crime victims were Jews and they clearly aren’t very well liked in the Middle East, so still hated the world over.

I’m also hearing people say “75 years ago Palestinians had their land stolen from them by Zionists.” I also seem to recall another significant event 75 years ago - 6 million jews were murdered in 4 years in the largest genocide. Ever. In human history. Imagine 3000 years of getting absolutely slapped silly, a genocide unlike anything ever seen before AND STILL BEING MADE OUT TO LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY. 12.5 million Africans were horrifically robbed of freedom over a period of 350 years and rightfully deserve atonement. It took Germany 4 years to murder half of that number. Theoretically if the Holocaust had lasted as long as the slave trade, but remained at the same rate it would have amounted to 500 million deaths. And if my gran had wheels she’d be a bike. The rate at which they were culled is staggering and we have the gall to shame them for deciding enough is enough and establishing the home they were exiled from 3000 years ago. “Oh but the actions taken against the civilians by Hamas is only revenge for the treatment of Palestinians so it’s deserved.” My brother in christ, 3000 years persecution and 6 million dead - if the Jews inflicted the revenge we deserve this world would be split asunder.

And then, not only that, when they were legally given ownership of the land by the UN, almost immediately the were invaded by the arab league as soon as the british mandate ended. Idk it just feels like these guys have never been given a chance to catch a break. Anyway, you sly dog, you got me monologuing. 

Also again, Israeli actions deserve repercussion and Palestinians deserve justice. I also feel the need to say, I don’t believe it’s right for a country to own territory because of history. I believe might is right and Israel has the territory because they beat every other bastard that’s tried to take it from them and if you can’t beat them well congratulations, take a ticket and join the end of the line."

Fetishes and kinks are also really cringe. Publicly advertising your kinks, is way more cringe. I don't think we should lock up people with weird fetishes (unless it's a furry, pedophile, rape, or violence fetish), but we should shun them as a society as they are gross sexual perversions that are not natural or normal. As a society we need boundaries. Publicly displaying your kinks by showing up to a Pride parade with a BDSM suit or furry helmet it indecent and breaks our boundaries, and when someone breaks our boundaries, we should shame them for being selfish and stupid. Additionally, posting it online is indecent too, as it is way to accessible for kids. Sometimes, I look up a character, and find softcore porn and drawing of their feet or them fating or being obese or vore or disgusting shit like that. If I can find it, a kid can too. Kinks are bad, being obsessed with sexual activities is bad, and they need shaming to be brought out of public mind."
1,2023-10-11,CMV: Cities Should Have Unique Names,u/Uploft,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175vdw4/cmv_cities_should_have_unique_names/,changemyview,"By unique, I mean no two cities should share the same name. This is probably infeasible on a global scale. After all, how would nations deliberate over who gets to keep their city name and who gets to change it? But within one nation or limited partnering nations (USA and Canada), this seems more than reasonable.  


This gets particularly thorny when identifying which city is being referred to when you are halfway between both locations. If I'm in Virginia and regale about my trip to Wilmington, am I referring to the one in North Carolina or Delaware?   


A resident of one of these cities will struggle to find online resources pertaining to their city unless they append their state/province to the search, and even then it's not a perfect system. Misinformation about sister-named cities proliferates across the web because many people post, blog, and write about these cities but don't specify the state/province in the content.   


Cities named after globally famous cities like London, Canada and Paris, Texas make this unnecessarily worse. What if someone needs to find out about international proceedings between Canada and the UK held in London? These irk me and feel like a cheap cash-in on a bigger city's reputation. 

Other placenames that are frequently confused with each other:  
1. Portland, Oregon, and Portland, Maine: These two cities are both popular summer seaside destinations on their respective coasts. Oregon's Portland gets a lot of press as Seattle's little brother, but when you live on the East Coast, you can never be sure which Portland is being referred to. Both Portlands are the most populous city in their states, so it's doubly head-scratching.   
2. Springfield, Illinois, and Springfield, Massachusetts: Springfield is the 3rd most common city name in the United States. Springfield is the capital of Illinois, whilst the other is Massachusetts' 3rd most populous city.   
3. Ontario, California and Ontario, Canada: Either one can be shortened to ""Ontario, CA"". This is doubly confusing because Ontario, California is home to an international airport, making the puzzlement all the worse.  
4. Birmingham, Alabama, and Birmingham, Michigan: Might be confusing for those living in Rust Belt states. Birmingham, Alabama, is a larger city in the southern United States, while Birmingham, Michigan, is a suburb of Detroit.  
5. Salem, Oregon, and Salem, Massachusetts: Both cities have historical significance, but they are located in different states. Salem, Massachusetts, is known for its witch trials history, while Salem, Oregon, is the capital of the state.

6. Oxford: Oxford is a famous city in Oxfordshire, England. There is also a village called Oxford in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.  


7. Newcastle: There are two major cities named Newcastle in the UK. One is Newcastle upon Tyne in England, and the other is Newcastle in County Down, Northern Ireland.  


8. Perth, Western Australia, and Perth, Tasmania: Perth is the populous capital city of Western Australia, but there is also a small town named Perth in north Tasmania. If you visited Hobart, Tasmania and asked about Perth, you might get conflicting answers."

They’re all just lying to them selves to avoid any type of responsibility. 

1. There are plenty of problems associated with being fat, being obsese or even overweight increased risk if health problem. There’s nothing more to it. You may not have problems at 20 or 30, but it’ll all go downhill eventually.
2. No, you aren’t oppressed. You made the choices to eat the amount of food you did to get to your size. If you don’t fit in a plane seat, or don’t meet the weight requirements for an activity, no one is required to accommodate you. You get to deal with the consequences.
3. Genetics don’t play that big of a role. Even with PCOS and Endometriosis, it is still possible to lose weight in a healthy way.
4. Calorie counting and a deficit does not mean an eating disorder. There is a safe and PROVEN way to lose weight, a calorie deficit, eating less (while still eating enough, not starving yourself)

Weight loss is completely possible and simple. It may not be easy as it takes will power, but it is possible.

What is illegitimate is the continual colonization of Palestine. 

It is on Israel, the boot in the situation with military, political, economic, and international advantages. Palestine and Hamas are desperate.

Israel and Netenyahu's urges have gone extreme towards entirely affording Palestinians no home, while the countries bordering Palestine offer no respite or proper refuge. All the millions of refugees are trapped by IDF and also have no other country to go to. 

Every claim here may not be accurate but through deduction it seems clear that for violent conflict to end, Israel have to propose some kind of democratic solution offering state and regional legitimacy to Palestine. Defined borders, defined land that Palestinian authorities can actually allocate to its people. 

The effects of colonization are very real today, we see it everyday in the usa. this is a sad truth, and it means at this point the best hope for palestinians is not war and extinguishing israel, but to compromise and work with Israel on a solution. 

However this ultimately falls on the kind of proposal Israel offer: the ball is in their court in one line. Both sides have to compromise, but a defined solution with defined borders presented by Israel is necessary to end the war. It cannot be on Hamas/palestinian authorities to comply with current israeli standard of continued colonization and military advancement."

Republicans are split and in disarray.  There is a far right MAGA wing of the party that is holding congress hostage.  Rather than nominating Hakeem Jefferies who will always be limited to 212 Democratic votes, the Democrats need to nominate (and then unanimously support) someone who can get 5 Republican votes to get to the 217 needed to win.

To me, ""tolerable"" would start with someone who is not MAGA, doesn't support Trump, has condemned the attack on the capitol, etc.  Essentially, someone who maybe has different ideologies and opinions from the Democrats on what legislation should be passed, but isn't a ""right wing nut"".  Someone who genuinely wants what is best for America, but just has different opinions on what is ""best"".  Basically, the way things used to be.

A few sample names (and these are just samples, so these specific names are not part of my view that is worth challenging) could be someone like Mitt Romney, Stephanie Murphy, or even Liz Cheney.  I think any one of those 3 could easily get 5 Republican votes, so if they have 100% support from the Democrats, they would win the Speakership.

Is that an outcome that the Democrats would be *happy* with?  Of course not.  But is it a better situation for the Democrats than Jordan or Scalise?  Fuck yes!  So why make an effort nominating someone you're ideological aligned with who can't win, when you could do something else and end up with someone ""less bad""?

Is the goal just to highlight the Republican infighting and make them look bad?  To what end?  Any benefits from that will be outweighed by continuing with another extremist, MAGA nut and getting nothing done but shutting down the government, cutting aid to Ukraine and trying to continue to cover up the capitol attack and Trumps other crimes."

This seems to be kind of a 'GEN Z'-er locution, since I've only just sorta recently started hearing it more often. But what I've picked up on, as far as its usage, is that it really only seems to be used whenever someone either starts winning the argument, or one of the participants isn't reacting in the way the other would like them to (Keeping their cool, not getting provoked & angry, speaking rationally and counterpointing everything thrown at them).  
  
This is usually when the other, more contentiously irritated person will spit out the ""C Word"", ***-'COPE'-***, when they see that things aren't quite going as planned, and things are starting to slip for them. Whether the other person raises a solid counterargument against theirs, or even if they DON'T, but they fully accept & admit their loss in the argument *(""Take The L""*), and not make a big deal of it, they're still likely to get hit with the Cope-Comeback.

From my viewpoint (Which I may be 100% -wrong- about), '*Cope'*, when used in an argument, is basically another way of saying *""Whateva""*, without the sense of defeat that comes with it. It's a crutch word used when the other person, or the direction of the argument, gets the better of them. (This is usually followed by some intense Sperging Out) It really seems more like the person -saying- Cope, **IS** the one who's coping with the situation, just from using that word...

-Young kids love free stuff like free healthcare, free college and universal basic income, regardless of how much national debt those programs accumulate

-The urban rural political divide is significant and cities are growing while rural areas are declining

-Young kids want to stop climate change and so do Democrats

-Young kids are not as religious as their parents were generally speaking, so they are more accepting of premarital sex, porn, abortion and LGBT stuff

-Donald Trump, need I say more?

Originally I was going to post this on the advice sub, but I realized there's nothing I can do about the situation that is prompting this, so maybe you people can change how I think about it. 

_____________

So here's my current line of reasoning:

If my girlfriend is in the mood for sex, then we're having sex. Even if I'm not in the mood and my body isn't cooperating, there are numerous alternate ways I can address her needs. The only time I would ever conceivably reject her is if I was actually unable to proceed, like if I were injured or something. I feel like it would be lazy and selfish of me not to, with the implication that I'm only willing to put in the work and spend the time if *I* want to do it.

I compare it to giving your partner a massage because they're sore from the gym. Sure it's a little work for you and maybe inconvenient, but you care about them and want them to feel good, so you do it even though it doesn't directly benefit you. If you only ever gave your partner a massage when *you* felt like it, then I think it's safe to say most people would be giving far fewer massages than they are. But we suck it up and do it anyway because you don't want to appear lazy and selfish... Do you see my point?

Having sex with your partner takes time and energy, but if you are in the mood for sex then it's worth it to you. I just don't see why you would decline to have sex with your partner just because \*you\* don't feel like it. 

Is there something about the female experience that I'm not understanding that makes this one thing different from anything else you do for your partner?"

1,2023-10-12,CMV: Polyamorous is not a legitimate orientation and people who identify as such are usually toxic/manipulative,u/FreakinTweakin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175zy5x/cmv_polyamorous_is_not_a_legitimate_orientation/,changemyview,"Let me start off by saying I'm extremely left-leaning, and I am not an incel by any standard. I've also had first hand experience being a monogamous person in a polyamorous relationship and it was terrible for my mental health, I found it traumatizing so I admittedly am biased. 

Essentially, I believe that while polyamorous relationships exist, polyamorous PEOPLE do not. By that, I mean that EVERYONE has urges to see others every now and then despite being in a committed relationship. This is a normal part of the human experience. It does not make you a ""polyamorous"" personbor any other such thing to identify as. In my world, Polyamory is a relationship structure where both partners agree it is ok, polyamory is not an inherent quality of an individual. Likewise, most people enter monogamous relationships due to insecurity and jealousy over the thought of their partner (not them) being involved romantically or sexually with others. I view monogamy as being unnatural for most people, as anyone is capable or having crushes with more than one, but a sacrifice that most people make to have their partners and themselves feel secure in a relarionship. If you feel that you have irresistible urges to see multiple other people at once, and monogamy is not possible for you, this is not an orientation, this is, for lack of a better word, called being a ho with no boundaries and little self control. In which case, polyamory is for you. That's perfectly ok to be, but here is where the second part of my opinion comes in - polyamorous people are (not always) toxic and will manipulate monogamous people into being in relationships with them while they see other people, knowing full well that this makes their partners uncomfortable. Of course the ideal polyamorous relationship is when both partners embrace the idea and both have secondaries, this is not how it turns out in 99% of cases. There is a reason why polyamorous relationships have a higher likelihood of failing than monogsmous ones. Because one partner is usually unhappy and insecure about the situation. But this is all from the perspective of a monagous person. I also think being polyamorous in general leads to unhealthy and toxic relations due to the type of options you will encounter as a polyamorous person.

I believe that if you are openly identifying as polyamorous, the majority of people you will encounter who are willing to give poly a try, are people who have little self respect and are afraid of being alone, or people who don't actually care and are using you for sex or other reasons."

In the aftermath of the attack on Israeli civilians and military by Hamas, Israel is conducting heavy aerial bombardment of Gaza and will possibly conduct some type of ground invasion. In the US, there are calls from both sides of the aisle to pass a multi-billion dollar aid package very quickly. I don't think this is necessary or prudent. 

***
*Caveats:* Humanitarian aid for the victims of the attack is fine and I think should be provided, and most use of  US military or intel assets to support Israel and deter other countries from attacking is also fine (such as the CSG we brought into the region). My objection is to giving additional money or military equipment to Israel at this time.

***

On necessity, Israel is a rich country with the most advanced and capable army in the Middle East, while Hamas is little more than a militia with small arms and a limited number of inaccurate rockets. If we give Israel nothing, they will still be more than capable of responding however they see fit. 

On prudence, this is not a situation like Ukraine, where a cessation in US aid will leave them unable to defend against a numerically and militarily superior force. If there is military equipment Israel requires they can buy it from our weapons manufacturers. The US already provides several billion dollars annually in military aid, and does not need to provide more. There is no actual urgency to respond with aid, and the calls to urgency remind me of the period after 9/11, where in a time of trauma we allowed our government to pass draconian laws and launch a misguided global war on/of terror. 

Furthermore, if we provide offensive weapons they will be used on attacks that kill civilians, even if unintentionally, which I object to on moral grounds. It will also worsen US relations with some Muslim-majority countries in the region.

1,2023-10-12,CMV: The Most Pro-Palestinian thing you can do is reject Palestinian Nationalism,u/Far_Introduction3083,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17621vx/cmv_the_most_propalestinian_thing_you_can_do_is/,changemyview,"I am Pro-Palestinian that is why I reject Palestinian Nationalism. Pro-Palestinian for the purpose of this arguement is being pro reducing Palestinian misery. Palestinian nationalism, the idea they deserve a state and engage in resistance whether violent or non-violent is contingent on the idea they deserve a state. I don't believe they deserve a state and it's counterproductive to their wellbeing and the wellbeing of the world for everyone to continue to pretend they do. My argument is below.

  
I know at this point I'm pretty black pilled on the matter. I don't want genocide and I think Palestinian civilians deserve human rights but I absolutely reject Palestinian nationalism and it has nothing to do with racism. No ethnic group is entitled to a state as a consequence of existing. This includes both Jews and Palestinians but also lots of other groups see Tibet, Kurdistan, Catalonia, the Uighurs, Hmong, Assyrians, etcetera. I want to say this also includes ethnic groups with established states like Chinese, French or Egyptians or any other state recognized by the UN. Arguments can be made why these various groups ""deserve"" a state, but deserve has nothing to do with it. No one deserves self determination, they have historically taken it and other groups have historically taken it away. As an example, see half of Cyprus being occupied by Turkey or Nagorno-Karabakh being taken by Azeris, both moves I disagree with, but the fact I dislike these actions is meaningless.

  
On violent resistance, Palestinians have the ability to go down this path, Israel has the ability to use force to continue having the self determination they currently have. Notice that I used the word ability rather than right as no one has the right to inflict violence. I don't see the Palestinians ever winning this struggle for various reasons. Israel doesn't need to have a right to exist, but rather it exists axiomatically. Perhaps one day Israel will fall but I doubt it will be at the hands of Palestinians and their continued insistence on trying to do this violently just results in the misery of their own people. See Hamas and the current situation in Gaza.

  
On peaceful resistance, I think the idea of international actors such as the US or UN applying pressure to Israel in order to give them a state or force Israel to integrate them as full citizens is bad policy at this point. Israel also has no obligation just because international bodies like to virtue signal to extend Palestinians any form of citizenship or rights and international bodies will be unable to force a nuclear state's hand. It also has no desire to integrate them. In practice a one state solution could never happen. In theory, given the animosity between the two groups, it's a recipe for a bloody civil war that the Palestinians will most likely lose and bear the consequences for. Their desire for nationalism would once again result in their misery.

  
I would also like to point out that international bodies have been unable to convince Arab states to resettle refugees from the current conflict. This is largely a consequence of Palestinian Nationalism see Black September in Jordan or the actions of the PLO during the Lebanese civil war. In both of these cases the PLO, the Palestinian political class, tried to seize political power. Most Palestinians aren't terrorists but everyone is afraid of potential terrorist elements among the Palestinian population with nationalistic goals and the risks of destabilization as a consequence and therefore do not allow migration.

  
Back to Palestinian nationalism, my main reason that I reject their nationalism is the Palestinian leadership class. Ignoring Hamas, the Palestinian Authority is worthless. I have no faith in them to build a state that's a decent actor on the world stage. I think any Palestinian state will be a failed state. It will be an Islamic state not a secular one. I don't even think the Palestinian Authority has the legitimacy to broker a peace deal. Mahmoud Abbas won his election to a 4 year term in 2005 and hasn't held an election since. He polls in the teens as far as approval ratings go with the Palestinian people. It's a farce that he has the legitimacy to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians and sign a peace deal. His job is to misappropriate aid money and build a 13 million dollar presidential palace while Palestinians wallow in misery.

  
Let's ignore this and say a deal is brokered and a Palestine is created. It would be a failed state. The international community would be involved and let's be honest the international community has a horrible track record with nation building in the middle east. Why will Palestine be their first success?   
The Palestinian political class aren't interested in doing the hard work of building a state, they are more interested in fighting the jews. It is why Gaza still has rockets to shoot but no petrol for their power plant. It speaks to the priorities of the Palestinian political class.

  
The PA doesn't function now, it doesn't hold elections now, it doesn't invest in infrastructure now, what will change? If the past is prologue what gives anyone faith this state will be successful? 

What happens if it goes wrong? What happens if it starts shooting rockets at Israel? Israel invades, kills a bunch of people and creates a giant diaspora? A war breaks out and these people just flee? Civil War between Hamas and Fatah? I think outflows of Palestinian refugees could destabilize the entire region. Not only do Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt not want Palestinian refugees they are in no position to take in refugees. All the aforementioned Arab states' social stability is precarious to be charitable. Remember the Lebanon civil war was primarily caused by Palestinian refugees throwing off the demographic balance. Europe doesn't want them either. How much more right-wing will Europe get with 9 million Palestinians on their doorstep?

  
Everyone complains about the status quo, the Palestinians are miserable, but the Middle East is a case study in how things can always be worse. Don't Like Gaddafi, well he's gone now how do you like those open air slave markets and warlords in Libya? Don't like Saddaam and Assad, how did you like ISIS? The Arab spring sound like a good idea? Look, every Arab state is more oppressive now. The risks of establishing a Palestinian state are just too much.

  
Also as a side note, I also reject the premise that having an ethnic state is a way to achieve civil or human rights. Lots of ethnic nation states exist and the ethnicity the state exists for has no rights in them. For example, Persians have no rights in Iran and Koreans have no rights in North Korea. On the other hand, a Han Chinese person has more rights in Canada than China. You can have civil rights in a multi-ethnic state. Any Palestinian State will oppress its citizenry in a similar manner to the ethnic totalitarian states listed above. Hamas already does this in Gaza and I think Fatah does it to a lesser extent in the West Bank.

  
In my mind all Palestinians need to be resettled elsewhere. You can yell at me if you want and scream ethnic cleansing is a crime and you would be right but Vae Victis. My ideal solution would be to resettle them among various Arab states. Dispersal has worked to reduce militancy before. Historically, when Marcus Aurelius and Pompey the Great gave their soldiers parcels of land, they resettled them far apart from each other as they were under the belief that a lot of veterans together could mobilize easily into an army challenging them. Dispersal worked for the Romans, it could work for the Palestinians. You can keep your culture without a state and I hope you do. It is a beautiful and vibrant culture.

No. F*** you. F*** Israel. F*** Palestine.

I don't think it's appropriate to call the Palestinians terrorists. Palestine was a country, and it was taken over and turned into Israel by force. Israel currently oppresses the people of Palestine in an apartheid state.

I think the first thing that should be done when talking about the situation is to call it what it is. 

#Two Nations at War.

It's Teo cou tries in a land dispute 

If we look at history, it is clear that Hamas and Palestine have a legitimate grievance. At the beginning of this conflict, they are the party who was wronged first. And Israel continues to wrong them

However, we can look at other groups in history who have been in a similar position and see how they've reacted. Namely we have the American Civil Rights movement with MLK, Nelson Mandela's movement in South Africa, and Gandhi in India (please don't tell me what a piece of shit person Gandhi or MLK was in their personal life. It's not relevant to the political argument right now)

These figures went about expressing their grievance through peaceful resistance, which garnered sympathy and support both locally and internationally. When Mandela and Gandhi were able to be in positions of power in their respective countries, they followed through with their philosophy, and I have no doubt that MLK would have as well had he survived

The people in charge of Hamas and Palestine are not using this kind of peaceful Progressive rhetoric. Quite the opposite. They are chanting burn the Jews. Something that is not only appalling on its face but also has a clear historical connotation in relation to the Holocaust. They are targeting women and children for rape and murder. They are not supporting any peaceful philosophy in large numbers.

And Israeli soldiers are posting videos of themselve slathering bullets in pork lard because they think thats funny

I'm on the side that both countries need to grow the fuck up, be mature and start seeing eachother as humans worthy of respect and dignity. 

I'm on the side that someone, anyone, from Palestine, will stand in front of a crowd of people and preach peaceful civil disobedience and protests, and that people will listen. 

I'm on the side that someone, anyone, from Israel will stand in front of a crowd and admit that they have done wrong and that they should reconcile with Palestine to find a peaceful solution, and that people will listen.

Unfortunately, Palestine has to go first. Oppressors never go first. Until they can't manage that, Palestine will always be the bad guy. Israel will always be able to claim ""see. They're violent and dangerous. We have to oppress them for our own safety."" 

Right now, Palestine is making Israel look right. It's like when the bully picks on a kid until the kid throws a punch and gets suspended. Palestine needs to wake up and learn how to do diplomacy in a civilized world."

Some people say eating healthy is expensive and/or time consuming.

The thing is, even suboptimal diet is better than what most people eat, so take for example a diet that consists of:

soft-boiled eggs with sourdough bread, tomatoes and ham

muesli made from oats, nuts, almonds and such, with yogurt, banana and apple

cottage cheese with sourdough bread, either with onions and tomatoes or low-sugar jam 

and of course dinner - oven cooked meat, greek salad with olive oil and buckwheat

it's not the cheapest you can get, but all ingredients are unprocessed and most are cheap, preparation times are from almost zero to minimum and it covers most of macro and micronutrient demand already

I know diet is about variety, but if you create a three day plan like this and balance it for micronutrients and calories and stick to it, it's nowhere near hard to buy, prepare, eat and get healthier"
1,2023-10-12,CMV: Armed Resistance against brutal occupation is completely legitimate and sometimes the only option the occupied have left. It is also allowed according to International Law.,u/KOLLYBOLLYWOLLY,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17637gj/cmv_armed_resistance_against_brutal_occupation_is/,changemyview,"I think you all know what I'm going to talk about:

Yes, the Jewish resistance against the brutal Nazi occupation.

Just to give a little bit of context, in the 1930s, the Nazis had implemented a policy of ""German/European Supremacy"" and ""Lebensraum"" in which they will need space to expand to properly cater to the potential increasing German population.

&#x200B;

They also believed that ""Jews"" were an existential threat to the ""Glorious Third Reich""

&#x200B;

In light of this, the Nazis militarily occupied Europe ""as their right for being the superior race"" to the detriment of the Slavs, Roma gypsies and, ofcourse, European Jews. They would at best be killed straight away, at worst be placed in horrific concentration camps. This policy would not even exclude children and infants.

&#x200B;

The Jews, did not take this lying down and would form resistance groups and partisan groups to attack the Nazi regime, which would then generally cause a horrific reaction to these resistance groups against Jewish groups and routinely use collective punishment.

Non-violent resistance was tried by Jewish groups in Eastern Europe but that didn't help or change their material conditions, as they were still transported to concentration camps and murdered.

&#x200B;

The Nazis would use their allies and media to label these resistance fighters as ""terrorists"" , claim they are drinking the blood of babies etc, in an effort to further dehumanise the Jews (to justify their genocide) and to push public opinion against them. 

But I believe armed resistance against brutal occupation and genocidal regimes is legitimate as the occupied has little other options and it is easy for people who are not living in those conditions to condemn it as ""terrorism"". 

If I was in the same situation as occupied Jews in Europe, I hope I would have the same courage as these brave freedom fighters did.

While I acknowledge the value that religion holds for many individuals, I believe that eliminating religion could potentially lead to a more harmonious and peaceful world. Here are some points to consider, particularly in the context of how religion has historically contributed to conflicts:

1. Reduction in Religious Conflicts: It's undeniable that a significant number of conflicts and wars throughout history have been fueled or directly caused by religious differences. Eliminating religion could greatly reduce these tensions, leading to a more peaceful world.

2. Promotion of Secular Values: In a world without religion, there would likely be a stronger emphasis on secular values such as reason, human rights, and equality. This could foster more inclusive societies where people are judged by their actions rather than their religious beliefs.

3. Tolerance and Acceptance: A world without religious divisions might encourage greater acceptance and tolerance of diverse viewpoints and lifestyles. The absence of religious dogma could pave the way for more open-minded societies.

4. Paradox of Separation: It's ironic that religion, which often aims to bring people together in faith based communities, has also contributed to division and separation. Religious differences have led to prejudices, discrimination, and even violence, creating rifts between different faith groups. The absence of religion could help bridge these divides, promoting a more united and interconnected global society.

While this perspective highlights the potential benefits of a world without religion, it's important to recognize that faith also brings comfort, guidance, and a sense of community to many people. The complete elimination of religion may not be feasible or desirable for everyone."

1,2023-10-12,CMV: it is impossible to blame how the people in gaza acted when they attacked israel,u/UnNamedUser66,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1763mzk/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_blame_how_the_people_in/,changemyview,"Imagine if you put yourself in the foot of people of gaza. You were born in the year 2000 the gaza blockade began in 2005 and became full fledged in 2006, since you were 6 years old you have known nothing but blockade your whole life, Israel barely allows enough calories to keep you alive, water isn't clean and electricity is off half the day. 

When you were 9 years old Israel invaded and bombed, your parents lost their homes and now you have to live with a relative home. One of you school mates never return to school after the war. 

At 12 Egypt overthrown their dictator and their democratically elected goverment ease up the blockade from their border. You have hope now for things to get better. Your grand parents tell you how they used to live in ashkelon before being kicked off by Israelis in 1948 and have never given up hope to return to their birth place. You dream about leaving your home one day and studying abroad, but then next year Israel backed coup over throws the democratic government in Egypt and the new dictator makes the coup even more saffocating than before. In 2012 and 2014 when you were people fought back demanding ending the blockade. Israel bombs your new home and this time your dad died. Now as the eldest sibling you have to take of the rest of your family and find a job.

Over the next years things became worse Israel bombings became more frequent and economy collapses medical supplies more limited and one day one of your relatives die from a work accident doing labor and is denied access to an Egyptian hospital. More work for you. At 20 you volunteer to help take care of the injured people another bombing and say enough is enough and join an armed militia

Meanwhile you hear on the news how Israelis keep on electing the same politicians who placed the blockade on you, and more and and more hateful politicians rise to power sending more hatefull statements promising to wipe you out and bombing you to the stone age. 

Finally in 2023, you hear your people break through the seige took Israel completely by surprise tool hostages who will be exchanged for ending blockade that ruined your like, take over Israeli military installation and for the first time in your life you have upper hand over israel, what do you think you will do?"

His people have been forcibly displaced and face constant persecution and discrimination. He grows up desiring freedom for him and his people above all else not wanting to live his life in a cage. One day a titanic and overbearing force kills his mother right in front of him and so he vows to fight. After all, if he does not fight, he will never be free.  
He is full of hate and he probably knows it. He does not think that there is a solution so he watches and waits and sees that talks go nowhere. He and the military brass unilaterally (not necessarily representing the rest of his people) decide to fight. They make a declaration of war against a foe that is militarily conventionally far stronger than them. They kill innocent civilians. Women. Children.

A young girl whose friends are murdered for simply being in the stands does not understand why her friends had to die. She is angry and will happily tell anyone who interviews her how her nation will have their payment in blood. When it is pointed out to her that her nation has killed their loved ones she asks what about her friends. She retorts that she has lost people too.  
Some influential ~~minister~~ man called Willy makes a speech filled with dehumanising rhetoric about how the world needs to unite to destroy the ~~human animals~~ island devils so that they can live safe and without threat in the future. His people and the world at large give him a standing ovation, they clap and dance at this declaration. They will launch a massive raid and neutralise the threat. He promises severe retribution, dropping so many bombs that all the inhabitants can do is stare helplessly at the sky as the rumbling of collapsing buildings grows ever louder. They have been given a single warning to run even though there is nowhere to run to. 

We later see the charred bodies of children and babies amongst the rubble.

Is this the story of Eren Jeagar or Hamas militant?

If you strip away the fantastical elements and make the most minor of alterations to the story, you can see that Isayama has managed to portray such a complex and realistic conflict in a way that was extremely accurate but allows you to understand all of the sides of this conflict. Watch the news, read the comments on reddit - you can see the Armins, the Erens, the Hanges, the Gabis and the Flochs.

Israel and the US have faked or over exgerrated events to aid their interests. Iraq WMD stories and fake images is but one example

Israel is an apartheid state as stated by harvard law review, amnesty international and human rights watch. It has subjugated the people of palestine in Gaza and the West Bank for over 75 years. Armed resistance against an occupier is legal under UN resolutions. Who decides who and what is a terroist organistaion? The US and its friends? The US deemed Nelson Mandelas party a terrorist organistaion while it was fighting apartehid.... Designating an organistation as terrorist is but a tool the West uses. It should be based off the dictionary definition, but they would never do that as they themselves are terroists.   

To those that say gazans should push for peace through negotiations and peaceful process. Theyve tried that for 7 decades, the west bank has no armed groups and yet they still live under oppression that gets worse everyday. In 2018 Gaza had a 1 year long peaceful process that i bet only a small amount of people heard of."

At a time, when I had so much at hand, someone from another team approached me for help. I wanted to ignore her, but I couldn’t. So, I sacrificed my sleep that night.
 

After the deadline, she came to thank me. I felt some unusual satisfaction. Even with no sleep, I was feeling good as if I had gained something more.

 
Maybe I wanted to help her because I know how it feels like to be in her situation - to be asking for help in distress. I have been there many times.

 
Also, at my workplace, there is no culture of helping each other. They can’t even stand anybody else succeeding.
 
 
I read the below quote from Sadhguru and I immediately got reminded of this incident:
“Efficiency should always be out of love and care for people around you – not a machine-like, unconcerned action.”
 

I felt if only people cared more for those they work with, it might actually result in more efficient and happy employees.
 

I know, not all workplaces are like this. But this can be, if only we work along with an intent to help others too? What do you think?"

War-crimes are not a thing people at war care about, they are not enforceable and no country in a war is worried about “war-crimes” when the alternative is losing the war. They are ideal standards of how to conduct war, made by the people who won war by abiding my none of them, but wanted to demonize the loser of the war and hold them solely responsible. Basically, War-crimes only exist for posturing, or punishing. No victor will ever be charged with war-crimes, They are a form of punishing the losers of wars, an updated version of the War Guilt clause from the treaty of Versailles. That’s it.  
  
The Nuremberg trails existed to blame Germany for word war 2, and more importantly in response to the holocaust to explicitly hold Nazis ideology as directly responsible. That was a 1-time thing, not a change in the game signaling a new enlightened approach to warfare for the 20th century.  
  
There is no such thing as a war crime, if you win. These days they only get brought up so that nations not at war can judge those fighting from a stance of moral superiority. You can wish nations at war would be more humane, but unless its your people and your land being burned, your judgment on the morality of the conflict does nothing but make your self feel better while condemning those fighting for their lives."

I am 45 so I see moms my age having things done, I also see girls in their 20's having things done and I am just amazed. The people I see getting these treatments are generally already pretty attractive and don't appear to need anything done. I typically don't even NOTICE that they had anything done until they point it out. A friend of mine had her 11's done (two wrinkles between the eyes) and I had no idea. So you spend thousands on something that no one knows you had done except you?

It seems like the attitude around this is if it makes you feel good, do it. Feel empowered to get this done, don't judge anyone who gets it done, it's their body their face. I get that it's not my business but in the long run all the people getting this done are normalizing this, making it mainstream and pressuring other women to get it done. Think of it as covering gray hair, dying hair or getting nails done....but it's way more expensive and invasive.

I guess I am just surprised at how common it's become but it seems to just be me? Other people seem happy to have the option of having these things done. My attitude is be happy with what you have, you're actually very pretty the way you are. It's shocking to me that people want these crazy big lips or even microbladed eyebrows. Many people look like clowns after having these things done. 

Now if someone has really bad skin or something I can see getting something done...but it almost feels like botox and fillers are being abused. People in their early 20's should not be getting this stuff done but of course these med spas and beauty places are happy to take their money. 

I have a young daughter and I guess I need to be open in case she comes home at 18 or 20 with this stuff? For me I guess I will age like a hag because I am not going to be getting botox or filler every few months, lol."

I think people like certain elements of work, but not the necessary elements of work itself.  The things people like about work can actually be separated from work.  Work itself is tedious and even dehumanizing.  It is a compromise with a material reality which only limits us rather than enables us.  Working to remove those material limitations and to live uncompromised lives should be the goal of our society.

People like to be creative.  Sometimes work allows for a degree of creativity, but always in a limited sense.  Being a craftsman or an artist is often antithetical to economic imperatives.  The time spent perfecting your product so that it accurately reflects your creative powers is often seen as a waste from a perspective which values market efficiency above all else.  We see this all the time when creators complain about how their work-product was rushed out before it was ready due to a pressure from investors to monetize their work.  If freed from the material demands of work, we would have crafting and artistry in its pure form.

People like to serve others.  They like to be identified as someone with unique knowledge and skills to contribute to society.  Work fulfills this desire imperfectly because work is structured as an exchange, not as a gift to society or a service provided willingly.  The fullest appreciation of the people served is never received because the people are paying for the service.  With that payment comes scrutiny and criticism rather than gratitude or recognition.  This is why people who achieve financial security often devote themselves to philanthropy, sometimes it’s actually more fulfilling to do things without the promise of material compensation. 

People like to compete.  Some people treat their work as competitive play, in which case the work is incidental at best, and damaging at its worst.  Work just happens to be the game with the highest stakes, the most talented players, and which rewards the greatest recognition – if everyone was playing a different game, these sorts of people would get just as invested.  Even the luxury afforded to the wealthy and successful is really just an abstraction of competition; we all know that many luxury commodities are absurd, and that rich people only buy them precisely because other people cannot afford to do so.  There is nothing wrong with competition itself, the problem is that the free market ties competition to material productivity, and the results often work against social interests.  There is a tipping point at which the profit generated by competitive tactics are outweighed by the damage those tactics cause.

I believe that our goal in terms of our material relationship to the world should be to work hard to end work forever.  We should be working towards full-automation so that we can take care of our basic needs with minimum human involvement.  At the same time, we should be working to create spaces to enjoy the activities that fulfill us, freed from the stakes of material necessity.  Luxury can still be at stake for our creativity, our competitions, and our service to society, but I suspect that the concept of luxury itself would become secondary to what we get from these activities themselves."

The math on this number is \~2 hours a day and/or long stints on weekends consistently. In my view, since we're using the word ""addiction,"" the person would need to exhibit consistent or compulsive behavior. So, I'd say, they're playing video games in this fashion for 2+ months. 

  
**Known Prevalence** [Statistics](https://mpowerwellness.com/video-game-addiction-statistics/)**:** 

* Worldwide prevalence of gaming disorders is 3.05%. 
* During COVID, 30% of British people skipped eating food and showering just to play a video game.
* 8% of kids and adolescents that are younger than 18 throughout the world could be addicted to playing video games.

**Consequences of Video Game Addiction:**

* Poor work and/or school performance
* Mood and/or social disorders
* Obesity and/or weight health issues
* Sedentary lifestyle
* Lack of in-person interactions with friends, noticeable reduction in social circles leading to isolation feeding back into the above consequences.

**My Experience:**

In my selective exposure, I’ve had family and friends who’ve been addicted to meth and heroine. Plenty of them had alcohol problems or had been arrested for selling marijuana. My family and friends who had drug problems would act sporadically or in an untrustworthy manner occasionally but they’d otherwise interact in society. They’d go to museums, work to improve their career/job prospects, go hiking, and otherwise had productive hobbies. Generally, **the people addicted to drugs were interesting people who lived a somewhat productive life in comparison to the video-game addicted people**; albeit with a giant vice. 

My friends who had video game addictions would go years without leaving their house for non-obligatory reasons (like work, errands, etc.). They’d call out of work and lose their job for a new video game release.  They’d neglect their relationships with people for years to play video games every nonstop every Saturday and Sunday. Their health and social standing would drop significantly. They'd neglect taking their kids to parks, clubs, or to social functions. Plainly put, they’d be talked about in the same way you’d discuss someone with a significant drug issue: “they need help.”  

**Video game addicted people justify their video games the same way a drug active defends their drug use.**

* By playing video games, I'm actually saving money because I don't go out! (Sounds a lot like 'by using this drug, I save money not seeing a doctor for my illness.')
* Its just a hobby. It's what I enjoy to do to decompress! (Sounds like 'A drink a lot to relax.')
* This is more than a hobby, I can stream to make money on the side! (Sounds like 'I sell a bit to cover my drug use expenses.')
* I called out sick to play the new game. (Sounds like 'I was hungover, I called out sick.')
* I don't like hanging out with people, I'd prefer to just stay home gaming. (Sounds like 'I'd prefer to just get @#$%ed up alone.')

1,2023-10-12,CMV: The Los Angeles Dodgers’ 2020 World Series Championship is a fully legitimate title and does not deserve an asterisk,u/headsmanjaeger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176bxoo/cmv_the_los_angeles_dodgers_2020_world_series/,changemyview,"The Los Angeles Dodgers, my favorite baseball team, have made the MLB playoffs in an impressive 11 consecutive seasons. However, they have underperformed, being eliminated in the playoffs 10 of those 11 seasons. The lone exception was the 2020 season, which was shortened due to COVID from 162 regular season games to just 60, before a modified playoffs in which the Dodgers emerged victorious.

Because of the unusual circumstances of this season, many baseball fans (usually fans of rival teams) will say the season doesn’t count or that the Dodgers’ title deserves an asterisk. An asterisk (\*) is used in sports discourse to signify that an accomplishment is tainted in some way, or doesn’t count. For instance, one might say that the Houston Astros 2017 World Series Championship\* is illegitimate because they were later found to be using an elaborate sign-stealing scheme that gave them an unfair advantage. Another example would be Barry Bonds’ all-time record of 762 career home runs\*, which was likely inflated by his use of steroids, which is against league rules (I am not here to debate these, by the way. They are just examples).

The 2020 Dodgers did not commit a (known) cheating scandal. They were not given any unfair advantages due to the shortened nature of the season. They won the title after out-lasting the other 29 teams, the same number of teams that all World Series winners have out-lasted since the major leagues expanded to 30 teams in 1998. None of the other teams forfeited the season or didn’t try as hard. 

Some common reasons stated for this asterisk:

•	“They didn’t have to endure the grueling 162-game season that other champions do.” The Dodgers have in recent memory had no trouble grinding through the grueling 162-game season, as they have made the playoffs in ten consecutive such seasons, and 2020 would have been no different. The playoffs were actually harder to win, as there were 16 teams that qualified instead of the usual 10 and the Dodgers won 13 playoff games, more than any other team in MLB history as of 2023 (under the new playoff format, it is possible for teams to match this number but so far no one has).

•	“They were playing at full health due to the season being shorter.” So? Teams throughout history have been at varying levels of health come playoff time, and it does not affect the legitimacy of their success. If anything, it makes it more impressive that Dodgers were able to win over teams like the Braves and Rays who were also at full health.

•	“The Dodgers’ prior and subsequent playoff failings prove this one is fraudulent.” This is simply not how it works in sports. Individual seasons are measured individually. We don’t say the same thing about teams like the 2015 Royals, 2016 Cubs, or 2019 Nationals, who also were not able to replicate their success.

The attempted de-legitimization of this title comes from fans of rival teams who dislike the Dodgers and do not want to recognize their success. Most other teams wouldn’t have to endure this discourse had they won it all in 2020, save for maybe the Yankees and the Astros, who are also disliked by most fanbases.

Things that will CMV:

•	Showing me how shortened nature of the 2020 season or the modified playoff format actually gave the Dodgers an unfair advantage in winning the World Series

•	Showing me evidence of teams before the start of the 2020 season saying that they were not going to try as hard or that they did not consider this season legitimate due to it being shorter

•	Giving me a novel reason other than ones listed as to why the championship is illegitimate, or rebutting my responses to the reasons listed

Things that will not CMV:

•	Calling me salty

•	Saying it doesn’t matter or that sportsball is dumb

•	Debating the legitimacy of the 2017 Astros World Series or Barry Bonds’ home run record

People wrote that top CEOs are tireless workers, who dedicate their entire life to the success of an entity. That may be true, but tons of regular people do this. One huge example are the millions of poor families that have individuals who sacrifice most of their waking hours to ensure some quality of life for their dependents. This behavior is not even minimally unique to top CEOs. Furthermore, executive positions rarely have any meaningful personal financial stakes, or otherwise (they already made it). The main reason for their absurd pay, appears to be because they are allowed to dictate it, and that societies prioritize shareholders over laborers. If laborers were protected and prioritized, it would be seemingly impossible to justify an absurd CEO salary.

I have also read that CEOs successfully manage tons of important relationships, and have to make enormous decisions every day. This is also not unique to top CEOs. Again, I will use a common example with higher personal stakes, which are working poor families. The working poor often have to succesfully deal with tons of people who have power over THEM (often sociopaths), under the threat of homelessness, daily. Their decisions and sacrifices are what make every difference for them and their families. CEOs have entire teams dedicated to making their decisions easier. The important relationships that CEOs manage are likely people with mutual interests, from the same absurd social class (low personal stakes in terms of financial security), which is hardly the most testing thing one can imagine.

Another thing I read is that CEOs tie together a lot of expertise from different departments. This is also not unique and even less special, in light of the people who manage the actual products and projects that truly define the success of a large company. In a large company, the departments must surely be connected by much more than an individual. A large successful company always looks more likely to succeed in spite of an owner, or CEO (Twitter), than it is to be helped in any way that isn't hollow, or related to perceptions. The stock market is seemingly ruled in large part by perception, and the directive is already built in, which is to make more money and cut costs. The CEO would be the friendly face that they know, and who makes the investors feel better. Someone who will pull the trigger on those nasty directives, and look good doing it, but not much more. If that's most of it, how does the position deserve 400 percent more than anybody?

I feel like the only reason this absurdity thrives, is the stock market. A market which is largely incoherent, needing regulation, and way too big to fail. The modern CEO seems to be the clown steward of our system's broken promises, and a vestige of our monotheistic worldview, but not some special genius.

I would love to know of any reason that a CEOs vast inequality makes sense, outside of a greedy/emotional stock market, and the directive for infinite growth that apparently needs a friendly/confident face to execute it. They really do seem to me to just be a bad person, that can market themselves as a good person, and push some dark directives, while only concerning themselves with initiatives that support those directives. It would be nice not to feel that shitty about all of it.

Another example that was used in the other thread was Messi, the soccer player, getting paid much more than others. But Messi represents labor and the object of consumption, not administration, so that doesn't work."

1,2023-10-12,CMV: The NCAA and Penn State University really screwed Joe Paterno over badly.,u/Michael-Larson-1984,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176d9ha/cmv_the_ncaa_and_penn_state_university_really/,changemyview,"Let's look at facts:

* Jerry Sandusky retired as Joe Paterno's assistant in 1999, but stayed on campus because of his Emeritus status as well as him running his Second Mile charity until his retirement from that in 2010.
* Joe Paterno knew about the abuse of children as early as 2002, and he did report it to the university, but did not follow up his university report with a police report. 
* For that reason, Joe Paterno was fired, instead of letting him finish out the last few games of his final season. 
* Technically, he did everything within his legal obligation, but not going to the police himself fell short of his moral obligation. 
* Question then becomes, if someone with as much starpower as Joe Paterno files a report with the university about something so heinous, then WHY didn't the UNIVERSITY file a report?
* It's not like Joe Paterno did the abuse himself, he did what he felt was his obligation. Any Italian-American who grew up in Brooklyn in the 1930's and 1940's is going to have a pre-conditioned aversion to going to the police. I am aware that this is not 1930's mob-heavy Brooklyn, this is comfy cozy middle of Pennsylvania, but it's not like JoePa did absolutely nothing about it. HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS HIS DUTY.
* For the NCAA and Penn State to erase wins from 1998-2011 from the history books (though this was later reversed) and remove JoePa's statue and act like he was never nothing to the university was just wrong.
* He may have had cancer, but let's be honest, he died of a broken heart."

Now this goes back to Andrew tate. He has a reputation for teaching men dating advice and how to get rich, at the beginning I thought the same thing as everyone else. He is a crazy guy who lies to men for money. But I’ve realized every guy that gets laid is just like Andrew Tate and supports him. I have a friend who has sex with lots of women, consensual sex, he doesn’t force them or anything, yet he is exactly like Andrew Tate, some women are aware he likes Andrew Tate and still sleep with him, some of this women are feminists. I’ve asked them why they sleep with him and they tell me they just find him to be very arousing. 

That doesn’t happen to liberal men. All the liberal men I know are either single or monogamous relationships with average women. It’s true that Andrew Tate is truly an alpha male, and in order to attract women and be a successful ladies man you have to be like him, Andrew Tate in a nutshell is the bad boy girls love but men hate that’s why he is so controversial and dozens of people are trying to put him in prison, he probably fucked some Romanian politicians wife and that’s why they want to lock him up or something like that. What I’m trying to say is if you’re a virgin or have problems attracting women, listen to Andrew tate advice, and women will flock towards you."

To say that they’re the same is a false dichotomy. 

It is perfectly rational to be wary of men.  Especially now when women are suspected of being interested in so-called false accusations against the class of men. 

Moreover, for those who say that it’s the same as being “afraid of [fill in the blank] people” - I’d say: this subset of people are not the ruling class.  If anything, being afraid of men is more akin to being afraid of Cops, who are ostensibly there to protect civilians but instead  a “few bad apples” and the structure of the criminal justice system protects criminal cops when they behave badly.  Also there are cops who are unconscious or ignorant about why folks might be wary around them or scared of them. 

Moreover, misandry arises in response to misogyny, rarely if ever the reverse."

Matt Walsh made a video with basically the same sentiment. I do not want that video to get advertising revenue, so I will provide a link, not to the video by Matt Walsh that I am talking about, but to a reddit post critiquing the video I am talking about ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/16969b5/matt\_walsh\_wants\_people\_to\_have\_children\_weather/ ). 

Let’s go over some of the most commonly used arguments by those who say that it is your moral duty to reproduce, and pick apart these arguments. Some of these were actual arguments made by Matt Walsh, Classically Abby and Ben Shapiro. Some of these are arguments made by people in the comments section of those videos.

Argument #1: What if you regret not having children?

It is true that there exist people who regret not having children. However, there also exist people who regret having children. If you ask me, I would argue that it is better to regret not having kids than regret having them. If you regret not having kids, only you suffer. If you regret having children, more than one person suffers. 

Argument #2: People are not having enough babies. 

People are having more than enough babies. Even though the birth rate is lower than it was decades ago, people are still reproducing faster than they are dying ( https://www.worldometers.info/ ). 

If anything, people are having too many children. Current projections predict a world population of over 9 billion by 2050 and 11 billion by 2100 ( https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html ). Harvard sociobiologist Edward Wilson believes that the maximum carrying capacity of the earth is 9 billion to 10 billion ( https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html ). 

It is probably better if not everyone, who can reproduce, does so. If every single person, who is capable of having babies, did so, overpopulation would occur. On the other hand, if we were to enact the policy that existed in China at one point, where you were only allowed one birth per household, that would result in underpopulation. If the right to marry and start a family is still a protected right, but fewer people choose to exercise it, that is the most effective way to ensure that the world population remains neither overpopulated nor underpopulated. 

Argument #3: It is selfish not to have children. 

Selfishness, by its literal definition, means that you are concerned exclusively with your own needs and not with anyone else’s ( https://www.google.com/search?q=selfish+meaning&rlz=1C5CHFA\_enUS959US960&oq=selfish+meaning&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.2129j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 ). 

That definition implies that you are prioritising your own needs over those of someone else who has an equal or greater stake in the situation. If you were the only person who had a stake in the situation, then it goes without saying that you would be concerned exclusively with your own needs as there are no needs (other than your own) to take into account. 

By choosing not to have children, toward whom are you being selfish? It cannot be the children you did not have. They will not care if you don’t have them, because they don’t exist. 

Argument #4: If you are thankful to be alive, why wouldn’t you want to give that gift to someone else? 

Just because you are grateful to have something and you are capable of giving that thing, or the equivalent of it, to someone else, that does not make it your responsibility to give that gift to someone else. 

The best analogy I can think of to demonstrate my point in a really simple way is this. 

I am thankful for the farmers who cultivated and harvested the food I consume. That does not mean that I have a responsibility to become a farmer.   

Argument #5: The child you never had could have grown up to cure cancer. 

Two things. 

I could have nine children and the odds that any of them would grow up to make some great scientific breakthrough are slim. 

While the child I never had could have grown up to cure cancer, that child also could have grown up to be a serial killer. 

Argument #6: What if your parents had chosen not to reproduce? 

If my parents had chosen not to have me, I wouldn’t care. I couldn’t care, because I wouldn’t exist. 

Argument #7: What if Einstein's parents had not had children?

What if Hitler’s parents had not had children? 

Argument #8: You won't have anyone to take care of you in your old age. 

I will check into an assisted living facility. 

Argument #9: If you have no children, you no longer have a stake in the future of society, the world stops turning the moment you die. 

First of all, even if you have children, you are still gone from the world when you die. Your consciousness does not teleport to your children. Second, you do not need to have biological children to care what happens in the world following your death. You might have other family members (nieces, nephews, cousins, siblings, etc.) who carry on your legacy. 

Argument #10: America is not having enough children to support our giant welfare state. 

If there is a shortage of skilled workers, there is a simple solution, merit based immigration. While countries like Japan are becoming underpopulated ( https://www.google.com/search?q=japan+is+becoming+under+populated&rlz=1C5CHFA\_enUS959US960&oq=japan+is+becoming+under+populated&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.7271j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 ), countries like India are becoming over populated ( https://www.google.com/search?q=india+is+having+way+too+many+babies&sca\_esv=562586488&rlz=1C5CHFA\_enUS959US960&sxsrf=AB5stBh4C6p7nweN23v66tnv8IKjB9OMJQ%3A1693852510546&ei=XiP2ZJjyIN2fptQPlYmuyAQ&oq=India+is+&gs\_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCUluZGlhIGlzICoCCAAyBBAjGCcyCxAuGIMBGLEDGIAEMgQQABgDMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBxAAGIoFGEMyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAESNwbUABY2hBwAXgBkAEAmAF1oAG0B6oBAzMuNrgBAcgBAPgBAagCFMICBxAjGOoCGCfCAhYQABgDGI8BGOoCGLQCGIwDGOUC2AEBwgIWEC4YAxiPARjqAhi0AhiMAxjlAtgBAcICCBAAGIoFGJECwgIOEAAYigUYsQMYgwEYkQLCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICCxAuGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIREC4YgAQYsQMYgwEYxwEY0QPCAgcQIxiKBRgnwgIHEC4YigUYQ8ICDRAuGIoFGLEDGIMBGEPCAhAQLhiKBRixAxjHARjRAxhDwgIOEC4YigUYsQMYgwEYkQLCAggQABiABBixA-IDBBgAIEGIBgG6BgYIARABGAs&sclient=gws-wiz-serp ). Therefore, let’s make it easier for people living in over populated countries to travel to under populated countries. 

Argument #11: Only if you have had children before can you say if happiness increases upon becoming a parent. 

If you are a parent, you can tell for certain if having kids increases your happiness, but you do not know what it is or would be like for other people. 

Argument #12: Those who claim to be happy with their child free lifestyle are doing so, because they have lied to themselves. 

I think it is very arrogant to claim to know what is going on in someone else’s head better than the someone else who owns the head. 

It might be the case that parents are also lying to themselves, claiming to be happy when they are not.

Argument #13: God wants you to have babies. 

I do not believe in God. Even if God is real, how can you possibly claim to know what God wants me to do? Does it say so in the Bible? If so, how do you know that the Bible is the infallible word of God? 

Argument #14: Having children is what you are biologically programmed to do, so you have a responsibility to do so. 

Just because you are biologically predisposed to certain behaviours, that does not mean that there is any objective reason why you need to engage in those behaviours. "
1,2023-10-12,CMV: Having red flags is not the end of the world.,u/DayOk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176emg0/cmv_having_red_flags_is_not_the_end_of_the_world/,changemyview,"Okay, so what is a red flag? A red flag is a deal breaker that can be applied to average people. For example, when someone has anger issues, it would mean that you should neither date them nor be friends with them. It's not just a preference or incompatibility. It's an issue that can end badly when starting a relationship or a friendship.

Back to my view. I think that having red flags isn't the end of the world. Why? Because red flags could be applied differently. For example, if you are love bombing, then you shouldn't date or have friends, but you can still communicate with your work partners. If you are physically aggressive, then you can't be in physical contact with people, but you can still communicate online because you are not aggressive when you are talking online. Having red flags doesn't mean that you are hopeless. It just means that it's not suitable to do certain things if you have some red flags in you."

1,2023-10-12,"CMV: Capitalism is the only reason films like Martin Scorsese's $200 million ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" exist",u/Latter-Mention-5881,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176exi6/cmv_capitalism_is_the_only_reason_films_like/,changemyview,"Let me first begin by saying, I don't think Capitalism is perfect, or even great, and I don't love the trend of 5+ superhero films a year from 2-3 studios.

That said... 

Films (And television shows) are a unique form of art in which a single person's vision can be realized by hundreds of people to create a viewing experience for the masses. But that also means, if the masses reject the vision, those who spent money on making it come to life just... lose their money. I mean, what other economic system would allow so few people to have such power over a whole production for so much money, knowing it may or may not be successful? As another example, look at Ari Aster's Beau is Afraid. This was the director's pet project but lost $35 million. It has a small audience of folks who love it, but not enough of one to warrant how much was spent on it.

Capitalism is the only reason pet projects such as Scorsese's or Aster's can be made. Sure, they may lose money in theaters or overall, but there's a possibility they won't. And, in any other economic system, the idea that one person would have so much power and get so much money for a singular piece of art wouldn't fly."
1,2023-10-12,"CMV: Hamas, and their supporters, are not like us.",u/Emperor-Kahfonso,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176ezx8/cmv_hamas_and_their_supporters_are_not_like_us/,changemyview,"The Nazis industrialized murder. They gave their victims numbers, established an immense network of infrastructure, including camps, subcamps, industrial facilities and rail lines to aid in their genocide, and extracted as much financial gain as they possibly could from the Jews they murdered - from working them to death to melting down wedding rings for their gold. They made it efficient and completely impersonal and inhuman. 

&#x200B;

They did this not only due to the need to kill as many Jews as possible as quickly as possible, but also because there were 'worrying' reports from the frontlines. The soldiers found shooting innocent Jewish civilians 'distressing', and it negatively impacted troop morale. When the Nazis started losing, and the concentration camps looked to be soon to be liberated, they systematically tried to destroy as much evidence as possible. When it came to the trials, they invariably either plead a lack of knowledge, or claimed they were simply following orders. Even Eichmann, who ordered the murder of 400,000 Jews in Hungary in the last days of the war, never tried to justify or even explain himself. He simply said that he should not be held liable, because he was just following orders, and that ""There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders"".

&#x200B;

What I mean to say is that, under all of the hatred, evil, cowardice, propaganda and fear, there was a shred of humanity in at least *some* of the Nazis, especially in the rank-and-file. They felt distressed when they killed innocent civilians, they tried to hide the evidence of their crimes, and they tried to deflect blame. It's why Holocaust Denial is so popular. If someone *actually* thinks the Holocaust was a good thing - why would they deny it? They had some shred of morality that told them 'this is wrong' - they simply chose to ignore it. But, crucially, they didn't try to justify or glorify their actions - they lied and said they never happened. They, for all intents and purposes, admitted that what they did was wrong and immoral and worthy of disgust, even if they never did show remorse.

&#x200B;

Hamas is different. They've done much the same thing - shot families in their cars as they tried to escape from the Re'im music festival massacre, and engaged in massacres of entire kibbutz, unseen since the massacres of the shtetls, the ghettoes and the pogroms. They've captured scores of innocents as hostages, and killed hundreds more. And then they post videos online of throwing grenades into shelters where families are hiding in fear, of burning houses to the ground to force civilians to flee into the line of fire, of women, beaten to death, stripped naked and probably raped, being paraded through Gaza to jubilant crowds, women and children spitting on their corpses. They chant 'gas the Jews' in front of the Opera House in Sydney, and they call it 'decolonization' from the safety of their twitter feeds.

&#x200B;

These are people that do not have a basic sense of morality. These are people that are not like us, that do not have the same values and goals as we do. If your culture or ethical system call for the murder of civilians, it is inferior, and it is wrong, and it is immoral. There is no justification whatsoever possible for an action of this magnitude of evil. If *anything* *anyone* does to you can convince you that burning an innocent family alive in their home is justified, you are a horrible person, and I will pray for your soul. 

&#x200B;

It is not only counterproductive, but deeply insulting to the victims of these horrible crimes, to treat those that committed them or support them as normal humans, with the same goals, morality and desires as you and me. There is no context, there is no argument, there is no excuse that can make this justified. There is no moral equivalence, and if you say there is, you are the problem."

My view that I will soon describe is not new, but has gotten a new light due to recent events.  
  
In my view, when one acts in a violent way to achieve an ideological goal, we should condemn the violent act and no more. We should suspend any discussions on the topic until some time has passed.  
  
A ""soft"" example of this are small-scale protests that block roads. Those are wrong in my view. We need to find other non-violent means to raise awareness.  
  
A ""harsh"" example is the recent terror attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians. The butchering, beheading, burning, raping and kidnapping of kids, elderly, women and men.  
  
\[Side note\] It pains me to see people call Hamas ""resistance members"" or ""freedom fighters"". Or BBC calling them ""militants"" and ""combatants"".  We should call them for what they are - terrorists. Terrorists who act on behalf of nobody, and out of pure evil.  
  
It's important to note that I greatly sympathize with the suffering of the Palestinian people. Yet, even if I ""suspend my disbelief"" and buy into the claim that Hamas is acting on behalf of the their cause, it's not the time. It's not the time to advocate for them, nor is it the time to explain or discuss their situation.  
  
The reason is that if we do that, we are giving reason for more to behave in the same way. If we discuss these topics now, we show people that violence is legitimate. That brutal and inhuman violence is a mean to achieve goals."

They are the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the American Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War. I think that the United States will not enter another major war for a long time is that, starting with the Vietnam War, the major wars have gotten a lot more unpopular with the public. The Vietnam War and the Iraq War were both unpopular, and while the War in Afghanistan was popular at first, near the end it lost popularity. The Gulf War wasn't unpopular, but I think had it dragged on like the other wars, it would have become unpopular as well. So, in short, I don't think the United States will be in any major wars for decades, is due to the fact that most of the recent major wars the United States have fought have been unpopular."

Personally I think this is completely justified. 

There is no universally or broadly agreed upon definition of ""terrorism"". The only common denominator is violence, usually associated with non-state actors, but not always. It's also associated with civilian as opposed to military targets, but again, not always.

Reddit cheered when Ukrainian saboteurs killed the daughter of a Russian politician with a car bomb. Did she vocally support the war? Sure, but so do many ordinary Russians. Either way she was neither a combatant nor a politician. And I saw plenty of calls to ""bomb Russia"" and plenty of racism and hatred towards Russians when the war broke out in more hawkish spaces, it doesn't take a genius to put the two and two together.......

What about the attack on the Pentagon during 9/11? Sure, many of the people working inside were civilians, but if there was ever a ""military target"", the literal headquarters of the US military would be it.

Why don't we rewind 80 years to WW2? The Allied powers carried out indiscriminate strategic bombings of German and Japanese cities throughout the war, killing hundreds of thousand of civilians. A single firebombing raid on Tokyo, Operation Meetinghouse, caused a massive firestorm and killed [100 000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo_(10_March_1945)). And of course there were the nuclear bombs. A majority of Americans in 2015 said that those were [justified](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/08/04/70-years-after-hiroshima-opinions-have-shifted-on-use-of-atomic-bomb/). ""Terrorizing"" the population and destroying their will to fight was an explicit goal of these attacks. Was that also ""terrorism""?

It seems clear to me that the term is more of a condemnation than anything, and is not a useful when it comes to discussing ideologies and morality of non-state militant groups."

For years. Because they're related by blood and engaging in a sexual relationship, is legally and morally bewildering to me.  
  
I don't think the government should have any right to interfere in the private lives of consenting adults, and I feel that there are only two reasons that same-generation incest is criminalised.  
  
A: Because of the possibility of producing genetically deficient offspring. Which, when you consider that a Brother and Sister having a child is about as dangerous as a woman over 30 having a child, is a very vague and unsatisfactory reason. However if we were to take this answer, then why is it still legal for two individuals who both carry genetic issues to be in a sexual relationship, marry, and have children with one another, despite the risks it carries to offspring? If the government interfered and threw them in prison for being together, it would rightly be called eugenics, and evil.  
  
B: Because of the natural human kneejerk reaction to closely-related incest which has been evolved over millennia to try and prevent multi-generational inbreeding in small tribes. This is purely a kneejerk emotional reaction and things should not be outlawed and prohibited merely because a majority of the population find it icky. Morality and Legality are not one and the same.  
  
To make it clear, I'm not supporting multi-generational incest, because that is a clear ground for grooming and abuse, but single-generational. I.E. Brother and Brother, Sister and Sister, Brother and Sister, close in age. If a large age gap exists which causes grounds for grooming and abuse that can be addressed the same way as with non-related individuals.  
  
If you disagree, I'd be interested to hear your reasons why, and to ask that: If you were a judge, and you had two adult people in front of you who had done nobody harm, close in age, in a loving consensual relationship, would you feel comfortable sending them to prison? Do you think they should go to prison for hurting nobody? Or, do you think they should be fined or, as I propose, being charged with a decriminalised offence and allowed to live their lives in peace?"
1,2023-10-12,CMV: A newspaper recently told my story and people say its odd.,u/cognitive_Hazard401,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176ioi1/cmv_a_newspaper_recently_told_my_story_and_people/,changemyview,"Hi guys I recently did a interview with my
Local small town paper as i a new GM moving to town to run the local arbys and i think it turned out well but alot of my new friends in town seem to think differently can you guys help me see it from their eyes? Here is the column written:



In the bustling world of Arby's, a beacon of excellence radiates from one particular general manager new to our town - a certain 39-year-old maverick who's not only running the show but redefining it entirely. Meet the game-changer, the trendsetter, the maestro of fast-food management, fondly known as ""The Roast Beef Baron.""

Born and raised with the age-old values of hard work, dedication, and resilience, our hero is a firm believer in earning one's stripes. The path hasn't been easy, but it's been worth every step. A veteran in the food industry with two decades of experience under his belt, he’s seen it all, done it all, and continues to strive for perfection.

Being a general manager, he leads by example, setting the bar high for performance and commitment. His mantra? ""Excellence is not an act but a habit."" Millennials, with their avant-garde ideas, incessant need for validation, and, quite frankly, occasional lack of work ethic, have often found themselves in hot water under his watchful eye. 

But don't mistake his firm hand for a lack of empathy. He's seen the struggle. He understands the fight. He's been there. And while he might hold the staff's feet to the proverbial fire, he also knows how to reward the spark of effort when he sees it. A discreet pat on the back, a kind word of encouragement, or even a crisp $10 gift card can go a long way in boosting morale and fostering loyalty.

Not one to be out of touch with today's generation, he goes the extra mile to understand their lingo, their culture, their beat. ""Savage,"" ""lit,"" ""on fleek"" - you name it, he's got it in his colorful word arsenal. 

This understanding, coupled with his unyielding demand for hard work, has created an environment of respect and camaraderie among staff. They might not always see eye to eye, but the team knows that their GM has got their back, even if it means a stern lecture or two along the way.

With a keen eye for detail, a sharp mind for business, and a big heart for his team, our 39-year-old Arby's General Manager has managed to create a fine balance between running a successful fast-food chain and maintaining a warm, familial work culture. Despite the challenges and the hard times, he's a testament to the fact that success is not always about the raises you give, but the values you uphold and the respect you earn. And in that, hes become a inspiration for others in our small community within the past few weeks of being here."

However, this doesn’t apply to your family. If you’re a superhero and you’re worried about your family’s safety because of any villains who might try to attack them, it seems to me, the best thing you could do for them is tell them you’re a superhero, so that they’ll be prepared to defend themselves."
1,2023-10-12,CMV: Breaking Bad is Mediocre At Best!,u/Opposite_Bag_3913,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176jxxf/cmv_breaking_bad_is_mediocre_at_best/,changemyview," I recently finished my binge-watch of the series, and I wanted to share everything I didn't like about the show. Warning: This post contains spoilers, so proceed at your own risk if you haven't seen it yet.  
   
1. Coincidence and Plot Holes: I couldn't help but notice that the show occasionally relies on coincidences, which can feel unrealistic. There are some plot holes, and the occurrence of certain events seemed a bit too convenient. for example the plane crash, like how convenient is it that the person that navigates planes is the father of the girl that overdosed after meeting walt's partner jesse. And i liked that there's always a guy for everything, you want someone to go to jail for 20 years for you? sure i got someone! you want someone to kill 9 people in different jails? sure i got someone! you want someone to make you disappear? sure i got someone!  
2.  Cartoonish Cousins: While the Cousins were supposed to be menacing, I think that their characters came across as somewhat over-the-top and less realistic, like come on, they almost never speak and are just cold blooded killers who are just so angry about tuco, What a joke.  
3.  Questionable Episodes: The episodes like the one where the engine dies in the middle of nowhere and the infamous ""Fly"" episode felt like filler and were less engaging. Also, some people might read too much into them. (like stop overanalyzing sh\*t)  
4.  Character Motivations: There were moments where characters seemed to act out of character, like when Walt kills Mike. The scene felt a bit sloppy, and Walt's realization afterward was a bit frustrating, right after shooting mike for not giving him the names of his guys , he remembers that he can get the names from lydia instead! That's just dumb and seems to be a cheap way to add a shock element (cause everyone liked mike and no one had seen it coming).  
5.  Jesse's Revelation: I had trouble understanding how Jesse pieced together Walt's poisoning of Brock, given his character's usual naivety. It felt like a bit of a stretch, based on minimal clues. (Just because Sault took weed from his pack of cigarette he figured out that walt poisoned brock? and even if he did it doesnt explain the things he had done afterwards).  
6.  Marie's Character Development: Marie's sudden extreme hatred for Walt did feel somewhat abrupt, The guy helped her husband walk again and paid for everything and she was okay with it as long as it's gambling money, but when it turns out that he's a drug dealer she suddenly LOATHES him and says that she will be never be happy unless he's jailed or dead? where did this come from, i understand feeling some kind of hatred or betrayal but to that extent.  
7.  Dialogue: I think that the dialogue between Jesse, Badger, and Skinny Pete (and other people) sometimes felt like it was written by old people who think that's how drug people talk and it felt so goofy at times.  
8.  Skyler's Reaction: Skyler's shock at Walt's actions and the inconsistency in her stance regarding violence for safety were  a bit puzzling. She insinuates that walt should kill jesse as a  prophylactic move but is then shocked when walt couldn't save hank and kept calling him a killer, even in the final scenes when he goes to talk to her, she tells him ""did you kill anyone on your way here"" like stfu B.  
9. Random Killings: What's up with the random killings , tuco kills his buddy for no reason, gus kills victor for no reason, walt kills mike for no reason, and all these killings are passed off as ""Sending a message"", ridiculous.  
10.  Methamphetamine Rarity: It's worth mentioning the odd portrayal of the methamphetamine's rarity towards the end of the series, especially considering how easily it was  stolen earlier in the show.   
11.  Walt's Oversight: It's funny to note that Walt, who is known for his attention to detail, makes a notable oversight when he leaves his Walt Whitman book where people are meant to grab things to read. \*Face Palm\*.  
12.  Gus's 6th sense: The very strange moment when Walt planted explosives in Gus's car and Gus, while going to his car, suddenly stopped and turned around for no apparent reason. Did he go back to his house on foot?   
13.  The Final Scene: A fully automated weapon that pops out of the trunk and shoots everyone so accurately before any of them could react ? really ? is this the final scene of the show ? i had the last episode playing on 1.5x.

  
And a ton more that i won't mention in this post!  When I first dove into ""Breaking Bad,"" I was buzzing with excitement. With the show often touted as one of the greatest ever, my expectations soared sky-high, but unfortunately it was mediocre at best, in my opinion at least. P.S Skyler is EFFIN Unbearable.

Will my child be genetically predisposed to having bad vision? I’ll be gene editing and removing those genes. Will my child be genetically predisposed to having a bigger chance of having certain mental issues? Just edit his genes and remove that chance. Will my child just simply be born “ugly”? You guessed it, gene edit him into being born with conventionally attractive features.

None of this should be illegal. Yeah sure you should love your child however he/she comes out, and I would love them no matter what, but the possibility of giving the unborn child an easier life and removing all the “bad” genes should 100% be ethically okay to do.

BIPOC is racist because it is so fucking exclusionary despite being praised as an ""inclusive"" term. It stands for ""Black and Indigenous People of Color"" and in my opinion as an Asian man the term was devised specifically to exclude Asian, Middle eastern, and many Latino communities. Its unprecedented use is baffling. Why not use POC and encompass all non-white individuals? It is essentially telling Asian people, Middle Eastern people, and Latino people that we don't matter as much in discussions anymore and we're not as oppressed as black and indigenous people, invalidating our experiences. It's complete crap.

White Adjacent is perhaps even more racist (I've been called this word in discussions with black and white peers surrounding social justice). It refers to any group of people that are not white and are not black, which applies to the aforementioned Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latino communities. It is very much exclusionary and is used by racist people to exclude us and our experiences from conversations surrounding social justice, claiming ""we're too white"" to experience TRUE oppression, and accuses us of benefitting off of white supremacy simply because our communities do relatively well in the American system, despite the fact we had to work like hell to get there. Fucking ridiculous. 

Their use demonstrates the left's lack of sympathy towards our struggles, treats us like invisible minorities, and invalidates our experiences. If you truly care about social justice topics, stop using these words."

A very common critique I hear of centrists/centrism is that it is a cowardly position to hold. Trying to play both sides, non committal, or lacking real beliefs. 

I find the opposite to be true. People who sit somewhere ""in the middle"" tend to take heat from both sides, often just as hard. Someone like Sam Harris, for example, has extreme critics and haters in the form of the ""MAGA"" crowd"" as well as the ""Social Justice"" crowd. They tend to get taken out of context a lot, and it becomes a kind of joke to make fun of people who are harsh critics of ""both sides."" It's not because he has weak principles, it's in my view the exact opposite. He has strong principles and views, strong enough that he doesn't feel a sense of loyalty to a side, only to what he sees is ""right."" I'm not trying to put Sam on a pedestal, he has his flaws, but there is no doubt that he has extremely well thought through positions and that he is a good faith actor. I use him more as someone I think fits the ""center"" label pretty well, and gets the heat from both sides more than most.   

I'm a person who has floated all over the political spectrum in my early childhood years, adolescence, and now young adulthood. No doubt my views will continue to change. What I've absolutely noticed however, is that...hardliners are usually blinded in some way, and in my opinion their ideology prevents them from acknowledging reality. 

I have strong moral principles, but I don't have strong policy positions, and I don't have strong ideological beliefs. I think you should look at the evidence and do what works and as best as you can try to keep ideology out of it. 

The reason for this is because In my experience, people are...different. Quite literally. You have to have a sort of blindness to not see that people are different. Some people like harsh truths, others comforting lies. Some people actually like ""tough love."" Others would instantly roll their eyes and tune you out. Some people are sprinters, other people are marathon runners. Tall, short, fat, skinny, ugly, beautiful, put together, slovenly...the idea that the world can fit into a neat little dogma is...demonstrably false with all the seemingly infinite variety and complexity. I mean, if you take evolution to be true, and you even consider the ramifications of evolution for even a second, it becomes obvious how diverse and enigmatic life is and can be. The sheer existance of a political right and a political left should be evidence of how dramatically different and divided humans are in terms of how they conceive the world. The sheer scale of the difference should suggest that ""shit is complicated.""

It's because of this variety and complexity that I find dogma itself repugnant in a way.  ""Human nature is good"" or ""human nature is selfish.""  These maxims are seemingly...wrong. People are evidentially...both. Everything really is deeply complicated, nuanced, grey, etc. Is this deep? I mean, yes and no. Of course a lot of people will make fun of this take, but...I can't see how it isn't evidently true.

It's much less active than other parts of the chicken, which results in a lot less flavor. Paradoxically, it's also less tender and drier because it has less fat . Even if you cook it meticulously it will never be as soft or juicy as a chicken thigh or drumstick. It's literally the worst of both worlds. 

The SOLE redeeming quality, in my opinion, is its consistent shape and large size which makes it suitable for stuffed or cutlet style dishes that are breaded and fried. Chicken parm and chicken kiev are quite tasty, the breading keeps it fairly juicy. But that's just a few types of breaded and fried dishes, and there's an italian saying that ""even a shoe tastes good when its fried"". The average grilled/pan fried/shredded chicken breast  that most people eat is just sad and nasty. "

Israel is the inventor of modern terrorism, the Zionist movement throws bombs on buses,bomb the hotel. And after that, the Palestinians were massacred without restraint. an entire village was massacred, women raped, villagers chased with flamethrowers.

Later, the Israelis realized that doing so would damage their international image a little bit, so the smart Israelis adjusted their way of doing things. Now they are squeezing the living space of Palestinians little by little, street by street, in Gaza. Build high walls, barbed wire fences, and sentry towers, confining three million people in less than 400 square kilometers, completely controlling their water sources (sealing wells with cement), electricity, and food. Only a handful of ""good boy"" Palestinians are allowed to enter Israeli-controlled areas to work every day. Palestinians are not allowed to fish beyond 5 kilometers of the coastline. Anyone found crossing the border will be killed.

At this point, the world's largest prison was born, and the smart Israelis realized that killing a hundred people in one day would be accused of mass murder (even then, of course, the international community would support them). But killing just one person a day for a hundred days is just a ""regrettable conflict."" 

The Israelites were also very ""kind"" and left some secret tunnels leading to Egypt. Then whenever Palestinian counterattacks occurred, they bombed the open-air prison, even using white phosphorus bombs. The main combat targets are schools, hospitals, and residential buildings. Because all of Israel's goals serve one thing: to rid this land of Palestinians, whether by killing them all or forcing them all to leave.

Israel has also very wisely controlled the powerful power of public opinion. In Europe and the United States, once someone supports Palestine, it will usually attract sanctions from the entire society. For example, college students will be collectively refused employment by companies, and talk comedians will be imprisoned for making jokes about Jews. Prison (while making jokes about Muslims is considered a sign of free speech). Legislate to investigate and deal with any ""anti-Semitic"" remarks, Therefore, whenever Palestinians make violent resistance, the media will focus on them and accuse them. But when Israelis do similar things, there is no massive criticism.

To this day, Israel is still a place with extremely serious racial discrimination. Asians who come to work in Israel have to sign an agreement ""not to have relations with local women."" This is simply a reappearance of the American Chinese Exclusion Act. There were a large number of Nazis in the cabinet, high-ranking officials who openly advocated the annihilation of the Palestinians and acted in the name of the state. For example , the Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir，israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich，Bezalel Smotrich once stated in a speech in Parliament that：“it's a mistake that Ben-Gurion didn't finish the job and didn't throw you out in 1948.” 

So what is “job” and how do people around the world understand it? Yes, that's what it means.

So in this case, why do the Israelis feel that they are worthy of a gentle, non-threatening, and at the mercy of others as an opponent? Like Gandhi? Do the Israelis bomb Palestinians and expect their relatives not to join Hamas? Whatever you do to others, don't think that similar things won't happen to you.

So peaceful protests must be useless? Yes, it must be useless. The United Nations can be considered a relatively peaceful and moderate coordination organization, right? Once Israel's occupation goes too far, the United Nations will occasionally hold meetings to condemn Israel, but as long as the resolution is sent to the Security Council, the United States will veto it with one vote. The United States has bravely used its one-vote veto power 86 times (if I remember correctly), of which 50 Many times it was a veto of resolutions involving Israel. Therefore, peaceful struggle is simply impossible, because the United States will do everything possible to help Israel. Israelis deserve to fight only opponents like Hamas."

Let's start off with the obvious. They don't look white. They're not culturally white. Ain't nobody saying Osama Bin Laden (bad example), or my Jordanian friend or Iranian friend (who are both quite brown and have a large nose and very thick eyebrows) looks white. Don't be ridiculous. They are treated very distinctly from white people and often discriminated against, in both casual microaggressions and flat out hate crimes.

Additionally, while I generally hate racial categorization, they provide good statistics on how a community compares to average in various subjects, which is especially beneficial in medical fields. For example, Middle Eastern and North African people have a much higher risk than white people (and Asian people) at developing lung cancers because they often live in environmentally polluted environments. This statistic is largely invisible because of their white classification. If they were admitted as a separate race officially, then this problem would be better addressed.

Another interesting point to be brought up is potentially putting South Asian people in this group with Middle Eastern and North African people as they face many of the same issues as the community, but I'd have to hear input from both sides before claiming this opinion as good."

1: lack of freedom - i am a guy who likes to move around from a city to another, basically i can be working in a firm in helsinki 1 week & next thing you know, i might be in a small town in UK freelancing. this kind of unplanned way of living on edge is my jam and i believe not everyone is a big fan of this kind of living on edge scenario

2: having a family which depends on me or even if they are independent, i still bear the responsibility to come back to home on time, to have a family time, you know to be a good family man, take them out on family outing etc.. but i dunno if i can live upto that, i may be stealing my family members of the good times of their life by not being there for them enough.

3: having child, responsibilties associated with it, financial needs & fears of raising them with proper care without messing their childhood is a no go for me. the thought of being a father to a child and bearing the responsibility just scares me shitless ngl. don't get me wrong, i like taking responsibilty for my work & many other personal things, i love doing it, but being responsible for a another human & how they turn out to be just scares me because i fear i might mess them up.

4: things like holidays, expensive gifts, expensive romantic dates scare me too. i like going on dates, but i like to keep a very minimal expense, for me date can go as low as taking a stroll in a park while eating shawarma, but i sense that it might not be so romantic (again it's my fault that i might be not too romantic or something, not blaming people for having higher expectations on dates). but see this is me, that's why i think it might not be for me

5: saving up monies - i have grown up in a upper mid income family with luxuries most people do not get in my country (India). but my father made sure that it never came at the expense of spending away the money like anything. for me, saving money is utmost important thing, a firm believer in drops form ocean. even if it just couple of cents, if i know i can save, it will be saved. i do not stress, but it has become the way of life for me. for eg : i catch a train @ 3am in the morning to an airport which is 100 miles away from home just so that i can catch a flight which is 70% cheaper than any other flight. how many people will be ready to put up with this? even my mom refuses to do this, but i can't. if i knew i had this option, it would become impossible for me to consider any other option, period. this might create a lot of divide in opinions in my married life.

this fueled by the fact that i had a girlfriend who used to spend her daddy money like crazy. when i asked her about it, she used to say ""we have only one life, what use if we do not spend the money which we make?"". this sounded super scary to me as i have a relative in our family, who are in their 70's now, they used to be like her and spend away any money they made, now they are broke af, legit. their brother pays for their utility bills.

so these are the things that deter me from getting married, CMV

tldr : i think marriage if for those who have a planned long term stable jobs with a good family values & willing to spend away money."
1,2023-10-13,CMV: An unregulated market goes against nature,u/Croatwink,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176tljo/cmv_an_unregulated_market_goes_against_nature/,changemyview,"Context; This is referring to a ""free market"" as made popular by the United States. The view is that a market without government regulation goes against the very nature of evolution and human psychology. In the sense that evolution is nature throwing dice and trying combinations until one works better than the others, and human psychology is a product of that.

The nature of evolution means that there will never be an equilibrium, there will never be a homogenous population with one mind and one goal. Therefore a market can never ""regulate itself"" as people say, because there will always be outliers.

In the context of a free market that means there will always be some who strive to exploit vulnerabilities in the system to get ahead of others. And all it takes is a few to do this, for others to follow suit because they don't want to be left behind.

So there is no way a free market can work, the only reason it exists is because people with power feel more comfortable wielding their power freely without government regulation."
1,2023-10-13,CMV: Liberal/left wing Israelis should accept responsibility for Palestinians condition.,u/invertedBoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176v05g/cmv_liberalleft_wing_israelis_should_accept/,changemyview,"Some common narratives I see coming out from the Israel Gaza situation are the following:

\- Palestinians in Gaza are innocent victim that are suffering the consequences of Hamas rampage, however they don't rebel against Hamas, they voted them in power 20 years ago and opinion polls (apparently) show that the majority of people still support them. So, in a way, they are partly responsible for what is happening to them.

\- Israel is far from perfect. They have had a series of right wing governments that have been very hostile to the Palestinians rights, however it should be noted that not all Israelis support those governments. Netanyahu is despised by a lot of Israelis and lots of Israelis are sympathetic to the Palestinians plight. Killing Israelis indiscriminately is particularly hideous for that reason, for instance lots of the victims were butchered while participating in a peace music festival.

Now, I grew up hearing the constant mantra that ""Israel is the only democracy in the middle east"" so clearly all Israelis should accept responsibility for the way Palestinians (both in Israel and in occupied territories) have been treated for decades. 

You can't have it both ways, you can't blame Palestinians for not dethroning Hamas while claiming  that a lot of decent liberals/left leaning Israelis would like to see Palestinians condition improved but can't do much about it. 

This to me is one of the many double standards that I hear in these days. "

1,2023-10-13,CMV: Prisons should provide decent living conditions,u/0xAERG,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176xkrx/cmv_prisons_should_provide_decent_living/,changemyview,"***Disclaimer****:* ***Death Penalty*** *is outside of the scope of this discussion, please let's try to all leave it outside of it. For the sake of this debate, I'll consider that the worst sentence possible is a lifelong Jail sentence.*  


I believe prisons should aim to be decent and provide humane living conditions, following examples that we can see in Switzerland and Norway. Making inmates live in squalor is not just unethical, but also counterproductive, which I will try to argue.  


Here is my train of thoughts:  


1. From minor offenses to severe felonies, people can be sentenced to jail for a wide spectrum of crimes. Sentences can range from a few month to life.  


2. Estimates suggest that between 2 and 10% of convictions could be wrongful. According to the World Prison Brief, as of October 2021, over 10.74 million people were incarcerated worldwide. This means that approximately 200,000 to 1 million people could be wrongfully incarcerated globally. Until we find a way to reduce this figure to 0 (if we can ever), we need to take this fact into account.  


3. Some inmates are deemed too dangerous for reintegration and therefore receive maximal sentences. However, the vast majority of inmates are expected to re-enter society at some point. For them, I believe the prison system would be broken if it was making them bigger threats to society that when they came in.  


4. Humiliating living conditions break people. Even if you don't care for the mental health of inmates, this make them more dangerous for society. Those wrongfully convicted may develop a lifelong grudge against society. Minor offenders risk becoming radicalized, and already dangerous individuals may become even greater threats  


As a result, I believe giving inmates decent living conditions is the bare minimum that we can do in our own interest, not even to rehabilitate them, but at least not to exacerbate the risks they may pose upon release.

70% of an art came from Artist A, 30% from Artist B. It would be indicated in the image (allowing reverse search) and making it possible to charge Copyright to the artist who was used for the result. 

""but how would they know about a ready-made image?"" In the same way that there are mechanisms to recognize copyright in other media. Basically, searching the generative AI databases (Where all results should be stored)

Simplified:

IA generate something > includes where each piece came from for the result > Keeps the image in the database. > A tool like recognizing music and content copied from YouTube comes into action when that content is used. > Artist has the possibility of being notified (If he has a contact)

1.Historical nations

Neither Ukraine nor Israel has the usual history of the formation of a country. One was released from Russia, the other was formed by committee. From the point of view of both Russia and Palestine, their enemy  is not/should not be an actual recognized country.

2. The land claims

The lands both countries inhabit are historically divided, with both parts having valid claims, as in both Palestinians and Jews, and both Russians and Ukrainians. Nobody can deny the history of Jews in Middle East, or the one of Ruthenians and Cossacks in Crimea or Kievan area. Each aggressor sees the lands of the enemy as rightfully their own.

3. Cultural divide and war propaganda

Both Russia and Palestine have developed an internal propaganda that has worked, for years, to raise war support and justification. There is a cultural substrate that divided a long time ago, and is now used to differentiate into a ""us better, them worse"", this practice being initiated by both Russia and Palestine.

4. Infamy of aggressors

Russia is an aggressor and a terrorist supporter in an initiating role. The same for Palestine.

5. Global Ideology

Both Ukraine and Israel lean to democracy and western liberalism, both Palestine and Russia favor authoritarianism

1,2023-10-13,CMV: Debate culture spreads hate.,u/pedrulho,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/177bubf/cmv_debate_culture_spreads_hate/,changemyview,"In my opinion at least, when you have a disagreement with someone and want to have a debate with them, specially when everyone involved is a fully grown adult, they should be capable of having a polite friendly conversation regardless of who's right or wrong, and just because you ""lost"" the debate and got proven wrong that doesn´t necessarly need to be a bad thing, much for the contrary, it's good to be proven wrong and get put on the right path.
  

  
A debate should be about a friendly exchange of ideas where even if someone is proven wrong she will feel confortable admiting it without having to face social scrutiny. It's good for everyone, the person who was wrong has now a better understanding of the subject matter and the winner gets a new ally/friend who now agrees with him and shares similar ideals.
  

  
But now a days, whether it's a debate involving someone from the Daily Wire, Jordan Petorson or Piers Morgan, when you watch footage of this debates everyone just seems so condescending to each other, it feels like that deep down the one true objective of this debates is not necessarly to reach an agreement but yes to shame the ""opposing"" side as much as possible to the point that being proven wrong is considered a public humiliation. This i feel devalues the truth because now, when it comes to solving these peoples differences , the truth is irrelevant because now the disagreemnt between the two side stops not only being due to differing ideals, but now is also because this one person purposely attempted or succeded at shaming you socially. This will only spread more hate between both communities of opposing sides.
  

  
It has reached a point where ""losing"" one of this debates is considered a public humiliation, this i feel could create a situation when the person in the wrong could hesitate and refuse to admit their mistakes even if they themselves have become aware of them just so to avoid social scrutiny not only coming from the debate itself but also being the target of online mockery in the form of youtube videos titled in the nature of ""This personed owned this person"", ""This persons destroys this person"", a situation more easily avoided if being in the wrong stopped being so prone to social humiliation, once again creating even more resentment between people.
  

  
I do understand that not everyone is easy to talk to nor to reason with, some people could indeed lose their cool in a debate and sometimes you have to fight fire with fire to defend yourself., but it still feels like too much and unnecessary.

Edit: Just to clarify, i am not against debating in general, exchanging ideas and opinions with others is perfectly natural and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, you can even argue that i posted here to have one, which i did.
My issues arrive when the ""debates"" proceed to unnecesarly lack civilty and turn into childish arguments where the pursuit of truth and reaching a mutual understanding stops being the focus, and it becomes about who can humiliate the opposite side the most.

Conclusions i came to after reading your coments:

1. How people see themselves as human beings comes in large part from their opinions and beliefs and people associate these to their persona, so when someone challanges one's world views they feel as if they themselves as a human beings are under attack leading people to hold on to their egos, causing a situation where peoples emotions get the best of them causing them to get angry as they refuse to admit that they might be at fault as that for them would feel like they would be admitting that they are indecent or lesser has a human beings.

2. Discussions taking place in front of a large audience could take an effect on the people partaking in it, compelling them to simply seek social gratification out fear of public humiliation, people will make it their focus not to necessarly change to opposing side's mind but to humiliate them in front everyone to make them look weak and dumb, that way they get to look strong and intelligent in comparision, hence avoiding socila scrutiny.

3. Certain people defend and take positions considered by many to be outrageous and objectively wrong such as things of the nature of marginalizing and dehumanization of vulnerable groups, making these people with who will be very difficult to have a civil discussion for very long."

I have been on a self improvement journey and doing things that make me happy and grow as a person.

However... I can't help but feel so upset and envious that other guys seem to get girls so effortlessly while other guys like me seem to have to work so hard to get equal results.

Some unattractive guys I met have fucking told me that they met their girlfriend or FWB(s) by ""accident"" or luck.

I have seen and heard of fat, broke, socially awkward, ugly, etc guys who have dated and had sex with really beautiful girls and it just makes me seethe with envy.

Some guys are even horrible human beings and seem to still get girls.

furthermore, I am not sure why but being some unattractive loser with nothing going for them yet still be banging the super hot popular girl just seems so hot and cool. it seems ""better"" and hooter than being some muscular popular jock and banging the same attractive popular girl.  
Like imagine being a fat or scrawny nerdy kid with no friends or accomplishments or even a ""great personality"" thats charming, funny, full of unbreakable confidence that rivals james bonds, and yet have a very beautiful girl choose YOU over every other guy, who are objectively better than you?

BTW, please dont take this the wrong way. i am not saying girls are ""objects"" that can be collected or earned. im sick of people accusing me of thinking that way. I just feel bad that some guys are able experience such pleasures. the experience of being desired, admiration and sex from such beautiful girls.

plus, it makes me feel awful that some guys are objectively worst than me and still do well with dating and casual sex. it makes me feel so pathetic.

its like if a employer chooses a felon with no education over you even though you have graduated from college, follow the follow, dress well, etc.

why should I have to put in so much fucking exhausting effort to find casual sex? why should I go out and socialize and meet dozens of girls, build a social network, get rejected countless times, hone my social skills, work on my self confidence and humor, and so much more just to get the same results so many slobs get with little to no effort?"

All that stuff about power imbalances also doesn't apply. They are both adults. They are perfectly capable of making their own informed choices. If their relationship ends up toxic with one being subordinate, it's not specific to them being siblings.  There are normal relationships where power dynamics are wrecked. Now you might argue that being in a relationship with someone you've known since childhood is odd, which is fair enough. But if we were to consider 2 gay men, not related by blood, who've known each other since they were kids, you could say they are as close as how most are to their siblings.  So generally speaking it looks like a regular relationship with a dynamic pretty similar to those childhood friends if you take away the sibling label. This raises the question. Why? What makes one wrong and the other not?"

Hi,

So this post is kinda long and complicated in purpose. This preface is relevant i promise. I will preface this with a TW: OCD and self harm mentioned

I have been professionally diagnosed by multiple doctors with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).

The way OCD works is that you basically you get an intrusive thought and you cannot get this thought out of your head (the obsession). This thought causes you a great deal of discomfort or anxiety. Some people fear germs, others think god is going to punish them, others think they're pedophiles, etc. It doesn't have to make sense or be rational. To deal with this anxiety, you do some compulsion. Compulsions can vary. I used to wash my hands because I feared ""contamination"". It got so bad that I dried out my hands to the point that if I bent my wrist the skin would crack and bleed. But the pain was worth it because it lessened the anxiety. Other people compulsively organize or the check the burner 500 times. You get the idea. If you don't do the compulsion the anxiety builds and builds and builds until you cannot take it anymore and give in. It's hard to describe the level of anxiety but it can literally feel like life or death sometimes. 

So, recently I realized my latest obsessions are that I am secretly like a terrible fascist racist person and that the only way to counter that is by investigating. I.e. the only way that I can prevent myself from being a terrible racist is by fully investigating and refuting racist claims. I want to get treatment for my OCD. But I fear that if I do that, and I no longer fully investigate these claims, I will accept racist talking points as true and contribute to the societal problem of racism. That means I am going to effectively be hurting other people. And I would rather not be a nazi. Cause they suck.

Hence this post. Fact checking and investigating racist, misogynist, classist, homophobic claims has consumed my life. I actively seek out the worst type of shit you can find online so that i can refute it. And the entire time i am more or less having a panic attack because of high levels of anxiety. I want to get treatment. In order to get treatment I need to convince myself I won't be a horrible racist if I do. Common treatment for OCD is called Exposure Response Prevention. The basic idea is that you get exposed to something that gives you anxiety and then you are prevented from doing your compulsion and have to sit with the anxiety. That means i will have to like, not fact check racist shit when i encounter it to try and get better. But I worry if I don't i will accept racist shit and become one myself.

So if this doesn't come off as strictly rationale or make a lot of sense, it's cause it's entirely rooted in my own personal anxiety and OCD.


Ok, with that preface out of the way, let's dive into it.

So take the ""racial iq gap"" talking point nazi types like to spout (there's many articles on it on the nazi website American Renissance which i had the misfortune of reading to refute) I felt the need to fact check (the claim, for those who don't spend their time in racist circles, is that there is an ""intelligence gap"" between different racial groups that is rooted in biology and explains differntial outcomes amongst racial groups. Basically they're saying ""black people are poorer on average because they're dumber"", see The Bell Curve by Charles Murray which is a whole book on the topic) I think we can agree that's a fairly racist talking point right? if you actually look into the issue at all you can see that 1) iq isn't innate. You can train for a better iq. 2) given that reality and well known disparities between educational spending and resources between racial groups in the US is this ""iq gap"" really a result of some inherent racial difference or is it more likely a result of like, some kids get more training than others? 3) Plus, iq has also been measured between generations and there's been a massive boost from the previous generation to this one and the one before that's too fast to be explained by genetics. It's caused by educational systens teaching more abstract thinking which is what is measured on the test. It's also worth pointing out that the iq gap has been rapidly shrinking, again much faster than biology can account for

So by fact checking that claim I found out more relevant information and thus didn't adopt the whole ""well I guess that means white people are just biologically smarter than black people""

Had I not done the fact checking then I would have accepted that racist framework right? Fact checking is a counter to that no? Because there is actually a measurable iq difference on average, but it doesn't actually mean anything cause of the reasons I outlined

How do I know I won't be racist if I don't fact check? If I don't fact check and I come a claim like ""there is a racial iq gap"" which is technically true, but missing a whole lot of context, then wouldn't I adopt a racist viewpoint as I was missing that critical context? And then I would turn into a shit head who goes around saying that black people are dumber or some other racist shit right?"

I just can't wrap my brain around this. I *feel* like it's wrong, but better mathematicians than me claim it's right, so I'd like the flaws in my logic to be pointed out to me.

I'd also love links to good explanations on this - a quick google search didn't provide me with anything that really clicked for me.

My reading showed me that the cardinality of a set is sort of a definition for how many elements are in that set - the size of the set.

And that since the two sets of whole numbers and even numbers can be arranged like:

1 - 2

2 - 4

3 - 6

n - 2n ad infinitum

Then the two sets have the same size.

It's an ordering thing.

But couldn't I also order it in other ways that give them *not* the same cardinality?

And couldn't the same argument be made for finite sets? 

e.g. the same sets but capped at 100. I could order those sets so that they seem like they have the same cardinality, at least for the first few elements, but would run out of even numbers to pair with the whole numbers after 50. The ordering thing doesn't quite make sense to me, it feels like a cheat way to mess with uncountable sets, because technically I could do the same thing with finite sets if I just didn't bother to count the whole set. I could have that same-cardinality ordering for the first few elements but if you counted *all* the elements you'd find twice the cardinality in the whole numbers set as the even numbers set if they're both capped at 100.

Can someone point out why I'm wrong?"

There must have been at least some evidence for it for them to go this far.  
  
However I also think that stealing the election was the right choice. Otherwise Trump might have won and considering the damage he did during Covid (a crisis he could have easily turned into a victory), it was necessary to remove a very very bad president and protect the country.  
  
Perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the election truly wasn't stolen - I see plenty of democrats arguing in good faith believing that there's evidence to the contrary. Alternatively, perhaps it was stolen but it's a bad thing - while I disagree with many republicans it's also true that they want the best for the country and perhaps stealing elections is going too far."

Similarly, I've seen a persistent trend on reddit where the citizens of anti western countries(Russia, China, Iran, etc) are gleefully declared savages who should be bombed into the stone age.   


I'm aware this can be dismissed as anecdotal evidence in all cases, but it's the persistent behavior I've seen from all these places, not the norm.

Similar applies to car parkings, specifically closed ones where there's a ticketing system and CCTV. They often claim they'll take no responsibility for theft.

I feel this is unfair, as they have zero incentive to store these items securely if there's zero repercussions if they do a poor job. Someone can walk out with an expensive stolen jacket just because they found a lost ticket and the staff would rarely not even try to question it (some places ask for initials but most don't check).

I understand forcing these places to be liable wouldn't exactly work, as they'd just avoid offering it, which is a lose-lose in the end. What would change my mind is some kind of reason why it should be allowed to take *zero* responsibility when you're the one providing storage (and implicitly security)."

Some have even said they should do away with advertising altogether and revert the platform back to how it was in the late 2000s.

I remember YouTube in the early days although I was a kid, I understand the difference. I also understand from a business perspective why monetizing a free platform is necessary with ads, premium offers etc.

If tomorrow YouTube decided to do away completely with premium offers and advertising, it would directly negatively impact the content on YouTube itself and what people can create. Advertising is a necessary annoyance, not just on the internet but in society as a whole. Beyond just supporting content creators and funding the platforms themselves, advertising drives competition and awareness. 

It makes very little sense to argue against advertising, especially on a free platform. Even Netflix and Hulu offer tier's at a discount with the con being you have to watch ads. We've come a long way from paying $80 a month for cable television with 3 minute ad breaks every 10 minutes. "

Second, transgenderism reinforces the gender binary. You are male or female. This is in no way progressive.  

Third, and in-line with the second observation, transgenderism reinforces gender stereotypes. Not progressive either.

Overall, the transgender movement is not making any meaningful societal advancements. On the flip side, the binary movement is because it questions the gender binary, it is inherently body positive, and it challenges gender stereotypes.

Humans are omnicidal. Humans are sadistic. Humans are sociopathic. The current conflict between Israel and Hamas is living proof of that.

Frankly, I was barely appalled by Hamas' actions. Beheading babies? Horrid, but they didn't eat them alive. Parading corpses? Unforgivable, but they could've cut open their abdomens and let their intestines spill out during said parades. Massacring people at a music festival? Abhorrent, but they could've gouged out their eyes, raped them, cut open their abdomens, and eaten directly out of them. There is truly no limit to human depravity.

The conflict has also done a great job showing how heartless the average human truly is. There are people defending terrorists and screaming ""gas the Jews!"" It would appear empathy is not a natural human emotion. In fact, people aren't just being being heartless; they are enjoying the deaths of thousands. I doubt that there's any greater a feeling to any human than watching someone cry out in pain as you slice them to bits. To be human is not to cry when someone dies; it is to laugh.

When we are born, we want to kill our mothers. When we reach maturity, we want to kill every other person on this rock. Humans are tribalistic by nature, and when a different tribe appears, we decide that their only proper fate is death. Humans achieve unity through genocide, as once the outside tribes are eliminated, the large tribes split into smaller tribes, and the bloodshed resumes. We kill, rape, sacrifice, and cannibalize until only one remains. That is humanity's true nature.

Of course, the purpose of tribalism is so we can justify our own wrongdoing. We honestly wouldn't need any justification if it weren't for the Cult of Morality. Humans are indoctrinated into this cult from an early age, and it tells us, among other things, that murder is wrong. Of course, the only reason why people believe murder is wrong is because they were taught to believe that it is. Morality is a myth and a social construct. We only believe that murder is wrong because someone told us that it is wrong to intentionally take someone else's life. However, we can never truly overcome our nature. We still want to take human life at the end of the day, and no amount of indoctrination can change that. So, our minds develop scenarios in which it is not only acceptable, but proper, to take a life, such as when our victims are different for one reason or another. That's what is on display in Gaza right now. That's what  was on display in Nazi Germany. That's what was on display in Rwanda. We all want to kill, but because we are told not to kill, we seek justification for all the heinous things we do."

The chemical composition of the alcohol in tequila is the same as it is in whiskey, as it is in wine, as it is in beer, etc. There is no reason why anything else in these would interact to make you sick, and I believe the main reason that people believe they get sick is a combination of placebo + just drinking high quantities of alcohol.

For example, think about what a cocktail is. It is LITERALLY A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT ALCOHOLS. Not even talking about drinks like the Long Island or AMF, but think about any fancy bar with artisanal cocktails. It is not uncommon for their drinks to be a mixture of 4-5 different liquors, yet people will drink these happily and with no hesitation.

I want to be clear that the people I’m talking about are the regular average person, and not someone with low tolerance, allergies, or other health issues.

There is more of this for the individual if there be less humans, and of course greenhouse emissions are sstrongly tied to the the human of humans.

There are however some often raised counter arguments which I shall address:

## Aging of the population

The big problem with reducing birth rates is that it will lead to a population demographic of more old and less young people and young people must work to support the elderly who cannot. My simple counter argument to this is that [people that don't have children out-earn people that do to a ridiculous degre](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241530/birth-rate-by-family-income-in-the-us/#:~:text=As%20the%20income%20scale%20increases,44.89%20births%20per%201%2C000%20women.&text=Income%20and%20high%20birth%20rates,States%2C%20but%20around%20the%20world.). It makes complete sense that having and rearing children significantly cuts into one's financial opportunities. Society can well pay the price of more old people as a cost of reducing population with the fact that people that don't have children, or have less children, out-earn people that do have them by a substantial degree. In fact, people that don't have children earn so much more looking at these graphs that having fewer children will lead to far more money to take care of the elderly with how much this translates to more taxes.

Apart from that, one must also remember that it's not all young persons that work, how countries are mostly structured is that in the first 20 years of life, human beings cost society as an investment, then they start to contribute, and in the last 10-15 years they cost society again, so reducing the number of young persons along with the number of middle-aged persons isn't even that much of a detriment, and again, childless persons out-earn childed persons by such a degree that even if it weren't the case it wouldn't matter and finally, we're speaking about opportunity cost too. Having more children is an investment for the eldelry that first costs money and then pays back at best, whereas less children immediately pays the elderly, and society at large more, as people that don't have children now earn more money and are more productive to benefit society now.

## Less people total means less innovation

This is an argument I'm more sympathic towards. Ideas are not a resource that has to be shared, they can be copied free of charge and can be shared by anyone. Only one person has to invent a revolutionary medical treatment and all mankind can benefit from it, the chance for that one perso to exist and find it obviously increases with more human beings.

However, it's only the educated elite that innovates these kind of things that benefit all mankind. It is not so much about increasing the number of persons but increeasing the number of educated persons and the two don't seem to linearly correlate at all when population grow doesn't correlate with prosperity which is what creates education and innovation. There are some very populous countries such as India or China who nevertheless as a country seem to be comparable to countries such as Germany which are far smaller in terms of how much groundbreaking innovation they produce in absolute numbers because of Germany's prosperity. I would thus argue that if population decline lead to prosperity, which I believe it does, it's negative effect on innovation will either be low, or negative itself, actually leading to more innovation since a smaller population will actually have a larger absolute number of educated persons than a bigger population simply because a smaller population has more resources to divide per individual.

Even with somewhat less innovation. The fact that there will be so much more productivity and resources per capita with population decline, it'd be worth it."

“that lady all of my respect”

This is because this comment does not clarify which lady deserves respect or what she has done to deserve respect. This comment could be on a video about a woman donating to charity and make sense. Heck, this comment could be posted on a video that encourages asking kids for pronouns and it still fits in. On the other hand, one comment that directly addresses the issue of pronouns is stuck at only 4 likes.

&#x200B;

The most liked comment on a video is also usually one that can be agreed by everyone when taken out of context. In that video where a woman says that parents should be wary of teachers who ask for kid’s pronouns. One of the top comments with over 4,000 likes says:

“god bless those who are protecting kids, I’m a kid myself, and I thank this lady”

Almost everyone claims they want to protect kids even if they don’t, which explains why it has so many likes. I have a feeling that if this comment mentioned pronouns, it would have far fewer likes. I am not moving the goalposts, I simply have more to say.

Every single school district announcement, news story, or anything public on Facebook is just overwhelmed by adults attacking each other viciously. During the height of the pandemic the AG in our state was suing schools for enforcing mask mandates, school board meetings would devolve into screaming matches, and parents - ARMED- would stand outside the schools. Fucking madness. Politicians are working tirelessly to target attacks on transgender children, like relentless aggression on these kids for fucking existing. Don’t even get me started on school shootings. Police officers stood outside the school doing nothing, while adult politicians bully activists from a separate school shooting, and a child who is a climate activist. Adults are storming the capitol building acting like animals. The complete disregard for their safety during covid, and the full lack of acknowledgement that the majority of school aged students are about 2 social and academic years behind, but just push them through. Our health, and education systems are crumbling, and a potential presidential candidate for an election a year away is a walking dumpster fire with the emotional intelligence of a rabid tapeworm. 

And yet… people are throwing their arms up, like, “why are my students mean to me” “why are teens so mean” “why did this young person tell me to mind my fucking business when I asked them to stop cussing in front of my kids” “why is gen z like this”

Uhhh- I mean, probably because adults are literally trying to genocide their friends, their teachers are burnt out and ignoring the fact their entire lives uprooted for 3 years, and adults are actively behaving like self absorbed, self righteous sociopaths. The behavior of adults, both public and online, is disturbed. Adolescent and young adults are behaving, appropriately, as a reaction and reflection of the adults publicly showing their whole asses."

&#x200B;

* The Trump phenomenon would be much weaker today, or non-existent. If Romney were the incumbent president in 2016, he'd be a virtual shoo-in to be the Republican nominee (as incumbent presidents usually are.) Trump very likely would not have chosen to run for president in 2016 at all - and if he had done so, he'd be most likely heavily squashed in the Republican primaries and seen as the joke that he was. The damage that Trump has done to America has been massive, but a Romney presidency might have nipped any Trump aspirations in the bud.
* Even if Trump wanted to run for president anyway, he likely could not have ever won the Republican nomination until 2020, when Romney would be stepping down - and in 2020, the tide would have been in favor of the Democrats, since voters tend to get tired of the party that's holding the White House after eight years and vote in the opposing party. So if Trump were running in 2020, he most likely would lose to the Democratic nominee since the Democrat would the voter-fatigue momentum on their side. What this means, then, is that Trump may very well never be president.
* Had Romney (or a Democrat, or - really, anyone but Trump) been president in 2020, I believe he would have done a far better job of handling the Covid pandemic than Trump did.
* Romney was known for a very strong anti-Russia stance - in fact, this was one debate clashing issue between him and Obama in 2012, where Obama was actually the somewhat-Russia-friendlier candidate. Had Romney been president, I believe America would have taken a substantially more pro-Ukraine stance and Ukraine would be in a considerably stronger position today - perhaps even strong enough to the point that the February 2022 invasion by Russia would not have happened.
* Romney represented the old, traditional wing of the Republican Party - the McCain wing, so to speak - which, for all its flaws, was still a lot better than the current berserk-insane Trump wing of the Republicans. If Romney wins in 2012 and again in 2016, then the Republican nominee for president in 2020 may very well be someone like Paul Ryan (the presumed vice president), which would also represent a continuation of the old-school GOP.
* The reason the Democrats have remained stuck in their old staid ways (such as nominating and re-nominating an octogenarian Biden for president) is because the Trump factor made them afraid of nominating anyone young, bold or new - Democrats have become incredibly risk-averse (""We can't nominate anyone but an old white man, because only an old white man like Biden can beat an old white man like Trump!"") If Romney had won in 2012, I think we might have seen a new wave of young Democrats being presidential candidates instead. The 2016-2024 Democratic presidential nominees might be people like Kamala, Buttigieg, etc. instead of.....an 80-year old guy. Without Trump, I think we would see a younger, fresher Democratic party.

There are some who will swear up and down that it helped them lose weight and if they feel it's helpful that's their choice. But in general, I don't think insulting people leads to change. It's bullying and I'm against bullying. So where that aspect of the fat acceptance movement is concerned, I'm on board. 

Second, I think the fat acceptance movement is right about a very important idea: weight is *not* the best indicator of health, even though almost all physicians take people's weights but don't measure their body composition, body composition is a far bettet indicator- more specifically where the fat is stored. Excess abdominal fat has been linked to inflammation and disease. Whether an individual is normal weight, underweight, or overweight. 

And if fat acceptance advocates said ""weight is not the best indicator of health here is a *better* one I would take no issue with the movement. But I feel like the movement is more interested in making fat people feel like they don't have to change than accurate health science. And the reality is that many fat people will be at risk for inflammation and all sorts of diseases going by the better barometers of health that I mentioned above.

The common responses I hear from defenders of the fat acceptance movement are: some people cannot change it (this is true and I believe those people are still at the risks mentioned above) and the people who can don't really *believe* they are healthy. 

But I think these people are underestimating the ability of the mind to grab on to a comforting idea and buy into that idea if it means avoiding discomfort. If there's even the thought ""*maybe* I don't need to change, change won't happen."" And that's what the movement does, it tells people they don't need to change. But sometimes, for their own well being, people do need to change. 

I feel like there's always this sort of tightrope walk between what's true and what makes others feel good. And if something cannot be changed, I don't think its beneficial to tell people ""here are the ways this quality can make your life worse"" when it's something that cannot be changed. But when it's something that can be changed I feel like people have the right to know the benefits the change will bring (I think it's also good to frame it in this light.) Losing excess fat has many benefits. better immunity, feeling better internally, better sex life, more attractive to more people which helps when it comes to dating. On top of that, there are enormous benefits from eating a healthier diet and exercising regularly. The flip side of that, the part people probably shouldn't lead with, is that not losing excess fat has major detriments. 

That's my view, but I don't know a ton about this topic and I'm open to changing it"

Marriage and long-term monogamy are actually an evolutionary anomaly that only appeared 5 to 2k years ago, but only took hold of society about seven hundred years ago.  
  
Most humans that ever lived engaged in a combination of loose serial monogamy, polygyny, or polyamory. It is only when high populations in urban centers start to appear that humans engage on long-term monogamy, largely as a defense mechanism against STIs, as a guarantee of biological fatherhood, and as a means by which to increase social cohesion and provide stability. It has been proven that we have twice as many female ancestors as male.  
  
Modern technology, particularly advances in medicine and communications, made these advantages obsolete, this is why we are seeing a decline in marriages and long-term monogamy nowadays, we are basically coming back to our evolutionary norm. it is not a cultural accident or political conspiracy, it is literally biology.  
  
Life-long monogamy had its advantages in the pre-modern era, such as reducing STI contagion, improving social cohesion in various localized and systemic ways, and assuring resource flow from the provider to the family. None of these three are relevant anymore:  
  
\* STIs are mostly under control with antibiotics, vaccines, and antiviral medications.  
  
\* Communications technologies, digital and physical surveillance, and the rule of law took away the necessity for micromanaging societal cohesion through marriage and associated social justice systems based on honor, shame, or guilt.  
  
\* Courts can hunt men down all the way into other countries for alimony and child support, in addition to testing their DNA for confirming parenthood. This effectively prevents ""pump and dump"" strategies that would have been easier before.  
  
The only way for marriage to come back into fashion is for long-term monogamists to have more children than anyone else. What seems to be happening, however, is that serial monogamists are having more children on average:

Social media has provided a way for pro-Hamas groups to tell us what they believe without sanitation from their supporters and I see no reason why they shouldn't be allowed to let the world know that so others can react as they see fit.

It is simply true that none of the societies which labelled themselves as communist ever achieved a society which was classless, stateless, and free of currency. Most didn't even achieve socialism (which we can generally define as the workers controlling the means of production).

I acknowledge that the meaning of words change over time, but I don't see how this applies here, as communism was defined by theory, not observance, so it doesn't follow that observance would change theory. 

It's as if I said: Here is the blueprint for my ultimate dreamhouse, and then I tried to build my dreamhouse with my bare hands and a singular hammer which resulted in an outcome that was not my ultimate dreamhouse. 

You wouldn't look at my blueprint and critique it based on my poor attempt, you would simply criticize my poor attempt.

I think this distinction is very important, because people stand to gain from having a well-rounded understanding of history, human behavior, and politics.

Ghosts in films are always portrayed as solitary and evil (and dead) which subconsciously creates the idea that they are lonely. It doesn't have to be about them falling in love, they could just become friends or accomplices.

 Now that I'm writing this I'm getting more ideas. It could be a sick basis for a comedy, or an entertaining movie about ghosts scaring random urban explorers. But I'll stick with my original romance/some form of bonding.

 Picture 2 ghosts in some abandoned tunnels underground. At first they are scared of each other or whatever, but after time they become familiar with each other. Not communicating, just familiar with each others existence. It could be similar to the feeling you get from watching a human bond with a wolf. Non verbal, but the connection and mutual trust grows. How about one ghost sees the other crying in doorway or something?

 Obviously this would be very hard to film in a correct way that delivers the feeling right, but I think it could be done.

 It could also be done similar to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 with the rocket and his friends. That creepy but nostalgic feeling of joy in a place of bitter cold and hell, with your ghostly friends that you can't quite remember: like hallucinations. The film could end with one ghost disappearing or it could end with them leaving the tunnel into the light while holding hands or something metaphorical like that.  


I think this could be a very nice artistic film, but I understand it is up for interpretation of the viewer and will sounds like bullshit to many. Please feel free to ridicule it or provide suggestions. "
1,2023-10-14,cmv: Outside occupation of Israel/Palestine would probably be a better medium term solution than any other realistic scenario.,u/Alexander_Wagner,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1781dxu/cmv_outside_occupation_of_israelpalestine_would/,changemyview,"The situation in Israel/Palestine as I see it, is that you have two groups of people who for a variety of reasons are incapable of living together peacefully. Such a situation could work itself out in several ways.

* One group dominates the other. This is the situation in Israel/Palestine right now and I think we can all see that it isn't really working.
* The two groups coexist in a single state. This is the ideal situation, but it seems unlikely to be possible in the near term.
* The two groups are divided into two (or three) separate states. This is probably not possible because Israel is actively pursuing expansion into Palestinian territory and any Palestinian state would certainly have irredentist claims into any Israeli state. Also, there would be lots of people from one group on opposite sides of the border, and trying to move them would likely result in a tragedy similar to the partition of India and Pakistan or the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
* Finally we come to the solution I think presents the best opportunity of clamping down intercommunal violence. The political power of both groups could be suppressed by an outside force coming in and establishing themselves as overlords.

If there were a third outside force, with no stake in the conflict between the two groups, it could be possible to come to some sort of compromise which both sides could be compelled to accept.

Ideally, this outside force would be some kind of international mandate representing the great powers of the world whose interest was in the suppression of violence for the sake of peace and prosperity. But even an imperial power who was interested in exploiting the region for their own profit would probably have a similar motivation to stop the excesses of violence."

A large reason for this view is because I tend to be less incensed by injustice than I am by people getting away with it, and this act is proof America is committed to ensure ""we will get away with it in my eyes"". what good reason is there to have this exceptionalism, especially when it cites that ""it will not come to the aid of a country that is party to the ICC"", barring NATO members or anyone else with ""Article 98 Agreements"". 

the purpose of this CMV is there has to be some reason this law was passed, some reason the people who passed it deserve sympathy despite the fact my gut tells me ""they so do not deserve sympathy or mercy"". as the above paragraph explains, I am sickened by how many people in this world escape justice, and the fact they do speaks volumes of the moral character of those who enable that escape.

The only reason it worked to save Sirius is because Dumbledor knew they already used it because he saw them save Buckbeak. He then told Harry and Hermione to use it. All the events had already happened.

If they used it to go back and try to stop something that already happened they would have met some kind of obstacle and wouldn’t have succeeded."

Even though everyone knows the kind of creepy behavior the asshole is engaging in, a lot of people will continue to remain friends with the asshole - so we can never kick them out of the group. 

I understand that in some cases, people feel obligated to support assholes because they have to maintain working relationships, they're family members, etc. Also, sometimes people just have genuine differences of opinion and seem like assholes to each other, but nobody's really at fault. I can accept that. However, I feel increasingly infuriated by people that I know who continue to remain friends/friendly with **known,** **agreed-upon** assholes - because their crappy behavior doesn't affect them personally.  

In my view, the only reason assholes continue to get away with their bullshit is because they don't suffer any social consequences. In fact, I largely blame the political dysfunction we're seeing worldwide on the fact that we're not kicking enough assholes away from our communities. I strongly feel that people in a group have an obligation to work together to shun predatory and destructive people. 

I think by now we've all heard the famous quote that the opposite of hate is not love, but indifference. I truly feel that if everyone on Earth took the responsibility to stop being friends with + supporting bad people seriously, we would live in a much better world. And it's because we don't that we live in such a bad one.

Maybe at an individual level, none of us carries the full blame for the problems of society at large. But when it comes to a small social group of 3-30 people, people who continue to support the assholes in the group effectively act as assholes themselves by allowing the harm they cause to continue unchecked. 

However, I understand that this is a pretty black-and-white view, and I don't want to feel so angry and frustrated when I see this happening in the world anymore. For some reason I can't fully understand, a lot of people don't seem to agree with me that it's important to take a stand against assholes. Help me CMV so I can see the gray area that probably exists here, because I genuinely don't get why anyone who remains friends with an asshole isn't also being an asshole. "

He provided the working class two straight years where American workers wages didn't keep up with Bidenflation.  
  
Nearly two million retirees had to come out of retirement in the past year just to survive Bidenflation.  
  
Last year during just a three month period, there was over $6 Trillion in wealth lost for Americans as a whole.  
  
According to a recent poll, 75% of the middle class is worse off under Biden.  
  
Credit card debt is now at all time highs for Americans and consumer confidence is in the toilet under Biden after it was near all time highs under Trump.  
  
Now we're sitting on sky high interest rates in order to bring down inflation at 41 year highs.  
  
To be clear, inflation was already at 8% in February 2022 in the US before Russia stepped foot into Ukraine.  
  
Biden inherited inflation at only 1.6% and made sure inflation would go through the roof after attacking big oil/fossil fuels with an executive order in his first week in office. Energy is a key component of inflation.  
  
Then Biden followed up two months later by signing at $1.9 Trillion pork filled 'covid' bill, (not one Republican voted for) which paid the American worker to stay home for 6 months while there were over 10 million job openings. It further increased supply problems and exploded inflation.  
  
Young Americans can forget the American Dream under Biden's cost of living explosion.  
  
Half of Americans age 30 and under are still living at home since they can't get a start in life. The highest rate in nearly 100 years.  
  
Democrats spent US taxpayer money like crazy. Over $7 Trillion in less than 21 months while controlling the House, Senate and President. The cost of living completely exploded. The National Debt now sits at over $33 Trillion and growing at $200 Billion per month. Republicans in the House had to fight Biden this past debt ceiling deal to get him to stop the ridiculous spending.  
  
Furthermore, Obama and Biden have added substantially more to the National Debt than Bush and Trump put together... And Biden hasn't even completed his term.  
  
Biden and Democrats kept the same exact Republican trickle down they inherited from Trump as a job creator with low corporate tax rates and low individual tax rates. Dems didn't even put it to a vote to raise taxes while having the House, Senate and President for two years.  
  
In regard to foreign policy, Biden has been beyond horrible. Iran was down to $4 Billion when Biden took office and are now up to $70 Billion after Biden eased sanctions.  
  
Then Biden followed up by unfreezing $6 Billion more to Iran?  
  
In addition, under the Biden Administration, Putin/Russia was getting $74 million per day for oil, which helped fund their war against Ukraine.  
  
Biden and Democrats have maintained an open/unsecured border where millions and millions of people have come into this country illegally, including hundreds on the terror watch list under Biden's watch. With fentanyl pouring over the border at dramatically higher rates, it has now become the #1 cause of death for Americans age 18-29."

Most commentary has been about the morality of the action (killing civilian festival goers vs turning off utilities), or historical justifications for the actions (Gazans have suffered decades of Israeli encroachment/oppression, Israel turning down two state proposals, etc). Unless crucial to your point, I would refrain from entering that territory as it ends up in a lot of whataboutism. 

But no matter how I think about this situation, I cannot help but feel that the Hamas-led attacks have been counterproductive to the Palestinians liberation. There has been a growing chorus of international support for Palestine over the years, which is now fractured and many former pro-Palestine supporters have now reversed course. Not to mention the outsized military retaliation that is under way. 

I believe the actions taken by Hamas were understandable (violent anger is understandable in an apartheid system), but not excusable. And that non-violent protests over the years had increased support for the Palestinian cause, which is now in jeopardy.

I would like to have my mind changed on the fact that this was actually a useful thing to have happened for Palestinians. Is there an argument for the attacks happening that is not based on short-term impulse revenge for suffering, but that this was a better alternative than non-violence for Palestinian liberation?

If you think USA is sex-crazed, then you haven't been here. Americans are basically prudes compared to most parts of Europe. 

Anyways, I'm in my early 20s and I'm a virgin. I'm struggling getting into the dating world because of the lack of experience. No kissing, no sex. Nothing. There are lots of private reasons for that and I'm not gonna get into them. Guys my age seem more interested in experienced women.

You might think that these guys are only into casual flings so of course they would want experienced women, but I'm talking about those who seek LTR too. I've talked to so many men (all in their 20s) about this: friends, acquaintances, co-workers, classmates etc, and the general census is that they prefer experienced women. 

I've gotten ghosted after telling romantic interests about it. A lot. Both through text and in real-life. Those around me who are virgins as well experience the same problem. I've learned by now that I probably shouldn't mention it until just before the act lol.

I mean, I understand. Sex with a virgin will not be great. Yes, they're supposed to learn to get better, but mamy people do not wanna teach others something they've already learned in their teens. Men's hormones and horniness are peak at this age so it's not that surprising. 

Not only that, but many will think that they're dealing with a religious woman who wants to wait until marriage, or just someone in general who wants to wait at least 5 months. Everyone has their own pace and standards, nothing wrong with it. You can't expect everyone to adhere to your standards, men AND women. 

I think also another major reason to why they don't wanna deal with virgins is because of the pressure. They want the woman's first time to be special and they're scared that the woman will put very high expectations on them and then get disappointed after their first time. So they leave it to other men who they hope will give the woman a better time. The first time isn't supposed to be perfect, but so much of the media has sold the lie that it is. 

However, that being said, men on average still prefer a woman with low body count over high body count. From what I've read and seen at least. At the same time, they prefer a low body count over a virgin. 

The only men who weren't scared off by my virginity were the 30+ year olds who were specifically seeking out early 20s virgins (nope), Andrew Tate fans (nope) and religious men (not religious).

1,2023-10-15,"CMV: The root cause of the Israel-Palestine conflict lies in its location, and obviously the British.",u/Competitive_Fudge_96,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178dbab/cmv_the_root_cause_of_the_israelpalestine/,changemyview,"I have spent a lot of time reading over the years trying to find a cause for all of the problems in Israel-Palestine region and I sympathise with both sides. Both sides have been harmed by each other and has caused harm to each other. There's no victim and nobody ever wins and I doubt anyone will win in the future either. I am not even religiously biased and I am an atheist whose former religion was neither Judaism or Islam.

The Zionists started demanding a separate Jewish state back in the 19th century. Fair enough. Their demand was right. They started immigrating to Palestine because it was their true home and started purchasing land even before the Ottoman Empire was dissolved and the British Mandate started. Palestine was already filled with Arabs and they had been living in it for a really long time. I get that Palestine was originally the home of the Jews and it was their Holy Land, but those lands were with the Arabs for so long that they had held it for hundreds of years and it was practically the home of Arabs too. Nobody is going to take it kindly when you force yourself back into another person's country, especially when the neighbours are Arab countries and who support them.

And so goes history. World War One. Balfour Declaration. World War Two and obviously the Holocaust. The horrors of it cemented support for a Jewish state in Palestine. UN partitions it and then bloodshed for seventy-five years.

Did it HAVE to be in Palestine? I understand the historic and religious significance, but is it really worth it to spill so much of your own blood and also of your enemy's every single day for it? Is it really worth living when they force themselves into a small country in a region where everyone hates you and tries to kill you and you have to rely on superpowers to help out? Is it really worth it to live in a constant state of conflict? What about mental health and PTSD? I cannot find the difference between this and the European occupation of the Americas and Australia. The goal was to establish a state where they could live peacefully. I doubt that this has been achieved till date.

This is where the British and their hypocrisy comes into picture. People demand a lot of things, but you just cannot say yes to every single thing. Yes, the Jews needed a country of their own, but it did not have to be Palestine. They could offered a province/state or two from Canada or Australia and made it a country for them. Heck, even an island of the two New Zealand islands would have sufficed and is way bigger than the current Israel. 

It's far away from Europe, and away from the horrors of the Holocaust. It's in the New World. The best part? Those areas were barely inhabited by many people. All of them were British countries under the British Empire. This would have brought in so much peace. The amount of investment Israel does to Science is amazing. Imagine what they could have accomplished if they didn't have to spend so much on the military.

It's just that the British didn't want them in 'their' lands. ""I have so much of sympathy for you. I will not give you some of my land but instead I will go destroy another country by breaking it apart and give it to you."" It was a classic colonial move to protect itself and the many innocent lives are lost every day."

The reason for this is because Hollywood almost imploded in the 1960/1970s, which lead to auteur driven films were directors where given control over their films. Producers were unable to comprehend why audiences liked certain films, which ended up with having to put trust in the directors. I think Easy Rider is considered the first of these time of films, but it lead all the way to people like Scorsese and Coppola. And yes, Spielberg has been argued to have ruined cinema with blockbusters, but I think older blockbusters had some intelligence to them.

The cycle is inevitable and we should embrace that is is good.

The few things that are different now are the fact that video games earn more, China cannot be offended and physical media is death. If you can string together an argument using any of these I would be open to having my mind changed.

They have this immunity like they're speaking of some objectively good force but if you peeled back the curtain and got rid of this fantasy you'd have to justify capitalism, war,  porno, all of it and you can't so you just pass the buck to Elohim which is a name for saturn anyways. Christianity is the biggest lie ever told and wedging into the minds of kids should be considered child abuse.
Of the people I know who were raised devoutly Christian ones a pedophile, one was molested as a boy by a man. One repeatedly threatened to shoot up my high school. Christianity is not a safe vestige of spiritual truth its a dangerous dark mental illness we all condone then if you challenge it you are inferred to lack."

Homophobia is as another Redditor liked to call it, “misogyny with extra steps”. 

They believe that man on man action means that one party becomes the sex object aka the woman, the inferior, the submissive which makes the man less of a man and more like a woman in the eyes of the homophobe. And how dare a man act like a woman, as femininity is considered weak or inferior to the man or masculinity. 

And woman on woman action is seen as two inferiors trying to have sex with one partner taking on the masculine superior, which again goes against their beliefs as they are women so will never be the superior dominant partner. 

These people hold views that mean that women are to be dominated and a man that wants to be dominated aka a bottom gay man, is against nature and they will never be a full man in their eyes. 

 I also feel that the tops in gay relationships are seen as slightly more superior than the bottom as they take on the more “natural” masculine position, however they are still seen as inferior as it’s man on man and women like men."
1,2023-10-15,CMV: Danny Phantom should be the next animated superhero show Netflix turns into a live action.,u/Square-Dragonfruit76,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178fo82/cmv_danny_phantom_should_be_the_next_animated/,changemyview,"Danny Phantom was a popular show and was only cancelled because it went over budget and the network prioritized Avatar the Last Airbender. It would be an ideal show for a live-action remake for the following reasons:

1) The show was popular and had a great plot with potential for a lot of viewership. It had such dedicated viewership that there were protesters outside the studio for weeks after it was cancelled.

2) The concept is really interesting for a superhero show and not the cliche Marvel-type thing.

3) The plot lends itself to live-action. It has diverse characters, high school drama, action, romance, etc.

4) The special effects are appropriate for live action. you have traditional superhero powers, without ones that are insanly difficult to replicate, such as _One Piece_ powers.

5) The show has the potential for a lot of new angles. They could redo their original series, or create new high school plots, or even do a college version. It could even follow the path of Buffy and successfully make a show that matures as the characters get older.

Potential challenges:

1) _""We should do a more traditional superhero show. that has more guaranteed chance of success.""_ To me it seems like people have a little bit of fatigue of some of the classic superheroes. Especially when the plots are recycled so much.

2) _""How about a live action that is more dark and gritty.""_ I think Danny Phantom has a lot of potential to have both lighthearted and dark aspects, which is part of what makes it an entertaining show. But if you're talking about really dark or adult animated shows, a number of those already exist on other streaming platforms.

3) _""We should make a LA avatar The Last Airbender instead.""_ They're already doing this; you're out of the loop 

4) _""They should do an anime such as_ My Hero Academia_ ""_   Netflix already has its hands full with _One Piece_ right now."

1,2023-10-15,Cmv: There’s a lot more pressure regarding sex on men than there is on women,u/full-NelsonMandela,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178gr3q/cmv_theres_a_lot_more_pressure_regarding_sex_on/,changemyview,"I think this is one of the things feminists have very wrong about sexuality and the pressure placed on both genders regarding sex.

For women, sexual pressure comes in the form of either having it or not having it. There is pressure to not be a prudish bore to the men around you, and there’s pressure to not have tons of sex lest you be seen as a slut. I’m not going to say this pressure is nonexistent but I don’t think it amounts to much in comparison to the pressure men have.

For men, we don’t have to deal with these aspects but we have to deal with so much more. The first and most obvious one is being sexually successful. This is something that is not only incredibly difficult as a guy but in many aspects uncontrollable. You as a man do not get to decide whether you are sexually successful. The woman around you do. They decide who has sex and who doesn’t. 

There’s also not as much performance pressure placed on women. A woman can starfish in bed and chances are the dude will still have a decent time by virtue of getting to have sex. There’s not a pressure placed on women to be “good in bed” because of this. Men on the other hand are under extreme pressure to not only be good in bed, but to be better than previous men the woman he is sleeping with has been with. 

There’s a reason why media portrays the simple words “I had better” to be devestating towards men. Because there is a level of pressure to be the best fuck of whatever woman you’re sleeping withs life, because a lack of sexual skill is an indictment on your masculinity.

There’s also physical standards which are much harsher on men than women. For women, the harshest standard is to be in shape. Which is something in pretty much everyone’s (barring disability or disease) control. Nothing else is really asked. Sure some men have preferences but there’s a reason why we men joke that “all boobs are good boobs”.

This is not the case for penis size. There’s a pressure to be an adequate/bigger size? Why because the ideal penis size is [significantly bigger than the average](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558040/). Since penis size cannot be changed, men who do not fit the ideal size have to know that they will be less sexually satisfying than their partners previous lovers. As for “vaginal size”  I feel that it’s a pretty common sentiment that when a guy says a woman is “loose” the automatic assumption is that the guy has a small dick. If a woman says a guy has a small dick, it’s taken. At face value.

Men are under pressure to perform above and beyond whereas women really aren’t. Men don’t talk about sexual experiences with their friends other than “we fucked”. Women discuss everything so a man’s sexual flaws are going to be shared."

1.  I live in Turkey so I am already paying a 180% automobile tax that is used to build the roads and shit so no my tax isn't going to that.
2. Turkey, isn't safe at all, I am a business owner and I hire my own security since I know for a fact if I got burglarized police wouldn't come and even if they did they wouldn't make any arrests.
3. Although we have universal healthcare, public hospitals in my country is shit, so I never go to any of them.
4. The country didn't give me an environment to grow my business either, only does imports and we had to pretty much pay people unofficial bribes to deal with government affairs.
5. The government doesn't use tax money to subsidize food/water/energy etc. either. Everything is expensive and paid 100% out of my pocket.
6. I am paying 40% every year because it is pretty hard to avoid taxes (tax avoidance and tax evasion aren't the same)

The only thing the government does is bribe people into voting for them and pile up an ever growing pile of weapons so they can be stupid about their foreign policy.

I don't think I am unique in my situation either, people are like we should do socialism and taxes are actually good but in reality other than a few western countries, people don't get shit back from their government and even in those countries the services are pretty shit compared to how much they are paying. An average US citizen pays over 21K USD a year in taxes and what do they receive in exchange? Fucking nothing. Most people only pay it only so that politicians can be fucking stupid and spend it all on bullshit."

1,2023-10-15,Cmv: women have an easier time pursuing a career based on their interests,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178hud9/cmv_women_have_an_easier_time_pursuing_a_career/,changemyview,"The choice of a career is a fundamental decision in an individual's life, one that is influenced by numerous factors including personal interests, societal expectations, and partner preferences. While both men and women face unique challenges in their career paths, it can be argued that women often have more freedom to choose careers based on their interests. One intriguing lens through which to examine this is by analyzing partner preferences, where men typically prioritize attractiveness and fun, while women often seek partners who are stable and goal-driven. This difference in criteria reflects a broader societal context that allows women to pursue careers that align with their passions, even if it may not be the most lucrative option. 



When exploring partner preferences, a common trend emerges. Men, on average, tend to prioritize attractiveness and fun when describing their ideal partners. Women, conversely, often mention stability and goal-driven attributes as significant criteria. This discrepancy in partner preferences is indicative of societal expectations and reflects a broader understanding of gender roles in relationships.





The emphasis on partner stability rather than wealth provides women with the freedom to pursue careers that genuinely interest them. Since men tend to prioritize other qualities over financial success, women may feel less pressured to choose careers solely for monetary gain. This is a crucial factor in explaining why women might feel more comfortable selecting careers based on their passions and interests.



The fact that women, on average, prioritize stability rather than wealth also implies that there is less societal stigma attached to women who choose lower-paying careers. Women who choose fields that do not yield substantial incomes are less likely to face judgment from potential partners. This lack of judgment creates an environment in which women can explore professions that align with their interests, even if they do not offer high salaries.



The contrasting partner preferences can be attributed to long-standing gender norms and societal expectations. Historically, men were expected to be providers, while women were expected to be caretakers. Although these traditional gender roles have evolved, vestiges of these expectations remain. Men are less likely to be judged for not meeting traditional ""provider"" standards, while women are often praised for their other qualities, such as nurturing and supportive attributes.



It is crucial to note that these patterns are based on averages and do not represent every individual's preferences or experiences. People are diverse, and their partner preferences and career choices can deviate significantly from societal averages.



The impact of partner preferences on career choices is substantial, affecting not only what careers individuals choose but also their overall job satisfaction. Women who select careers aligned with their interests tend to find greater fulfillment, contributing positively to their overall happiness."

I'm not suggesting that the translation should be word for word, or that it's easy to convey, but rather that it is in fact conveyable. I'm a believer that if a language fails to convey a thought then it is ineffective. The whole purpose of language is to convey all thoughts.

 Also if possible I'd like to stay away from puns. Someone told me recently that It's hard to convey the pun ""a man walks into a bar, ouch"" In other languages because ""bar"" is a homonym. 

The idea of a bar, either the counter with drinks, or the long metal rod, are both objects I can describe. It just happens that the word ""bar"" has many different meanings spelled the same. So of course the joke won't translate to another language where ""bar"" is spelled/spoken/discussed differently.

Another example is gendered language. I agree that say in Hebrew, and I'm sure too in other languages that are gendered, you can discern who you are speaking to just from the suffixes. We don't have direct translations for that in English, but it can be described who we are talking to if only with more words. 

It may not be as effective as a gendered language but it certainly is describable in English"

1,2023-10-15,CMV: Ghandhi’s non violence was not the main reason why the British left India,u/crosssafley,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178j7sf/cmv_ghandhis_non_violence_was_not_the_main_reason/,changemyview,"The prevailing childish opinion that ghandhi through tugging at the heartstrings of the benevolent British overlords, had managed to convince them that Indians had the capacity to rule themselves without the guiding hand of the raj is I believe patently false and is just revisionism to make the British seem less horrific than they really were. 

 My first point is that it wasn’t non violence that eventually got the British to leave but the very real violence and the threat of even more violence that the British had no capability of controlling or combatting that got them out. After ww2 the British found themselves with almost 2 million Indians that had been armed for the conflict that with Japan defeated would eventually turn their barrels towards them. This is evident from the Indian naval mutinies and other mutinies that occurred between 1945 and 1947 and these mutinies did fill the raj with great fear of a rebellion on the scale of 1857. In my opinion if it was non violence that the British had to face they would have stayed for decades longer. The raj administration feared ghandhi not because of his peaceful nature but that by uniting enough Indians  eventually they would unleash bloodshed upon the British. The British knew that the time was up and it wasn’t potential hunger strikes they faced but guns and bullets.

 Secondly and most laughably is the idea that after 200 years of subjugating the subcontinent the British suddenly grew a conscience and was about to let the manpower and resources of its most important colony walk is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. And if that were the case why did they fight to keep its African colonies well after Indian independence? The Indians deserved freedom but the Africans didn’t ?

So in conclusion ghandhis non violent nonsense helped but mostly it was the fact that the British knew that they would be killed to a man if they stayed. And they had neither the money or resources or support to hold india any further. IF THEY DID HAVE THOSE they would have happily kept exploiting India until the return of Jesus, ghandhi would have starved to death before they left."

I never realized other guys really felt that way too until I watched Friends when I was like 10 or 11 or 12. My mom once caught me looking at softcore Lesbian stuff (probably informed my hatred of porn I know have), and thought it was weird and homophobic and didn't understand why I liked it. I have now asked myself why I hold these views and came up with a simple answer: it is porn, but without penises in it. The lack of a nude male, who a straight guy could find consciously appalling or subconsciously threatening,  makes Lesbian porn highly appealing. 

This does not mean I am a sexual deviant. Whenever I interact with Lesbians, I do so with respect and don't sexualize them to their face, behind their back, or in my head.

There's also the question of if something is natural, is it morally defensible? This is trickier. Is murder and rape natural? Animals do it. Is civilization natural itself? Certainly not. Are humans themselves natural? Is life natural? as far as we can tell, life is an anomaly in the universe that sparked because of a random coincidence. Regardless, I think Lesbianism and straight guys liking Lesbian action are both morally defensible because Lesbianism likely won't lead to a societal collapse and a straight guy liking lesbian action will not lead to a societal collapse unless obsession over it is normalized.

I also found out that many straight women like this type of porn, which confused me, but I now think it stems from the sight of female empowerment without the presence/validation of a man."

I’m 22 years old I’ve never dated, had sex, had a girlfriend or ever really been close. I’m getting to a point where I’m starting to accept that it just won’t happen for me and I’m deciding to move on from the stage in my life where I try to find a romantic partner or try to have sex.

As I’m getting older I’m beginning to consider that maybe this was not something ever meant for me. Maybe it was over for me before it even began. I looked at the facts of my circumstances and saw that I did everything I thought was right to do to meet women, and this was when dating was it’s easiest in college and high school. Now im out of those bubbles, and I’ve realized that if I couldn’t make it where it was easy, there’s no way in hell I have a chance when it’s hard. So I gave up. And it’s been a huge weight off of my shoulders for the last few days and I could only imagine how much I would’ve enjoyed high school and college if I wasn’t so constantly depressed over no girls liking me.

So I feel that I was not prepared for this or warned of this possibility. Not by my family, not by male figures I had in youth, not by anyone. There’s bound to be other boys who will grow into men like me just based on statistics, so I feel that it would be helpful for them if the path in life that is destined for them was a little bit more clearly illuminated.

What would this entail? First I would say parents shouldn’t reinforce the idea that one day they’ll date or find a wife or ever be romantically/sexually succeefull. This removes a lot of pressure and doesn’t normalize the idea of finding a partner. I personally am the last male in my bloodline so my last name dies with me. I got a lot of pressure to find a wife and pass down my last name and it’s story to my kids. I was also one of those idiots that for too long believed my mother and grandmother constantly telling me I was handsome (something I would say parents should stop doing). This all gave me a very warped idea of what my future would become.

I would also suggest media stop glamorizing the idea of a relationship as much and start showing some Hollywood depiction of a perpetually single man without depicting him as a loser.

Last in schools, I would think at a certain point, it’s easy to tell who will find romantic success and who won’t. I would bet by 16 it was clear to everyone except me that I wasn’t cut out to find a partner and it just took me another 6 years to realize. So I would say, when you can recognize them and just give them a realistic talk. Like what they did for bad kids who needed to understand the consequences of their actions as they became adults, I would say do the same but for uniquely unattractive boys. 

I think this would help young men just accept themselves better and would at least give them some perspective on their avenue regarding those things.

Like I said I personally wish that I had knew what I know now at 14."

So i've been struggling with this topic for a while now and it's making me angry and i don't want to be angry about something i have no influence on. So i'm looking for someone to shed light on this topic or change my view, so i can be more at peace with my thoughts :). In my opinion: Modern urban architecture is ugly, it's lazy, it's boring, it ruins cultural identities and pushes towards a world where everything looks the same: a universal style. In my head its a really sad thing. So here are my thoughts:  
  
I'm from the Netherlands, known for its pretty canal houses, old warehouses, stepped gables and beautifully decorated facades. Buildings are decorated with beautiful details so that the viewer is invited to look at it, to take it in. The facades of the buildings tell a story about the building.   
Newly build modern buildings (especially houses) in my country very rarely have any details. Most of the post-war houses look exactly the same. You look at it, and everything you see, that's it. Within a glance you have taken in the whole building. There are no details that you can lose yourself in. You are no longer invited to contemplate the beauty of something, because there is nothing to challenge the viewer. All parts of these new, modern buildings have a function (functionalism). Everything is there for a reason. Nothing is added to a house or building purely to make it beautiful. No ornaments, no decorated facades, no playfulness with the masonry, no stained glasses or decorated doors. What you see is what you get. Why did we stop decorating facades and buildings to make it look pretty?   
  
For me it feels like a reflection of modern society: information overload, everything is fast-paced, everyone is lost in their phones, everything has to go quick quick quick. There is no time anymore to stop and look at a building. To see the beauty of it. Why make something beautiful if everyone is just rushing by? Do we even care anymore? It almost feels like everything has to be minimalist. Less is more. Its like handing someone a blank canvas and tell them they have to 'imagine' the painting. There is nothing to challenge the eye or the mind anymore. Modern building looks like a children's drawing: a square with windows and a door. Where is the artistry in that? Its the same for things like public benches or streetlights. Just bland, minimalistic, functional design. Do people not care anymore?  
  
Why is it ruining cultural identity? Because cities around the world are starting to look the same. For example office buildings: They are all boxes of concrete, glass and steel with barely any details. Walking through cities in different continents should feel like a different experience because the architecture reflects culture and history. But we are starting to lose this. Skyscrapers in China, Australia, Europe, South america, Asia... They are all copy and paste. Just look up any modern cities skyline and they all look the same. Just glass, concrete and steel. And all new houses are just not made to look pretty in any sense. Its just copy and paste. Mass production.  
  
 I went to the south of spain a few weeks ago. Known for its blending of cultures and beautiful Moorish architecture: an area that has strong cultural identity. The cities have cute little old towns, but most of the cities now are your plastered with tall apartment buildings that look the same like anywhere in the world. You can copy and paste these buildings to anywhere, Asia, America, India... It doesnt matter. They all look the same. Tall, functional boxes of glass, concrete and steel. If this is the future, why would i want to travel to a different city if im only going to see the same shit?  
  
I also think that in the Netherlands that we are so focussed on being 'progressive' and 'forward thinking' we tend to think that everything that is 'modern' or 'new' is inherently good. For me it feels like we are storming towards a cliff where we lose our cultural identity because its a fcking free for all, there is no harmony anymore. Nothing is added to make a building pretty anymore.  
  
What i also think is a key element is: Harmony. Strolling through and old medieval city and then suddenly seeing a modern, minimalist, misplaced building takes me out of the immersion. Modern architecture doesn't go well with classical architecture. I know its subjective to like modern architecture, but why does it have to be blended into old city centers for example. It completely ruins the immersion.  
  
In my opinion, functionalism is ruining cities. It feels like they (Bauhaus for example) taught us a lie that buildings should be designed based solely on their purpose and function, and when everything comes together, it will be pretty as it is. Well there is nothing pretty about functionalism.  
  
Im obviously writing out of emotion so my argumentation is not the most reasonable. Its not a well written story, its more of a rant. If someone can shed light on this manner, i would greatly appreciate it :)."

Hell if being natural determines whether or not it was right or not then by that logic rape would be okay since nature does it and it happens all the time in nature. All nature cares about if it helps reproduction not weather it not its right or wrong.

What determines if a sex act is right or wrong is the act itself does it harm the other person if so then its wrong. A sex act can be unnatural and be okay as long as it does not harm anyone. I feel as if appeal to nature is a dumb religious argument since anything that god makes is okay according to religious nuts. God put it on earth so it's okay according to religious nuts. There is many wrong things humans also do that is natural such as racism, being hateful, tribalism and many things of human nature itself so being natural does not prove those things are okay."

Clarification: this would only apply to certain power tools, not all of them. Only the ones that would make sense

* It reduces noise and allows for quiet communities. No one actually likes the loud noise produced by power tools, although they may tolerate it 

* It necessitates the creation of new blue collar and labor jobs to account for the loss of efficiency due to the disallowing of power tools 

 * It incentivizes athleticism and physical activity among the general population as many of them will fill these jobs

* It provides employment for non college educated and non highschool educated men. Many might see this as a bad thing but for my purposes it is a good thing

* It is an organic way to provide a wealth transfer from wealthy home owners and developers to wage workers

1,2023-10-15,CMV: Asperger's should not have been merged to create Autism Spectrum Disorder,u/General_Erda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178ro6a/cmv_aspergers_should_not_have_been_merged_to/,changemyview,"I will finish with data backed opinions, but will start with anecdotes: Me & everyone else I know with Asperger's cannot for the life of us interact with cases of Autism, and struggle to interact with most PDD-NOS cases, there are a few situations which resemble this, one time me & my 1 friend (also a sperg) were talking about conflict, and how unusual but mid tactics usually work better than typical yet ""META"" tactics rarely worked, and the little devil we were sitting by just came in as loud as possible (including hitting too) making no real responses to our points & non stop deflecting. Turns out the guy had PDD-NOS, the other time I can think of this is the one time a D&D group accepted a PDD-NOS patient in, and the devil wouldn't obey to the most basic rules, or even sneak in his violations in a clever way, just announcing when he'd break rules & breaking them even when told not to. Utterly impeccable. We never had a single issue with other cases of Asperger's.

Anyways, here's the data that backs up by conclusions in a less anecdotal way.

1- Asperger's Disorder & most of the other mild PDD's cannot be diagnosed under DSM-V standards for ASD ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-014-0016-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-014-0016-7))

2- According to multiple studies (which were condensed into a single overview) Asperger's is distinctive from PDD-NOS & Autistic Disorder of Childhood (among the other 2 merged to create ASD) ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-013-1870-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-013-1870-3)) 

3- An EEG coherence study found ASD fits into 2 distinct clusters ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6375153/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6375153/)) "

It is pretty important to my culture and my mother has a wooden one hanging in the inside of her car. The one caveat of it is that is looks like a swastika (but reflected). Throughout my life, I always thought my mother was foolish for hanging that in her car, knowing what meaning a similar symbol carried in the US, but whenever I told her to get rid of it as people might ask, she told me that if somebody asks about it or causes a ruckus, she would calmly explain to them that it's not what they think it is and educate them on the meaning of the Manja. Now, I find myself agreeing with her. Why should my mother have to give up some part of her culture because Adolf Hitler and his Nazis appropriated and misconstrued it (or appropriated a similar symbol from another culture).

This should not only apply to Koreans, but any culture who has historically revered a swastika-like symbol. We can find ""swastikas"" in Zoroastrian temples, on rock carving on the Arabian Peninsula and Americas, on the tile work of Roman villas, Buddhist, Hindu, and Jainist ritual objects, and in countless other contexts. In NONE of these contexts does it represent hate or persecution."

Since we know that the attacking country has no regard for the lives of the those collectively accused to be human shields, they no longer can be defined as shields becasue they don't provide any protection against attacks. The argument is self defeating.

It's also quite dubious and impractical that all, or even the majority of the civilians killed, were even serving as human shields. The more plausible explanation is that the attackers are actually engaging in a form of collective punishment with little to no regard for civilian lives, than that they're merely trying to take out the others country's government members."

Soon enough, young kids caught on to what adults were doing and would call you gay as an insult or bullying tactic - I remember not even knowing what a gay person or sexual orientation was but finding myself painfully curious to know what I was being called and why it was so bad - being so young (4-5) and having to find out that people around me were essentially mocking a part of me which essentially relates to sex and sexuality was hard to digest - looking back, it was in my view a form of sexual harassment - people, even adults, are essentially prompting you to envision a concept of two men being sexually intimate in the most graphic form, and then to conclude that that's somehow wrong - their bullying causes one to envision intimacy, this is child abuse at the least.

As much I now do identity with the LGBT community, my childhood, sense of innocence and character development, along with body image, took years to remedy - I found a piece of my childhood stolen, as my existence throughout grade school was extremely sexually charged - with day to day being concerned about how I could appear 'less gay' to avoid harassment.

I find it shockingly hypocritical that 'conservative' and outright homophobic people accuse the LGBT or queer community of being hypersexualised, when they themselves foster the very environments where said community's identity and value to society is reduced to their orientation or identity, and this becomes a point of fixation."

https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/s/BOWsicuwtm

As a Polish-Canadian, I lean sympathetic to occupied people such as the Palestinians. In videos I have seen, Israelis abduct kids, cut down crops while grannies sob in despair, and slaughter innocents. From my uninformed perspective, Israel finally got its ass kicked for this brutality—a vengeful uprising against an oppressor. My wife is outright cheering, as her origin country considers Israel a loathesome enemy. Meanwhile, I feel rather lost.

From the human perspective, both the attacks by Hamas and Israel’s retaliatory bombings are despicable. War is a nonsensical atrocity to me, as I am a pacifist, and harming citizens is most heinous of all. If disputes are to be settled violently, let the killings be limited to murder-pawns (soldiers) sent into battle. Alas, once you lose enough humanity to kill a fellow human being, anything goes.

So back to the main question: why is Palestine suddenly the villain for attacking Israeli citizens *just as Israel keeps doing to Palestinian citizens?* What differs? What pieces am I missing in this political puzzle?

To those who answer—clarity in your words is appreciated. I try my best, but Autism does make it trickier to decipher slang and vague innuendos.

Somewhat off-topic: strange that Reddit removed a comment of mine for ‘violence’, when in that sub, I stated my support for the dissolution of Israel. By dissolution, I meant replacing this forcibly-created shape on the map with a multiethnic, multifaith country. How is this a violent concept? I advocate for peace.

**DISCLAIMER: Critics of Israel are often accused of antisemitism, thus I must clarify: I couldn’t care less if Jews, Muslims, Whites, Asians or any other group were the victim or aggressor. My issues with Israel are focused on political / military actions, not ethnicity. I have Jewish blood in my veins and intense grief towards the Holocaust. Israel does not equal the Jewish people in my head.**

Only reason WW3 didn't happen was because some European countries had some backbone against the Ukrainian propaganda and called them out on it. 

With Israel there is no country that is going to call them out on their propaganda, because all the Western countries are pretty much in the pocket of Israel. Like for example, holocaust denialism has been criminalized in pretty much all European countries. There is no other historical even you aren't allowed to express skepticism about, other than the Jew-Nazi-holocaust, which tells you all you need to know about the power of the Jewish lobby in the West. 

I'm not saying the holocaust didn't happen, just that criminalizing the criticism of the official story violates free speech, which is exceptional in the European laws especially regarding historical events.  

I'm neither saying that what we have just heard from Israel about the current Hamas attack was propaganda - just that if it was propaganda and a staged false flag operation, we would never know, and hence since there is no one who is able or willing to call out Israel if they do decide to BS, Israel can just say and do what ever they want and the West will just take that as the truth, which means that if they don't win this conflict fast and easy they will say something that obligates US to get involved and then after that happens, Iran and other superpowers will get involved too and we have our WW3, and hence I think WW3 will happen inside a year from now, since the pieces are moving so fast right now in this conflict.

2) Women are punished for cheating (death, prison). 

3) Babies & children are beheaded.

4) Airstrikes on innocent civilians.

5) Anyone who does not believe in their views are murdered. Viciously. 

First off, I think cheating is wrong. Being from America and someone who actively dated a lot in my college years A LOT of girls cheat. Pretty common. While it sucks and I don’t agree with it, should it be punishable by death?

Comparable to Ronaldo allegedly being sentenced to 100 lashes for hugging a fan?? How backwards is that?!

Should babies be beheaded or brutally murdered..?

From my understanding BOTH the Palestine and Israel murder innocent women & children. 

I believe all these celebs and “media” are dumb and beyond tone deaf. They are acting like this is a random terrorist attack when both sides for DECADES have brutally murdered each other.

When you take a look at their laws you’ll realize that in America both sides would be cancelled. What would be the outrage in America for women who cheat being murdered? Or babies being beheaded?

To be fair, I don’t agree with the Palestine mass attack. Which killed tourists and innocent people. I just think we need to be clear that both sides and their ideology is wrong."

Once a child born, if both biological parents want to give the child up for adoption, that can happen. However, as soon as one biological parent decides that they feel like keeping the child, it then becomes the responsibility of the other biological parent to support the child financially, even if the latter never wanted the child in the first place. 

Since the overturn of Roe v Wade, the topic has gotten even more complicated. Before Roe v Wade was overturned, it was easy to say that opting out of parenthood via abortion is allowed, so both the mother and the father should be allowed (if they want to) to opt out of financial responsibility to an already born child. Now that a lot of states have passed laws that would compel a 13 year old rape survivor to remain pregnant with her brother’s baby, one could argue that allowing men to opt out of financial responsibility to an already born child would be unfair to women. However, consider this. Many states still allow abortion. Ned Lemont is enacting policies to make it it easier for women who live in red states to travel to Connecticut to obtain abortions.

Imagine a woman, who resides in Connecticut, gets pregnant. Imagine her baby daddy wants her to abort and she gives birth anyway just to spite him. This woman could have had an abortion if she wanted to. Just because she choose not to, does that make it okay or fair for the man to be on the hook for child support for a child he never wanted in the first place? I say absolutely not.  

I would like to discuss two hypothetical scenarios. Both of these scenarios take place in a geographic location where abortion is illegal, except when the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life. 

Scenario #1: 

A woman ends up pregnant. She goes to the man who inseminated her and informs him of the pregnancy. He says to her the following sentiment; 

I am not ready to be a father. If we lived somewhere where abortion is legal, I would galdy pay for the procedure and drive you to and from that procedure. Since that is not an option, I say we give the child up for adoption. I would gladly pay for the cost of prenatal healthcare and the cost of maternity clothes. 

Now imagine the woman keeps the child. 

I think that the woman who just gave birth has a right to keep the child if she wants to. She should not be forced to give her child up for adoption. I see nothing wrong with that. 

Because the mother chose to keep the child in lieu of giving the child up for adoption, should the father be compelled by court order to support the child financially? I say absolutely not. 

Scenario #2: 

A woman gets pregnant. She wishes that she could have an abortion, but she cannot. During pregnancy, the hormones are so bad that she considers suicide. 

After giving birth, the mother gives the child up for adoption. 

The father would be first in line for custody of the child. I see nothing wrong with that, it makes all the logical sense in the world. 

Should the father be able to take the mother to court and demand child support payments from the mother? I say absolutely not. 

In my mind, the father in scenario #1 and the mother in scenario #2 should not be held financially responsible for a child they did not want in the first place. 

I advocate for a policy that would allow both men and women to opt out of  financial responsibility to an already born child. If this policy is enacted, no matter what the abortion laws say, any man or woman who does not want to be financially responsible for a child would not need to be. If the child support laws for which I advocate where a reality, even if abortion did not exist, forced financial responsibility to an unwanted child would not happen. Under the policy that I wish for, even if forced child bearing where a real thing, forced responsibility to an unwanted child would not be. 

Here is how it would work. 

Once the child is born, the mother can sign her name on the birth certificate if she wants to raise the child. The father can take the issue to court and demand custody of the child if that is what he wants. If the mother wants the father to be in the child’s life, there is no need to take the issue to court in the first place. If the father wants nothing to do with the child, he can sign some paperwork stating that. When he does this, he surrenders his right to sue for custody. 

If the mother would rather not be responsible for the child, she can give the child up for adoption. If the father wants the child, he is first in line for custody. However, because the mother never wanted the child in the first place, she is not responsible for child support.

If you disagree with me, I must ask you two questions. 

Question #1: Do you believe that abortion should be legal? 

If you are pro-choice, that means that you believe that a woman should not be forced to remain pregnant if she does not want to. I agree with that. If you are okay with a woman opting out of parenthood via abortion, how can you not be okay with a woman or a man opting out of financial responsibility to an already born child? 

On the other hand, if you are pro-life, then that means that you feel that a fetus has a right to life that takes precedant over a woman’s right to choose. By advocating for policies that force women to remain pregnant AND also advocating for policies that would force a woman to be financially responsible for children they do not want, you run the risk of a woman (or man) being forced to support children they cannot afford. No good can come from forcing people to be financially responsible for children they cannot afford. The most common reason why women choose abortion is inability to support a child financially ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html?fbclid=IwAR2oz-iVf0-dyikpG76GTpqgq3SjBepTdiOp8oGDojNPUZiH8tot-Ciy8n0 ). Therefore, allowing women to opt out of financial responsibility to an already born baby will make women more likely to choose life. 

Question #2: What if both parents want to give the child up for adoption? Should they be allowed to give the child up for adoption then? 

If your answer is no, why? 

What if there is a couple out there looking to adopt who would really love the child? How can you possibly claim that two people who do not want to be responsible for the child and who probably do not love each other should be forced to be responsible for the child, when there is another couple who would gladly take on the responsibility of caring for the child? 

If, however, your answer is yes, giving the child up for adoption is okay, provided that both biological parents want that, then why does one parent wanting to keep the child suddenly make it the responsibility of the other parent to be responsible for a child they never wanted? 

Let’s go over some of the most common counter arguments. 

Argument #1: You should not be having sex if you would rather not be a parent.

Three things. 

Imagine if you ate a raw hamburger, got a tape worm as a result and you were prohibited from taking medication, because you should not be eating raw meat if you do not want a tape worm. 

If you believe that people who have sex without the desire to reproduce are irresponsible, why would you want them to be parents? 

What about rape? Imagine a man rapes and impregnates a woman. Imagine a statistically less frequent but still equally as reprehensible hypothetical where a woman rapes a man and gets herself pregnant. If the woman, who ends up pregnant from rape, wants to give her child up for adoption and she is forced to be financially responsible for the child, is that fair? If the man is forced to pay child support to the woman who raped him, is that fair? If you do not believe that an exception should be made for rape, then the argument from personal responsibility does not apply. If, however, you believe that an exception should be made for rape, how would this work? Do you have to prove that you where raped before you can be exempted from financial responsibility or do we start with the assumption that you are telling the truth and then exempt you from financial responsibility until and unless it is proven that you are lying? 

Argument #2: Having an abortion is different, because it exempts both biological parents from parental responsibility. 

What if the father actually wanted the mother to abort? If you feel that forcing a woman to give birth would be a bad idea, then it follows logically that it would not be fair to force the father into financial responsibility for a child he did not want. 

This is when someone replies with the argument…

Argument #3: Abortion is about bodily autonomy, not opting out of financial responsibility. 

The difficulty of injustice if forced child bearing as it compares to the difficulty or injustice of forced child support is not the point. The point is that, as long as abortion is legal, those who can get pregnant can consent to sex without consenting to parenthood. Therefore, anyone who supports mandatory child support on the grounds that a man consents to parenthood the second he consents to sex should be in favor of an abortion ban for the same reason. 

It is basic logic. 

If Sally likes all fruit, and apples are a fruit, then it follows logically that Sally likes apples. 

If the government has a duty to make sure no one is ever able to consent to sex without consenting to parenthood, and the legality of abortion allows certain people to consent to sex without consenting to parenthood, then the government has a duty to ban abortion.  

Argument #4: Having an abortion severs ties to a potential child, not an actual child. 

I would like to make two points, one with regard to a mother opting out of parenthood and one with regard to a father opting out of parenthood. 

What if the mother lives in a geographic location where abortion is illegal? What if, despite the legalty of abortion, she did not live near an abortion clinic? If she would have had an abortion where she able to, but she was not able to, then it would not be fair to force her to be financially responsible for the child once the child is born. 

What if the father wanted the mother to abort and she gave birth anyway? It would not be fair to hold the father financially responsible for a child that would not have been born had he had his way. 

Argument #5: The child has a right to financial support from both biological parents. 

This logic confuses rights with best interests, they are not the same thing. It is in your best interest to have a functioning vehicle, a good job and an attractive significant other who wants to have sex everyday, at least I am assuming so for the sake of this hypothetical. The fact that those things are in your best interest certainly does not mean that they are rights. If it were the case that a child is entitled to to financial support from both biological parents, then all of the following things would be illegal:

\- A mother leaving the name of her child’s father off of the child’s birth certificate. 

\- A woman giving her child to a safe haven. 

\- A mother failing to take measures to inform the father of his child’s existence and seek financial support. 

\- A single woman using the services of a sperm bank to become a mother. 

All of these things are completely legal, therefore financial support from both of your parents is NOT a right to which children are entitled. 

Now to the best interests argument. What if, in a particular family, the parents won’t let their son do ballet, because they are gender role conformist who hold the misguided belief that ballet is only for girls? Should these parents lose custody of their son?

Argument #6: Forcing the non-custodial parent to pay child support is the only way for the child’s basic needs to be met. 

I would argue that Universal Basic Income could also help the child’s basic needs be met ( https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc?si=KwkFzskM39zLeO7A ). If you are not in favor of that, there are certain welfare benefits that could be given to the custodial parent to help support the child. 

Argument #7: It would not be fair to force the custodial parent to chose between being a single parent and giving the child up for adoption. 

Mandatory child support payments would force the non-custodial parent to choose between paying child support for a child they never wanted or going to jail. How is that fair? 

Argument #8: This would result in an epidemic of single parents.

Receiving child support payment from the non-custodial parent does not make a single parent not a single parent. 

Even if it did, so what? Where in the constitution does it specifically prohibit anything that would cause the rate of single parenthood to increase? 

Argument #9: This would place an undo burden on the tax payers. 

It make logical sense for every single tax payer to have as much financial responsibility to the child as the non-custodial parent, because every single tax payer had as much say in the decision (of the custodial parent) to keep the child as the non-custodial parent did. 

Argument #10: If the child is not your’s, you should not be responsible for it.  

This is the argument against use of government benefits to meet the child’s basic needs.   
I disagree. The fire department is funded by tax dollars and every full time employee has to foot the bill for that whether they use the services of the fire department or not.

1,2023-10-16,"CMV: The current grading system used in most schools is toxic, inflated, counterproductive, and wrong.",u/Ben_Shapiro_SexUrMom,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178xu0y/cmv_the_current_grading_system_used_in_most/,changemyview,"I am currently a high school senior. I have attended schools in 4 different countries, including schools in 2 US states, and this is a problem common to every school I have attended. Note that these schools are mostly private schools, so this may not be a problem that all schools face.

In the past 12 years, I’ve gone to school every day with the expectation that, when I receive my report card at the end of the year, I get an A in every subject; anything else would be considered inadequate. 

This is not because I am a particularly gifted, hard-working, or generally “good” student, because I’m not; rather, grades have been artificially inflated in a way that makes an “A” not mean anything anymore.

Getting an “F” denotes that a student failed a class. Getting a “D” means that a student just barely passed. Yet getting an “A” has become the expected, “default” grade. 

For example, in my current math class, at least 80% of students have at least an “A-“ in the class. This is true for almost all of my other classes as well.

There are a few reasons why this is bad, and I’ll go through them one by one.

First, this gives significantly less meaning to grades. Sure, students who aren’t the smartest in the class will be happier than in a less inflated grading system, but almost everyone in a class gets an “A”, that’s not fair on the students who are actually at the top of the class. In the college admissions process, for example, admissions officers will be looking at so, so many students with an “A” in math; even though their abilities and performance vary wildly, they end up with the same grade because, again, “A” has become the default grade that teachers give any student who does anything beyond the bare minimum (AKA 80% of students). This makes it more difficult for top students to actually separate themselves from other students, at least in terms of college applications.

Second, this creates artificial standards that aren’t exactly healthy. Sound familiar? Yeah. In my opinion, this is similar to the whole “perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards” thing from the Barbie movie. Because of the previous point, students are forced to “grind it out” to receive an “A+”, which can mean hours and hours of extra work because, well, perfection is hard. To understand the material and get an “A” is one thing, but to memorize it to a degree that you make virtually no mistakes and receive an “A+” is just counterproductive to a student’s learning experience, in my opinion. This creates an exceptionally toxic environment. A student should be happy and proud to get a “B” in a class that they don’t excel in. Instead, getting even an “A-“ is seen as inadequate.

And last, well, this is sometimes just straight-up lying. Letter grades correspond to percentages for a reason. “Curving” a test, for example, is one way to artificially increase an entire class’s grades. I don’t think these practices are fair or honest.

To conclude, we should really normalize “B”S and “C”s as the “default” grades. 

TL;DR: Grades in many schools are heavily inflated, create unrealistic expectations and unnecessary pressure, and make it unfair on students who actually excel in a class."
1,2023-10-16,CMV: I shouldn't talk about my problems to other people.,u/ATXBookLover,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178xyge/cmv_i_shouldnt_talk_about_my_problems_to_other/,changemyview,"Hey y'all, I've been working on developing closer friendships and being more authentic with people - but I can't seem to shake the feeling that I shouldn't talk about my problems, even with people I'm close to. 

I strongly suspect that I'm thinking about something important the wrong way, but I'm not entirely sure where I'm heading astray in my thought process. Hoping to get some help here in changing my view. 

Here are my reasons why I don't really open up to people about my problems: 

1. I don't want to be a burden on others. 

* Everyone always says, ""It's not a burden!"" But realistically, I'm very aware that other people already have their own problems to deal with and I can see the toll that listening takes on people. For example, my mom is the person that people in our family bring their problems to. And I can clearly see how sometimes it stretches her to her emotional limit to take it all in and be supportive. I don't like the idea of ""using up"" someone's emotional resources when I don't *really* need to. 

2. People like cheerful, positive people and dislike depressed, anxious people. 

* I know that everyone does the whole rah-rah thing for mental health now, but in practice, most people just want to enjoy good vibes with happy people. Otherwise, depressed, anxious people would be swarmed with offers of friendship and social support, right? The truth is even people who are accepting and kind towards suffering friends still *prefer* to hang out with less draining buddies. 
* On the one hand, you could argue that I should only want to be friends with people I can be my ""whole"" self around. But on the other hand, practically speaking, it helps me with my depression to have friends, be invited to things, and know that people enjoy my company. I don't feel like it would benefit my mental health to alienate the handful of friends I have right now. 

3. My problems are genuinely too dark for most people to understand or relate to. 

* I'm not trying to sound edgy, but I have a combination of CTPSD and PTSD due to some abuse I suffered when I was younger. After doing a lot of EMDR therapy, my symptoms have gotten a lot better. But the memories, feelings, and thoughts I have at my low points are way beyond what most people would expect to hear even in a ""vulnerable conversation between friends."" It kind of messes with people's heads just to hear about it. 
* As a result, the most I can really say is something vague like, ""Well, I've been feeling a little down recently."" But that's such an understatement that it basically feels like I'm lying, so why not just go all the way with the lie and tell people I'm fine? What would the difference even be? 

4. I already have a therapist I can open up to if I need someone to really be honest with. 

* As a result, I feel like the mental health rationales for seeking support from friends and family don't apply, since I already have that base covered by a professional.

5. Opening up to people makes me feel worse, not better.

* As a result of all of the anxieties listed above, I generally end up feeling worse after I open up to friends or family, not better. Plus, most people just aren't great at saying helpful things - even when they have very good intentions. It just doesn't seem like I get anything particularly good out of the whole process, even as I recognize that being vulnerable with the people I love would probably be a good/healthy thing? 

That said, I do really think I need a different perspective on all of this. Because I've started to get the sense that people are on to me. So many people have told me this year that they ""feel like I never open up."" And my ex and I even broke up partially over this issue.

1,2023-10-16,CMV: Taylor Swift is the best artist of the 21st century and is on track to become the best artist of all time.,u/DesperateForYourDick,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178y962/cmv_taylor_swift_is_the_best_artist_of_the_21st/,changemyview,"Note that here, “best” means most popular, most successful, most famous, etc. I am in no way saying that her music is the objective best music to listen to or anything like that.

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical “basic white girl music” (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won’t get into here), but way too many people deny that she’s an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it’ll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I’m a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don’t see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title—I for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. “Taylor Swift” is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for “stereotypically popular singer”. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time."
1,2023-10-16,CMV: Feminism should not exist,u/elektroncloud,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/178yfiz/cmv_feminism_should_not_exist/,changemyview,"Feminists will claim that feminism is an ideology that desires nothing but social equality for the sexes. From there any potential criticism of feminism seems ridiculous: how could any sane, respectable person in the twenty-first century oppose equality between men and women? 

The problem is that is not what feminism at its core actually is. Defining feminism as ‘social equality for the sexes’ is like defining conservatism as ‘a desire for society to be prosperous’. Well I’m sure self-described conservatives want society to be prosperous (how could anyone not?) but conservatism is clearly more than the vague and abstract values which it purports to support: it holds a specific understanding of what constitutes prosperity and what policies will bring that state about. It’s the exact same situation with feminism - the principle of the social equality of the sexes isn’t so much a concrete definition as it is an effective marketing slogan to pitch to potential voters. Feminism implies more than that. 

So what do I think feminism is? I think it’s no more than advocacy on behalf of women’s interests, whatever they’re perceived to be. Feminists doesn’t seem very interested in establishing women on an equal plane so much as they want to uplift and empower women even if the end result is an advantage over men. The opposition to putting women in the draft is an example of this. Regardless of whether you support the draft or not, if it exists then a genuine supporter of social equality would want men and women to be treated equally under it. Feminists criticizing the draft as a whole rather than holding a position on the treatment of men and women under a draft is like a conservative responding to the controversy of same-sex marriage by saying they do not support any government recognition of marriage instead of answering whether they believe homosexuals should be able to marry should it exists. Feminists will also not consider certain people feminists even if they do support gender equality for their positions on transgenderism or sex differences or capitalism which again supports the idea feminism is more than just gender equality.

With that being said I have 2 criticisms of feminism and why it shouldn’t exist.

1. Most of the agreeable aspirations of feminism can be justified without referencing feminist concepts at all. Domestic violence need not be seen as a gendered problem for the state to act upon it. Sex discrimination can be opposed generally.

2. Framing issues as uniquely women’s issues invites a dismissal of other issues and creates oppression olympics. Since feminism only focuses on women as the name implies (a brief offhand remark about how the patriarchy hurts us all as a persuasive tactic doesn’t change this) any attempt to discuss other issues like ones men have either get lower priority or are disregarded completely because they’re seen as an attack upon women or derailing women’s issues. This breeds hostility between the sexes and prevents a nuanced understanding and solution to gender issues."

I have no issue with people *changing* their opinions or applying nuances to it, but to only selectively apply it when convenient is something I just cannot accept.

To be a hypocrite is to forgo the right to an opinion on the matter you are being a hypocrite about. If you are considering nuances, they should be objective and with proper reasoning, not that you will make exceptions simply because you know someone and are close to them, or feel that applying the opinion at that moment will harm you as well.

If you make an exception, it should be clear what that exception is based on and should be applied to all it is logically applicable to.

People who act hypocritical on a matter do not genuinely care about the matter and only speak to their own benefit, whether to gain out of it irl or to garner social points online.

There is no way to enforce them not voicing their opinions, that has no slippery slope effect, but I just feel this way.

CMV by convincing me people can be hypocrites but still genuine. Note that someone changing their opinion is not hypocrisy in my view. People can change their minds even in the moment. Isn't that what this sub is about? To me hypocrisy is to still hold the same opinion (not even considering a nuance to it, it is just absolutely unchanged), but choose to not apply it because of convenience."
1,2023-10-16,"CMV: If Palestine was ""free"" it would be a ethno-fascist hellscape, and a single-state solution is only marginally better",u/FFIFISISHFISHFISH,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17925sm/cmv_if_palestine_was_free_it_would_be_a/,changemyview,"When you ask, fundamentally, what the hordes of people in the west protesting against Israel really want for the region,  most will, when pressed, eventually acknowledge they dont actually want their public demand of a two state solution along 1967 borders with land swaps.   This is actually pretty explicit from the ubiquitous protest chant ""From the River \[Jordan\] to the Sea \[Med\], Palestine must be free"", which clearly requires the conception of Israel to cease to be.

So what they are really arguing for is a single state solution.    Let's be incredibly generous and give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that the single state is created without genocide, and protects both Jews and Muslims (and Christians, Atheists, even, gasp, apostates) equally.   What happens? 

Well, since the 650-700k Palestinians left their homes in what was the Mandate of Palestine (at least partly at the urging of the Arab state neighbours massing troops on the borders in anticipation of invasion), a lot of time has past and now there's upwards of 6m+ refugees and their descendants (fun fact, when counting Palestinian refugees for official purposes only patrilineal descendants count- score 1 for the patriarchy!  Possibly a further 2-3m more people can claim descendance from Palestinian refugee antecedents).

Assuming a decent proportion of this number exercised a right to return or a right to citizenship, combined with existing populations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israeli Muslims, would give the new unitary Levant state a significant Muslim majority.

But what would that population be like?   Well, polling of Palestinian refugees is pretty clear on what they would vote for - hardline Islamists, most likely full jihadis.   The charter of Hamas (approval rate: 60%) expressly calls for driving the Jews into the sea, and half of Gazans actively support this goal.  Several more extreme groups have higher approval rates (Lion's Den: 75%)

In a two state solution, its obvious that the Palestinian state would elect a government extremely hostile to their Jewish neighbour.  Anyone who says different is deluded; their argument usually goes ""Palestinian hostility to Israel is Israels fault - if the occupation ended they'd have no reason to continue to be hostile"".   This ignores how Jews are treated in the world's Muslim majority states. Try being an apostate or Jew in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.   Even Turkey.   It's hard to imagine a Palestinian state, whose population would be in large less educated, more hardline, poorer and more religious than those of any of those states, would somehow fulfil the progressive wet dreams of the pro-palestine protesters.  Much more likely any Palestinian state would be fun by violent religious extremists that make the Taliban look liberal.   Women would not be educated,  Polygamy (which is legal in Gaza) and corporal punishment would be commonplace. Apostasy would be punished by death (as it is expressly in 9 other Muslim majority states).   Borders with Israel would need to remain locked down to avoid constant violent clashes.  Travel between Gaza and the West Bank would have to remain extremely tightly proscribed (unless someone builds a tunnel!)

In a single state solution, you import all these problems into a state which needs to represent the interests of two utterly dissimilar populations.   It's hard to imagine how this would work, perhaps some kind of strictly enforced apportioned (but not proportionate) representation, constitutional safeguards with supermajority requirements etc..  Even then, it's likely there would be distinct local government (perhaps a federated republic?) of different Jewish and Palestinian areas of the state, and this is where things would get sticky.    Would the federal state be able to mandate Israeli-style anti discrimination laws, e.g. based on gender,  or for example outlawing Polygamy, when this is a normal part of life for many Palestinians?   How would Shariah law, which Palestinians are governed by, interact with this Federal law?   

Ultimately as Palestinians who have emigrated return en masse and (due also to much higher birth rates), the small Muslim majority in the unitary state would become an overwhelming one.  Constitutional safeguards are suddenly increasingly under threat and federal politics will remain deadlocked between two totally mis-aligned factions.  Pressure to take from the wealthy former-Israelis and give to the poor former-Palestinians would be overwhelming.  Public conflict between sectarian groups would be inevitable.   Under these conditions, its hard to imagine the state's safeguards remaining intact.  Likely, civil society would break down.

There are no easy answers, but I've yet to hear a cohesive vision from anyone that sounds like something any Israeli should support, even if they also want (rightly!) an end to all illegal settlement in the West Bank and the deplorable conditions in Gaza."

1,2023-10-16,CMV: I don't like presidents being elected by the public,u/Aravinz_HD,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1793rih/cmv_i_dont_like_presidents_being_elected_by_the/,changemyview,"I personally think that presidents should not be elected by the public. It's not that I'm against popular elections, far from it but I personally really think, popular elections should be limited to referendums and legislative (parliament/congress/assembly) elections. My reasoning for this is that:  
  
A: Popular elected Executives are only accountable to the populus itself and lack accountability within the political system  
  
B: You elect an individual more for the person's popularity, charisma and what they say they are going to do if they come to power (agenda), rather than prior political experience or knowledge of the individuals personality and character.  
  
Reasoning A: A directly elected president is as I said only accountable to the general public and the general public mostly lacks the means to ""check and balance"" the president. I personally think presidents should either be voted on by the legislature or candidates should be approved by some political body, before being put in front of the populus to be elected. The elected president can than either be independent of the legislature or not, it doesn't really matter. But this whole stuff adds a level of accountability to a presidents actions.  
  
Reasoning B: Directly elected presidents are being elected mostly for reason mentioned in B, which means anybody with enough support in the populos can become president. In comparison indirectly elected Head of Governments are elected by people who already know the given candidate is and what he is capable of doing which a typical presidential candidate can not claim, because the average person does often times not know much about a given candidate which can lead to people who are unfit for office being put into office anyways.  
  
Sure, there are also issues with chief executives being elected indirectly, but I personally think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages..."
1,2023-10-16,CMV: Still advertisement for charities is useless in educated countries.,u/CCCyanide,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1793rz7/cmv_still_advertisement_for_charities_is_useless/,changemyview,"To clarify, by ""charity advertisement"", I mean advertisement that directly suggests donating to a given charity. For example, I do not consider tutorials on how to make such a donation advertisement, since it actually has an informative purpose. By ""still"" advertisement, I intend to exclude documentaries (which I don't really consider advertising, but might be mentioned by some) on suffering demographics the charity aims to help.

I have a hard time seeing the serious purpose of advertising for charity. In the context of such advertising, all viewers of the ad can be sorted into three demographics :

\- Those who **don't have enough money** to donate to charities. Regardless of whether they actually want to donate to charity, these people won't do (for obvious reasons).

\- Those who **have enough money to donate, but don't want to**. These people will most likely not be convinced by an advertisement. I don't seriously see anyone seeing a call to donate and say ""*Ah, yes, I should definitely give away the spare money I have*"".

\- Those who **have enough money AND already want to donate**. These people probably are already donating, or seeking for a charity to donate to. Either way, they already know how to do so.

The only eventual demographic left for charities advertising their role to cater to, would be people unknowing of the issues existing in the world, which charities hope to solve. This niche, at least in educated country, is most likely filled by both education and media.

That is why I consider most advertisement for charities to be a waste of time and money. CMV."

You can't change what you're born with fellas ... our lady compatriots have a million surgical options to choose from if they don't like their body ... but guys ... there's no magic surgery for a bigger dick . There is a guy in Japan tht injects silicone into ur junk to make it fatter but thts a 50/50 shot ur dick won't work . 

Your dick is your dick . There is a woman for every guy , I believe tht... although I also believe that most women WILL blow off a guy with a average dick for a guy with a huge dick . That says more about the fairer sex then it says about us tho guys. It's not necessarily tht u might be inferior , u most likely aren't... what's actually happening is a whole host of societal expectations that have told the object of your desire that large peni are better than dicks that are made for their vaginas . 
Sadly alot of women can't handle a 10 inch dick , no matter how much they try , it'll always be painful . They might want the right to say they can take whatever a man can dish out , its a front for most women. Real size queens arent as prevalent as you think... but the good news for all my average dick brothers ... most guys with big dicks cant/don't know how to fuck anyways... they're like supermodels in bed ... they lean on having a big dick like a model leans in being attractive . They don't actually kno how to use it . How would I know this ? I talk to humans about their problems.  

One example;
I knew a chick tht had to have emergency surgery to repair her vaginal walls because she thought that splackavelli with the footlong dick was gon take her to the moon ... turns out he didn't give a fuck about her Insides cuz what they don't tell u about a dick tht big is that half of its gon stay dry during sex ... if you wanna get tht wet , u gotta go deeper , and deeper is not good if you're not trained to do porn . Cue an impromptu ER visit . 

If you think u have a small dick be happy , bigger dick guys might get more pussy because of the novelty ... but very few of those guys even kno wat they're doin outside of makin people go ""wow thts big"" . If you don't buy wat I'm sayin , talk to most women.... you'll find they each have a goldilocks dick , the one thts just right ... the perfect penis ... and don't be shocked when u learn its not 10 inches lol , it's more than not gonna be closer to what you got .

Let me explain why.

Not everyone with discriminatory views, such as racism and sexism, is acting upon it. Yes, I know that not everyone acts on hate itself, but it seems like people who are racist and sexist also find the people that they are not discriminatory against annoying. For example, a random man has sexist views against women. They treat men better than women. Though they also sometimes act rudely against other men, they are more likely to be rude to women. You can see that sexism functioned as a catalyst because it was easier for that man to be rude to women than to men.

In conclusion, discrimination is 75 percent a catalyst and 25 percent the hate itself. Change my view as to why it's more likely the hate itself than functioning as a catalyst."

Not for a lack of wanting to, but because I don't feel like any candidate that's run in my country has earned my vote. 

I end up in a lot of heated debates with people over this, everyone says its my civil duty to vote but my argument always lies in the fact that I haven't liked any candidate and think they would all do bad things for my country or are just generally untrustworthy. 

In response, people always tell me ""well you should have just voted for the least worst one out of all of them"". To which, my response is, that is down right unconstitutional. 

Here's why. Imagine you go to eat dinner somewhere. When you are given your choices for dinner you get, rotten beef, rotten chicken or rotten pork. Now you have to pick one to eat for dinner. 

No matter which one you pick, you will get sick, so naturally you would say, ""where's the non-rotten options"", so your told, ""there is none, now pick the one that will get you least sick and then next time, hopefully there won't be any rotten options"". 

If everytime you went out to eat and you were given terrible choices and no good ones, you would eventually stop wanting to go out. 

Now that's how I feel about voting. Everytime an election comes around, I spend hours looking at all the candidates, primary ones and other registered parties, they all don't align with me at all. I think they all would make bad choices and have a bad view on how to fix things in general. 

A lot of people believe in required voting, which seems countwr productive to me as I feel I shouldn't have to vote for a candidate in which I think sucks and would do bad things to the country. 

I should be allowed to protest the terrible selection of candidates by holding back my vote untill someone worthy enough comes along. I respect everyone's right to choose their candidate and if they like one of the candidates, they should place their vote on that candidate."

Chemical fertilizers: the chemical in chemical fertilizers are simple molecules, such as ammonium, phosphorus or potassium. Plants do not care if these molecules come from the soil or from a chemical plant. They are identical, and all organic food does is force farmers to use inefficient methods of obtaining the same molecule.
Pesticides and herbicides: it’s a myth that organic food does not allow any pesticide or herbicide use; the yields would be ridiculously low. Instead, farmers are forced to use “natural“ pesticides. The problem with this is that while chemical pesticides are specifically engineered to maximize lethality against bugs while minimizing harm done to humans, pesticides made using naturally occurring substances, such as certain plants, are just as lethal against humans as they are to bugs. So if an organic farmer sprays enough pesticide to equal the bug-killing ability of a non-organic farm, produce from the former will be much more harmful against humans.
GMOs: the idea that GMOs are inherently dangerous against humans only exists in the mind of the public, not the scientists. 93% of scientists in the field believe GMOs are harmless to humans. This is because we’ve been significantly altering the genes of our crops since the beginning of agriculture, and GMO is simply a more targeted and precise way to do that.
Almost all pro-organic arguments can be summarized as “natural things are good for us, and artificial things are bad.” This is simply not true."

I'll start with an example. I'm gay and if someone assaulted me because I was gay I would want them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I do not believe their motivation for the attack has any relevance nor should it affect the punishment. If it did, I think that I would not be being treated equally. Equality is being treated equally. I also don't believe these laws, at least initially, were created with any malicious intent but I think they were naive. At a time when certain minority groups were not being treated equally  under the law, the answer should have been to ensure that wasn't the case. Not by creating new laws which I think is something for lazy politicians and sometimes a totalitarian leaning government.

More specifically, hate speech laws (more of an issue in the UK I believe) are the most dangerous, deplorable Orwellian laws introduced in a country that is one of the pioneers of the west. For a Crime to be purely based on the victims interpretation (ie whether they were offended) opens the door for a censorship that could equal North Korea. More people were convicted in the UK last year for things they said than Russia. If this doesn't terrify you I'd love to know why.

Everyone complained, and you know what you got in response? Double unskippable ads. Everyone complained, and now what did we get? Double unskippable ads with adblock detection.

So really, what do you think is gonna happen while you all sit here and circle jerk about missing the old YouTube?? Nothing.

If any of you actually cared and actually wanted change, then you'd be advocating to your favorite YouTubers to *at least* upload somewhere else too. There are already established YouTube alternatives, think Vimeo, Dailymotion, Peer Tube, DTube, etc, but you don't. You sit here, cry, and pretend like that's gonna do anything. If the community here spent a fraction of the time they spend whining on advocating or even brainstorming/coming up with another site, this wouldn't be the issue.

But nowadays, a lot of talk of gender equality revolves around **perception**, which is very different. *""Why is it that when a man does \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ society reacts \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ way, but when a woman does \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, society reacts \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ way?""*

This sort of ""gender equality"" is impossible to achieve, because you can't get people to see two different things as being the same.

When a man is violent towards a woman, for instance, it will always be perceived in a more severe light than vice versa, because of men generally having greater strength or advantage vis-a-vis a woman.

Men's sports will generally be more popular and closely-followed than women's sports, due to men generally being faster, stronger, more aggressive, etc.

The fact that men generally commit more crimes than women will also result in men being perceived in a more suspicious light than women in many situations. 

The fact that most people prefer a relationship in which the man is taller than the woman will also mean that a short man will face more disadvantages than a short woman, and a tall woman may face more disadvantages than a tall man.

The list of examples would be too long to provide in a thread here, but men and women are not ""equal"" in the sense of having equal characteristics; there are dozens of things that are different. You cannot expect society to view two different things as being the same, and hence, gender equality will always only be a superficial ""equality"" at best that consists of men and women being given roughly the same rights but never being *perceived* as being the same.

1,2023-10-16,CMV: Offensive penalties in the NFL should be more directly comparable to defensive ones,u/200um,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179dayq/cmv_offensive_penalties_in_the_nfl_should_be_more/,changemyview,"tl:dr Penalties on offense should result in loss of down more often as well as for egregious plays such as dangerous hits or preventing interceptions/sacks, should involve loss of possession.

&#x200B;

American football (NFL) has become more offense-centric with rule and meta changes. Many of these, especially with regards to player safety, are large improvements over the even more pronounced CTE inducing practices of the sport. With this aim to protect players (mostly offensive ones) and encourage offense to generate more entertainment, the system of penalties has not adapted and exacerbates the difficulty of playing defense in the modern era.

&#x200B;

Most offensive penalties simply result in a repeat of play with a yardage penalty (holding, false starts, offensive pass interference, etc). A personal foul or unnecessary roughness penalties do this as well for often dangerous plays, but are only yardage penalties.

&#x200B;

If a player on defense commits a dangerous penalty (such as personal foul or unnecessary roughness), the team not only loses yards, but the opposing offense is granted a free first down. Many other defensive penalties also grant first downs such as holding and the largest penalty that is called is generally defensive pass interference where a defensive player interferes with an opposing player trying to catch a pass: the penalty is a first down at the spot of the foul or near the goal line. Note that the exact same play by a player on the offense is only a loss of 10 yards and essentially a ""redo"" of the down with that penalty. 

&#x200B;

A more equitable and safer scheme would lead to at least loss of down for dangerous acts by players on the offense or loss of possession at the spot. Given how hard it is to cover receivers in the modern era and the massive use of push-offs with no calls, offensive pass interference should result in loss of equivalent yards and a loss of down. 

&#x200B;

If refs are more reluctant to call penalties on the offense, then implementation of separate refereeing body independent of the league should be instituted (probably should be for all sports leagues) with contracted independent from both players, ownership, and their interests and any contraventions, said sports league must immediately repay all public funds for all stadia and operations at inflation rate.

Israel gave back the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for peace, a wildly controversial and unpopular move at the time. 

When Israel left Gaza in 2005, it forcibly removed Israeli citizens to let Gazans govern themselves.

 When the goal is great (peace, or statehood), hard and tough decisions must be made. Compromise must be made. After WW2, the Germans lost parts of historic Germany. Like it or not, for peace to exist, when one party starts a war and then loses, they lose leverage and negotiating power and must make compromises if peace is truly the goal. It's been that way throughout history.

Palestinians need to let go of the notion that resistance means the eradication of Israel and that generations of refugees can return. It's simply a fairytale dream at this point. Too many Palestinians, in my opinion, have been brainwashed to believe that this is a feasible outcome -- hence the celebration/support for any and all type of resistance, no matter how gruesome and inhumane.

Meanwhile, in the current conflict, I've yet to see a reasonable answer as to what Israel should do instead of attacking Hamas? What other country would allow another entity to break through, murder over 1000 civillians, and then take back over 150 hostages? If the line hasn't been crossed now, then how many more massacres will be needed before people realize that Hamas' stated goal is to destroy Israel?

What is a proportional response to an entity like Hamas who's objective is to eliminate Israel entirely? Am geniunely curious if there is an alternative to war because I sure hope there is.

Am open and interested in counterpoints to the above!"

Getting advice from a stranger with no qualifications, speaking based on a few paragraphs of text, is more likely to hurt than to help. 

About the qualifications, I think that even if a layman is in a healthy relationship, they are probably not aware of what makes the relationship healthy. It’s better to get advice from someone who can draw from the world’s collective, rigorously tested understanding of how relationships work, i.e. relationship science. 

Aside from professionals, close friends could be a good resource because they have intimate and extensive context about you and/or your partner. A brief description of your relationship gives nothing close to that understanding. Redditors are bound to make wrong assumptions about your relationship in addition to probably having wrong ideas about relationships in general.

Personally, my girlfriend [22F] and I [23M] have both used Reddit for advice about our relationship of almost two years. Neither of us has been in a relationship before. Every time I’ve posted people have told me that either I’m a bad person or she is, or that we’re just not compatible and should break up. Currently we’re happily together but those posts have caused plenty of fights. 

That said, I’m wondering why other people post on relationship subreddits and whether it’s helpful to anyone. I’m interested in talking about it."

Fast-forward, and most built environments around the world - save for pockets of Southern and Northern Europe (I'm sure there are more examples), remain built to antagonize human life (and all other life forms...) as much as possible:

**Pedestrianism remains architecturally criminalized** \- I say this from the comforts of suburbia, but every so often I'll leave the SUV for some wild fun in the city, where crossing an intersection may require a sacrifice to the traffic gods, and pavement and bicycle lanes lead to nowhere and end abruptly. Most built environments appear more suited to our technology and machines than to our own quality of life, despite years of activism and awareness around livable cities - a lot of new new developments will shockingly echo the same car-centric, anti-pedestrian design, bulldozing green zones and all other organic life to make room for endless lanes of asphalt.

**Densification** \- especially in climate zones which are most suited to outdoor living, walkability and/or cycling year-road, is executed so poorly that it makes the environmentalist in me cringe. Imagine living in a climactic paradise like LA or Istanbul, and still having to drive everywhere! 

Most new construction and urban redevelopment/revival I've seen throughout my travels is not at the least reflective of the scholarly findings and research trends around livable cities, which we've had available for years, if not decades, at this point. 

It is my view that politicians, nimbyists, j-walkers and Karens continue to suffer disproportionate blame for urban planners' lack of imagination and ambition. I understand that most redevelopment and infrastructure projects are subject to political and corporate corruption - but lets not pretend that our Engineer overlords are not in bed with those same demons; they are not using the understanding and research at their disposal to built a better world, fast enough - doing quite the opposite tbh.

I'm someone who enjoys learning about science a lot, and am interested in how the public views it. I'm a 4th year (MEng) student of bioengineering, privileged enough to be studying it at two world-leading universities, where I've worked closely with scientists as part of research projects and on-site internships, in different two countries whose populations have different cultures and attitudes towards figures of authority (I believe science can be considered one). I don't know much about politics. My post goes into politics a little (without explicitly taking any side), but if you find my arguments to be weak there, you're probably right and I haven't entirely made up my mind. I'm quite clear on the core arguments though.

**The current state of genetics and related scientific research**

You may be aware of CRISPR \[1\]. It's been only 11 years since Dr Jennifer Doudna and Dr Emmanuelle Charpentier used it in biotechnology, modifying the gene code of a live organism for the first time, for which they won the 2020 Nobel prize. The media generated a lot of noise on this discovery (8 years too late), before naturally moving on to other things, as usual. This left the general public with some vague overhanging idea of what science is doing, with zero retained knowledge on how or why it works or what scientists' plans are with it going forward, or what's already been done. What's happened between then and now in biotechnology?

* 2018: Chinese rogue scientist He Jiankui illegally edited the genes of three developing human babies. The babies were delivered and are still alive and healthy. After being released from prison, He was reluctant to admit what he did was wrong, saying only that he acted too quickly \[3\].
* 2020: Singaporean restaurant ""1880"" became the first commercially successful and economically competitive place to serve lab-grown meat as part of the food they served \[7\]. The technology used to grow the meat involves stem cells, as well as originally using a serum derived from animal blood although animal-free solutions have since been developed. Gene editing is also used to improve various properties of the meat. In Europe, progress on lab-grown meat has been a little slow due to the legal hold-ups regarding whether it can be imported or not, but many well-funded startups exist to develop the technology further. Lab-grown meat is projected by some to be a global solution to the emissions caused by traditional meat farming methods.
* 2020: Once the coronavirus had had its genome sequenced by Chinese scientists, an mRNA vaccine was systematically developed by Pfizer in just two months. After a colossal effort, the vaccine was tested and rolled out worldwide, forming the and only proper defence against the exponentially growing pandemic. Despite the success, a relentless barrage of whining followed, with only a fraction of it actually making an attempt at making any sense, and mostly was about the perceived authoritarianism with which the pandemic was handled.
* 2021: Russian scientist Denis Rebrikov continued He's research, this time without implanting the embryos to avoid the backlash. Both He and Rebrikov have good intentions, with their stated goal being to remove harmful defects such as susceptibility to AIDS and deafness, although they are clearly quite happy to skirt around ethical guidelines in order to attain these goals.
* 2022: CRISPR was used in consenting adult humans (*in vivo*) for the first time, with good success \[8\].
* 2022: An effective form of personalised medicine, CAR T-cell therapy, was also developed to treat cancer.
* 2023: *In vivo* CRISPR technology was approved for use in medicine to treat sickle cell anaemia.

In the near future:

* Dendritic cell vaccines are being developed that could be a vaccine against cancer \[10\].
* After 8 years of debate, the gene drive technology designed to wipe out an entire species of mosquito across all of Africa has gained the approval of many regulatory bodies, with expectations to be used in the wild by 2029. Within this period, the technology has been optimised and refined to kill the insects even faster \[5\]. The scientists have suggested that the African public should get the final say on whether or not it gets used \[6\].

**Why does the public need to care about all this?**

With all that as background, we can see how quickly things are moving, and possibly, how little of this progress has been widely publicised in an easy-to-understand way. Most of it sounds good - treatments for diseases, transforming the agriculture industry, so what's the problem?

I view science as a provider of tools. It does not, and cannot, tell us how to use them. In a democracy, the people get to decide who makes the rules, which in turn determines what is done and what is not, and who can do things and who cannot. But the current level of science education, capacity to identify misinformation, and sensitivity to conspiratorial thought, of the general public, is quite frankly, utterly atrocious. Should an entity with ill intentions gain some degree of power, it would be quite easy for them to craft various narratives, propaganda and smear campaigns to convince the public that their usage of biotechnology is legitimate and in the public's interest, regardless of what's actually going on. As an example, suppose a the leader of a relatively authoritarian political party in a science-illiterate wanted to eliminate a population of a certain ethnic minority. They could pass legislation in which all babies are screened for a particular defect, and if it is detected, they are given a vaccination to prevent it manifesting later in life. The ""vaccine"" contains a recombinant retrovirus that can be guided to infect germ cells (sperm / egg cells or their stem cell priors). ""It will render the germs inside you unable to spread!"", they could say, and be technically correct, compounding the confusion on an already poorly-understood topic. On detection of the recombinant gene at later medical screening, the person will be told that they have an extremely dangerous mutation, and for the good of society, must not be allowed to reproduce. Within a few generations, a selected group of people don't exist any more.

This scenario is completely made up by me. But it shows how, by abusing science, this could plausibly be done if the climate is right. This was an example of biotechnology being considered good when it's actually bad, but equally dangerous is when the intentions are good but are being effectively smeared as bad. Without a baseline understanding of what people are even talking about, it becomes a game of who has the best propaganda. In some countries, the fruits of the miraculous delivery of the COVID vaccines were almost nullified entirely by the misinformation surrounding it.

Not everyone has to be a PhD biologist for this to have been avoided. By carefully and responsibly drawing attention to the times in the past where science *has* been mishandled, we can ensure that everyone knows how to spot the signs of when something isn't adding up, and have those in charge (who need to be trusted and trustable) investigate further and take action, exposing the lies, and disarming the liars. With basic understanding of how our bodies really work and what's going on, as well as an improvement in media literacy and critical thinking skills, propaganda of this variety would never even be able to take root, let alone spread. The ideological polarisation and the resulting blow to community cohesion is reduced, and everyone is better off as a result, and the perceived overbearing authoritarianism is no longer a concern.

**How to solve the issue?**

I think scientists should engage more with the people, governments and politicians in order to make themselves more visible to everyone, especially those who work in interdisciplinary fields, to maximise approachability. Maybe a requirement for becoming a political public figure could be to attend an annual seminar on some select topics in science and technology, covering the established facts as well as what remains uncertain, if anything. It would have to be made interactive, engaging and relatable to a wide range of people in order to stick. I think this is good balance of placing the responsibility between the public and the scientists. 

Efforts should also be made to convey the fact that science is a dynamic, changing field and the more cutting-edge you go, the higher the uncertainty. Not only that, but also an appreciation that the science learned in school is a simplification of reality, in which scientific models (where we make approximations in order to match observed data without necessarily knowing the underlying mechanisms at play) are presented at a level suitable for the education level of them, not of scientists. The catchphrase ""it's basic biology!"" comes to mind here; you can probably guess what issue I'm alluding to there (it's now banned in this sub). This could be done with changes to the national curricula and better paid science teachers, where more experienced educators with actual knowledge of these subtleties can deliver this information to the classroom where I think it's being unfortunately left out for one reason or another.

**Thanks for reading**

I look forward to discussing this with the community, regardless of any background in this topic of course. Apologies for this being so long, I originally intended to make this only a few paragraphs but more and more things came to mind. Regardless of how it goes, this has been a nice exercise in essay writing, which us STEM students have a reputation for being pretty bad at, and must also improve if we want to communicate with people!

**TLDR:**

* The public does not currently have a good enough understanding of science in general.
* It is becoming extremely easy to create, disseminate and amplify misinformation on social media.
* A bad actor could fund a propaganda campaign that promotes a dangerous use of biotechnology, while smearing the experts who speak out against it. If the public doesn't know what either of them are talking about or just doesn't trust scientists anyway, it becomes a numbers game: who's louder?
* The actions of a few could therefore have extremely devastating effects on everybody, including those who saw the danger and tried to stop it.
* A basic level of science education, particularly in biology/genetics, would immunise the people who elect such people against falling for misinformation, while also helping to think critically about separating science from authoritarianism.

But it makes sense to me that the more localized a law is and the more precise the culture is that it pertains to, the more powerful it should be.

I've seen this occur when it comes to restricting rights but never the opposite. A particular city near mine in CA completely banned smoking. You could not smoke a cigarette anywhere in that city, period (other than your own home).

I'm not trying to turn this into an abortion CMV, but it's something I've been engaging on a decent amount lately and makes for a decent example. I'm personally pro-choice, but I'm also pro-choice about being pro-choice. There do exist women who would vote no on abortion, and they should have the right to a voice on the matter instead of there just being a blanket law that applies to everyone.

So you might have a state that outlaws abortion but then a county within that state that has no problem with it and legalizes it for that county. And then you might have a city within that county that doesn't want abortions performed there so it's illegal in that city.

I think this model would make every citizen much more powerful, give them much more of a reason to engage in the political process at the local level, and greatly enhance their ability to change things that actually pertain to them.

Accidents are one thing, like if someone drove around the gates at a railroad crossing or jaywalked in a freeway, but crime is done with volition on behalf of the perpetrators.  Whether it be a woman ""shouldn't have worn that miniskirt"" if she was raped, someone ""shouldn't have gone to that bar known for broken noses"" if a drunkard assaulted them, or the six million jews having ""gone like sheep to the slaughter.""  It's one thing to say in advance that it's unwise as a preventive measure to go to certain neighborhoods, lock your door, be vigilant, etc. but in hindsight it's a horrible way to talk about a survivor.

However I think that attributing certain risk behaviors to vulnerabilities isn't wrong when someone is trying to realize that they may be worrying too much.  For instance, I'm planning a trip with my friend to Chicago.  I've been there countless times and my brother went to college there so I know first-hand that it's not like the way FOX News makes it seem, which is often a dog whistle.  My friend expressed some concern, but I pointed out how the media does not paint a very good picture and it's only a few neighborhoods that are unsafe, and we can easily avoid those especially at night, but even those aren't ""war zones.""  Furthermore, I pointed out that while it's not recommended to walk alone at night in those areas on the South Side as muggings happen, being killed is extremely unlikely in our case.  The reasoning I gave is that while the murder rate may seem very high, the vast majority of it comprises turf battles, so as tourists unaffiliated with gangs we are not at high risk.  I did go on to clarify that in no way, shape, or form do those gang members deserve it.  Especially since turning to such organizations isn't a decision people make casually; they don't see a choice because of low wages and terrible education.  So someone being killed for selling drugs on the wrong turf isn't any less egregious than someone being killed out of the blue while walking down the street, but with that said, it's a reason to not worry so much about visiting Chicago.

I also feel that it's important to address it in discussions on gun control.  I support regulation and requiring gun owners to be responsible, but I take issue with the way the media creates a culture of fear about mass shootings.  The epidemic of gun violence in America cannot be denied, and it's fair to say that Congress is part of the problem as they put lobbyists before constituents and that gun control would reduce it, although I think it's important to emphasize that the ""someone walks into a school/church/mall/etc. and shoots from the hip unprovoked"" shootings are still extremely rare in the scheme of things and are just the tip of the iceberg.  When people from other countries see America as a land of death with nonstop shootings and are deterred from visiting, they don't understand that if they are neither in a gang nor an abusive relationship nor have suicidal tendencies, the likelihood of them being shot when visiting America looks nothing like the overall rates of gun violence.  Part of it is also that discussions of gun control need to be holistic and not focused on the rare but sensationalized massacres like Sandy Hook, and even I am skeptical of the idea that AR-15s are at the crux of the problem.

Let's apply my logic to sexual assault on college campuses, where discussions of victim blaming often take place.  Suppose a girl was about to go to college, and her parents knew that she isn't interested in partying, drinking, or dating.  If she is worried that she won't make it through college without rape, the parents could re-assure her that the ""1 in 5"" statistics cover all forms of sexual assault down to a single improper touch, but more importantly that most of the violence occurs in the context of alcohol, frat houses, or intimate partners.  How very rarely is someone attacked in the archetypical way by a stranger hiding in the bushes by the quad while the victim was walking back to their dorm from the library.  So they tell her it's important to be vigilant but not to fear the whole campus.  Furthermore, I believe it's imperative that they make it clear that even if she does engage in those ""unwise"" choices like going to a frat party, she never waives her rights and that they will always be supportive of her.  And that if she has friends who are taken advantage of while under the influence, to be sympathetic to them and never lecture them about how they shouldn't have had a drink, as they've suffered enough.

I wonder if my line of thinking is part of the problem or perpetuates the ""perfect victim"" narrative."

1,2023-10-16,CMV: Americans Have Made Up their Own Definition of Racism,u/Juuggyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179lf5r/cmv_americans_have_made_up_their_own_definition/,changemyview,"""White people cannot experience racism"" has been a trending statement on social media lately. (Mainly trending in the U.S.). As an African-American myself, it hurts me to see so many of my fellow Americans confused about what racism truely is. I hate that it has come to this, but let me unbiasely explain why many Americans are wrong about white people, and why it's a fact that anyone can experience racism.

First, what exactly is racism? According to Americans, racism has to do with white supremacy; it involves systematic laws and rules that are imposed on a particular race. Although these acts are indeed racist, the words ""racism"" and ""racist"" actually have much broader definitions. Oxford dictionary (the most widely used English dictionary on the planet) defines racism as:

""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized."" (- 2023 updated definition)

In short: racism is prejudice on the basis of race. Anyone can experience prejudice because of their race; and anyone can BE prejudice to someone of another race. So semantically, anyone can be racist. And anyone can experience racism.

So where does all the confusion come from? If you ask some Americans where they get their definition of racism from, they'll usually quote you one of three things.

1. Webster's Dictionary (definition: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race)
2. Cambridge Dictionary (definition: policies, behaviors, rules, etc. that result in a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race)
3. It's how our people have always defined it.

Here is the problem with these three reasons

1. Webster's dictionary is an American dictionary; it's definitions are not globally accepted by other English speaking countries. How one country defines a word does not superceed how nearly every other country on the planet defines it.
2. Although Cambridge is more popular than Webster, Cambridge has been known to have blatantly wrong definitions; for example: ""sexism,"" which Cambridge defines as ""the belief that the members of one sex are less intelligent, able, skillful, etc. than the members of the other sex, especially that women are less able than men"" By this logic, if a man were to say: ""Women are so emotional."" or ""Women should spend most of their time in the kitchen."", this man would not qualify as sexist. Since he is not claiming women are less intelligent, able, or skillful in any way.
3. Regardless of how you, your peers, or even your entire community defines a word-- you cannot ignore how the billions of other people outside your country define the same exact word. If there are conflicting definitions, then the definition that's more commonly used or accepted is the right one; which unfortunately is not the American definition.

Another argument some Americans will say is that ""White people invented the concept of race, so that they could enact racism and supremacist acts upon the world.""

It is true the concept of race was invented by a white person around the 1700s. It is also true that racism by white people increased ten fold shortly afterward; white people began colonizing and hurting many other lands across the world-- justifying it because they were white and that their race was superior. Although all of this is true, this does not change how the word ""racism"" is defined by people alive in 2023. The word ""meat"" in the 16th century ment *any solid food*. Just because that's the origin of the word doesn't mean that people abide by the same thinking today. People today define meat as ""the flesh of an animal"", which is a much narrower definition than it used to be. The reverse can be said for racism, as racism nowadays is a much broader term, and can be experienced or enacted by any person, even if they aren't white.

I hope everything I've said has cleared the air about racism. I've tried explaining this to many of my peers but many refuse to listen-- likely due to bias. I refuse to be that way. And although I myself am a minority and have experienced racism throughout my life, I am also aware that the word racism is not *exclusively* systemic. And I am aware that technically speaking, anyone can be racist."

1,2023-10-16,CMV: WNBA should adjust court dimensions/proportions to allow the game to be faster and more exciting,u/JeeAlPalmdaddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179o09h/cmv_wnba_should_adjust_court/,changemyview,"My opinion is simply what the title says. My reasoning stems from the compromise to make the official WNBA game ball smaller than the official NBA game ball.

If that compromise was made and agreed to, then why not adjust the rim height, 3P arc length, FT line distance, court length, and other attributes to a proportion that makes sense to energize and push the flow of the WNBA games to be more exciting than they are now.

I am a BBall fanatic and love watching all variations and skill levels that is offered to me as a consumer of the sport. With no prejudice (can’t stress this more), comparatively WNBA is relative to the speed of a NJCCA game. WNBA needs to be faster and more exciting by increasing, for instance, Dunking and/or Fast Breaks that stay fast.

The reasoning for keeping all but one key attribute seems foolish and a disservice to the fans watching. The average height between a WNBA player versus an NBA player is not small; neither are wing span, hand size, or quickness between the two leagues - in fact it is quite large.

To that note, the WNBA ball was made smaller to accommodate the smaller hand size and probably other attributes I am not immediately thinking of. They understood by making the ball smaller, the players would have more handles/control, smoother and more accurate shot, and far less fumbling for a ball designed for the NBA.

The speed of the game might end up being its demise. Comparing the speed and excite to an NBA game would be unfair and probably impossible to duplicate; with that said, I find WNBA comparable to High School Basketball or, a little more so, to NJCCA.

The physical differences in player attributes between the leagues will not change quickly. Which means, the game will slowly die watching WNBA players, as a league, struggle to perform smooth fast breaks, quick release shots, dunking, etc. If they lowered the rim and decreased the 3P Arc, those 2 alone would add an element of excitement that can’t be achieved using smaller & slower players on an NBA league court. 

I believe the logic that went into making the official WNBA game ball smaller should be applied to more of the specific key attributes a WNBA basketball court currently has. 

NOTE: I understand that trying to argue anything pointing to an opinion is tough, but this is an honest question from a true fan of the WNBA. I really want it to thrive and grow, but I feel it is not feasible with the current attributes that define a regulation WNBA court. I also intentionally left out gender from this argument even tho the leagues are gender specific - but it isn’t relevant to my stated opinion and suggestion. at least that’s my view 😊"

Positing the existence of such metaphysically queer entities amounts to an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. But the only apparent evidence for this claim is our (so-called) shared moral intuition, which is plausibly explained by evolution, without invoking moral facts.  Plausible evolutionary explanations are available for sympathy, empathy and disgust, for
norms of reciprocity, fairness and justice, and for moral belief.

People weave through traffic, cut people off, and go 20 miles over the limit in areas with heavy foot traffic. The sociopathic disregard for others' safety, because people can't consider that there are humans inside the metal boxes in the way of their manic commute home, represents true criminal negligence on a scale that gives me deep anxiety daily. Drug dealing, robbery, theft, many other crimes are serious, but are so much less a danger to society than your average dad barreling through the lanes of a busy road, three feet behind the car in front of him. If there was really any care for intervening on the scourge of society, police would be revoking tens of thousands of licenses a day across the country. People would wise up fast, and start treating driving with the same respect as doing open heart surgery or sprinting across a living room with a butcher knife in their hand.

I can't get over how little people consider the destructive power of operating a vehicle and how little society and police do to intervene on the norm of driving like absolute maniacs. How can so many people have so little regard for the most dangerous thing we do every day by a wide margin?

1,2023-10-17,CMV: I accept antinatalism and view reproduction negatively,u/skatelandkilla,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179qqof/cmv_i_accept_antinatalism_and_view_reproduction/,changemyview,"It seems self-evident to me that being an organism, especially a human organism, is an undesirable thing, compared to not being anything at all (note: I do not mean the already living ought die, but rather when comparing a world where organisms are born with a world in which they arent, I view the empty world as preferable *for the ones who would be born*). We have perpetual physiological needs that *hurt* when they aren't met. We have the capacity to suffer and to cause others to suffer. We are at constant risk of all manner of contingent harms that could befall us. We are born in dependence and ignorance and must acquiesce to pre-existing heirachies as we develop and gain independence. We must compete within societal structures (for housing, money, jobs, partners, seats on the train), which we depend upon for our survival and comfort. 

Fundamentally, I see human life as struggle and antagonism, with no higher meaning or purpose. I developed in the womb through biological mechanism, instigated by sexual desire devoid of contraceptive planning because my parents *wanted* a child. Now, I must struggle to secure my bodily needs and comfort (or suffer greatly), all while aging towards an inevitable death. Life has its goods, sure, but these all occur in a structurally negative context that even the best of lives can not compensate for. Nobody escapes aging or death, and everybody suffers personal tragedies or struggles.

Now, there are more formal arguments for antinatalism having to do with the inability to acquire consent from the one who will be born (generally we think we ought get consent in cases where harm will be imposed - or at least have good reasons to assume consent on someone's behalf (as occurs in emergency situations)), or the lack of need or desire from the ""unborn"" to be born and to be benefitted from trading off life's harms for its goods, or the inherent risk of fostering upon someone a life in which the tradeoff of harms for benefits is not guaranteed to 'obtain' - and the consequences of this can be absolutely horrific (a life not worth living, abject suffering, suicide, etc). There is also a misanthropic argument for antinatalism such that there is simply no guarantee ones offspring will not cause large amounts of harm to others.

Generally I accept these arguments as valid and they seem like good reasons for not only myself but all of humanity to stop reproducing. But, for me at least, the arguments intuitively appeal to me because of my *already* existing negative stance towards the worth of life. And so that's where CMV comes in - if you ask the typical ""man on the street"" what he thinks of life, he's bound to cheer it on and celebrate birth and consider his life a gift, or at least not be so negative as to advocate human extinction. And so there's a doubt here in myself that perhaps I suffer from some sort of affective deficiency which precludes me from ""smelling the roses"" so to speak. The thing is, I don't think so and think this philosophy is perfectly rational and moral. Essentially it takes a hippocratic stance towards procreation of *First, do no harm* and I do not see a particularly good reason to disregard this, especially considering nothing is harmed by not being born.

And so I view procreation as *wrong*. It unnecessarily and irresponsibly inflicts a structuraly negative condition (human embodiment, with all it's inevitable and contingent harms) for no reason other than parental desire or simple biological mechanism. Human suffering could end in a single generation if we simply stopped hurtling people into a world fraught with danger, needs, and inescapable death. How can reproduction be justified? Of course in reality it doesn't need to be, and bodily autonomy trumps all - I am under no illusions that the world will voluntarily walk hand in hand into extinction. But that doesn't mean it isn't morally right for us to do so. 

And yet there's a nagging doubt - maybe I just lack the ability to sense what makes the human condition so desirable?"
1,2023-10-17,CMV: Modern medicine and parenting styles are damaging the gene pool,u/sagiterrible,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179sfa1/cmv_modern_medicine_and_parenting_styles_are/,changemyview,"I’m going to try to state my case two ways, and then I’ll explain.

To try to put this scientifically, modern medicine and parenting styles are allowing for the proliferation of traits that would not be selected-for in nature, or even would have been a hundred years ago.

In layman’s terms: we’ve put the bumper pads on the bowling lane of humanity, and there’s a lot of folks making it to the end that would’ve ended up in the gutter. That sounds kinda harsh, I suppose.

To healthcare: we now have the ability to save newborns with genetic disabilities and accommodate those disabilities until adulthood, which gives them the ability to pass those on. With the exponential rate humanity is growing, that means a large portion of society is going to continue to be focused on accommodating those disabilities. (I want to note here that I’m one of those babies— genetic heart condition. Yay.)

To parenting: helicopter parenting means that children are protected from dangers that, frankly, would’ve removed a lot of those conditions from the gene pool. The scene where Ray Charles loses his brother in the movie Ray comes to mind.

In nature, there are various mechanisms for remove the weakest of the species from the gene pool for the overall strength and survival of the species. The slowest baby spiders don’t make it out of the web, while the runt of the bird’s nest gets pitched out of it. We have removed most of those from ourselves. 

A lot of times you hear, “You didn’t hear about ADHD when I was a kid.” Medical advancement aside, it’s probably because a lot of those kids didn’t make it very long. “You didn’t hear about peanut allergies back in my day.” True, you just never figured out that little Jimmy and Jiffy don’t mix.

On top of that, you have instances like Flint, Michigan, where you have lead in the water stunting the development of young brains, which is bad for society overall, and you have food insecurity, where malnutrition in young children leads to an average loss of ten IQ points and an increase in aggression. (Specifically talking about America here.)

Now, this started as a just a thought in my head and has rattled around until it became a belief. In an effort to save every individual, we are likely weakening the species as a whole. With oncoming climate disasters coming, plus how a large population allows for the spread and evolution of diseases, I don’t think we can handle our species becoming weaker in this manner. However, I’m open to hearing arguments and evidence that refute my position.

Edit:

So I believe I’ve read through all the comments so far, or at least all the ones that have been directed at me. I want to thank the people who took the time to thoughtfully and intelligently respond; I much appreciate the input. I can see that there are a couple flaws in my logic but, overall, my view hasn’t changed. I have a couple deltas to hand out to people who, after thinking about it, have made some pretty good points, and I’ll be getting to those shortly along with a few more responses.

If you’re reading this for the first time and you’re initial reaction is to post, “This is eugenics and you suck,” go for it. You won’t get a response or a rise out of me, because the other people who’ve posted that have done nothing towards meaningfully moving the conversation in any direction. Directly misinterpreting my position to make me out to be something I’m not isn’t going to work. You do you, though.

1,2023-10-17,CMV: The state of Israel is the wet dream of intersectionalists: an indigenous population that takes back their land after thousands of years of oppression and diaspora. The only reason it's being despised is because of its general political orientation and their contemporary alliances.,u/throwfoolishra,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179ywxz/cmv_the_state_of_israel_is_the_wet_dream_of/,changemyview,"I'm purposefully ignoring the geo-political context that gave rise to the state of Israel, the interference of European states in the area over the past centuries, and the crimes and negligible conduct of its government.

The core of the argument is that I see a blatant incoherence. Many speak for reparations, land restitution, and substantial aid to be given to the indigenous populations of the Americas. What happened in their story is effectively a large-scale genocide that nearly erased, and in some case completlely, destroyed their culture and way of life.

What the Israelites went through isn't in any way different.

I'm fully aware that before the Jewish populations settled in the land, it was mostly occupied by the Canaanites, which were effectively of the same origin as the Israelites (their God, for one, was called El), and for all intents and purposes that's precisely where most Israeli tribes came from before their diaspora into Egypt. The land was constantly object of contention between ancient Egyptians and the Hittites, who turned the area into a wasteland with their seemingly never-ending conflict. In the end, the Hittites collapsed, and Egypt lost interest in the land. The Canaanites ended up mixing with other invaders, the Philistines. When the Israelites came, even with their lesser resources and numbers, ultimately conquered the land and made it theirs for the next thousand years. 

The same pretty much happened among the indigenous americans themselves, before the Europeans arrived. But no one will use this as an argument to favor this or that population.

After that, the Israelites themselves were subject to continuous invasions and they were ultimately pushed away from their own land. First, by the hand of the Romans. Then, by the Arab-Islamic populations. While the Romans put the Jews in check because of their stubborness in not wanting to accept Roman law, they had no particular hatred against them. The Islamic populations, on the other hand, had an ideological aversion against them. An hatred that never stopped, and that still exists to this day. So much so that we have important muslim spokespersons openly stating racist insults such as ""[I'm not anti-semite, I'm anti-termite!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC9mlc-aTIY)"". 

""Not all muslims"", sure. It can't be denied, however, that anti-semitism in Muslim countries is as embedded in the culture as it was among Europeans up until 80 years ago. But that's precisely part of the argument: ever since the Israelites lost their land, they were subjected to all forms of discrimination and oppression, for thousands of years. This hatred towards Judaism, Israel, is still there in the area."
1,2023-10-17,CMV: Minecraft is Not Beginner Friendly at All,u/00PT,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179z1ry/cmv_minecraft_is_not_beginner_friendly_at_all/,changemyview,"# Overview

With the latest controversy on the mob vote, Minecraft has been on my mind a little more, but I don't have the strongest opinion on that controversy itself. Instead, I began thinking about a long-held belief of mine that was quite controversial when I first began expressing it, but my viewpoint has always stayed the same, and I really want to see if someone can change it. The opinion is that Minecraft is not beginner-friendly at all.

For years, players in Minecraft have relied on resources like the wiki to get acquainted with basic mechanics. This is a problem because it unnecessarily puts responsibility on the player and reduces the game's immersion in general. In addition, it reduces the potential for creativity in the game. If you have no idea what the actual behavior of the item you are using is, you can't be creative with said behavior.

My view was perhaps more of a popular opinion earlier in the game's lifetime when features like the recipe book, the advancement system, and ruined portals were in place, but it seems that these kinds of changes have satisfied most. However, I was never swayed. There was only one thing that helped beginners meaningfully, [the tutorial world](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Legacy_Console_Edition_tutorial), but it is now lost because the individual console editions of the game became legacy in favor of the Bedrock version, which is cross-compatible with other platforms.

Here, I will provide a comprehensive list of every ""tutorial"" feature  I know of and will cover more in detail later in this post (feel free to mention if you think I missed something):

* [Advancements](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Advancement) \- Achievement system built as a guide.
* [Recipe Book](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recipe_book) \- Tells you how craft things.
* [Paintings](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Painting) \- A painting demonstrates how to create a wither.
* [Structures](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Structure) \- Sometimes include demonstrations of certain mechanics.
   * [Ruined Portals](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ruined_Portal) \- Nether portal structure is demonstrated here.
   * [Desert Pyramids](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Desert_Pyramid) \- TNT mechanics are demonstrated here.
   * [Ancient Cities](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ancient_City) \- Redstone mechanics are demonstrated here.
   * [Igloos](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Igloo) \- Villager Curing mechanic is demonstrated here
   * [Villages](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Village) \- Some mechanics, such as farming, are demonstrated here.
   * [Woodland Mansions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Woodland_Mansion) 	\- Similarly to the village, mechanics such as farming are demonstrated here. Also, there is a room demonstrating the end portal.
   * [Jungle Temples](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Jungle_Temple) \- Redstone mechanics are demonstrated here.

# Advancements

Of the covered topics in this post, this is probably the one people point to most for Minecraft being beginner-friendly, and for good reason.

Advancements are the newer generation of Achievements. They have some technical differences, but if we assume vanilla Minecraft without any data packs or commands running in the background, they are effectively the same thing. When a player completes a particular objective, there is a notification that an advancement is achieved. There is an advancement screen accessible through the pause menu that will show a player's accomplishments and some of the next advancements that can be achieved. This creates a sense of progression for players.

The advancement system is good in theory, but it has several problems. First, the function of advancements is designed to be reactive. You are notified after completing a task, but you only know that you must do it if you actively check the advancements menu. Thus, the menu should be much more accessible and clearly communicate what it is actually for. The term ""Advancement"" absolutely is not enough for me to intuitively determine that this is where I view the achievements I have earned. This is a relatively minor problem, though.

A much bigger problem is that the advancement system is incomplete. There are advancements for crafting a pickaxe or getting iron, but not for any other special ores in the game. A beginner cannot tell what an item like Lapis Lazuli or Redstone is supposed to do, as the tutorial system they rely on leaves these elements unmentioned. The advancement system implies that one should immediately go from getting iron tools to looking for diamonds, but this is only one possible path, possibly a bad one. At the very minimum, advancements should recognize redstone, which is, to this day, the most complex and misunderstood mechanic in the game, benefitting the most from some tutorial system.

Finally, advancements are inherently insufficient for explaining things. They consist entirely of a logo, title, and short description, and it is far too often that one of those three elements is made less clear in favor of making some joke or reference. ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" makes very little surface-level sense for an advancement that asks the player to make obsidian, and the description doesn't actually tell you how to make that block. It is only vaguely implied that lava is part of it because the parent is ""Hot Stuff."" The only hint for how to cure a zombie villager is the Golden Apple icon on ""Zombie Doctor"" and the word ""Weaken"" in the description. A player isn't given any information about what the nether is like through the advancement system other than the idea that it is vaguely ""hot,"" which is an incomplete description, especially after the changes in 1.16.

The truth is that Minecraft mechanics are often multifaceted due to the game's sandbox nature, to the point that a couple of lines of text will never adequately describe almost anything in the game without leaving out a whole lot.

# Recipe Book

Compared to advancements, the recipe book certainly fulfills its intended purpose much better. It's essentially just a book that shows you what you can make based on what you've already come across and the names of those items. This is a massive improvement over the previous state of the game, where a player is clueless to what crafting methods are available to them or even how to use a crafting table at all.

The problem is mainly with the mechanic that recipes are only unlocked once you complete some predefined task. This means you can only work so far ahead and often miss out on simple items that could have been used if you actually knew how to make them. The expected playstyle is that you walk around collecting every new thing you see, hoping one of them will prove useful and unlock recipes for you.

The Recipe book might be decent at what it does, but what it does is far from an adequate tutorial system. The book tells you how to make stuff but not what those things do or how to use them.

# Paintings and Structures

Painting and structures are grouped here because I have the same opinion about both. The idea behind this tutorial method is that the player, being naturally curious, will explore and come across these pre-made elements of the world. At this point, they will observe the study and learn about the mechanics used. I think this is a solid idea in concept, especially since it covers stuff like the Nether portals and Redstone, which were some of the most opaque mechanics before.

However, the game's sandbox nature gets in the way of the intended purpose. A player is never forced to explore in Minecraft. They could theoretically spend their entire time in the same few biomes doing the most basic tasks. Even if they do go out to explore, nobody is guaranteed to come across the specific structure that demonstrates a particular mechanic. If they find that structure, they won't necessarily ""get"" the implication, as many of these are cryptic (especially the Wither painting). A good tutorial advertises itself to the beginners who need it, not hiding behind a specific playstyle and motivation to deliver its knowledge.

The tutorial worlds of Legacy Console edition did this perfectly by building a map with areas right out in the open that are intentionally and explicitly designed to demonstrate mechanics, then sending dialogue when the player enters those areas."

The whole point of downvotes is to distinguish good content/advice from trolling and hate, however, the system frequently seems to be used as a way for people to either silence opinions they don't like or because they're butthurt about something else a person said earlier.

Futhermore, if there's not even any feedback how are people even meant to learn anything? A random bunch of people downvoting a post without saying anything isn't going to change the person being downvoted's opnion on the subject. If anything it makes you feel vindicated because why would people not give a reason why they think your opinion is wrong vs just lazily downvoting?

Obviously, there are exceptions to the case like if someone says something crazy outlandish like Hitler was right or that the earth is flat where there's already an abundance of evidence to the contrary, but we're talking generally here like if someone gets downvoted for saying digimon is better than pokemon ."

I mean, most companies give the day after Thanksgiving off, so why shouldn’t the day after Christmas also be a federal holiday? Most of the WORLD celebrates Christmas, and a lot of people have to travel for it as well. No one should have to travel back home on Christmas Day. And, the reasoning for the day after Thanksgiving being a holiday is because of Black Friday…ah yes, give us a day off so we can fight crowds for dumb sales that aren’t even that great. The day after Christmas is more important IMO. And if the 26th falls on a weekend day, give employees a floating holiday. Or, maybe employees can choose to either work the day after Thanksgiving or 12/26. There are so many options and I wish employers would think of them and better yet, practice them.

\-Black men who like White women are seen as more acceptable to society, i.e., Tom

\-It creates an unnecessary rift between authentic Black culture and what's seen as ""the norm"" or healthy, by expressing Black men as either thugs or oreos. 

\-There was even an episode that demonized the victim of R Kelly, painting her as some kind of groupie who wasn't held hostage and repeatedly raped - with Riley saying it shouldn't be illegal to accidentally pee on someone

1,2023-10-17,CMV: The trend of blurring your kid's face in photos posted on social media makes no sense.,u/cmoriarty13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17a15oi/cmv_the_trend_of_blurring_your_kids_face_in/,changemyview,"Before I became a dad, I did extensive research on this, and I still can't understand the point of blurring your kid's face when you post photos of them. Don't get me wrong, I will always say that parents have the right to make their own decisions, I'm just saying that this doesn't make any sense to me.

Below are all the arguments I hear advocating for blurring their faces and why I think they make no sense:

* **""Privacy. My child should be allowed to give consent to having their face online.""** Ok, then just don't post photos of your kid at all. Share or don't share, but there's no point in sharing a photo of someone with a big emoji over their face, or their whole head blurred out. It's just a blob. It's pointless to share photos of blobs. If you actually care about their privacy, just don't share the photo. Or, better yet, make your account private so only people you know can see the photos. But no, people want the attention from the post and are so obsessed with sharing their lives that they will put ridiculous emojis over their kid's face just to post the photo. If you don't think your kid will like that there are photos of their face online, what makes you think they'll like that there's photos of them with ridiculous emojis on their face?
* **""I don't want pedophiles seeing my child.""** Sorry, but why does anyone think that blurring the face would deter a pedophile? The photo you post of your kid with a blurred face is just as likely to circulate on pedophile websites as an un-blurred photo is. Especially when the blurred photo is literally them in the bath or running around in a diaper...
* **""It's for their safety.""** I hear this all the time, but I haven't heard a solid argument for it. How does blurring their face make them safer? I literally see people posting photos of their kids with blurred faces, yet they tag the location or say the name of their daycare. Sorry, but blurring their face won't do anything. 
* **""They should be able to curate their own digital footprint.""** Ok, if your kid grows up and has an issue with anything you posted, just delete it. I know nothing on the internet really ever can be deleted, but it's about the digital footprint, and if you delete the photo, it's no longer associated with them even if it still exists somewhere.
* **""It protects their privacy.""** No, not really, not in 2023. There's literally AI that can remove emojis from faces in seconds and pretty accurately rebuild their face. If my kids grows up and tells me that they don't want all those pictures of them on my Instagram, I'll delete them all, no question. If this is about autonomy, then that should suffice. 
* **""I don't want Google and other tech companies having that information about my family and tailoring my online experience to it.""** Once again, blurring their face won't prevent this.
* **""I don't want companies stealing these images for commercial use.""** This can happen with any photo you take. Whether it's of your kid or not, you have every legal right to sue that company. Also, you should know that if you post these photos to social media, those companies now have usage rights to the photos. So even your blurred photos can appear in articles or posts all over the world, [just like this.](https://www.intheknow.com/post/sharenting-censoring-kids-faces-social-media/)

All of this basically boils down to 1 thing: If you don't want your kid's face online, just don't post photos of them. The blurring or emoji over the face idea is completely pointless, at least at achieving the arguments I outlined above. The only way to achieve all of these points above is to just not post photos of them."

However, Israel's response of indiscriminately bombing most densely populated area of Gaza is doing the unthinkable of uniting the Arab world. 

Even though most of the surrounding Arab countries are militarily weak, Iran issued a stark warning while international community and  neighboring countries have asked to stop the bombings. Even the US calls for restoring water have fallen on deaf ears.

 Yet an attack on Israel might provoke a US response, which in turn can have a domino effect in the region drawing  China and  Russia into the conflict."

I'll leave Japan out of this thread, though.

Had Nazi Germany focused solely on conquering Russia and no one else, several thing would have happened, IMHO:

&#x200B;

* The western Allies (Britain, France, etc.) were still reeling from the horrific cost and trauma of World War I. They would have been quite reluctant to get involved in another war after WW1 had cost millions of men. With a very intense and skillful diplomatic campaign, Germany could very well have convinced the Brits and French, ""We are solely at war with Russia. This isn't worth it for you to get involved - you don't want to lose 6 million men again,"" especially considering that the western Allies were hardly friendly with Russia anyway. Indeed, it would have been in the best German interest to act as friendly towards the west as possible, since a 2-front war would be fatal.
* The best path to invade Russia under such a scenario would be one that avoided Poland as much as possible, since Poland had a treaty with the Brits. Such a German path would involve passing through Romania and Ukraine. 
* Operation Barbarossa failed largely because of 1) American Lend-Lease aid to the Soviets and 2) Germany couldn't devote full resources to it because it was bogged down in Belgium, France, Africa, etc. If America had stayed out of the war and gave Russia no Lend-Lease aid (which it might have done if Japan had been persuaded to leave Hawaii alone and Germany didn't attack France or Britain,) and Germany had had more resources available due to fighting a 1-front war instead of 2-front war, it could have meant a stronger German punch against a weaker Russia. 
* Had such an attack succeeded, and toppled Stalin's regime by, say, 1940-1942, Germany would then set up a puppet regime in Moscow and spend a decade or two quelling insurgencies and firming up control over the region (the Reich empire would stretch from Germany to perhaps as far as the Urals - it's questionable what the fate of Siberia or anything east of the Urals would be in this situation) and trying to exploit the region's natural resources to the max. We would then see a new Cold War - one that involved a western-Europe NATO against a Nazi Eastern Europe (rather than a communist East Europe.) It would also only be a matter of time, of course, before the Nazi empire was armed with nuclear weapons."

Calhoun, the man whose appearance could be described as an unfortunate collision of odd proportions and a perpetually sour countenance, was a striking figure in American history. Standing at a rather unimpressive 5 feet and 4 inches, he was a man of diminutive stature, almost as if nature itself conspired to render him inconspicuous in a crowd. His oddly-proportioned frame did him no favors; his short and stubby limbs seemed almost out of place on his body, as though someone had pieced them together as an afterthought.  
Calhoun's face was nothing short of a marvel, but not in a flattering way. It was as though his features had been sculpted by a disgruntled artist who had lost interest halfway through the process. His nose was a particularly peculiar appendage, jutting out prominently like the prow of a ship, leading the way for his deeply furrowed brow. This brow seemed eternally burdened with the weight of his own ambitions and controversies, permanently furrowed as if to remind the world of his lifelong devotion to divisive political positions.  
But it was Calhoun's mouth that truly stood out – not for its attractiveness, but rather for its perpetually twisted expression of disdain. His thin, pinched lips seemed to form a permanent sneer, as if he had an ongoing distaste for the world at large. When he spoke, which he did with a frequency that could only be described as incessant, his mouth contorted into a shape that gave the impression of a man eternally sucking on a lemon. This expression, combined with his harsh, staccato delivery, made him come across as an individual who relished in delivering bitter diatribes rather than engaging in constructive discourse.  
Calhoun's eyes, deep-set and sunken beneath a heavy brow, further added to his rather unattractive visage. They had a perpetually piercing quality, as if he were scrutinizing those around him, ever ready to pounce on any perceived transgressions. These eyes, framed by a pair of thick, bushy, and unkempt eyebrows, were a window into his restless and relentless political mind, always seeking to further his own interests and agenda.  
His hair, or what remained of it, was a testament to his advancing years. Wisps of gray and receding locks clung desperately to his scalp, as if in a losing battle against time itself. His hairline, which had long since retreated, left his prominent forehead exposed, an expanse of skin that seemed to emphasize his severe, almost austere countenance.  
Overall, John C. Calhoun's physical appearance was a visual embodiment of his divisive political career. His peculiar proportions, his perpetual scowl, and his facial expressions that appeared to revel in disdain were a reflection of his unwavering commitment to controversial and often divisive principles. He may have left his mark on American history, but his appearance remains a lasting testament to the polarizing figure he was, forever etched in the annals of time."

1,2023-10-17,CMV: Christianity Is Not Capable of Self-Regulating or Taking Responsibility for Abuse,u/Nuwisha55,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17a2g37/cmv_christianity_is_not_capable_of_selfregulating/,changemyview,"I've had a lot of discussion online over the years with Christians. Recently the two majority branches in the US, Southern Baptist and Catholic, broke records for paying out victims of church abuse. According to BishopAccountability, the Catholic Church has paid over $4 billion in claims and settlements through over 8,600 cases. Some archdiocese are considering bankruptcy.

Now, I want to point out here that **all religious communities in the US have a problem with abuse**. Mormons, for example, have a major problem with abuse. The basic rule of thumb appears to be that the more isolated and fundamentalist a community is, the likelihood of abuse goes up. Ditto child marriage, which is legal in most states. It's only illegal in ten, with most politicians saying they don't want to interfere with the ""culture."" 

I encourage anyone to visit [this link](https://www.abuselawsuit.com/church-sex-abuse/) and [this link](https://www.notinourchurch.com/statistics.html) for specific statistics. They're pretty bad, and get into abuse that isn't even discussed here, like the abuse of women (who, by the way, are the majority population of the religion.)

I've noticed two things in my discussions whenever abuse is brought up.

A) ""It's individuals, not the religion."" Yes, but the religion has a problem with individuals. More to the point, these individuals, more often than not, are moved or hidden by clergy. Supposedly ""god-fearing"" individuals that would otherwise represent the Christian ideal. Despite the religion's major abuse problems, abuse is NOT a problem, not discussed, and by and large definitely not known in its breadth and width by the average Christian. This argument completely removes responsibility from ... well, anyone. No one has to take responsibility at any point except the victim, who are often coached to forgive their abusers or face Hell. (!!!)

B) ""Why do you hate God?"" Aside from my riposte that God appears to hate victims and that regardless of anything else I personally am not raping kids and therefore have less to worry about on the morality scale, this argument tries to derail the argument and turn a legitimate criticism of the Church into a personal spiritual battle. These people can't defend the abuse, but also seem angry that the church is being criticized at all. It's framed as ""not"" legitimate criticism, therefore no responsibility needs to be taken. However, a lot of these same people are angry when the video or article is about people leaving the church, as if people absolutely MUST navigate the statistical probability of child rape in order to get into Heaven.

Also C) in a minor sense: ""The good the church has done is worth the price of child rape,"" otherwise known as the ""[The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas)"" argument.

I point out that the same people going after LGBTQ people for their ""lifestyle choices"" can't and won't regulate the Christians in the pew beside them, despite one having a greater statistical probability of child abuse. The whole ""Hollywood liberal pedophile ring"" is happening in real life, just in the church. The same people concerned about the moral culpability of ""the gays"" or anyone else also think that they themselves are going to get a free pass from God despite being morally culpable for endorsing, evangelizing, and tithing to a church that denied **child victims** justice. 

A similar element in all this is that most Evangelical Christians have zero idea of their own history, or seem to think that the offending Christians were ""other"" in some capacity. The Salem Witch Trials, The Boston Martyrs, the Crusades, etc. weren't Christianity or the religion, they were just an unfortunate Something Else that doesn't have to be acknowledged as, say, a warning or a lesson. ""Christianity can do no bad"" is the prevailing sentiment, and if it is, it's those pesky ""individuals"" again.

Pretty much since the advent of the Internet, Christianity has been hemorrhaging numbers in the US. About 64% of Americans call themselves Christian today vs 90% 50 years ago, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. That same survey said the Christian majority in the US may disappear by 2070. I place this squarely at the feet of Christianity's abuse problem. When you have a predator in your midst, who has prime choice of victims among a flock told to obey authority, and an authority hierarchy that can't or won't acknowledge the predator, you're of course going to have people leaving the church. The growth of Christianity elsewhere globally can be attributed to, uh, most third world countries not know how extensive or systematic the abuse it. When they catch up to that fact, their numbers will drop, too.

My working theory is that Christianity is destroying itself with this attitude. It seems to be the most obvious thing in the world that abuse is bad and should be stopped, and instead it's become a silver bullet for the entire religion. ""We don't rape THAT much"" appears to be the best argument I've gotten for why someone should consider Christianity. Hellfire is bad, but you have to get past the child rapists to get into Heaven.

Am I wrong? Are Christians lacking in self-awareness? Why are Christians default considered mainstream ""good"" if all of this is a major attribute of their religion? What will stop the decline? How are Christians self-regulating to get the abuse out of their churches and communities? How can Christians take responsibility for the abuse?"

I do not see how parenting is any different. Raising a child is an incredibly demanding skill  which requires time, money, energy. If done wrong then the consequences for both the child and society at large can be severe. A child of abuse/neglect faces a life of misery, and in many cases this gets projected outwards at a later stage as they are more likely to turn to drugs, violent crime or other anti social behavior. 

A parenting license will deter people who lack the means and/or ability to raise a child from ever having one. In an age of overpopulation and high costs of living with no signs of improvement, this would be a good thing. 

Considering that this license can't be physically enforced, we would also need a robust foster home system which would guarantee a decent upbringing for an ""illegitimate"" child born to unlicensed parent(s).

Of course this is unlikely to ever happen due to the sheer logistical effort required from the government but the idea seems valid. Would love to get your views on this."

In my opinion, it's one thing to be staunchly child free and to not be good with kids, even to not necessarily want to or prefer to be around kids for extended periods of time. But to me, it is very concerning and indicative of someone's character if they claim to downright hate children and if they are wishing harm to children, even in a so-called ""joking"" manner. Children are children for a reason - they are defenseless minor members of our society and it's a spoken and unspoken societal requirement for us to protect and subsidize them. 

Practical things aside, every one of us were a child at one point in the past, and many of us don't like to remember or acknowledge the period in our lives when we were quite literally novices to personhood and were trying to figure out how to exist as a human being in a space where the majority of the people around us are much older, taller, and wiser than us. And at a certain threshold, when we were *very* young children, we weren't even old enough to communicate our needs with words, which I'm sure is a very frustrating experience for many kids, if not all of them! I feel that to actively ignore this point about the experience of children is very misguided. 

Like, for those of us who have worked with children or been around kids for extended periods of time in some capacity, it can be VERY taxing and exhausting, and there are many kids who are downright bratty and insufferable. But the latter point is often the fault of the adult(s) in their lives, and to ascribe this feeling of genuine hatred and disdain toward the entirety of a literal protected class - a defenseless and dependent one at that - is very sinister to me and is indicative of either deep unresolved issues from one's own childhood or sociopathic tendencies.

1,2023-10-17,"CMV: It is impossible for most baseball players to be considered the greatest of all time purely because of the position they play or the way in which they play it, irrespective of their actual skill and quality of play.",u/Aceofkings9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17a5nw8/cmv_it_is_impossible_for_most_baseball_players_to/,changemyview,"When compared to most other sports, baseball different positions have pretty heterogeneous roles. The skills that make a good pitcher versus a good infielder versus a good outfielder versus a good catcher generally vary a good bit, let alone the subtle differences in those roles. That being said, more so than any professional sport except for maybe basketball, I think that people have very strong, unwavering opinions about which player is the greatest of all time. That being said, I generally think that this comparison is stupid from an objective standpoint. 

Subjectively, I get it. It's fun to compare players between positions and eras, and I have my own personal preferences. But I think that it is pretty useless to try and figure out, say, whether a pitcher or a position player was an overall better player, given that in today's game they share no overlapping tools except for fielding their position. As a result, I think that the consequence should be that people should see at least one career pitcher (not counting Ruth, who, although a good pitcher, did not seriously establish his legacy as a pitcher and whose pitching career is generally just used as a gotcha by people who believe Ruth is the greatest) as a serious contender for greatest of all time. 

If you want to get sabermetric with it, there is a reasonable argument to be had based off of WAR that a pitcher is not the greatest player of all time, owing to the fact that the highest WAR live-ball pitcher (I'm using bWAR here, just to be transparent)  is about 40 wins above replacement below first place (and I'm talking about Clemens, who opens a whole other can of worms with PEDs). But (admittedly without evidence), I think even among fans who generally don't care about statistics, a pitcher could never be seen as the greatest just because they don't hit, which I do not really think is a fair system of analysis. 

Moving down the line, I think that catchers suffer a similar problem. Because of the physical strain of squatting for hours on end, in the aggregate they can't really have long and successful careers the same way that other positions have, and the burden doesn't much help in the offensive department either, which severely limits almost all their prospects of being considered the greatest of all time. Defensive catching is generally understood to be important, but important components such as pitch framing can be much more challenging to quantify when compared to other valuable defensive positions and statistical developments have been largely very recent. I would bet that most fans consider Johnny Bench to be either the best or one of the very best catchers of all time, but outside of Cincinnati, I doubt there are very many who would consider him the greatest player across all positions. But is that a skill issue, or just a constraint of the position?  I tend to buy into the second more so than the first. 

For my view to be changed, I would need to see a compelling argument that there is a realistic way a position like a pitcher or catcher (or even another more overlooked position like second or third base) could be widely considered by at least a substantial chunk of players to be the greatest player of all time across all positions.

Islam is no better or worse than other religions and like other religions there is plenty that warrants criticism. Like the fact that several passages of the holy book either promote violence or have not been written clearly enough to stop people from interpreting them that way. 

But whenever somebody criticizes Islam today they're often accused of being Islamaphobic. Which is really, from the perspective of those who don't follow Islam just not liking the views of people who have been dead for centuries, which seems completely fine to me and not remotely racist unless somebody dislikes them because they were from the middle east. But the assumption is usually ""this person doesn't like POC."" 

Some people seem to believe that criticizing Islam will lead to hate towards Muslims, esp. Since they're already in the minority. I think the opposite is true- if you refuse to point out clear issues with a given religion and don't let anybody else do it either people start looking for those who will. And the people that they find are the actual threat. Whereas if you say ""this passage about lot's people is encouraging violence against gay people or not written very well so it causes some hardcore followers of Islam to kill gay people... It's no different than saying this passage in the bible about slavery is bad. I don't think saying a passage in the Bible is violent leads to violence against Christians, so why would criticizing a passage in the Quaran lead to violence against Muslims?"

The view in the title is a bit broad (I didn't want to write an essay in the title), so a more fleshed out version of the title might read something like:

""Most people who daily-drive a financed pickup-truck or SUV would be better off financing a different type of vehicle, and renting a larger vehicle when needed.""

Here are a couple arguments I think some may try to pose, so I will go ahead and preempt them:

""I need a pickup to haul cargo/need a pickup for the space"" -- It's my impression that minivans and sprinter-type vans offer similar if not greater cargo capacities. The only way I see this argument working is if someone consistently tows something (trailer, food truck, etc) or carries oddly shaped loads.

""I need an SUV for my kids"" -- A mini-van will almost certainly be a better fit, with enough seating and capacity for an average family's daily uses. Furthermore, I think a larger family would be better off with a sprinter-type van.

""I like trucks better"" -- subjective concerns are beyond the scope of this CMV. When i say better off, I'm speaking more in a financial sense. 

I'm sure there are many edge cases where owning only a pickup would make sense, but my view is more of a generality. I am NOT saying there are zero good reasons for owning an SUV or a pickup, but i think most people would be better of without one.

My main reason for holding this view is that the vast majority of pickups i see day-to-day are completely empty. 

You can change my view by showing a situation where one might not fully utilize a pickup or SUV, but they are still better off owning it, rather than occasionally renting one. Alternatively, you could show me some form of statistics contradicting my anecdotal experience."

Plenty more to say, but will leave for discussion. I think some facts that would change my mind would be along the lines of definitive evidence of the things often claimed about Musk/Tesla (unsafe cars, low quality, FSD is fake, Musk hates XXX group that you love, Musk is dumb liberal, Musk is dumb conservative, etc) that are perpetuated by clear media incentives, or some argument as to why the media is not incentivized to go after Musk/Tesla.

1,2023-10-17,CMV: Focusing on on issues solely on a superficial level is not productive in the long run,u/Hatrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17a8esb/cmv_focusing_on_on_issues_solely_on_a_superficial/,changemyview,"I think people are going about it the wrong way. They focus on superficial issues. For example, right now there is talk about Israel-Palestine. The corporate oligarchy owned mainstream media keeps pushing the same divide and conquer narrative, they want you to pick sides and hate the other side. This simply doesn't work. We have factual historic evidence that this doesn't work. It is very simple: this has been the strategy, and it has not worked. There is nothing to argue here. So what can we do that will actually work? We have to go deeper.  
Human conflict is not due to superficial differences in terms of religion or other demographic factors, etc.. It is due to lack of basic knowledge/critical thinking, as well as needs not being met resulting in frustration. After this happens, people get drawn into any number of bad ideologies. The surface ideology doesn't matter, and is simply a product of determinism (e.g. where you are born/what external stimuli is exerted on your senses). That is why a young boy in Gaza who is living a tough life, if he becomes radicalized, he will join Hamas, it makes no logical sense for him to join IDF, according to the universal laws of nature (determinism). Similarly, if a boy in Israel gets radicalized, he will likely to be pro-Israel, not pro-Hamas, again, according to common sense/the universal laws of nature/determinism.

Politicians don't want people to realize this, because they use divide and conquer to keep their own advantage. Unfortunately, at one point I thought the internet would spread critical thinking, but it serves to do the opposite: it created even more division.

So the practical steps moving forward I can think of is to teach people the above. Here are some specific ways:

\- before judging someone, put yourself in their shoes  
\- recognize that humans fall prey to irrational thinking and logical biases. check these out and practice catching yourself when you commit them  
\- when you get negative thoughts about yourself and others remind yourself that this is an evolutionary protective mechanism that is mismatched with the unnatural modern world, and so try to practice telling yourself that this rumination and complaining and blaming is not productive or helpful in the long run, i can't change the past, i can't change what is out of my control, I can't change other people overnight, the only thing I can do is right now stop ruminating and focusing on doing something that is actually in my control and is productive  
\- a concept similar to the above point: would you rather be right or less distressed? Even if you genuinely believe that something will turn out negatively, act and behave as it won't, this will in a way act as a positive self-fulfilling prophecy and increase the chances of success. For example, if you are running as a political candidate, even if you practically know you won't get enough votes, if during your interview you act like you will win, do you think this will increase or decrease the number of votes you will get? Or would you prefer to be ""right"" and be known for making the ""right"" prediction"" and consequently shooting yourself in the foot and making it a bad self-fulfilling prophecy? If you publicly say you can't win, why would people vote for you?  
\- practice meditation so that your own emotion and frustration does not get in the way of your thinking  
\- cognitive dissonance is hard, but needed for critical thinking. Question all of your pre-existing beliefs, pretend you are someone else and you are arguing against yourself, see what you can come up with.  
\- study basic statistical concepts such as correlation is not necessarily causation, and practice applying it practically, without getting emotion cloud your judgement. There are many people with PhDs and advanced knowledge in statistics, but they are unable to apply simple concepts like correlation does not equal casuation in a practical manner, because cognitive biases/fallacies and emotion get in the way.  
\- disconnect from the media and most social discussion. The vast majority of people are not at the level to abide by these principles (due to the poor education/political/media system not teaching these principles and also brainwashing people to go against them) so most discussions are superficial and toxic, filled with emotion, simply 2 people trying to yell over each other and doubling down on their superficial pre-existing beliefs, then some people picking sides without using critical thinking, and saying person a ""owned"" person b in the debat. This does not help us get to the truth. This is ego based and counterproductive."

**Argument**:  When one acts intentionally, what one does is a function of how one is, mentally speaking. Therefore, to be ultimately responsible for one’s action, one must be ultimately responsible for how one is, mentally speaking—at least in certain respects. But to be ultimately responsible for how one is in the relevant respects, one must have chosen to become (or intentionally brought it about that one would become) that way in the past. But if one chose to become that way, then one’s choice was a function of the way one was in certain mental respects. Therefore, to be ultimately responsible for *that* choice, one would need to be ultimately responsible for being *that* way. But this process results in a vicious regress. Therefore, one cannot be ultimately responsible for any of one’s intentional actions. And one clearly cannot be ultimately responsible for any of one’s unintentional actions. Therefore, one cannot be ultimately responsible for any of one’s actions.

Recognizing the impossibility of ultimate responsibility is highly therapeutic, because it renders irrational a whole range of negative emotions, including guilt, regret, shame, remorse, indignation, anger, outrage, resentment, contempt and hatred.  When one realizes that all of one’s actions can be fully expressed as a function of factors that are entirely outside of one’s control, all of these emotions are rendered irrational.

Whereas someone who is trans or gay is born that way, I do not believe anyone is born poly nor have I seen any evidence to suggest it. I also do not believe anyone is born monogamous, I do not think monogamy is a default. And because of this, I do not think any ""amory"" preference deserves to be treated the same as other types of LGBT. Essentially, polyamory is a relationship structure, a preference, and it is not an inherent quality of an individual the same way being trans or being gay is.

In my mind, there are only two types of polyamorous people.

1) Someone who agrees with polyamory for philosophical reasons and chooses to participate in it because of that. Or because they just want to have some fun.

2) Broken individuals who have been turned into hoes by a series of traumatic experiences. This type of person usually exhibits antisocial manipulative tendencies and will serial cheat due to a lack of self control, causing polyamorous relationship structures to be the only viable options for them long-term. 

Either way, none of these people are ""born"" that way"

Over the last 100 years, America has fought WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War. All of these wars were completely justified, except for maybe Iraq.

Most people say Korea was justified, and it was. North Korea invaded South Korea, an American ally, and the United States got involved to save them from a communist dictatorship.

Now for Vietnam, most people think it wasn’t justified. Many people cite American war crimes as their reason. Yes, the United States committed horrible atrocities in Vietnam, but the initial declaration of war was justified and had nearly the same context as Korea.

As for Iraq, it’s complicated. There were no WMDs, but the United States did oust a brutal dictator and stop the genocide of the Kurdish people in Iraq.

Afghanistan was also totally justified. The taliban was harbouring terrorist and the United States invaded to stop the taliban and ensure that Afghanistan remained a free country, even if they did fail"

If you want to listen on my reasoning I’ll listen to yours.

The Aftons are basically your own characters when you make a AU since you only have their actions to go off of. So since they are technically your own characters I believe you should be able to do anything with them except for things that aren’t acceptable with your own characters, like shipping children with adults, etc.

Possible questions you may ask are going to be answered down below

 “Well why don’t you just make your own OCs then?”

Because the lore of the family is like a prompt, it’s specific but vague and it’s easy to get invested into it. I honestly think of the canon designs as something you don’t need to stay true too, since they keep changing(Elizabeth has been seen with multiple hair colors for example) and if the creator of FNAF can change the appearance of a character depending on what book, movie, etc they are in I think people who make AU’s should be able to change the appearance as well

“Then why is it wrong to whitewash canon black characters?” Because blackwashing isn’t about erasing white characters, it’s about making a white character black for more representation, of course only having black characters is a problem too unless you want them to be realistic to the place you have the characters in

I know my perspective may not align with yours but I just wanted to explain it for you to understand, if you don’t agree with me I won’t demonize you or something like those toxic blackwashers would"

Some are much easier to do so than others. 

If a business owner doesn’t want someone who is legally allowed to carry a firearm to enter their business with a firearm on their person, I am fine with that. I believe it’s absolutely useless but I agree with them being able to set those rules. 

An overwhelming majority of citizens are civil. Decent individuals who don’t go out their way to be purposefully rude to others. Most go through their lives without ever committing horrific crimes as well. Most will enter a place of business, look and leave or purchase something and leave.

Yes, there are bad apples there. Some are absolutely rotten to the core. Some have no problem doing things that most would find utterly abhorrent. 

I do not believe signs posted on a window will stop a person who is set on committing evil from doing evil. It depends on the state, but the possible penalties of ignoring the posted sign is pretty mild. They are especially mild compared to armed robbery, aggravated assault & homicide. 


I don’t think the average decent person goes into a store with no ill will and then is cranked up to a 10 for some reason and decides to rob everyone in sight or kill everyone. No one is in the store, shopping for their bbq and then decides to go on a killing spree. 

Someone who will commit those heinous actions goes in with their hands set to do no good. Their mind way made up *before* they ever entered the door. That being said, those people are willing to risk several years, life or death in prison. 

Why would a little sign deter them?"

So my loan principle is decreasing only $1000 for every $12500 I make. I've effectively given $6500 back to the government or about half my money. 

This keeps the populace in a perpetual state of barely being able to pay their loans off. The economy improvements would be stellar just off purchasing power and reducing our debt.

This is discrimination. Despite all the fancy coating around it, the ugly truth is still there. 

I get it. Diversity, and how we want other races to be afforded a chance to get into good colleges too (for the record I’m an 15 year old Asian girl.) I also understand that Asians seem to have a correlation between good grades, better access to schooling, etc.

BUT it doesn’t excuse anything. I was also born in an average income family. I also go to public school. I don’t have any tutors. I have no tennis lessons or extra classes to learn new things. Heck, my parents barely buy me the things I need half the time. Everything I’ve achieved and done is mostly of my own accord. I, MYSELF, worked hard to get where I am right now.

I want to cry everyday, and just give up but I can’t because once I do, my future will come crashing down and my parents will be so, so, so disappointed in me.

1,2023-10-18,CMV: Free Speech Is Bigger than the First Amendment,u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ajb3k/cmv_free_speech_is_bigger_than_the_first_amendment/,changemyview,"I really hate this [cartoon](https://xkcd.com/1357/).  If you don’t feel like clicking on that I can sum it up for you.  A pedantic and self-righteous stick figure points out that if someone bans you from social media or tries to get your show cancelled or shouts you down during a lecture, your rights to free speech are not being violated.  Because (sigh) the First Amendment doesn’t protect you from consequences. 

  
OK, fine.  That is true, the First Amendment does not protect anyone from consequences. But here’s what else.  Free speech is bigger than the First Amendment and it’s not just a legal issue, it’s a moral one.  You shouldn’t try to make people stop talking, particularly if other people are interested in what they have to say.  Just because something is offensive or upsetting to you, doesn’t mean that everyone else thinks so.  If you don’t like what someone is saying, you can disagree with them and say why you think they are wrong or just not pay attention to it.  But trying to shut people up is rude, presumptuous and it’s not very smart either.  

  
Check this out.  [Here is a list](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-disinvitation-database#campus-disinvitations/?view_39_page=23) of times that students attempted to get speakers disinvited to speak at a college campus.  There are 576 examples.  576 times that college students, who are supposed to be all about challenging their ideas and entertaining new perspectives, tried to just make someone shut up because they didn’t like what they are saying.  So much for intellectual rigor, right?

  
Now some people will say that those students are using their speech too.  They have a right to call for speakers to be disinvited, to deplatform people, to shout them down, to block access to events, etc.  This is true.  They have that right.  But that doesn’t mean that they should.  Just like everyone has a right to cheat on their spouse, but they really ought not to.  

  
You don’t have to look at college campuses to see this problem either.  Just look right here at Reddit.  [I’m going to use this as an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/175b9yn/comment/k4fx72p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  Here we have a pretty silly post, in my opinion, that showed up on r/TrueUnpopularOpinion the other day about alleged support for Palestine among the LBGTQA community.  As you can see, the mods of that sub had to ask people to stop reporting the sub to Reddit admins.  

  
Think about that.  People were taking time out of their day to try to get something that was clearly popular (it has about 2400 upvotes at the time that I’m typing this) banned from a subreddit that is devoted to having controversial points of view, because they wanted there to be consequences for expressing that a particular opinion.  They wanted to make sure that other people did not hear that opinion. 

  
Just to be clear at the end, I am talking about people expressing opinions and telling jokes.  I accept that fomenting panic, defrauding people, threatening and harassing individuals and creating a public disturbance (for example, running around a quiet neighborhood banging pots and pans) is not speech anyone needs to tolerate. I’m even excluding what I call derailing the conversation.  If, for instance, someone gets on r/modeltrains and starts talking about how model trains are silly and anyone who collects them is an overgrown child, that person should be banned from the sub.  Because that’s not what the sub is there for.  It exists to have people discuss their hobby.  

  
But if a sub is devoted to discussion of political and social issues, there ought not to be any opinion that cannot be expressed. And, if an institution’s main purpose is explore and evaluate ideas (such as a university), a speaker who comes to share their research or their conclusions, should not be disinvited, should be shouted down and should not be threatened for trying to speak.   Is there any possible justification for this apart from arrogance and the desire to forcibly prevent others from hearing a particular viewpoint?

I've noticed alot of people disagree with me when I bring this up. Main argument being that its very easy to tell the difference between the state and the capital city and I agree, but that's not the reason I think it should be renamed. I don't think the US capital should share a name with a state on the other side of country as it makes people just give it a different name anyway, we shouldn't have refer to Washington as D.C. I've also heard that instead of renaming the state we should just call the capital D.C. but I think its important for any nation's capital to have a true name not an abbreviation or a multi word name like ""District of Columbia"". As for why the capital should be the one to keep the name Washington I think it's symbolic for the US capital to be named after the first US president."

My biggest qualm is that it can detract attention from actually facing and solving real issues. It’s easy to calm yourself down and move on, ignoring or avoiding a reckoning with whatever issues might have caused you to get agitated in the first place.   
  
That’s why, in fact, corporations love mindfulness. It’s the perfect capitalist type of spirituality. All your problems are not with the system, they’re inside you, so just get into a lotus pose, take deep breaths, and attend to thoughts and feelings without judgment. What an elegant way to avoid looking in the mirror; well done, capitalism!

The ammunition the US is giving the Ukrainians is unsustainable and that’s even according to CNN and other American sites. While they’ll never actually run out of ammo they can’t keep up the firing rate. Also with things heating up in Israel, an actual American ally, it’s not likely that the US will prioritize Ukraine.

IMO, mid/credit-scenes demonstrate a desire to link the movie narratively to the greater MCU but the writing staff was unable to think of a way to do is more diegetically/in the film itself. It says to me ""we have a mandate to make this movie its own entity but also a canonical part of the MCU, but we can't figure out how to do it well so we're forcing this scene here at the end"".

They are almost all ""it turns out this character is alive"" or ""it turns out this other villian/character was behind everything"" or something that is a naked effort to further the overall MCU narrative while either not moving or in some cases negating the individual movie's impact."

Love might not be the most accurate word, and it kindve a loaded word lol, tho its the closest i could find to describe this

Every day people around the world have such negative and positive experiences with others in day-to-day life. Whether its out and about, in the workplace, at home, etc

Ive found that most love and hate is simply a distortion of Love, of course to varying degrees. Not invalidating either expression, its simply what those people are capable of at the time and what theyre experiencing

From the most saccharine and caring gestures to the most abrasive and hateful, its all an expression of Love. It seems to me like the perceived polarity of the action or gesture is a result of the givers biases/life experience. It all emanates from the same place, Love

When a mother swaddles her newborn and gives them forehead kisses and whispers sweet things, its Love- it just comes out with a perceived positive distortion in accordance to the experiential filter and temperament of the mother. The mother really Loves her newborn, and vice versa

When a buisnessman spits at a homeless person begging for food, its Love- the buisnessman loves the homeless person, it just comes out with a perceived negative distortion in accordance to the experiential filter and temperament of the buisnessman. The buisnessman really Loves the homeless person, and vice versa

It seems to me that once any action is explored long enough enough and in enough depth, the driving force more often than not boils down to Love- its distortions come about for a myriad of reasons- i guess it could be simplified by just saying life experience, traumas, biases, etc

Nonduality may very well be true, tho most societies do not embrace that system wholesale- so many often struggle to find compassion and understanding for certain actions and ideations due to how theyve been educated and socialized, most perceived negativity is quickly compartmentalized, dismissed and stigmatized instead of studied

Love is everywhere, all the time- whether that is lowercase l love or hate varies- tho ultimately it is love all the same

From bigotry, to classism, to racism, to sexism etc- theyre all just distortions of Love- a message of Love that cannot be communicated properly in that moment- a distortion

This world is filled with expressions of Love and nothing else

Not to be conspiratorial, tho ive found that most negative distortions of Love are simply due to social influence and forms of propaganda

They point to Scripture - particularly Daniel and Revelations - claiming that wars and disasters of unprecedented scale and scope will hit us as the End Times come. I'm not familiar with Islam or Judaism, but I wouldn't be surprised if their adherents make similar claims as well.

The problem is, previous historical events were *much* bigger and *much* worse......yet they *weren't* the End Times. 

The current Ukraine and Israel wars are *tiny* compared to World War II. The Covid pandemic actually had a *small* death toll compared to the Black Death (proportional to population, the Black Death would have been the equivalent of 1 billion people being killed today, if I calculate correctly.) Covid has also killed far fewer people than smallpox, yet neither World War II, the Black Death nor smallpox ushered in the End Times.

If someone like Adolf Hitler wasn't the AntiChrist, then why would someone like Barack Obama be? 

The view I am open to being changed is this: **Until, or unless, we get wars and natural disasters that are even** ***worse*** **than WWII or the Black Death - such as a war or pandemic that kills billions of people - religious people have no reason or basis to believe the End Times are near.

As an example, the U.S. Defense budget is bloated and misused from 80+ years of imperial war mongering and global policing, and a 2010 survey showed that over 30% of Americans *do not* want their tax money funding it. This reflects a resentment and moral opposition to funding global militarism, and working class citizens of every country have a universal right to resist the squandering of billions towards violent geopolitical war games.

1,2023-10-18,CMV: Some subreddit mods are absolute losers who have nothing going on in their lives and choose to mod for free only to have power trips,u/CrookshankChronicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17az0wc/cmv_some_subreddit_mods_are_absolute_losers_who/,changemyview,"Ok so, I've been banned a few times from subreddits before and apart from a couple of instances where I definitely deserved the ban, I was unfairly banned for something as harmless as disagreeing with the moderator's views and sometimes for even being of a race that an openly racist mod disliked. Funnily enough, I was also banned just for joining a subreddit, I never posted or commented. How can someone break a rule if there was literally zero interactions on that subreddit? I can only imagine that the mods of this subreddit had way too much free time and way little to live for and was willing to stalk every single member of the subreddit to see if their post history aligns with the subreddit ideology and ban the ones who don't fit in. Which is both hilarious and sad at the same time. Do they really think they're guarding some sort of nuclear codes or something lmao? Such pathetic losers I swear (not all, but some for sure)


Now, I don't mind being banned from a subreddit if I broke a rule willingly or unwillingly. But I absolute hate the fact that one could be banned simply because the mods disagreed with something you said even if that didn't break any rule and he/she felt like having a power trip because nothing was clicking in their personal lives anyways. A bigger issue is that the Reddit Ban evasion system that's absolutely brutal and unjust. When it automatically get's triggered, all of your accounts logged into any device gets banned because Reddit creates a finger print of the user based on the data it collects. I've tried disabling 3rd party cookies, using VPNs, incognito, different devices, etc. But somehow the ban evasion detection gets triggered and Ive lost all my accounts for something as minor as one disagreement with a basement dwelling virgin slob probably riddled with acne and fleas. Sometimes even a month or two after the previous ban. I find this absurd. 


Secondly, I don't understand how a person can take a volunteering job so seriously. When I think of a subreddit mod, I think of an obese, neckbeard typing away at his keyboard while sipping a large gulp soda from his retired mother's basement while pretending to be a productive member of society. I picture someone who's never had sex, never tasted love, doesn't have friends, has no control over any aspect of their life and simply never had a shot at life. I picture someone who's been bullied all their lives so much so that they've retreated deep into their shell and can't go out in the real world while choosing the virtual one 24*7 instead. I don't think my visualization would be far off in most cases too. I refuse to believe someone with a functional life would voluntarily choose to moderate a subreddit with such militant fervour unless it's something that they're extremely passionate about or are getting paid to do so. And I can tell you that these mods that I've had issues with were only there for the powertrip because they wouldn't get that kind of power anywhere else in real life.

It's awesome re-watching highlights of stone-cold slapping Booker T around through a grocery store or Mankind visiting Vince in the hospital. Great and memorable moments, I won't argue otherwise. 

I do argue though that the WWE is a stronger product now than it ever was during the Attitude Era. 

In the Attitude Era, titles had little relevance. They changed every couple months and sometimes, even sooner. As a result, titles that changed hands regularly and often, just don't mean as much as they do now. 

For example, take a look at Gunther. The reigning IC champion. He's held the title for nearly 500 days and quite frankly, I don't remember a time where the IC title meant as much as does now. 

The same goes for Roman Reigns. And listen, I dislike Roman too, but we can't deny what he's done for the WWE Championship belts. A staggering 1,000 days as champion. We're at the point where we are dying to know who will take the belt from Roman. Who does WWE see so much potential in that they believe would justify ending this streak? 

The Attitude Era had none of this. The titles meant next to nothing. And what is WWE without titles that mean *something?*  

While the Attitude Era was great and helped shape the future of WWE, it is often looked back on as the peak of wrestling when that is just simply not true. Feel free to change my mind though.

1,2023-10-18,CMV: Misogyny Stems From Ableism.,u/DayOk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17azy4v/cmv_misogyny_stems_from_ableism/,changemyview,"Misogyny is the hatred or distrust of women. Ableism is the discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities, especially physical disabilities. Misogyny is caused because men are seen as better, stronger, and more worthy of life, in contrast to women, who are viewed as weak, inferior, and replaceable.

The reason why I think that misogyny stems from ableism is because ableism discriminates against those who have disabilities or physical disadvantages. Since women, in general, have physical disadvantages compared to men, and misogyny is the hatred and distrust of women, you can deduce that misogyny stems from ableism. Women are primarily seen as inferior because their body is weaker than men's body. With this alone, you can conclude that misogyny is the specific ableism toward women.

#Why I believe we should abolish the electoral college

The electoral college provides uneven representation to citizens depending on which state they live in, which I believe to be quite arbitrary and unjustified.  It has resulted in presidential races that, multiple times within my life, failed to result in the president that the plurality of voters wanted.  We are all citizens of these united states.  And the office of the POTUS is meant to represent us all equally.  So we should all have equal power in choosing who fills that office.

It means that a lot of votes are wasted.  If you're a Democrat voting in Texas or a Republican voting in California, your vote is essentially not counted for the national race, and instead you are counted as a population in favor of the party you're voting against.

It creates a situation where the only way your individual vote could matter (even in nationally close elections) is if you happen to be one of the relatively few people living in a swing state.

It also more easily allows the flawed first-past-the-post election system to be replaced with something more efficient, like ranked choice voting.

#Arguments in favor of the Electoral College I've heard

I'm going to type out some arguments I've heard in favor of keeping the electoral college that I've heard and why I find them unconvincing.  If you think I've unfairly judged one of these reasons, feel free to bring it up again, but please not in a way that rehashes what I've already typed out here.


1. ""But the electoral college results in the side I like winning, so it's a good thing.""  Honestly, I think this is the primary reason for keeping the electoral college, but it's not a good reason to keep it.  People with disproportionate power like keeping their disproportionate power.  It's why dictators don't decide to abdicate and create democracies.  It doesn't mean the disproportionate power is a good thing. 

2. ""But the founding father's came up with it, so it must be right"" or ""here, people long ago wrote in the Federalist papers about how it was a good thing, so it must be good.""  I'd like to hope we can agree that the founding fathers coming up with a way of governing doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing.  We've changed a lot of things about the country since it first came about, like abolishing slavery and giving the vote to a wider population than just the land-owning white men.  These changes were good.  And the fact that they are changing things away from how the country originally existed doesn't make them bad.

3. ""We're a union of states, not a union of individuals.""  I guess that's the way things are set up, but it's usually not presented with any kind of reason that it should be this way, with respect to the Electoral College.  Just kind of a technical way things were set up.  It's confusing ""this is the way things are"" with ""this is the way things should be"".  And, as said in the previous point, we've made changes from how this country was set up before, that turned out to be beneficial.  If removing the EC would as well, this is no reason to prevent it.

4. ""But under the popular vote, I'm worried that some cities/states will decide elections.""  Under the popular vote, cities, states, and other tracts of land don't have power.  They don't vote; people vote.  That's kind of the whole premise of the popular vote.   I think, if you reword this to be more literal, it just becomes about not wanting a group of people who live close together to have as much power as the same-sized group of people who lives more spread out.  Also, under the electoral college, we pretty much are in a situation where a small number of states (swing states) choose the POTUS.

5. ""Abolishing the electoral college will cause a civil war"":  This one requires a lot of assumptions, since it's basically trying to predict the future, and I've never seen it presented with enough supporting evidence to make it persuasive.  Also, even if it were true, it wouldn't mean the electoral college is a good policy or should be kept.  Getting rid of slavery required a civil war.  And yes, that was was terrible and bloody.  But that's not a mark against abolition of slavery, or a reason why we shouldn't have abolished it.  Getting rid of slavery was still the right thing to do; it's just that the southern state's reaction that was bad.

6. ""Tyranny of the Majority"" or ""Democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep voting about what to have for dinner.""  I generally see these presented as quips without a lot of expounding upon them, because I think they fall apart if you try to look at them closely.  The bad part of ""tyranny of the majority"" is the ""tyranny"" part, not the ""majority"" part.  And the electoral college just gets rid of the majority part.  There's really nothing it does to prevent tyranny.  Rather, things like the establishment clause of the 1st amendment prevent tyranny of the majority (or the minority) in some specific cases.

7.  ""Rural voters just know more things and their votes should count for more.""  Usually presented with a lot of assumptions, or the belief that knowledge about the day-to-day of farming is the one determining factor of how much someone's vote should be counted and other kinds of knowledge are meaningless.  Also, even if it were true, weighing people's votes based on the state they live in is a pretty inaccurate way to get at the goal of trying to give farmers' weights more strength.

1,2023-10-18,cmv: As a gay man I'm wary of highly religious people,u/Ice-Kagen2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17b1ki1/cmv_as_a_gay_man_im_wary_of_highly_religious/,changemyview,"Let me clarify this: I'm an agnostic but I'm not against religious people. I know plenty of Christians and Muslims support LGBT and even sometimes are LGBT themselves. I have NO issue with those people at all. However, I feel like most of the time those people aren't devout believers. In the sense that they don't follow the teachings of their holy books to the letter and it's not as if they prayed every day or something. They even rarely bring up God in conversation. Some of my best friends are actually Christians/Muslims like that.  
  
However, I feel like most of the time, people who are like ""God this, God that"" every time you interact with them or who spam posts about religion on social media are generally very homophobic and misogynistic (it's never one or the other, it's always the full package). I mean, I can't really blame them because the Qur'An and the Bible explicitly state that homosexuality is a sin (and no matter how you try to twist it, that's what the text says. I won't buy into the ""it was a mistranslation"" argument). I like progressive Christians/Muslims but they don't follow their scriptures to the letter. However, I think that if people followed their holy books to the letter, they would be dangerous.  
  
That's why as a gay guy, I'm always wary when I see people spamming religious posts on social media. They make me feel unsafe and I absolutely want to avoid interacting with those people, because I assume they would judge me for my sexuality.  
  
I also feel like those people who spam religious posts on the Internet talk like brainwashed robots whose whole life is controlled by the scriptures (it must be true because the Bible says that, it must be wrong because the Bible says it is. Bad things are happening to me because I'm not close enough to God. If you're feeling bad in life, you should pray and try to get closer to God (even when they know I'm not a Christian). So that's another reason I want to avoid interacting with them, because according to those people, EVERYTHING has to be about religion, so it's difficult to have a meaningful conversation with them because they're always going to bring it up no matter what."

It is my view that all of their arguments are hilariously easy to defeat, the ""facts and logic"" they love to pretend to tout completely optional. You can use nothing more than emotional arguments to shut them down. Gun nuts rarely argue with facts, mostly resorting to ad hominem and low effort ""we'll see"", ""shall not be infringed"", or ""what's an assault weapon?"" responses when shown that the majority of Americans objectively hate their ideas. Most of, if not all the time, they report to the good ol' ""STACK UP AND TRY"" response. I've seen it a million times. This one is the most hilarious to see, as you know they're on the ropes and in the corner at this point. The correct response is to ask them what they'll do when the stack does in fact try. They are incapable of answering this. It shuts them down and they slink off to their echo chambers of fat wannabe soldiers to stroke their egos as we pass legislation that will make their guns illegal to own without proper registration with the government.

1,2023-10-18,CMV: Unicode is really badly designed,u/AhoyISki,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17b3nrk/cmv_unicode_is_really_badly_designed/,changemyview,"I'm not talking about the fact that a codepoint can vary between 1 and 4 bytes, instead, what I'm referring to is the thing that every person learning unicode quickly finds out:

> Not every codepoint is a character.

That, in my opinion, is really stupid.

If I were designing Unicode, I would make it so that every single symbol in unicode corresponded to at most 4 bytes.

My main reason for this is computer efficiency and ease for programmers. Currently, if you want to render characters, you have to:

1. Check how many bytes a character has;
2. Check for an image representing the character in a given font;
3. Check if the following character joins with the current one
  * If it does, change the current image to a new one;
  * Repeat the check for the next character;
4. Print the character;

But if every character was just a codepoint, you could

1. Check how many bytes a character has;
2. Check for an image representing the character in a given font;
4. Print the character;

And I know that the rendering pipeline is not that simple, there are other things to consider, such as ligatures or the direction of text. And you could certainly improve the efficiency of the 2 algorithms presented with clever computer tricks, but the point is: *The first piece of code will never be as efficient as the second one.*

This means that every single computer on earth, when rendering text, is being less efficient than it could be.

A prime example of this is most terminals. Most terminals support the rendering of grapheme clusters, such as long emojis. But most of the time, the rendering is incorrect, placing more than one emoji where there should have been only one, or putting too much space after the character.

Now, here's a few points in favor of the current standard, that I will argue against, trying to show why the ""advantages"" of the current system aren't real:

> Handling every single possible character would overwhelm the maximum number of characters that unicode allows

Currently, we use around 150 thousand characters of the possible 1 million. I really doubt that storing every character as a codepoint would increase that to even 200 thousand, considering that the scripts that can have a lot of graphemes (latin, arabic, emoji, korean, etc) don't have that many characters in them, so multiplying the number of codepoints by an extreme number like 10 (assuming 10 variations for each character) would barely make a dent.

> It makes more sense for some languages, like korean

The argument for korean is that characters are composed of parts, and having them separate would be intuitive when typing.

I agree with that, but that doesn't mean that, after the text is already typed, we couldn't just join them (which we already do).

My issue is when that isn't an option, and the programmer -- and by extension, the computer -- is forced to handle the possibility of the following character joining with the current one.

> Rendering of certain characters composed of multiple graphemes would be incorrect

I actually think this is a good thing, since text applications are supposed to normalize all the unicode input that comes their way, incorrect rendering would be a very visible bug, representing a failure in the normalization code. It would make this kind of bug more visible to developers.

> Algol text wouldn't be possible!

...

My point is, this ""feature"" of unicode brings nothing but pain for programmers, and there are absolutely no advantages to it for anyone else."

10 black kids get shot in the hood with Glocks, no one bats an eye.

But if 10 white kids get shot at an elementary school, everyone loses their minds.

It’s really sad that people aren’t as up in arms about gang shootings as they are if a psycho decides to shoot up a grocery store in New York. For every 6 year old that gets killed by an AR-15 at school, there are several black kids and adults that die from gun violence in poor neighborhoods.

A significant majority of mass shootings aren’t even the stereotypical AR-15 wielding lunatic kills school children. According to Everytown Research, 46 percent of mass shootings with 4 or more people killed involve the perpetrator shooting a former intimate partner or family member.

Even when you take into account all mass shooting deaths where 4 or more people are wounded or killed, only about 600 people died in these kinds of shootings, which pales in comparison to the over 40,000 people who died in car accidents the same year.

https://everytownresearch.org/mass-shootings-in-america/

Also, according to the FBI, over 6,000 murders were committed using a handgun while only 364 people were killed with any kind of rifle, whether it was a hunting rifle or a 30-06

The UK passed a series of increasingly stringent gun laws, with the most significant being passed in the 1980s. Despite guns effectively being banned, homicides continued to increase throughout the 80's and 90's, until finally decreasing 16 years after guns were banned.  
In Australia, after the Port Arthur massacre, guns were effectively banned. While it is true there was a modest and gradual decline in homicides, the decline was inline with trend rates and didn't seem to accelerate. Like the UK, Australia saw an increase in homicides throughout the 80s and 90s, before peaking and declining. Over the last decade, the private gun ownership rate in Australia has increased significantly, returning to about 70% of the rate of the rate before Port Arthur. Despite this significant increase in private gun ownership rate, there was no correlative increase in homicides outside of trend rates.  
Meanwhile, the largest decrease in homicides out of any advanced economy has been in America. Like the UK and Australia, America saw a rapid increase in homicides during the 80s and 90s. Despite an increasing rate of private gun ownership, the per capita homicide rates declined drastically during the 00's and into the late 2010s. In fact, America's homicide rate in the late 2010s dropped below the UKs homicide rate in the 90s.   
All 3 of these countries have since seen increases in homicide rates.  
What this demonstrates is that gun laws seem to have very little, if any, impact on actual homicide rates. Since the purpose of gun bans supposed to be curtailing homicides, I see no evidence that support gun bans. Owning a gun will increase you risk of suicide, accidental deaths, etc., but this is true for swimming pools; swimming pools are, statistically, more dangerous to own than guns. I think owning a gun is stupid, but things aren't banned because they are stupid.  
Since this is a non-issue, I believe we should default to liberty. "

Before I make the pro-Israel folks angry let me start off by doing the basics that's asked of everyone who even suggests that Palestinian people are human beings . Yes, I condemn Hamas. Yes I condemn the barbaric attack on Israel soil. Yes I condemn harming innocent Israeli civilians. Yes Israel has a right to self defense. I condemn anything you ask me to condemn as a Palestine supporter. Please be kind here. I am open to seeing different perspectives. If you are a decent person, you will acknowledge that both Israelis and Palestinians have human rights. This is a hard issue, because both Muslims and Jews have been seriously persecuted, so I know it's personal to many. 

What Israel is doing right now is collective punishment. They are punishing all 2 millions Gazans for the actions of Hamas. First they restricted food, water, electricity until Hamas releases the hostages. Can we all stop playing dumb? We KNOW Hamas doesn't care about Palestinian lives. If they did they would've never attacked Israeli civilians in the first place knowing exactly what would happen as a result. So, the idea that you are going to convince Hamas to release the hostages by starving their people is laughable. Israel isn't stupid. They know this. Also, if Gaza has no access to food, water, electricity, do you think the hostages are going to have access to that? Do you think if supplies became very short, that Hamas will give the hostages food/water or themselves? Do you think making Hamas even more angry is going to help the hostages at all? 

I keep hearing pro-Israel supporters saying that Israel gives Palestine water and other things for free. Gaza is literally not allowed to regulate their own water. Military order 158 by Israel prevents them from having access to their own water, it all goes to Israel. The water that Israel does give Gaza has been accused of contamination. Israel will also cut off the water and weaponize it whenever they feel like it. I'm all for Israel stopping water supply to Gaza, but you have got to let them regulate and have access to their own water. 

The amount of war crimes Israel has committed in the October ""conflict"" alone is outrageous. The use of white phosphorous is a war crime. Expecting 2 million people to run to the south of Gaza in 24 hours has to be a sick joke. Israel has been accused of bombing the safe routes after telling Gazans to go there. Where exactly are they supposed to go? The surrounding Arab nations (who are traitors to the Muslim people for not helping Palestinians) aren't letting them in. They can't go into Israel. Are they supposed to go to the sea? Israel bombed the safe routes on the way there. They bombed medical personal after giving them permission to enter and rescue. These people are being bombed in an open air prison. 

Israel has bombed schools, refugee camps, hospitals, residential areas now and in the past. This is nothing knew. The number 1 excuse we always hear is Hamas Hamas Hamas. The buildings were Hamas hiding spaces. Does anyone not find it suspicious that Israel had NO IDEA Hamas was hiding in those exact places they are bombing now before the terror attack (otherwise they would've dealt with it.) The terror attack happens and now all of a sudden, they know exactly where Hamas is in Gaza. Look, noone likes it, but Hamas is the government of Gaza, so all buildings and areas are Hamas buildings and areas. Palestinians have never said anyone is using them as human shields. Hamas is awful, we all agree they need to go, but let's tell the truth here. Even if Hamas was gone, Israel still oppresses the Palestinians and there would be no peace. They were committing human rights abuses against the Arabs prior to Hamas existence in the 1980's. Israel was founded and created and they started the ethnic cleansing and massacre of Arabs in the Nakba 1948. No Hamas was there then. 

Now let's talk about how Israel lead to the creation of Hamas. We have seen time and time again in the Middle East that when a young boy watches his family get blown up, it radicalizes him. Instead of dealing with his grief properly, he seeks revenge. Is that an excuse to join a terror group, FUCK NO. But this is something we notice throughout the Middle East when the US was bombing it and creating mass civilian casualties and destroying their countries. Every war torn area has created an Islamic extremism terror problem (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Afghanistan, Pakistan). That is not a coincidence. I fully believe that if Middle East was not destroyed by war, Muslim countries would not have a terror problem. Back to Israel, when you commit human rights abuses again and again on a population, and you bomb them in ""self defense"" and take their loved ones from them, then yes, they will seek revenge. It changes them. They will go to extreme lengths, because now they don't care about anything except vengeance. That is why Hamas formed in the 1980's. You can wipe Hamas out, but until you address the root problem, then Hamas can disappear and another terror group will replace it. I promise you what Israel is doing right now will radicalize a new generation. 

Finally, the hospital attack. I am fully convinced Israel is behind that attack and is lying so they don't get international outrage and consequences. If you watched the video, you can see the bomb was done by a very advanced looking missle. Hamas only has rockets and guns. Not a chance they have access to something that advanced. Not a chance they are intelligent enough to make it on their own. That type of weapon is only in the hands of Israel. Next, the IDF posted a tweet blaming Islamic Jihad. They posted a video. They edited the tweet and deleted their video. Israel's digital spokesman (appointed by Netanyahu I believe) posted a tweet saying IDF did it because there was a terror base. He deleted his tweet later and said it was Hamas. Finally, this isn't the first time Israel accused Palestine for their own crimes. If you remember Israel accused Palestine of killing Shireen Abu Akleh. Then later, they admit it was them. Israel admit it was them. 

That's all. Feel free to change my mind. "

They require you to put everything else on pause for literal years, being a halfway decent parent and doing anything else remotely time consuming is nearly impossible.

If you have a partner this will put at least a bit of a strain on things. Worst case, the relationship crumbles due to the stress of having the child and now the kid, who didnt ask to be created even, has to deal with two unhappy parents that hate each other.

You have to be strong for them and pretend the world is all happy and easy for their sake, you have to lie about how the world works for a long time, every day.

Having a biological child requires you or you partner be in a lot of pain and discomfort for 9 months before being in pure agony for hours during labor and delivery. I cant even imaginr that and id never want to subject my partner to that. Adopting puts that pain on someone else.

Meaning that does not mean I believe the current method in which bailouts are implement are what is best. 

I am saying I think the rationale behind it makes more sense to me. So no need to tell me that a CEO in charge at the time was able to make off with $17 million and keep their job.  No need to tell me that the company would take more silly risk knowing that the government would bail them out when they fail. I will agree with you on thinking that’s wrong. It’s never really a good look to reward someone’s failure with someone else’s money. 

Again, in theory, in an imaginary perfect world, I think it would make more sense to bail out a large corporation than lots of individuals. 


I am a believer that capitalism is mostly positive. I believe that people who are against any and all parts of capitalism are either lying or they are just completely ignorant about how they benefit from it and would quickly complain if it was to disappear. I think a large corporation is much more valuable to the economy than any individual.

Many individuals are lazy. Many have horrible work ethic. Many have poor money managing skills. Many have drug additions. Many have health issues. Many are poorly educated. 

*I don’t think many individuals would turn a bailout into an opportunity to better themselves.* 

I think the money would be spent and those individuals would be right back in the same position. Never becoming a benefit to society. 

However, a corporations goal is profits. Their goods and or services are used by millions. Their continued presence in people’s lives would be of a benefit. It would be much easier to account for the money, make sure it goes where it should. Their profits would also be a return back to the government. Lots of individuals who would blow their money on useless crap and really never contribute ever again. 

Also CMV: 

For me to think bailing out millions of individuals would be a good idea, I think it would need to be certain individuals. People with a good track record of employment (no one who has worked [non temp] jobs at 5 places in the last year), people with a good credit score, people who have not been convicted of certain crimes and small business owners of a certain nature.

1,2023-10-18,CMV: Presidential debates should be done through reddit,u/Hatrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17b8meb/cmv_presidential_debates_should_be_done_through/,changemyview,"Many of you may have read about have the 5 o clock shadow of Nixon cost him the election against Kennedy. You don't find that bizarre? That a 5 o clock shadow determined who the president is?  
Voice, appearance, body movement, charsima, vocabulary, tone, etc.. these have nothing to do with how good of a president you will be. Yet they influence who wins. When you are conducting a research study, you try to control for all variables, so they don't influence the outcome. For example, if you are giving drug A to 50 people and drug B to 50 people, you will want those 50 vs 50 to be as similar as possible, to find the true effect that the drugs are having.  
So why should it be any different in terms of a debate? We want to know who is RIGHT. Who is closer to the TRUTH. Or at least who has the BETTER ideas. Who cares if you pass a stimulus package with a nice smile to a neat tie? The only thing that matters is the stimulus package and whether it makes sense.  
By making debates via text, online, the only confounding variables would be vocabulary/writing style. But it would at least get rid of all the other types of irrelevant variables such as appearance, voice, body movement, etc...  
I think the majority of people tend to think whoever is more charismatic, or has better vocabulary or a better voice has ""won"" the debate, when none of these variables have any logical bearing on who has the better ideas or who is closer to the truth.  
Similarly, one major issue plaguing politics is how corporations and billionaires have too much influence on politicians, because they fund their election campaigns. If elections were done through via post debates, then there would be no need for campaigning, and this issue would be solved. We are in 2023, this is not the 1950s anymore, what is the point of a presidential candidate going to a factory and shaking hands with workers to pretend they care about them or are part of them. It is so phony, and expensive, and unnecessary."

It has to exist regardless of thought, interpretation, opinion and coincide with the actual real world. Morality is inherently a BELIEF system. What's moral in immoral is going to vary from person to person, culture to culture etc. But morality inherently can't be verified through a lense, it can't be tested, there's no universal laws behind it. So therefore it's an oxymoron to say that there is an OBJECTIVE morality. And lots of people try to use religion or a god to try to appeal to morality but that's an issue as well. Because first of all that's just an appeal to authority. That has nothing to do with whether or not an action is moral or immoral. You're just appealing to a higher power that you don't even know for sure exist because it's inherently a faith based belief system. If you use divine command theory in order to say something is immoral or not my question is, does god say something is moral because it's moral or is it moral just because god says so? If you choose the second option than I guess rape, murder, incest and so on can just be morally justifiable just because a god says so. And if you chose the first option than it's irrelevant what the good thinks because it's seperate from him. Another problem with the religous view is that there's no universal view of interpretation of scripture. There's difference types of Christian's, Muslims etc that disagree on what the nature of god entails. So if morality is objective than who's to say that isis, Hamas, Sunni, Shia, Catholics Protestants, Mormons etc. are wrong for their moral view because they all appeal to a god for their views on morality. That is why I think that morality inherently can't be objective. Because you have to appeal to some type of entity whether it be a god, religion, society which is forever changing to decide on it. Morality isn't something that inherently exists it's a human concept. Nobody really says animals are engaging in moral or immoral behaviour because again morality is a HUMAN CONCEPT. If I were to say that lions are carnivores that would be true irregardless of human interpretation. But if I were to say that ""it's wrong for that monkey to beat that squirrel to death"" that wouldn't be true or untrue outside of my human preference. Because again morality is a social concept."

1,2023-10-19,CMV: Beastiality is not inherently morally wrong.,u/Seiko_23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bd4g5/cmv_beastiality_is_not_inherently_morally_wrong/,changemyview,"I’d like to start off by saying that I’m not attracted to animals in the least bit. I think beastiality is disgusting. But, I think scat is disgusting too, doesn’t mean it makes it immoral.

So, the first and obvious argument would be the fact that it can harm the animal sometimes. This is true for penetrative sex with some animals, especially small ones. But beastiality isn’t necessarily about penetrative sex. It can basically be smearing peanut butter on your genitals and letting the dog lick it for example.

The other one would be consent. Here’s the thing, we do all sorts of stuff to animals without their consent. We inject them with antibiotics, make them live long, miserable lives, milk them dry and kill them for their meat, imprison them for their companionship, post pictures of them on social media etc, all without their consent. If you did those to a human without their consent, it wouldn’t be acceptable so we do believe as a society that animals don’t deserve the same rights as humans already. (Not a vegan btw) I’d say slitting the throat of a cow is a lot more harmful to the animal than stroking it for example? Why are sexual encounters treated specially? They don’t always harm the animal.

The third one I can think about is STD’s. Which is probably the best argument. You could argue that it is morally wrong to have sex with random animals without testing them, sure, but what if you do test them and they don’t have any STD’s?

So I don’t see why beastiality is considered wrong by society. Do you have any arguments against it?"

1,2023-10-19,CMV: Doubtful ADHD really exists,u/Thoronar3DArt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17belm6/cmv_doubtful_adhd_really_exists/,changemyview,"There's not a specific neurobiological cause for ADHD in the way that there is for parkinsons with the substantia nigra. Instead there's basically two pieces of evidence used for the existence of ADHD:  
  
1) Brains of people with ADHD tend to have abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and dopaminergic mesolimbic pathways  
2) If someone has ADHD, their twin and other family members are much more likely to have it  
  
The problem with this is that:  
  
1) The brain changes associated with ADHD are very similar to a lot of other conditions - especially addiction (hypofrontality, decreased D2 dopamine receptors). Most notably, both the brain abnormalities and symptoms of ADHD are basically indistinguishable from internet addiction. Even beyond that, tons of other health conditions are associated with prefrontal and dopaminergic dysfunction (depression, aging, poor nutrition/neurotoxin exposure), etc.  
  
2) Lots of conditions that are not innate have high heritability. Some studies have found that if a twin is obese, there's a 70% chance that the other twin will be obsese. This is fairly close to the heritability of ADHD. But you're obviously not born obese - you may have a genetic predisposition that makes you more likely to become obese, and/or social/environmental factors that make you more likely to become obese, but it's fundamentally the result of your diet and lifestyle.  
  
Really hard to prove that ADHD is its own independent condition, rather than a symptom of underlying conditions (internet addiction, substance addiction, health or nutrition issues, emotional issues, separate neurological issues). Also seems really damaging to tell someone that they have an incurable neurological disorder that they'll have to manage for the rest of their life, when it may just be a reversible symptom of something else."
1,2023-10-19,CMV: Blaming people for not voting for the lesser evil over the party not capturing them is not productive.,u/PandaDerZwote,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17beuwo/cmv_blaming_people_for_not_voting_for_the_lesser/,changemyview,"Today I was once again confronted with someone on Twitter saying that topic x will probably lead to people not voting Democrat in the future and a dozen or so answers from people saying that these people not voting Democrat are the ones to blame is Republicans come to power. (And just for clarity: Any argument who is or isn't the greater evil is irrelevant for the view itself, but I think it is clearly the Republicans, just to play with open cards here)  

This kind of rhetoric has always existed but I personally became acutely aware of it after the 2016 election. And I don't really think it holds up any water if your goal is actually trying to ensure that the greater evil doesn't come into power.  
In my view, you're asking a single person to give up quite literally all the leverage they have in this political system (their vote) and expect them to not want anything in return. As long as you're the lesser of two evils, you are owed their vote and no matter if you yourself become less palatble to them, the onus is on them to still vote for you. In my view that has it exactly backwards, you have millions of decentralized players that are all binary in their leverage (They vote for you or they don't) while the big party is centralized and can make concessions on thousands of points. I believe it to be misguided to seek the blame on the voters, when the party should clearly be the first target. If you don't manage to motivate people to vote for you over the greater evil, that's on you, first and foremost.  
For me this doesn't compute, why should those people give up any and all leverage and be the ones responsible to beat back fascism while the party isn't even asked to give up anything, like moving to the left on some issues?

And even if that doesn't work for you for any kind of moral or ethical reason, from a purely logistical standpoint, trying to shame millions of voters for voting for you or else you will tell them they enable fascism is not as fruitful as trying to capture people when the other option is outright fascism. From a purely logistical standpoint, the Democratic party has much more concessions to make before it, in my opinion, is more feasible to ask voters to make the one and only concession that they have.  

Another argument that I read is that those people are just whiny and entitled and are not making the sensible decision over any number of perceived slights (like in 2016 when people accused Bernie fans to be sore losers and not vote for Hillary) when in reality, people are getting motivated for any candidate that is even slightly to the left of the average Democrat. I don't think this binary of ""Either I get EVERYTHING or I ain't gonna vote for you"" exists in any meanigful number of people. And for those that it exists in, they are not the kind you shame into voting for you anyways."
1,2023-10-19,CMV: Karma(spiritual) is same thing as trauma(or anti-trauma). Let me explain.,u/lifeInquire,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bfqzf/cmv_karmaspiritual_is_same_thing_as_traumaor/,changemyview,"""Trauma is an emotional response to a terrible event like an accident, or natural disaster.""

""Psychological trauma is a response to an event that a person finds highly stressful.""

We only talk about trauma, when one incident changes our entire life, for the worse. We only call something trauma when something really big has happened. When people go through abuse, or some accident; and then later, when the situation has passed, they are still affected by the past-incident, we call this as trauma.

Loosely speaking, trauma is anything negative, that stays in mind even when the situation has passed.

So if you think about it, small hurts are actually same as the big traumas we talked about, only difference is that we are less affected by them, but all other things are same. We randomly remember embarrassing instances from years ago, because we still ""care"" about those situations. We still in the present, do not want people to know about this situation that happened in the past, we have not gotten comfortable with it, we have not processed it fully.

When they talk about Karma they say the same thing. One difference is that when they talk about Karma, they talk about good karma and bad karma. Bad karma is same as what I described above. Good karma is when you are living in a good situation that has happened in the past, and has passed, but in the present, you are still kind of fantasizing about that situation(lets call it anti-trauma). It feels good, but it robs your present moment just as bad karma does. That one feels bad, this one feels good.

I am writing all this because Karma is seen as very supernatural thing, and trauma is seen as very practical thing. I want to establish that at that time, they used the word karma to mean this exactly same thing.

Even if it's something you’re not naturally drawn to, but its sudden popularity can leave you wondering what all the hype is about.  
It’s normal for things to trend, but why do people blindly follow them even if they’re misleading for our health and society?

According to psychology, this tendency is called The bandwagon effect.  
People naturally tend to follow the crowd. Research shows we do not have as much control over our thoughts and behavior as we think. Sometimes, we follow it because we feel pressured. In most cases, We compare ourselves to others, especially people around us and then try to act and change to be more like our surroundings.

And most surprising thing is that bandwagon effect has positive and negative effects and people choose to overlook them just because of the fear of missing out

I believe this is disturbing because what happens is that our detached, irony-poisoned culture is portrayed as being intelligent. Doubting things, being cynical, not showing emotion - it is all seen as traits of as being smart.  Nowadays kids are raised on the internet, and it is pointless to give counter arguments and try to say it is the role of parents because that is simply not happening with the majority.

For example, anti-feminist videos tend to focus on feminist being emotional, rather than critiquing feminism (which you can do). This gives the impression that someone is wrong because they are emotional, even though being emotional about injustice and happiness seems pretty good and important.

While I acknowledge the value that religion holds for many individuals, I believe that eliminating religion could potentially lead to a more harmonious and peaceful world. Here are some points to consider, particularly in the context of how religion has historically contributed to conflicts:

1. Reduction in Religious Conflicts: It's undeniable that a significant number of conflicts and wars throughout history have been fueled or directly caused by religious differences. Eliminating religion could greatly reduce these tensions, leading to a more peaceful world.

2. Promotion of Secular Values: In a world without religion, there would likely be a stronger emphasis on secular values such as reason, human rights, and equality. This could foster more inclusive societies where people are judged by their actions rather than their religious beliefs.

3. Tolerance and Acceptance: A world without religious divisions might encourage greater acceptance and tolerance of diverse viewpoints and lifestyles. The absence of religious dogma could pave the way for more open-minded societies.

4. Paradox of Separation: It's ironic that religion, which often aims to bring people together in faith based communities, has also contributed to division and separation. Religious differences have led to prejudices, discrimination, and even violence, creating rifts between different faith groups. The absence of religion could help bridge these divides, promoting a more united and interconnected global society.

It’s also important to recognize that faith also brings comfort, guidance, and a sense of community to many people. The complete elimination of religion may not be feasible or desirable for everyone. Religion has done more harm than good for humanity, so change my view."

This creates an unhealthy hivemind mentality where people pile on downvotes once a comment already has a negative score.  
Shouldn't it display both?  
Seeing only the net score makes a -100 comment look like everyone disagrees, even though the real counts could be 11,000 upvotes and 11,100 downvotes. That's still a very mixed opinion overall!  
Only showing net scores makes people scared to share minority opinions, since they'll assume no one agrees if the visible score is negative. This strengthens echo chambers and discourages healthy debate.Reddit should show both upvote and downvote counts, or at least show the ratio of upvote %.  
That would give a much more nuanced look at public opinion.For example, a score of -20 with a ratio of 45% would indicate a very divisive comment that some agree with. But the way it looks now, -20 appears like overwhelming disagreement.  
Showing both numbers would lead to less pile-on downvoting and more reasoned discussion. People would be more willing to express minority opinions knowing others agree. And seeing the upvote count might make some reconsider a downvote.Reddit already tracks both numbers internally.  
Making them visible would be an easy change to reduce hivemind mentality and echo chambers. The resulting discussions would be more representative of variety in public opinion, not just the majority viewpoint. Am I missing something here?"

1,2023-10-19,CMV: The Democratic Party should support financial abortions in an effort to attract men,u/Fantastic-Surround,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bm2bp/cmv_the_democratic_party_should_support_financial/,changemyview,"Discussions of liberals' lack of appeal to men has been fairly common for a while, as seen in \[threads like this with hundreds of comments\](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vpy91u/cmv\_the\_left\_helped\_radicalize\_moderate\_men/), and much of it comes down to arguing about the abstract notions of maleness, the woes of modern dating, how masculinity can be toxic or non-toxic, how liberals can somehow try to display masculinity to take men back from conservatives, etc. Personally, I have strong doubts that the perceived lack of masculinity or difficulty in getting dates is why men stop voting for Democrats, and any efforts to push liberal-leaning male role models may end up backfiring due to the message being seen as manufactured and ham-fisted. Instead, I believe that, if Democrats wish to bring men back, then they must show how their proposed policies can actually aid men. They need to make an effort to specifically appeal/pander to men (choose either verb depending on which connotation you prefer).  
  
To that end, I feel that liberals could benefit by actually proposing a policy that could aid a great majority of men, and one idea that has come up before often online but rarely seriously discussed offline is the concept of financial abortion, also known as legal paternal surrender, in which a man could legally absolve themselves of financial responsibilities as a parent by opting out before a certain period of time, some time before the deadline for the pregnant woman to undergo an abortion.  
  
 \- I consider this to be the perfect policy to lead with, since it is a policy that will primarily cater to men while keeping in line with Democrats' values of reproductive freedom. Democrats have pushed for many policies that specifically benefit mostly women such as abortion rights, Title IX, and so on (all of which I also support), but nothing that is directly marketed to men, particularly those related to sexual matters. While many policies that are primarily intended to help women can also be useful to men, no policies have been made to specifically increase Democratic appeal to men. If financial abortion is proposed by Democrats, then it will be seen as a move to specifically court men. At the moment, even Republicans have come up with very few laws that are specifically made to pander to male voters, so this could be a great opportunity to be seized by Democrats.  
  
 \- Additionally, supporting financial abortion rights will put an end to bickering and unite people under a common goal. Men who are into financial abortion rights often ask, women get abortion rights, so why can't men get something of a parallel to abortion? Often the response to these men is that they should not have had sex, and said men will retort that such an answer is no different from conservatives telling women that they should have had their legs closed. Those opposed to financial abortion will attempt to come up with a justification as to how they are completely different, and the supporters of financial abortion will somehow find a way to argue that they aren't so different. Just giving men the right to financial abortion will end this pointless debate.  
  
 \- I think that feminists will also find financial abortion rights useful as well. Often, the idea of financial abortions have been promoted by men's rights activists who were needlessly hostile to feminists, and the feminists then developed a knee-jerk reaction against such ideas as well. However, I believe that, upon consideration, feminists will find the idea welcoming. If men are given the right to abdicate the responsibities of potential parenthood, they are also surrendering the right to the fetus inside the body, freeing women even further from men's wishes. With no responsibilities come no rights. Not to mention that the existence of financial abortion rights necessitates the legality and protection of abortion access, so this can be used to encourage men to come out in droves to actively support pro-choice campaigns as well. Both physical abortion and financial abortion rights complement each other."

Infertile men see what not being able to provide their part is doing to their partner. Choosing to have children is fundamental and life-changing if successful. Taking the step to have biological children comes from a deeply rooted desire to be a parent. Many women will say they always dreamt of being a mother. Many people who are unsuccessful naturally go to great lengths to eventually be successful. Particularly women subject their bodies to invasive procedures. If all this fails, it is not unlike any other great hardship people face, such as the death of a parent. It creates deep wrinkles in the relationship. A big part of what that couple imagined for themselves is out of reach. If a couples’ infertility is caused by a male factor, a woman might have a shot at the life envisioned with a different partner. Society might frown upon a woman leaving her partner for this reason. I disagree. I think women should be given the option of finding a new relationship (where having children is back on the table) over being expected to accept that they may never be a biological mother just to continue the relationship."

But it’s also important to understand how they got here. Israel has been occupying arab territories since 1967. They obtained these territories in an offensive (albeit preemptive) war. Most people in these territories were forcibly expelled from Israel proper in 1948.  There was hardly any terrorism in Israel prior to 1967. The arab citizens of Israel were able to integrate because they had citizenship with equal rights.

Most people in Israel and the west aren’t aware of the sheer brutality of the military occupation. Palestinians in the West Bank have been living under martial law for 56 years. They are tried in military courts, and thrown in military prisons. They can’t travel between villages without going through checkpoints. Every aspect of their lives are HEAVILY regulated. 

Palestinians grew increasingly disillusioned by the moderate PLO in the early 2000s. Israel’s peace offers were extremely lopsided. Israel refused to even entertain the arab counter-offers. Israel has no interest in respecting the PLO. Israel has a massive military and the PLO has nothing, why would they? 

The more Palestinians get killed, the more popular hamas becomes. The cycle of violence will keep escalating if this continues. 

The only possible outcomes of this are:

1- Palestinians are all expelled
2- Palestinians are all killed 
3- A comprehensive peace agreement that respects the Palestinians is reached"

As a typical ""who cares"" type of man I don't normally care about such, but even I couldn't stand the stupid pants the guy was wearing. So, then I started to scroll through the possibilities of reddit avatars and was shocked to find that there were almost no dresses, skirts, gowns, or traditionally feminine style of dress that weren't ALSO the cutesy animal types. Sure, one could argue that in today's time women can (and should) wear what suits their fancy even if such is the traditional ""masculine"" attire. However, the other side to that coin is that options for more traditionally feminine styles are also more than valid for women to pick (AND for men as well!!!). 


Isn't half the point of reddit and the avatars to be a platform for self-expression. Isn't the avatar supposed to, in part, be a visual expression of one's personality. If most of the types of clothes that the little reddit person wears correspond to different types of dress in reality and also in fantasy shouldn't that include a significant amount of feminine attire? 

Additionally, as I think entirely uncontroversial, women's fashion is significantly more diverse than men's. My head starts to spin when women reference all the different types of shirts, shorts, dresses, etc. And, yet, for the reddit avatar we don't see that happening. Where's my ankle length skirt and apron? Where's my tube top (or crop top, I don't know) with bell-bottoms (or flared legs as someone told me is now the term of art). Why don't we have gosh-darn leggingss? Maybe I'm blind.

Why can't we style a little reddit man (because it does present as masculine) with boobs? Why don't we have a more feminine version with wider hips and a thinner waist? Almost every major video game with a create a character function has that. Why doesn't reddit.

Lastly, and to my extreme chagrin, when looking back over the options I was shocked to find that a great, great deal of the more feminine outfits are locked behind a paywall... so now you mean to tell me that in order to have a character that looks like you or expresses your feminine style you have to pay for it? What is this????

---

I would like to give some arguments that I don't find particularly persuasive in the way that I understand them currently in order that conversation can progress into the substance of our potential disagreement without forcing me to roll out objections and replies that I've already thought of. Could I be persuaded by modified versions of these? Sure, possibly... but I think it will be more helpful for me to ""get out ahead"" of them just a touch.

1) It's gonna cost and be more expensive to create the art for it.

Reply: really? Multi-million dollar company can't hire someone from deviant art or compensate a redditor from a contest (hell, people would give away their characters for free in contest form I'm sure) to use their art for a few more outfits for the avatar? Doesn't seem right here.

2) Reddit man doesn't have a sex nor a gender. Therefore, all clothes are neither masculine nor feminine. 

Reply: I think this is simply untrue. Do you mean to tell me that we don't associate certain hairstyles with women and men? Do you mean to say that the very dresses that are on offer aren't feminine. Do you mean to argue that the one floral dress bottom isn't feminine? Do you want to argue that slacks and a suit that you can do doesn't look masculine... I think not.

3) Women care more about the style and avatar. Reddit is a business and wants to make money to run the site. Recent financials ain't the best (or at least could be improved). If women care more than men and would be persuaded to buy dresses, reddit should lock them out behind a pay-wall.

reply: [tries not to swear]... What? Really. That just seems quite unfair and it essentially presents an unfair tax on a large group of people simply based upon wanting to have an avatar that represents them. Even if the argument is true, we shouldn't agree with it for moral reasons and due to the gut-check ""ick"" feeling associated with such scummy practices.

All in all, I'm excited to see what arguments ya'll come up with for this. I think my view is pretty strong and will be victorious over scrutiny and counter. However, I'm more than willing to change my mind on this because I have a sinking feeling that I'm missing something or that I'm blind, or that I'm just wrong for unforseen reasons. It's just something that has bothered me since last night, and I just can't get it out of my head... even as a dude who doesn't care about this sort of thing a great deal, I just had an ""urrrg"" off feeling upon my realization."

in america, guns have more rights then women. i refer you back to what i just said about the overturning of roe v wade. and yet, there are more relaxed laws for an instrument of death because of the second amendment.  
  
in america, blatant bigots are elected to political office. as a matter of fact, it's mostly because these politicians are so bigoted that they get elected in the first place. they often use their bigotry to appeal to likeminded bigots. and also, some people don't even vote which is part of the problem.  
  
in america, people refuse treatment because of medical debt. these people are literally choosing to die rather then put their families into debt. and so many people are against free healthcare because they may have to pay more in taxes. well pray tell, what's worse? having to pay a bit more in taxes or dying of an easily treatable disease because you can't afford treatment?  
  
in america, parents are allowed to refuse vaccines for their children. you know, doctors have said that if this many anti vaxxers had existed during the time that polio was such a big problem, polio wouldn't have been reduced.  
  
in america, the people in power are powerless to do anything to help with change due to having their power restricted. the people who actually want to try to make changes can't do so because the constitution restricts what they can do. the president cannot make doctor fees payable by taxes, cannot make gun control laws, cannot mandate vaccines, cannot legalize abortion nationwide. why? because their power is restricted. what is the point of having all that power if you can't do anything with it? if you think about it, it kinda makes the whole position of president extremely pointless.

1,2023-10-19,CMV: People should explicitly use an expected value framework when discussing/deciding who to vote for.,u/onomatopoeiahadafarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bqpcd/cmv_people_should_explicitly_use_an_expected/,changemyview,"CMV: People should explicitly use an expected value framework when discussing/deciding who to vote for.

What is expected value? You can Google technical definitions, but essentially it boils down to the idea of a weighted average. In certain contexts, it can be used to help people make decisions, because it can balance the likelihood of an outcome with the benefit of that outcome if it occurs.

For example: lets assume that historically, a basketball player makes 80% of her 2-point shots and 30% of her 3-point shots. The next time she wants to shoot, all else being equal, which should she attempt? Well, the expected value of a 3-point shot would be 0.3*3 = 0.9 points, and the expected value of a 2-point shot is 0.8*2 = 1.6 points. You could think of this as the ""return on investment"": on average, in the long run, 3-point shots will have a lower return on investment than 2-point shots for this player. So, all else being equal, she should attempt a 2-point shot, because it has a higher expected value, or a higher return on investment.

Whether consciously or subsconsciously, I think most people use some version of this framework for most decisions in life. Using an expected value framework is essentially a way to combine a pro-con list and a strategy for managing uncertainty. (Note: sometimes, people make ""bad"" decisions because they miscalculate the likelihood of an outcome, or the benefit/detriment of an outcome. For example, most of the time, buying a lottery ticket carries a negative expected value--it's a money-losing proposition on average--but people might still buy one because they have no real sense of how improbable 1:300,000,000 odds really are.)

So, with that background, my view is that people should use this framework when deciding who to vote for, too. (Note: I'm generally coming at this from a U.S. perspective with respect to FPTP voting, but would be open to thinking more about other contexts and voting systems if you want to highlight those in the comments.)

Let's say you have 3 presidential candidates. Here are their key platforms and polling averages.

A: Wants to impose a 75% marginal tax bracket on individual incomes greater than $5,000,000, and wants to use this additional revenue to fund universal ""Medicare for all""-style healthcare, eliminate all student debt, and dramatically subsidize renewable energy companies. Candidate A has been consistently polling at 10% in national surveys.

B: Wants to close a handful of tax loopholes for fossil fuel companies, and wants to cancel $10,000 in student loans per borrower. Also wants to expand military spending and wants to ""build the wall"" between the U.S. and Mexico. Candidate B has been consistently polling at 45% in national surveys.

C: Wants to slash marginal income tax rates, eliminate multiple federal departments, and enforce a national abortion ban at 15 weeks. Wants to nominate justices to the Supreme Court who would dramatically expand the scope of the Second Amendment. Candidate C has been consistently polling at 45% in national surveys.

After reflecting on their platforms, let's assume that on a scale of -10 to 10, where -10 is absolutely take the country in the wrong direction, and 10 is absolutely take the country in the right direction, you would score: Candidate A as a 9, Candidate B as a 3, and Candidate C as a -10.

Then, if you assume that the candidates' polling averages are reasonably accurate estimates of the likelihood that they will be elected (big if, but let's stick with that assumption), then based on an expected value framework, I would argue that you should vote for Candidate B, because that vote would carry the highest expected value for you:

EV(A) = 9*0.1 = 0.9
EV(B) = 3*0.45 = 1.35
EV(C) = -10*0.45 = -4.5

I think that an expected value framework is valuable (pun sort-of intended) because it would force people to be explicit in disentangling how likely a candidate is to win with how much good they perceive would come from their election. I think it would also help people who support different candidates have constructive conversations about their differences because it would force people to use some sort of common language when assigning likelihoods and perceived benefits.

One criticism I anticipate is that someone will say, ""You're just trying to justify forcing someone not to vote for a low-polling candidate."" I disagree. In fact, using the example above, if you score Candidate A as a 10 and Candidate B as a 1, instead of 9 and 3 respectively, then I actually think you *should* vote for Candidate A, because a vote for Candidate A would have a higher expected value for you than a vote for Candidate B. I think one benefit of using an expected value framework is that if you did feel this way, it would shift the conversation away from discussion of election ""spoilers"" and towards a discussion of the merits of each candidate's policies (assuming that everyone agreed on the polling averages and their correlation with election outcomes).

Anyway, that's the main thrust of my view. I'm posting here just to see if there are any big gaps in my thinking. Looking forward to the responses."

So all I can offer is my own experience or opinion, which I'm open to being challenged on:

In my observation, women usually overcome and get over breakups and divorces better than men.

I've rarely known a woman to regret a breakup, but I've known quite a few men to regret it. I've rarely ever known a woman to pursue a man and ask him for a second chance after a breakup, but it's quite common for men to pursue their exes this way.

My theory is that it's for multifold reasons: 1) women generally have more of a social support network than men, and can recover more easily with such support, 2) men are often not as tuned in to subtle things as women. So it's more common for a man to be ambushed or caught by surprise by a breakup because he was ignoring things that were a persistent problem in the relationship, while the woman has seen it all along and carefully made up her mind in advance that a breakup needs to happen. 3) women generally have more options in dating, so if a woman breaks up, she has many suitors, but a man has a harder time getting a woman. 4) women are generally more willing to live solitary lives without a man than vice versa - they generally have less intrinsic need for a mate than a man does. There is more of an attitude of ""Either a very good mate or no mate at all"" among women than men.

So long as the majority or significant enough minority of an islamic population embraces the role of religion in politics, has favorable views towards terrorist organizations, has favorable views towards countries hostile with israel, we should consider ourselves in a cultural war with the middle east and attempts at normalizing relations make absolutely no sense. Even if the governments want to do so, it is clear much of their population does not. 

We should be taking any and all steps required to secularize the middle east and change the core beliefs of the population. 

I do in fact want this view changed.

1,2023-10-19,CMV: This world isn't ready for the suicidal minority.,u/mindfulapocalypse,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bub7a/cmv_this_world_isnt_ready_for_the_suicidal/,changemyview,"I know how violently people here hyper-fixate on any slightest flaw or inconsistency, but I'll hope some get what I'm trying to explain here and actually attack the view I hold and not just how exactly I word it. Even then, criticism for how exactly I word it would be appreciated anyways, since I've never been good with words. Also, I'd completely understand why a post like this wouldn't allowed here, but it seems like it's fine within the rules. Feel free to remove it though.

Also I'm sure I won't be able to express everything I think in an orderly manner in one post, so I'll hope to clear up specifics by responding if anyone comments. I'm sure there's a lot I'm glossing over because I'm just so used to it at this point.

I haven't lived a long life, I'm 21 years old right now, and I've been going through the works of mental illness and decay since I was 14. The usual stuff, depression, ADHD, OCD, maybe more. It's always been a pain, but primarily since 18, because at that age things would start changing and taking over my mind in a way that'd lead to a long road of self discovery that hasn't gone anywhere good. I'm now currently at a solid feeling conclusion that this world really isn't ready for the suicidal minority I'm a part of, with handling it and accepting it.

There's this ever present platitude that suicide is inherently bad, because it's often an impulsive and spur of the moment decision made by a frustrated and irrational mind in emotional turmoil. And that it is. For the majority. But I'm **not** talking about the majority. I'm **not** talking about the people who don't think of suicide at all until they're abruptly at their breaking point and go for it. I'm talking about people like myself who this pattern does not apply to.

*""As soon as you attempt suicide, you'll regret it. Some are lucky to survive and change, but you have to change now.""*

As inspiring as it is for most, it glosses over the minority completely. Because as someone who has attempted suicide already and failed, and still wants to commit suicide, what is supposed to be gleaned from this statement? I don't regret trying, I regret failing. Every single day of my life. And I know another attempt will come eventually, but this time it won't fail unless I'm getting fucked over by quantum immortality. And knowing it may be assured next time, that makes it scarier and harder to do.

Because yes, there is an ingrained desire for things to not be this way. There are things I want to do in this life. There are dreams I have that I want to pursue. There are dormant passions in me that I want to awaken, ideas I want to grow, projects I want to create. But my best efforts have still resulted in fuck all. Tried to get into drawing, music composition, even game development. All things I've been craving since my childhood, and I feel even more incapable of pursuing them than I ever have before. It's nigh impossible for me to bring myself to do these things, to enjoy them, and to make any progress with them. And it gets worse the more I see myself falling behind.

(I'd like to mention real quick that I don't want the argued part to be about my specific demons, I'm just explaining what I've dealt with to arrive at the conclusion I'm at to give more context.)

Soon enough, people 7 years younger than me will be doing what I want to do. Then people over 10 years younger than me will also be doing what I want to do. All the while I'll still be struggling through my issues and making no meaningful progress. Before I know it, I'm going to be in my 40s still struggling with my hatred for existence, and my incapabilities of my dream passions. Maybe I'll know a lot more about psychology than I do now, but it still won't make a genuine difference, it'll probably just make me more miserable the more nothing changes.

That's why I believe so strongly that suicide is the best route for people like myself, and that this world just isn't ready to deal with or accept that. I want to force the hand of existence by crossing over into the most unknown phenomenon of them all, death. Because what's my alternative? Staying alive and continuing to rot and gamble, with an overall higher chance of things to get worse because this world isn't driven by any karma or justice?

Believe it or not, I **have** tried professional help, and it feels like it has only worsened my beliefs. Medication that does nothing, extremely long intervals and delays between trying anything new and getting to speak with them, and as if the idea of going through the botched mental health care of the USA for the next couple decades for any result whatsoever isn't bad enough, I'm already getting screwed over by it. By not really having the means to afford it, and getting struck with out of nowhere prices, even for things that didn't happen. As if I needed to know any more that these people really don't give two fucks whether I live or die.

You'd think if there was any information that'd actually counter the logic of suicidal people like me, wouldn't it be a bit more widespread? It wouldn't be some wishy-washy virtue signaling blanket idea that suicide is this be-all end-all bad that's never justified nor valid for someone who's life isn't overtly and excessively horrendous.

And that's an entire other can of worms, the invalidation. If you aren't a quadriplegic who's experienced a life of mind withering abuse and torture, well, fuck you I guess. You're not justified nor valid in wanting to off yourself, you're just a bitch apparently. Life's hard, either deal with it or die.

But then when death is actually chosen and preferred, suddenly it's bad?

*""You need to get professional help, try all venues before coming to any drastic conclusion.""*

Well, for a second believe it or not, I'm trying. I've been trying to figure out medication, and I've talked to several therapists/counsellors. I go outside, breath oxygen, feel grass, and absorb sunshine. If that's not good enough, I take a multi-vitamin and even a vitamin D supplement. I've had a job, and I have dreams and desires. And of course, an inherent desire to not crave death. But despite it all, it still feels like suicide is the best thing to do, since nothing is working, nothing is making me happy, nothing is fixing me. And I don't want to struggle like this for the rest of my foreseeable future.

*""If you're eventually going to die anyways, why not just keep living to see what happens?""*

Because in these circumstances, living is not inherently enjoyable. And just because you keep going doesn't offer any kind of promise that things will get better, if anything it feels more likely that things will just get worse. Ninety percent of gamblers stop right before they hit the jackpot... right? No.

I would love for one to actually have strong enough logic to completely dismantle everything I think. But is that going to happen? I don't think so. It feels like there wouldn't be anywhere near as many depressed and suicidal people as there are if there was an actual counter to this pro-suicide logic. But I'd really like to be wrong about that.

Do pro-survival people frequently use strawmen in their arguments against suicide? Sure. From what I've seen, they target the weakest links and ignore the strongest. Do I use strawmen? I'm sure I do in many places, but it's very rare for them to get pointed out. It seems there really isn't much effort to argue from those who are so against suicide.

It's like I have a revolver, and the other only have their bare fists. Technically I'm sure someone could outmatch me with their bare fists while I have a revolver, but how likely is that to happen? Probably not at all.

When you've tried everything you can and nothing is changing, what other answers are there? What's an answer that isn't as disingenuous as *""Just keep trying for teh lols!""*, but also isn't as stigmatized as *""You're right, just kill yourself.""* Because frankly, I'm lost on why the latter isn't the best there is for such an overall hopeless situation.

I don't see why *""Then just kill yourself.""* wouldn't work for someone like me. I don't think this world is ready to admit that some people are just too far gone, and they don't have to be horrible vile people for that to apply."
1,2023-10-19,CMV: Egypt closing the Straits of Tiran didn’t justify Israel attacking in 1967 under International Law,u/NUMBERS2357,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bufbe/cmv_egypt_closing_the_straits_of_tiran_didnt/,changemyview,"In 1967, Israel fought a war with Egypt, Syria, and Jordan.  Israel shot first, but pro-Israel people defend it by saying that Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran, which they say is an act of war and justifies Israel’s actions under International Law.  I don’t think this is true, change my view.  
Few reasons why:  

* It’s not clear to me that closing the straits violated international law.  The straits are *not* international waters, they're the territorial waters of Egypt, and from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passage_through_the_Suez_Canal_and_Straits_of_Tiran), the relevant treaty that would otherwise establish the right was not signed onto by Egypt (in part because of this very issue).  

* Even if it was a violation of international law, it doesn't justify starting a war.  International law contains all sorts of treaties on mundane issues.  Someone violating a treaty on, say, copyright law doesn’t justify an attack.  The UN Charter says that you can only attack another country to defend against an “armed attack”, which this doesn’t sound like. 
 
* My understanding is that there are parts of international law that apply even to countries that don’t agree to them via treaty, but that’s usually really important issues like not doing war crimes or killing minorities … not the finer details of maritime law.  

* FWIW Eisenhower [agreed](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/president-eisenhower-radio-address-on-the-situation-in-the-middle-east-february-1957) with me regarding the same issue in the 1956 war:

> It has been suggested that United Nations actions against Israel should not be pressed because Egypt has in the past violated the Armistice Agreement and international law. It is true that both Egypt and Israel, prior to last October, engaged in reprisals in violation of the Armistice agreements. Egypt ignored the United Nations in exercising belligerent rights in relation to Israeli shipping in the Suez Canal and in the Gulf of Aqaba. However, such violations constitute no justification for the armed invasion of Egypt by Israel which the United Nations is now seeking to undo.  

What would convince me is citation(s) to bona fide sources of international law saying that actions like this are illegal, and justify resort to war to rectify.  
What wouldn’t convince me:  

* Arguing about other parts of the Israeli/Arab conflict  

* Arguing that Israel was justified even if it violated international law (a view that I think isn't totally crazy)  

* Saying “closing the straits was an act of war/casus belli” without citing any source  

* Saying that Israel *said* that it was an act of war (unless backed up by something saying that “what Israel considers an act of war” is relevant legally - doesn’t seem like it would be)  

I should add that I’m not very wedded to a pro-Israeli or pro-Arab version of events.  This isn’t “Arab countries good, Israel bad, CMV.”  I’m posting this here in part because I genuinely don’t have a strong opinion either way.  But I’ve always heard the Israeli position asserted as if it’s just obviously true, and it seems to me like the other side has the better argument."

My experience is anecdotal but I have known MANY women who have needed emergency care for their babies during labour and delivery and immediately afterwards in hospital, including my own. These babies would not have survived being born at home and some moms either. I’ve also known 3 people who attempted home births and all three ended up in emergency medical transfers. 
I know several paramedic friends who are all against home births. They have seen too many horror stories of things going wrong. Midwives treat paramedics like they are magical angels, but they are still bound by distance and time and the reality is they just can’t get to you or to the hospital fast enough. Also I recently called 911 for a medical emergency and was out on hold before speaking to them - on hold before even being triaged. I have zero faith that if I needed emergency care I would actually get it. 
Home birth has zero benefit to the baby. It is not healthier or safer in North America to give birth at home. It is only because mom wants the comfort of her own home. It doesn’t do anything to benefit baby it only puts baby ( and mom) at increase risks.

All they care about is being paranoid all the time of minorities, afraid of and shooting at their own shadows, hoping trump will save them as he destroys the republican party, giving rise to the next hundred years of Democrat control. They treat the supreme court as a jesus allegory, refusing to admit that the court is currently a rogue actor stacked by a narcissistic populist demagogue.

In my opinion, as moral assault weapon bans sweep the nation through any state with a remotely Democrat majority, and the supreme court seems to be very happy to just sit back and let Americans get arrested in these states for being unlawful gun owners and refusing to prim and properly register their assault weapons with their state government. They have not even remotely considered any 2a cases at all besides Rahimi which is doomed to fail and we all see it. You can see this exact sentiment in every single gun sub on this website. My proposal is for every state that is able to carve out a blue majority over the next few years to immediately start enacting assault weapon bans and similar laws (body armor/attachment/ammo/magazine/chest rig bans) as soon as possible. The supreme court is almost guaranteed to be a Democrat majority again within the next few years so just hold out and wait for that. When that happens, it's game over for gun owners and they know it.

Tell me how I'm wrong and you'll get your delta.

Here is a quick response for any gun owner who wants to be snarky and ask what an assault weapon is: all semiautomatic weapons of any kind. You know you don't need it but you love to pretend you're a soldier or cop but we all know your BMI is over 50 so we laugh at you. I will not respond further and will report all posts that ask that question as some kind of gotcha."
1,2023-10-19,CMV: Capitalism does not mean small government,u/FreakinTweakin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bw3fe/cmv_capitalism_does_not_mean_small_government/,changemyview,"Note: This is going off the Marxist definition of capitalism being a system in which the means of production are privately owned by individuals, usually who employ other individuals in a system of wage/labor.

Most people will assume that this means less government because, duh, free market and letting the economic actors work independently from state overreach. But in reality, private property is a social construct which necessitates a state to ensure that it exists as a legal construct and that it remains in possession of the capitalist. Capitalism cannot exist without a state, under any circumstance. When most people think of socialism vs capitalism, they have a false paradigm in their heads of ""there is the state and there is the capitalists, choose one which is better"" but if you have ever spent any time reading communist literature, especially anarchist literature, then you will realize these two forces are not fundementally opposed to one another, and often have the same goals and will work to support each other indefinitely. And as long as there is both a state and a capitalist class, there will be a joining of forces between them. It is impossible that one does not become entangled with the other. Because It is within the self interest of the state to interfere in the economy and create monopolies/take bribes and whatever. And it is within the self interest of the capitalist class, the business owners and corporations, to seek out state support."
1,2023-10-19,CMV: Religious ethics have no place in policy making,u/FamousHaggis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bx7k4/cmv_religious_ethics_have_no_place_in_policy/,changemyview,"I reently had a discussion with a redditor right here in a post about critique towards islam. It quickly evolved in a discussian about ethics itself. The redditor said, that he believes that secular ethics are not really defendable and lack substance, since, without a god, there is nothing to stop yomeone from murdering everyone for the benefit of spreading their own genes. 

I hurled some secular ethical principles against him, and i am fairly sure, at the moment, that those are absolutly superior and more appliable towars almost every ethical problam that one can face, especially when deciding on laws and policies. 

I would go furhter and say i currently hold that believe that every law influenced by religion is inherently unjust towards the percentage of the population that does NOT hold the religious views that influenced that law. 

I personally get the impression that being religious is fine, and ordering your life according to religious rules is fine as long as those rules remain private and confined to your own life. Although i still believe that someone adhering to secular ethics because they WANT to be a good person seems like a better person to me (and safer) than someone only holding back on the mayhem because they are afraid of divine punishment (because there might be ways around drawing the deities ire, for example by targeting a group that is singled out as ""evil"" in a holy text)

So, do you think there is any benefit for society from religious ethics being applied in policy making, be it via religious politicians or through religious advisors or clerics in ethic-commitees?"
1,2023-10-19,CMV: Regulating Essential Necessities Can Balance Access and Capitalism,u/grahag,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17bxkys/cmv_regulating_essential_necessities_can_balance/,changemyview,"I hold the view that regulating essential necessities, like food, water, shelter, energy, information, justice, representation, and healthcare, can create a balance between ensuring access for all and fostering innovation through capitalism. Here's the crux of my argument:

Tackling Root Causes: By addressing the expenses that influence rising costs for everything from energy to materials, we can work towards reducing the overall cost of living.

Balancing Profit Incentives: Critics often argue that heavy regulation stifles profit incentives, which drive innovation and efficiency. However, I believe that it's possible to regulate to ensure accessibility and affordability while still allowing room for innovation.

Ensuring Affordability: Affordability, especially in sectors like healthcare, is a valid concern. My view is that we should create mechanisms that prevent private alternatives from becoming prohibitively expensive through competition and a ground floor of acceptable service/products.

Navigating Regulatory Challenges: Regulating multiple sectors is complex. I propose designing efficient regulatory frameworks that minimize bureaucracy and inefficiencies, potentially leveraging private sector expertise.

Sustainable Implementation and Funding: Critics often worry about the funding of such initiatives. I think it's crucial to establish transparent, sustainable funding models that minimize economic disruptions while ensuring basic needs are met.

Striking Competitive Balance: Striking the right balance between public and private providers is crucial. We should encourage competition and innovation without compromising access and affordability.

Defining Necessities: The definition of ""necessities"" can be subjective. While basics like food, water, and shelter are universally acknowledged, other areas like information and justice might require a more nuanced discussion.

I'm open to changing my view on this, so I'm looking for constructive arguments that might shift my perspective. What are your thoughts? Can you provide a compelling argument to change my view on regulating essential necessities?"

You may say, “I want to hear the original, not a cover.” Then listen to it. It’s available 24/7 on Spotify, how do you think this guy got it?

Why, on this momentous occasion, would you not want the organic feel of a band that is giving that specific performance for just that one night; it’s an ephemeral moment. Of course they play other weddings with all the same songs, use all the same crowd work lines, but it will never be exactly the same as it was at your wedding. They may have a good comeback to when your drunk uncle screams “Freeeebird!” Maybe they actually shred Freebird, who knows?

To me, that’s the essence of why weddings are so important, it can’t be recreated. (You know, with the same person at least.) Even if you get remarried, I don’t think it will be the same as the first time you say “I do.”

Why would one prefer some middle-aged coke enthusiast, who *might* understand how to fade one song into another, over a living, breathing band of individuals showcasing the skills they’ve honed for years? Don’t get me wrong, not all wedding bands are made the same, and I get that, but let’s assume it’s a good one."

Don't get me wrong, most days I have no problem with taking a break when it's expected - and employees need protections in place to prevent abuse, but those protections shouldn't involve dictating to me how and when I take my breaks. If the employer has a policy on how and when breaks are taken then sure, but the state should not be involved in that process.

The biggest thing I’m talking about here is art. Imagine getting to be the director of a TV show from the palm of your hands. “But it would put the directors actors etc. out of business!”
…So? I don’t watch movies to support the artists, I watch them to be captivated in some way. Same thing with music. I don’t think that art is something that should be a career in the first place. It should be done purely out of passion, not to make money or to be recognized. 
Ironically, most successful artists are ones who weren’t expecting fame/money. I don’t think that art has any business being a career path. It’s amazing and entertaining, but it generally doesn’t really help people/society in the same way other jobs do.
But I think that it’s especially harmful because of how hit-or-miss it is. A big problem with society is that our culture of celebrity artists has convinced a lot of people that they are the next big thing.

As a musician myself, if AI frustrates you, I would question why you are an artist in the first place. I make art for myself, and I consume art for myself. I’m not going to get jealous because technology is better than me."
1,2023-10-20,CMV: There's nothing political about young men who can't get laid,u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17c4l2c/cmv_theres_nothing_political_about_young_men_who/,changemyview,"You may think that the title of this post sounds a bit strange.  Let me explain. 

  
If you have ever read anything over at r/purplepilldebate, you’ll know that a lot of the young men posting there are complaining that they can’t find a girlfriend because, in their view, women make illogical and unjust decisions when choosing a romantic partner. This may or may not be true but I want to point out that I feel for these guys.  I was an “incel” myself back in the late 1990s before that term was coined and I was super frustrated.  But if think what’s going on here is that these young men are confusing their struggles to get laid with other past struggles against injustice that were more political in nature. 

  
Let’s take the civil rights struggle of African Americans or women’s lib or mainstream acceptance of LGTBQA.  In each case there were policy decisions that could be made to right the wrong: ending Jim Crow, removing barriers from women entering the workplace, legalizing same-sex marriages, etc.  And there were also efforts that could be made to change people’s attitudes about these oppressed groups: calling out cops for profiling black men, addressing rampant sexual harassment, not using homosexual pejoratives, etc. 

  
But in the case of young heterosexual men who can’t find a partner, there’s nothing to be done at the societal level.  Choosing a sexual partner is a highly subjective personal decision.  There’s nothing logical or fair about it.  Yes, people do sometimes choose horrible partners.  This is not a man thing or a woman thing or a gay thing or a straight thing.  It’s a human thing.  This is why there’s about 2000 years of poetry and music about heartache and loss. It’s a fundamental part of being a person.

    
And you can’t tell women that they must choose men who are under 5’7” because it’s not fair that they have a harder time dating anymore than you can tell a man that he has to date a woman who is 400 pounds.  It’s a person isn’t attracted to someone there’s really nothing to be done about it.    
Many will say, “but in the past men had a much easier time finding partners, and then feminists wrecked everything!”, or something like that.  This is nonsense.  Again, there’s nothing political about how dating works.  

  
American men are having a harder time dating these days because we live in a super affluent society with a mega abundance of choice.  This means that yes, if you use dating apps, women are going to be more picky because they can be.  Biological women, particularly in their early adulthood, have a lower sex drive than biological men.  If you put a bunch of photos of men in front of them, they are going to choose less of them to date than if you put a bunch of photos of women in front of men.  Sorry.  That’s just how it is. 

  
But technology is stacked against young men dating in other ways too.  Because of the internet, lots of horny young males spend hours and hours looking at porn or playing video games instead of going out and meeting people which would, you know, increase their chances of getting laid.  But that takes effort and it’s a little bit scary so it’s not hard to understand why so many are choosing instead to just stay home and masturbate.  

  
I really think it’s just that simple.  I feel kinda sorry for these guys but I don’t think there’s anything to be done about their plight at the societal level.  Anyone want to change my view?

1,2023-10-20,CMV: The Left Are The New Anti-Intellectuals,u/Inevitable-Bus492,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17c83wl/cmv_the_left_are_the_new_antiintellectuals/,changemyview,"The attacks on Israel by Hamas in the past week show the sentiments had on the left and it's...approach to affecting change have reached a zenith. The left, in it's current incarnation, have become enemies of values that it pioneered i.e. free speech, happiness, liberty etc.

The author Kenan Malik [penned an article](https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/15/condemning-hamas-does-not-justify-collective-punishment-of-palestinians) about the many, many, many attempts by leftists to vindicate Hamas and to explain away the organisation's (who at this point are terrorists) actual aims and anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism that another left-wing pundit, David Pakman, is now on the receiving [end of because of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A_BFGgcuic) his condemnation of the attacks. There is no quarter to be given at this point regarding Hamas's goals as an organisation, or that at least a sizable number of leftist circles abet and engage in anti-Semitism in criticising Israel. The cracks in the left's image are in view.

[Palestinians themselves condemning Hamas](https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1711504505211097272) are an indictment of any claim that Hamas represents the interests of Palestine or it's quest for self-determination. It's also an indictment of the claim that the left represents the interests of minorities or any marginalised groups of people as much as it claims it does.

Side bar - The left often say that criticising Israel is not Anti-Semitic. This much is true. It's also true that the left regularly props up Jewish people to say this and as the political faction who coined the term tokenism... using Jewish people to advance an argument like this does invite accusations of tokenism. What is the difference between an organisation like the GOP using Candace Owens, a black woman, to criticise BLM and the hordes of [Jewish leftists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HXW8MeJ8YU) who came to Jeremy Corbyn's defence in the wake of the EHRC investigating anti-Semitism in the British Labour Party?

Since leaving Academia, the parallels between the current iteration of the left and fundamentalist religion become starker and starker.  Now, a terrorist attack that resulted in a war is being openly celebrated by those who could easily fill the shoes of zealots in Inquisition era-Christianity, Ottoman Empire-era Islam and Maccabee-era Judaism. This is illiberalism in it's purest form.

The parallels continue when those who criticise the left, even those from the left themselves (see [Ana Kasparian](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/14ptutc/ana_kasparian_has_officially_left_the_left_she/), Helen Pluckrose, Natalie Wynn, Lindsay Ellis, David Pakman, Kenan Malik) are ignored, [smeared as conservatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/15ndn9j/i_still_dont_understand_how_ana_kasparian_is/), are on the receiving end of pile-ons (which, as Natalie Wynn points out in her video [Cancelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjMPJVmXxV8&t=418s), has a disproportionate impact on marginalised people, who make up much of the left) and become collateral damage in contentions between other leftists (see [Stephen Woodford's video on Essence Of Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppxXejH2LQw&t=1301s), a YouTuber who is a personification of what he termed the ""regressive left"") i.e. Rachel Oates, who became a victim of the ""guilt by association"" precept that defines ""call-outs"" of this nature.

What sections of the Left have done to individuals like Lindsay Ellis and Rachel Oates is utterly evil. That it will continue to happen is...

This is almost perfectly in step with religious leaders who castigate moderates for having the ""wrong"" interpretation of a religious text and calling their fervency into question.

The left seldom admit to their failures and this leads directly to it exacerbating problems it sets out to solve. Take African-Americans, who are one of the more obvious examples of an oppressed group.

Black people in America continue to be amongst the most impoverished minority groups in the U.S., and despite the response to this by many sections of the left, the striking down of Affirmative Action by Joe Biden did not exacerbate the inequalities African-Americans face, and has had a [negligible effect](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/failure-affirmative-action/674439/) on their material conditions in the decades it has been law. This was noted almost half a century ago by writer [William Julius Wilson](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo13375516.html) and, more recently, [by](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/who-actually-gets-to-create-black-pop-culture) Bertrand Cooper.

That this same policy has had a negligible effect on a [group](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/yale-admissions-affirmative-action.html) who have joined several other minorities who are now considered ""privileged"" (see [Jewish people](https://www.socialeurope.eu/where-left-meets-right-anti-semitism-in-europe) and now [Asian people](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/21/atlanta-shootings-racist-myths-lie-behind-the-rise-in-violence-against-asian-americans), which is one of the more dangerous myths promulgated by the left in recent years) is another indictment of the efficacy of academia on the left. Asians make up some of the [poorest groups](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/) in the U.S. and this trend started conveniently around the time Wilson's book was written. Kenan Malik details the failures of this approach to equity in his book [Not so Black And White](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/08/racism-rebranded-how-far-right-ideology-feeds-off-identity-politics-kenan-malik-not-so-black-and-white) and has written extensively about why the left's approach of aping the far right and conflating identitarian approaches to equity with policy does not lead to results.

Similarly, [race norming](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31554110/nfl-halt-race-norming-review-black-claims-1-billion-concussion-settlement), a practice intended to circumvent racial bias in aptitude tests, led to the NFL banning the practice in 2021 after two African-American football players pursued litigation against the NFL for essentially [discriminating against them](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31554110/nfl-halt-race-norming-review-black-claims-1-billion-concussion-settlement) and continuing a practice that was predicated on a racist myth that is centuries old - black people are cognitively deficient. Again, Kenan Malik, someone on the left, pointed this out in a [2021 article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/06/race-norming-good-intentions-bigotry).

It should go without saying that racist ideas cannot be fought by adopting them in turn. That the left has adopted this approach repeatedly with the aforementioned ramifications is yet another nail in the coffin for its approach to issues of egalitarianism.

The allegations of [Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections) was a saga that vindicated much of the left in the years Donald Trump was President. The GOP under Trump were, indeed, histrionic, dishonest and galvanised some to commit some of the [worst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack) [terrorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Timothy_Caughman) [attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_synagogue_shooting) on U.S Soil in [recent memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_El_Paso_shooting) and Trump's insistence on these allegations with dismal amounts of evidence was the perfect opportunity to dismiss the allegations entirely and to dismiss those who wished to investigate these allegations as conspiracy theorists.

Quietly, many on the left , including [Krystal Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mXOkN2k-zY) and [Kyle Kulinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XjstPVKOFQ&t=388s) talked about the controversy at length and subtly pointed out the necessity of left-wing criticisms of the left... and the sophistry the left sometimes engages in to ""own the right."" [The Durham Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_special_counsel_investigation), an investigation into the origins of an FBI investigation into RussiaGate not only implicated Hillary Clinton, but Clinton's staff and other members of the Democratic party including Barack Obama and Charles Dolan, the progenitor of the ""pee tape"" lie found in the [Steel Dossier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier). 

What Hillary Clinton has done directly influenced how the U.S. is approaching the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and exposed the incompetency of the FBI on several different levels. Russiagate was essentially sedition against a sitting President by someone who already had ample motive to do so. The Lefts almost radio silence on it is deafening.

Many are often made fun of for ""leaving the left"" and are accused of grifting, but Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, their staff, and professional liars like [MuellerSheWrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/140wrbh/i_figured_something_was_off_about_the_person/) engaged in what is a textbook definition of grifting for several years at a time at a Federal level.

A political faction that :

\- Does not materially do anything to deal with its bad actors

\- Justifies egregious acts in pursuit of its goals and ideals

\- Does not honestly engage with its critics within or outside of its parameters as a group

\- Functionally acts as if its goals and how it pursues its goals are above criticism, analysis or discussion

\- Intentionally and/or unintentionally exacerbates issues it claims to solve at both a systemic and cultural level

\- Gaslights its critics to the level seen in issues like Russiagate

Is incompetent at best, a threat to itself at a worrying level, and at worst, an amalgamation of the two and a threat to progress of any kind.

On a personal level, abuse from neo-nazis, the far right and other stripes of bigot are par for the course. It is a form of [abuse](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/the-normalisation-of-the-far-right-in-greek-politics/) on the up across the [West in politics](https://www.dw.com/en/in-germany-far-right-violence-increasing-in-school-life/a-65600500) and in cultural spheres. As an African immigrant this was very clear to me long before entering the world of journalism. There are very few in the world of academia who do not know this.

Threats from activists and other members of the left have also been an omnipresent part of my job and little over a week ago I was accosted by a pro-Palestine supporter near Champs de Mars who proceeded to follow me through three arrondissements demanding I support Palestine. Waving a placard near my person was his most recent in what I imagine is a long line of mistakes.

He is now in a Parisian hospital with a sprained femur.

It wasn't Neo-Nazis and Xenophobes who galvanised me into carrying a box cutter during my final year of university. It wasn't white supremacists who harassed me to the point of suicide during my time at university for expressing INTEREST in Israel as a country. 

And it wasn't a Mouvement pour la France supporter who invaded my person and caused me to use the box cutter I have to this day. It was activists, members of the left, and those who, in my estimation, put ideology over principles. That the

So, how is it the Left is not a threat unto itself?

1,2023-10-20,"CMV: ""comparison is the thief of joy"" means we should compare ourselves to others",u/MysticInept,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17c8uhi/cmv_comparison_is_the_thief_of_joy_means_we/,changemyview,"This phrase has irritated me for a long time. The phrase doesn't specify false comparison, and clearly includes accurate comparison....person X has done this, and I have not. The fact comparison has such a profound impact on us is the case to do it. To paraphrase captain Picard, our first duty is to the truth.

What are the reasons not to compare yourself?

You will feel bad? Maybe we should. Maybe only 100 people on earth deserve to be happy and the rest of us should be miserable.

It will lead to bad outcomes? No level of human misery is more important than the truth

Someone was born on third base and has a head start? Doesn't matter. However they achieved it, they scored at home plate and you didn't. They won you didn't. They are the winner, and you are the loser. Starting at third doesn't alter that.

The person you are comparing to isn't happy or not good in other categories? Doesn't matter.They don't have to be happy for the rest of us to be unhappy, and we don't match up in the given category.

Broadly, there is an effort to have people not living in a miasma of human misery. I do not abide this. If comparison has such an impact on us, we should welcome change from learning."
1,2023-10-20,CMV: The only way out of the Israel-Palestine conflict is occupation...,u/Morasain,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ca8nd/cmv_the_only_way_out_of_the_israelpalestine/,changemyview,"... in the same manner that happened in Germany after WWII, going along with education and deradicalisation.

After that, Palestine may well be its own country again.

I have heard a few other solutions, or ways out of the , but I don't see them as realistic at all:

1. Peace talks or negotiations: you can't negotiate with terrorists. It's kind of their MO. They will still indoctrinate and radicalise the population, and nothing changes.

2. One-State solution: someone will be unhappy here. This is not a solution, because that'll just cause insurgency and will perpetuate an apartheid.

3. Two-state solution: this one is a fairy tale. This is as realistic as saying ""Nazis and Jews should've just split and made two countries"". When one side wants to exist, and the other wants extermination, you can't have a peaceful solution.

I'm not saying that this would be feasible right now. Germany was only occupied because it was in shambles, broken to the core, and headless. It would take a lot of fighting to get to this point. However, there is no other long term solution in my eyes."

1,2023-10-20,CMV: Istrael should never retaliate if peace is the goal,u/Dartagnan286,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17cahyq/cmv_istrael_should_never_retaliate_if_peace_is/,changemyview,"I am thinking that the Istrael-Palestinian conflict is pretty unique: you have two sides and one is clearly in control of the situation. 

Istrael has basically every advantage, the government can literally cut water and supplies to its adversary. The only thing that is keeping Istrael from occupying the Palestinian territories is the cultural factor: people will rather kill themselves than accepting a sionist government. Hamas can hide behind civilians because to some extent they are ok they do. 

Now, assuming Israel wants some sort of peace (big assumption  I know, but I have not read anything that disproves it), would it be the best course of action to never retaliate ? For example, the last Hamas attack was terrible and ferocious, hundreds of civilians dead. The response was a heavy bombardment on Gaza city. What if the government simply killed the terrorists found in Istraelian territory (like they did) and than tightened security to avoid it happening again ?

This reasoning stems from the fact that the bombing has always been useless, nothing is gained politically, they are not scared, they are ready to die. Why are they ready to die ? Because they were bombed, lots of sons, husbands, wives, mothers are dead. Hate is everywhere.  You are **basically making terrorists** and at the same time justifying, in the eyes of the innocent, the orrible stuff the other party did.  What if Istrael stays put for 20 years ? Hamas would die of natural death, people in Palestin would not feel the need of it anymore, peace would become more and more desiderable, even if it's not fair. Let's go still deeper, what if Istrael never bombed or retaliate in the last 20 years ? Would they be worse off ? I don't think so.

&#x200B;

What I am saying is: Istrael is in an unique situation, they can go full defensive (Iron Dome is a perfect example) and still have much less dead than the attacking strategy. We should condemn any bombing whatsoever. Any ground action is ok if terrorist attacks are on the way.

I am probably missing something, please let me know what.

The average modern citizen leads their life chasing a culturally determined set of objects that have little impact outside of the continuation of the status quo. As we close the distance between us using the internet, these objects lose diversity. I'll start with those who choose to have families. The classic example is the house, the car, and a stable job. The main perceived values of homes are raising children and passing generation wealth. The job more likely than not produces surplus wealth for a few people, and pollution. The car pollutes the environment and allows for quicker transport. The main destinations are work, school, and the home. School creates new citizens to follow this process, and along with work it reduces the amount of free time and energy available. The remaining free time is occupied with hobbies and personal interests.

The vast majority of hobbies like sports, live entertainment, food, and digital entertainment are largely consumption based. Again, they don't produce much other than pollution and surplus wealth for a relatively small number of people. People constitute their identity using their consumption and their ability to ""succeed"" (replicate) the above system. Liberalism is the dominant ideology, and a person's moral character is based on how they contribute to good (Freedom of consumption and successful replication of status quo). If someone is nourished, housed, sexed, employed, has hobbies and both friends and children dedicated to the same cause, they are doing good. Utilitarianism is the belief in spreading this as far and wide as \*\*'sustainably'\*\* possible.   


This attitude towards life and individuality is utterly boring IMO and collapses the possibilities of real-world evolution and the continuation of life. The objects people obsess over are temporary, so is society (hinged on fossil fuels, solar stability, water, pollution, etc), and spending our time trying to regulate the pain/pleasure of the masses is a waste of effort if done for it's own sake. Imagine if all of humanity totalized towards figuring out a way to spread life throughout the galaxy, or in search of new dimensions or branches of science. What if we used medicine not for strictly prolonging human life (in years), but creating creatures with superior brain and body function? There's so much interesting topics that are covered by few people in the real world. IMO modern society is a gigantic, fickle waste of labor.

I am also trying to speak Spanish as well. When you compare English grammar to other languages it doesn't even come CLOSE. English verbs have basically only one form (I play, I played, he plays, they play, what if I play) in contrast to Spanish (Yo juego, yo juego, él juega, ellos juegan, ¿y si jugué?) Notice how English has less variation and these are the simple tenses if we take into account the other tenses (Spanish has imperfect past, perfect past, conditional etc)  this diffence is staggering. No genders as well, when you write in a gendered language you have to keep strings of reference in the gender of the thing you're referring to, which is bad if you forget what you're talking about. And no needlessly confusing clutter of prepositions and conjunctions to use, instead opting for clear and unique words that don't have many synonyms. For example, which in Portuguese has a lot of synonyms which you have to keep changing them to not make your text repetitive. And of course, English grammar doesn't have any tones except apostrophes, when Portuguese has 4 main ones: á, à, ã, â. But I want to know what are the struggles of people who do write English and are native speakers, because I think their experience would be different than mine because I don't write English in a professional manner.

1,2023-10-20,CMV: Gamers are at fault for the current state of predatory microtransactions in games,u/Relative-One-4060,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17cgycv/cmv_gamers_are_at_fault_for_the_current_state_of/,changemyview,"Small disclaimer to start with:

I am by no means defending the predatory tactics of gaming companies. There is fault to put on them, but not all of it.


Main argument:

In my eyes, its a pretty simple concept to grasp. Gaming companies push these mtx so hard because they know that their communities will pay.

Look at GTAV (GTA:O) as an example. The mtx in that game was making R* nearly a billion dollars in revenue each year. Fans of the series were/are complaining about the slow release for GTA 6, and lack of any information regarding it.

But with how well GTA:O has been doing with its shark card mtx's, there was no real reason to push GTA 6 any faster than it has been. The players are, again, giving R* nearly a billion dollars each year just from their mtx.

Another example is Hearthstone, which is making 20-40 million each year. Its not nearly as much as GTA:O, but its still a huge amount of money that's been raked in yearly for not doing that much.

All these games with battle passes, cosmetics, P2W tactics, etc are predatory yes, but they are also 100% encouraged by the gamers who willingly throw their money at it.

Apex is a recent example. All the players would complain about the highly priced skin packs that made no mathematical sense when taken into context, yet everyone was still running around with all those new skins while still complaining.

Gamers are shelling out all of their money to these companies, but then complain every new game has the same mtx tactics. Look at sports games. They've been completely ruined because of the obsession with paying for currency/packs/boosts. NBA 2K is a joke now because of the money spent on VC. 

If we collectively stopped making these companies filthy rich through just mtx, then it would stop. Games would be better, more content would be available, any existing mtx would actually be worth their price tag instead of $40 for some reskin of another $40 skin. There would be more base-game content instead of locking all the developed content behind pay-walls that companies *know* we'll pay for.

I know the gaming community is huge and would not be able to collectively follow one goal, but that's what it would take to get rid of the predatory tactics all of these gaming companies are using and are starting to use more and evolve into bigger issues.

tl;dr Gaming companies use mtx because they know gamers will make them rich off of it. Why would you not take advantage when there's possibly millions sitting right there in front of you."

1,2023-10-20,CMV: We should change the names of elements 99 and 100,u/Few_Confusion5330,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17cnvqw/cmv_we_should_change_the_names_of_elements_99_and/,changemyview,"Element 99: Einsteinium (named after Albert Einstein: primary author of special and general relativity, discovered the photoelectric effect (reason why solar panels work), etc. Let's be honest, we have all heard of this guy)

Element 100: Fermium (named after Enrico Fermi: lead first team to control a nuclear reaction, memorialized in Fermi-Dirac statistics, and many more contributions. Probably less of us have heard of this guy, but still one of the most recognizable names in physics)

Reasons why I think we should change their names... a tale of destruction, secrecy, betrayal, martyrdom, regret, and the dark side of science, here we go:

1. Elements 99 and 100 were **discovered by analyzing a debris sample taken by fighter pilots who flew into a mushroom cloud resulting from the first hydrogen bomb test** (bolded because this context will become relevant). Neither Einstein nor Fermi were present at the test or involved in the analysis in any way.
2. Both Einstein and Fermi died between the time the names were originally proposed and when they were announced. The elements were officially named after their deaths, without their consent.
3. Neither Einstein nor Fermi ever actively searched for new elements.
4. Einstein's involvement with nuclear weapons is that he sent a letter to the US president saying that they are a real physical possibility, and the Nazis are working on it, so you should too. Later in life, Einstein deeply regretted sending that letter, as the Nazis failed to develop one anyways.
5. On the other hand, Fermi was heavily involved in the Manhatten project (US development of nuclear weapons), so this could be a counterpoint. However, while Fermi saw developing nuclear weapons during wartime as a necessity, he had mixed feelings about the whole thing later in life after seeing what became of it.
6. Both Einstein and Fermi are already famous as s\*\*t and memorialized in the theories of physics. Nobody can study physics without hearing about these guys. I really doubt they gained any more fame by being on the periodic table, but maybe that's because I don't spend a lot of time looking at the periodic table.
7. Because the cold war was happening when the elements were discovered, the researchers had to keep quiet about their discovery. Then, once they were announced, they were named after some other guys. Imagine you had discovered a *new element*. A new *fundamental building block of bulk matter*. Wouldn't that situation feel unfair to you?
8. Elements 99 and 100 was discovered by a team led by Albert Ghiorso, an *enormous* figure in the field of element discovery- directly involved in the discovery of **eleven other elements**. I actually think in all of human history, Ghiorso discovered the most elements. I think his name would be a good replacement and he has more than earned this honor.
9. A team of fighter pilots literally flew into a freaking mushroom cloud in order to collect the samples. One of them died because no one in the history of human flight had ever flown into conditions produced by the aftermath of a nuclear explosion- ""Robinson hit an area of severe turbulence, spinning out and barely retaining consciousness. He regained control of his plane at 20,000 feet, but the electromagnetic storm had disrupted his instruments... Robinson's F-84 Thunderjet crashed and sank 3.5 miles short of the island. Robinson's body was never recovered."" We could honor this guy for giving his life to advance science.
10. We could use this as an opportunity to popularize scientists who aren't white, male, or ultra-popular in an effort to combat disparities, gatekeeping/pretentiousness, and normalize the fact that all scientists are important, and all people can become scientists.
11. The periodic table is a changing thing by nature, since it represents our expanding knowledge. Historically, it changes each time a new element or group of elements is added, the structure is changed, etc.
12. It has to be easier than ever in human history to change the name of an element or two while avoiding confusion. Yes, there will be some growing pains (people who really need that perfect periodic table up on their wall might need to buy a new poster), but we live in a world where information travels near instantaneously. Also, we have an international regulatory agency that is responsible for naming elements, so the elements' names wouldn't be in dispute if the agency (IUPAC) changed the names.

The easiest way to modify my view would be to suggest names better than Ghiorsium (Gh) and Robinsonium (Ro); please explain your reasoning. The more complicated ways to change my view (I think) would be to try to convince me that tradition is more valuable than respect for humans (see 10,11,12), or that we shouldn't change the names because it would be disrespectful to Einstein and Fermi (see 2,4,5,6)"

1,2023-10-20,CMV: YA is a meaningless and pointless money grabbing scheme that does more harm than good,u/cyansnide,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17co7g2/cmv_ya_is_a_meaningless_and_pointless_money/,changemyview,"I should add that I think age boundaries on most books has always struck me as a bizarre way of doing things, except for books for children learning to read. I don't see that point in YA, but I'm willing to concede that I don't quite understand what it is. Some sources say it's when the protagonist is a young adult, but I can think of many, many novels in which a young adult or even a child is the protagonist that don't seem to fall under the category of YA ('Room', Joyce, Dickens, Harper Lee, 'Let the Right One In', Stephen King, Neil Gaiman etc etc etc). Some say that it begins to tackle heavier topics but in a more sanitised, gentle way. This to me perpetuates the idea that no teen has ever suffered through heavy stuff. It seems to run the risk of minimising things, leaving them underprepared, or if they have suffered whatever topic is discussed themselves, alone. In general, this approach doesn't seem to allow for much critical reading - I often see younger readers lambasting books (recently, Donna Tartt's Secret History) and saying that they shouldn't be read because an anti-semitic character was, shockingly, anti-semitic. Overall, I find YA a patronising, safety bubble genre (if it can be called a genre). Perhaps some of the problems lie in the gratuitous sex that is so rife in 'adult' books; YA is, I suppose, an escape from that. But there are many, many people out there who are not teens that also don't fancy reading that stuff, for a variety of reasons. Which is why I think doing genre with content themes, like the stuff you see on moves (this film is rated mature for use of swearing, explicit sex, rape etc), instead of by age, would lead to a much more interesting and varied way of discovering new books, without having the decision of what you should read made for you via age group. Not all teens are the same (again, perhaps I'm misunderstanding YA here?) Happy for anyone to CMV and sing the praises of YA! (Note: This isn't a dig at the books themselves necessarily. I thought the Hunger Games were really well written; just bc the protagonist is a teen and there is no sex, doesn't mean that 'adults' wouldn't enjoy it too!)

TLDR using age limits to market books is reductive and exclusionary, the concept of YA reduces critical thinking, lacks complexity, and has the potential to stunt desire for variety. Content themes are a better idea."

I was born in central China, abandoned at birth, and lived in an orphanage until being adopted. Now I’m in my 20’s living in Minnesota. I have no information on my medical or family history- so I have always just said I’m of Asian descent- and if I had to specify a country I say China.

Probably on a monthly basis I get asked about my race. I always respond with “Chinese,” and most people are satisfied with that answer and drop the subject.

However, I’ve met several people who don’t think I look Chinese and are dead set that I am [insert another race]. And if they know I’m adopted, they say something along the lines of you don’t really know if you’re Chinese because you don’t know your parents, so you could be anything.

Yes- I know they are technically right- I don’t know if I’m actually of Chinese descent- but I personally find it very invasive and inappropriate to point that out. I also don’t know why it really matters. Sure there’s a good chance I’m not 100% Chinese, but who cares? Very few people are of purely one descent. And I feel like it’s hard to truly know your racial background without a DNA test. I don’t know why me being adopted bars me from saying I’m Chinese. Also a lot of these conversations are with people I don’t know too well- so I don’t really want to have an in depth conversation regarding identity/race/adoption.

I genuinely don’t understand why people have a problem with me saying I’m Chinese. I already have a lot of insecurities related to race and being adopted, and this only heightens those insecurities. 

If anyone has a reason/argument for why I can’t/shouldn’t identify as Chinese I truly want to know. I really want to understand why so many people have said this to me. Thanks in advanced for all your input

Edit 1- I just want to clarify- I know ethnicity/race/nationality are all different. From my experience, the average person off the street doesn’t know the nuances and differences between these ideas. Oftentimes people use nationality and ethnicity as a euphemism for race. I said this in a reply- but when people ask questions, it’s important to try and understand what the person is actually asking and wanting to know. Yes, there are people who are asking about my cultural background and if I participate in Chinese traditions, but most of the time people are asking about my background in the context of physical appearances. Also, I generally don’t mind when people are curious about my background. The two main problems I have is when it’s done in an inappropriate manner (like if it’s asked rudely or asked by a stranger at an inappropriate time), or if I say I am Chinese, then they say I can’t say I’m Chinese because I’m adopted and don’t know my biological history. When people make these comments, they’re saying I can’t say I’m of Chinese descent. At that point the conversation has nothing to do with whether or not I can identify with Chinese culture or heritage, but rather that I need to know my birth parents to truly be able to say I’m of Chinese descent biologically speaking. I also know that probably the topic that “race is a social construct” will come up. That’s a whole discussion of itself, but for all intents and purposes, I’m asking what’s wrong with saying I’m Chinese when people ask about my race in relation to my physical phenotype. I don’t see why people are so against me saying I’m Chinese in response to that question. I have had several people want to debate why I can’t say I am Chinese because I’m adopted - which is a conversation I don’t want to spend my energy on.

Edit 2- Ok another clarification- transracial adoption means an adoption in which the parents and child are of different races. It has nothing to do with trying to change one’s race or intentionally presenting oneself as a different race."

As much as I hate to call it such, I'll probably get banned if I don't. When was it decided that it was a slur? I feel like one day I just woke up and suddenly people were getting canceled for it and twitter was calling it a slur. It was always just used on par with typical insults to intelligence like stupid, dumb, or idiot, and now it's a slur?

Let's adress some arguments from the other side.
1. It was originally a medical term to describe disabled people, and so using it is the same as calling somebody disabled as an insult, which is disrespectful to disabled people.

Word definitions change. Dumb once meant somebody who couldn't read, so is it disrespectful to people who can't read if I use it as an insult? No, because nobody uses it like that anymore. The same went for the ""r word"". If we're deciding a word is offensive or a slur based off of its past definitions, then there are so many common words that are slurs now. Idiot would literally have to be forbidden and referred to as the ""I slur"".

2. How hard is it to just not say it?

Why should I have to change my vocabulary because of an idea that isn't really easily defensible?

As much as I hate to misrepresent the other side, these are really the only counter-arguments I could think of.

Also, context matters. For instance- a sibling of yours does something stupid and annoying. You called them the ""r word"". Did you do this to insult any disabilities they had? If yes, you have used it as a slur. They were disabled and you called them it because of that. But most likely, that was not the case. Most often, you probably used it as a typical insult like stupid, dumb, idiot, imbecile, whatever your choice. You see my point now? Nobody ever really uses it as a slur, so why did it become one? Well, I have one theory, and I'm 99% confident it's correct. The internet saw that nothing bad had happened in a while, and so they found something to be mad about. This tends to happen. Remember when people tried to cancel Mr. Beast because no controversies had happend in a good while? These people LIVE off of drama, and so they'll go as far as to declare normal words ""slurs"" just so they can create more people to cancel and more things to be mad about.

1,2023-10-21,CMV: A company should be forced to break up if they reach a certain % of the market share,u/AfterAmbition,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17cw2dx/cmv_a_company_should_be_forced_to_break_up_if/,changemyview,"I think that how antitrust laws currently stand, they can circumvented and argued in favor of the defending company too easily. 

I believe that setting a ceiling for the market share a company can have before being forced to split up assets by the FTC would be an easier way to enforce measures to prevent monopolies. 

This ceiling % would be calculated using a business’ personal market share as well as any companies owned by said business within the same market. I am only concerned about a company’s market share on a national level. 

Any assets that have been gained after a company has surpassed the ceiling would be required to be sold off/dissolved. The market share would be reevaluated on an annual basis and the rule would be enforced at the end of each fiscal year until the market share was brought under the threshold. 

Ex: Our market share ceiling is set to 30%. 

In 2022, Amazon had a [37.8%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274255/market-share-of-the-leading-retailers-in-us-e-commerce/) market share in e-commerce. 

In this scenario, Amazon would be required to sell/dissolve all assets gained during the period that they were over the 30% market share ceiling. 

However, if Amazon only had a 26% share, but also happened to own Walmart who had a [6.7%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274255/market-share-of-the-leading-retailers-in-us-e-commerce/) share in the same market, this would give them a total 32.7% overall e-commerce market share and they would be required to sell/dissolve assets from Amazon, Walmart, or a combination of the two during the period that Amazon had over 30% of the market.

However, a proportion of men prefer to submit and a proportion of women prefer to dominate.

With that said, the proportion of men who prefer to submit is far greater than the proportion of women who prefer to dominate. This is because men, in general, in all walks of life, display more levels of variance. That could be sexual (more males that deviate sexually, generally speaking), intelligence (more male geniuses, more males with very low intelligence), crime (more male criminals) and so on.

So similarly, there are far more men who like to be dominated and the amount of women who like to dominate is vanishingly small. Most women hate to dominate and find submissive men a turn off.

Paradoxically then, a relationship where the male submits sexually to the female and the female dominates is one of the most male dominated relationships out there. The man likes to submit, the women also likes to submit. The man knows this, and knows that submitting to his girlfriend disgusts her. But he does it anyway, because he puts his own sexual desires above hers and doesn't care for the consequences because he has power over her. There are exceptions of course where the female actually does genuinely prefer to dominate sexually, but they are rare.

I have a 175k mortgage at 1,5% and the house is valued at 325k. All good so far.

However, I really dislike the city and neigbourhood I'm in. It's not really ghetto, it's just not great either, and pretty boring and ugly. The only good thing is that it's very close to Amsterdam.

I'm self employed and my income varies alot. If I wanted to move to another house I couldnt even get the 175k mortgage anymore with my income of last year. Even if I could, most of the cities around have much higher real estate prices so I couldnt even buy something decent anyway.

I love to travel and planning a world trip at the moment, must say that even if I lived in the best place on earth I would still like travel alot,  so it's not like an escape, but yeah it does give extra motivation to travel.

Because of that I wanted to rent out my house to cover expenses while I'm out. I asked for permission of the bank and they declined. Tried everything I could to persuade them but still no permission.

So basically I'm starting to feel like a prisoner in my own house. I can't buy something else, I can't rent out the place to move and rent something somewhere else or travel..

I could sell and cash out, hoping housing prices go down when I'm ready to buy again, but I'd never get this low interest anymore and prices are not likeley to go down that much anyway. So I would probaly be locking myself out of the housing market if I do that.."

As everyone here knows, or should know, jokes and other insensitive or nonsensical comments that are entirely based around race are pretty frowned upon nowadays.   


Now, whether you agree with this new status quo or not, there is a group that appears to have been left out intentionally from this new level of protectionism: white people, and especially white women.   


Every single day, quite literally, I cannot surf any social media site, be it Reddit, X, Facebook, even YouTube, without some sort of jab thrown at white people as a whole for some nonsense or another. Whether it's that we can't handle spicy foods, don't season when we cook, are totally ignorant about other cultures, or even just assuming we come pre-baked with some racial bias against non-whites.   


This doesn't even begin to address the fact that racial slurs against white people are seen more as punchlines than actual slurs, and are never treated with anything approaching the same level of disdain as slurs towards other races. As someone who abhors racial slurs, it's quite disheartening to see people who allegedly have the same stance be so flippant about this very specific issue.   


Perhaps I'm rambling a bit in my tired state, but after seeing a Facebook clip where a white guy calls himself a ""non-practicing white person"" because he has a cabinet with basic seasonings in it, I found myself rolling my eyes so hard they almost left my skull."

So let's save some useless trash talk, please don't accuse each other of ""you're anti-Semitic, you're a terrorist supporter"" and the like, let's just discuss the evidence. let's just focus on this incident. 

1. Some people questioned that the crater was very small and more like a Hamas rocket. But the Israeli JDAM bomb can be adjusted to air burst mode, which will also leave a tiny crater and have a better killing effect on flesh and blood.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYApLv6kJnA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYApLv6kJnA)

2，Some people questioned that the hospital building was not destroyed, only the parking lot was charred. This is normal. The effect of airburst bombs on buildings is very poor. For example, in this old video, an airburst bomb hit the roof of a Gaza house, but it only raised dust. In the photos of the parking lot, you can see that there are dents on the tops of some cars. This is a very obvious effect of the shock wave generated by the air blast bomb.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udbeJ7i6Ruk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udbeJ7i6Ruk)

3，Surveillance video shows that the bomb that hit the hospital was accompanied by a high-pitched scream at the terminal speed. This is the sound that a bomb with a fast enough speed can make. No Hamas rocket can have this sound at the terminal speed. And Israel's JDAM has the same scream.

4. Surveillance video shows that just before the explosion in the hospital, there were spots of light in the sky as planes dropped thermal decoys. This is a standard procedure for planes to evacuate after dropping bombs. Therefore, although there is no air defense equipment in Gaza, the pilot may have subconsciously Repeat your own training process, causing yourself to be exposed. Is there any other explanation for this light spot? It can't be a faulty Hamas rocket, otherwise we would see other fragments of it, and it is impossible for a faulty rocket to drop three light spots so regularly

5,Israel released an audio recording it claimed was an intercepted conversation between Hamas agents admitting that Hamas had caused the bombing itself. British Channel 4 investigated the recording as a forgery, using non-Palestinian grammatical conventions and having issues with the audio recording. They put it more euphemistically, ""It is not sufficient to meet the standard of evidence.""，The survey also included some discussion of launch direction.

5. Some people question the death toll. Photos from the scene prove that there are blankets in the parking lot, which shows that some people are resting in the open air. A group of people in an open space were hit by air burst bombs that are extremely good at killing people. It is not impossible to cause hundreds of casualties. The current statistics are 400+ people. This number may not be accurate, of course, but it's not impossible to achieve. Also, the number has nothing to do with who bombed the hospital, so I won’t go into too much detail on that.

Well, my point is that Israel is more of a party to the bombing of hospitals, or even convinced that it is. Because so much evidence is difficult to disprove, I welcome you to change my mind with new evidence that I am not aware of."

The former is much more open to a woman wearing a hijab, a church discriminating by race, or in allowing Jewish holidays to be state-recognized. 

This one comedian I recall had this joke that many liberals see black people practicing Christianity as cute and folksy. 

At the same time we see many secularists defending the Uyghurs in China yet denouncing the Taliban and Iran. Many of them also have this tendency for romanticizing young women wearing hijabs like Malala or Ilhan Omar in the case of the Americans. 

Many of them tend to turn a blind eye to the practice of circumcision, practiced by both Jews and Muslims. 

And why do these secularists get offended by attacks on religious customs? 

The media also did an active job, for example, in suppressing the Charlie Hebdo shooting, because, I would argue, many people believe the cartoonists were wrong to illustrate the prophet Muhammed. 

But why would they be wrong? The depiction of Muhammed was common in the Western world for centuries as we see in Dante, de la Noue, de Hooghe, Voltaire, etc...

Personally, I think its because of economic reasons, many secularists are afraid of losing their Muslim clients, their Jewish clients, investors from the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, etc...

So essentially, they play up this 'coexistence' game and turn a blind eye to the prejudices of the religions in order to keep the money going."
1,2023-10-21,CMV: The US people need to enforce a rampdown schedule to end tipping culture for good.,u/robotmonkeyshark,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17d32rp/cmv_the_us_people_need_to_enforce_a_rampdown/,changemyview,"Tipping has gotten out of hand.  Not just restaurants, but now so many places that take credit cards are adding the tipping options with defaults set as low as 18% unless you go through extra steps to specifically input lower.  And delivery companies like Uber Eats or Instacart are offloading payroll expenses on customers to tip more causing income instability.

Now just not tipping at all these days on your own is sort of a jerk move based on how tipping pay works, so to be fair people feel the need to play along because those workers need a living wage.  And just boycotting all these businesses would risk a lot of people's incomes 

So my proposal is to set a date and begin to ramp down tipping with the backing of a large portion of the population.  Get people onboard, constantly have people post on social media and other ways to spread awareness as much as possible, and businesses will be forced to respond before it causes problems. 

Now the exact schedule can vary, but I am thinking something like starting Jan1 2024, we officially agree tipping is capped at 20%.  You don't have to tip this much if you don't currently do so, this is just an upper cap to start the ramp down.

Feb 1 2024, it drops to 19%.  Now if you are a bit on the math nerd side, feel free to calculate your new tips at places to be 19/20th of what you would normally tip, or for those who like simplicity, just keep your tip below 19%.  

Every month, reduce the tip 1% more.  On September 1 2025, tipping officially hits 0%.  Now the point of this is not to take money away from jobs that rely on tips, but to instead make it clear to employers that the days of customers paying employee wages is coming to a close, so if you want to keep employees working at your business, here is a predictable schedule for how you need to ramp up pay for your workers so that it isn't a sudden shock.  Places will justifiably increase prices in order to bring in enough revenue to cover payroll, but in the end it works out to about the same cost but it gives workers more stability in their income. 

But in order for this to work, it needs to be implemented by enough people to gain traction or employers will call our bluff, workers will just get angry at those not tipping enough, and it will eventually fall apart and end up back where we are today.  

obviously for certain things if someone goes above and beyond, people can still tip for things, especially if it is someone tipping a self employed type job where it is truly a tip above and beyond fair pay to start with.  "

so my train of thought got kind of long but online I see how incels talk about how women don't understand male loneliness. Women do. many women, and take Japanese women, are single. Yet Japanese women are not violent. Neither, for that matter, are male Japanese who are single. 

The problem is a personal accountability problem.

some incels talk about how society should be worried that incels become violent and so we should encourage women to lower standards or some bullshit. Its bullshit because even if women collectively decide to stay abstinence and not date, then incels that turn violent, the problem is not the women who refuse them but the incels that are violent. We see plenty of incels who are not violent. 

we see some men who get rejected turn violent ie woman says no and gets stabbed. We rarely see it in women. 

Therefore all the problems with incels who are violent lies not with a society that should encourage women to be less picky but to encourage men to have some anger management. I don't know how to fix it but its not in telling women to date more..

when I look at things I don't care about, like if you don't care about women being assaulted, that's actually understandable if you shrug and move on.

I don't understand being so upset when women talk about their experience with some men. Just like getting traumatized by a dog attack isn't a statement on all dogs. But the trauma is there and can't be helped. 

When white men talk about their experience in a specific area and say that ""hey, this is a problem in the black community. I've been jumped just for being white"" no one is saying all black people but that this community has a problem. Yet people are quick to say its racist 

on the flip, when black people talk about the racism they faced by white people, white people are also quick to say its racism

The Palestinians do not hate Jews merely for being forced out of their homes and subjected to ethnic cleansing; they and the rest of the Muslim world hate Israel because it was the first time that Islam lost to the Jews. This is the final straw in Muslim humiliation - how dare the Jews and the Christian West subject the “final religion” to such humiliation. There is a reason Palestine has not accepted any significant peace deal from Israel and there is a reason Palestinian diaspora continue to cause massive civil wars and social destruction in every country they migrate to (Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait, etc) - the Palestinians are angry that they are continuously humiliated by people that Muhammad and the various caliphates used to slaughter effortlessly.

I also believe that the Israelis (and Jews who feel kinship with their “promised land”) don’t view the Palestinians in a secular manner - they genuinely believe that control of “their” holy land is revenge against Islam’s repression for millennia. There’s a reason Israelis and their Zionist supporters want the Palestinians to just “go to Jordan” already - they believe the state of Israel is compensation for the millennia of Jewish suffering; and they clearly think the Caliphate is still around.

In general, I think the whole planet would be better off without Abrahamic religions. Monotheism is inherently intolerant - Judaism’s hatred of other religions mutated into Christianity’s genocidal mania and Islam’s monstrous imperialism. They are socially destructive and tend to carry iron age prejudices against homosexuals, other religions, liberal lifestyles, etc well past their intended time that mutate into bad ideas. It’s not a coincidence that “clash of civilizations” rhetoric and antipathy is largely a result of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Had the West and Near East remained pagan, I think we would not have as much problems as we do today. Zoroastrianism was better than any of these narcissistic cults; more peaceful certainly."

Many older people develop serious health conditions and once you’re a senior if you don’t have a family of your own it’s a struggle. Most people in this group either have pets which obviously can’t take care of them or a group of friends, neighbours or extended family who is also old.  

At the nursing home I work with many patients without families are just rotting away here until they die, they don’t get adequate care and without family members these people often get poor treatment for years and have their health conditions exacerbated. It’s really just a cruel lonely existence, I actually feel better for patients with dementia because at least they aren’t aware of the state they are in. 

On top of this many patients in that group always tell me about how lonely they have gotten and their biggest regret often being not starting a family because after a certain point most social contacts lose touch or pass away.

I changed my stance on having kids after not wanting them because now I genuinely believe without a family the last portion of your life will likely be complete misery without one."

I have seen reports claiming that same-sex schools have better grade averages, but I’ve also seen claims that students struggle socially afterwards. 

I was surprised to learn that co-education was a topic of contention when I was a teenager and saw Scholastic debates about it.

Of course, if you went to a school with just one gender and it worked for you, that’s great. I just feel as though it would be counterintuitive for most people."

Look at what they’re actually focused on: ridiculous infighting, and trying to impeach Biden on thin to no evidence.  They’re not even able to elect a speaker in a timely fashion, let alone pass anything that’d benefit average Americans.  They’re utterly incompetent at governing, and some of their own members are admitting as much—saying their party would actually prefer to be in the minority, where they can scream and pull performative stunts without actually being expected to govern.

And I’ve seen no evidence that the likely Republican presidential nominee, Trump, has any plan at all for dealing with inflation, let alone a workable or practical one.

I’m not an economist, I’m an average schlub.  I do understand that economic ripple effects from policy take awhile to be felt, but I see no evidence that Republicans in the last couple years have put any significant policies in place to address inflation at all, or that they’ve done anything about it other than use it as a cynical talking point to gain power, which they then use to focus on completely different things that help no one outside themselves (if that).  Electing them hasn’t helped, and wouldn’t help, deal with inflation.  Try and change my view."

Then creates UNO (United Nations Organization) an organization totally controlled by them so the whole world only listen to them

Then declares war on communism (USSR) for no reason even tho the USSR was not the aggresor in the Cold War (the US was the aggresor)

Then creates NATO controlled by the US to keep his power high and keep the power of other countries like China and Russia weak

To a point I don’t think it’s a bad thing for people to seek asylum under certain circumstances. The way I see it, I do not think current situations in the Caribbean, Central and South American should qualify for asylum. 

The reasons you can seek asylum in the US are protection from being persecuted based on: race, religion, nationality, social affiliations or political opinions. 

I do not believe those issues are a wide spread issue in any of the aforementioned religions. I think most people are escaping due to high crime and a poor economy.

I will not deny:
* I would seek all available options if I was in the same situation (still doesn’t mean it’s right or wrong)
* That the US is fully/partially directly/indirectly responsible for the situations many of the aforementioned countries are in. 


So in short, I ask you, why should poor living conditions (brought forth by any means) be a reason to gain asylum in the US (if those poor conditions are not purposefully put on individuals based on the aforementioned criteria and are a situation the population at large experiences)?"
1,2023-10-21,CMV: You should be able to opt out of financial responsibility to an unwanted child.,u/awesomeness6698,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17d8dep/cmv_you_should_be_able_to_opt_out_of_financial/,changemyview,"In the United States where I live, child support laws basically say this; 

Once a child born, if both biological parents want to give the child up for adoption, that can happen. However, as soon as one biological parent decides that they feel like keeping the child, it then becomes the responsibility of the other biological parent to support the child financially, even if the latter never wanted the child in the first place. 

Since the overturn of Roe v Wade, the topic has gotten even more complicated. Before Roe v Wade was overturned, it was easy to say that opting out of parenthood via abortion is allowed, so both the mother and the father should be allowed (if they want to) to opt out of financial responsibility to an already born child. Now that a lot of states have passed laws that would compel a 13 year old rape survivior to remain pregnant with her brother’s baby, one could argue that allowing men to opt out of financial responsibility to an already born child would be unfair to women. However, consider this. Many states still allow abortion. Ned Lemont is enacting policies to make it it easier for women who live in red states to travel to Connecticut to obtain abortions.

Imagine a woman, who resides in Connecticut, gets pregnant. Imagine her baby daddy wants her to abort and she gives birth anyway just to spite him. This woman could have had an abortion if she wanted to. Just because she choose not to, does that make it okay or fair for the man to be on the hook for child support for a child he never wanted in the first place? I say absolutely not.  

I would like to discuss two hypothetical scenarios. Both of these scenarios take place in a geographic location where abortion is illegal, except when the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life. 

Scenario #1: 

A woman ends up pregnant. She goes to the man who inseminated her and informs him of the pregnancy. He says to her the following sentiment; 

I am not ready to be a father. If we lived somewhere where abortion is legal, I would galdy pay for the procedure and drive you to and from that procedure. Since that is not an option, I say we give the child up for adoption. I would gladly pay for the cost of prenatal healthcare and the cost of maternity clothes. 

Now imagine the woman keeps the child. 

I think that the woman who just gave birth has a right to keep the child if she wants to. She should not be forced to give her child up for adoption. I see nothing wrong with that. 

Because the mother chose to keep the child in lieu of giving the child up for adoption, should the father be compelled by court order to support the child financially? I say absolutely not. 

Scenario #2: 

A woman gets pregnant. She wishes that she could have an abortion, but she cannot. During pregnancy, the hormones are so bad that she considers suicide. 

After giving birth, the mother gives the child up for adoption. 

The father would be first in line for custody of the child. I see nothing wrong with that, it makes all the logical sense in the world. 

Should the father be able to take the mother to court and demand child support payments from the mother? I say absolutely not. 

In my mind, the father in scenario #1 and the mother in scenario #2 should not be held financially responsible for a child they did not want in the first place. 

I advocate for a policy that would allow both men and women to opt out of  financial responsibility to an already born child. If this policy is enacted, no matter what the abortion laws say, any man or woman who does not want to be financially responsible for a child would not need to be. If the child support laws for which I advocate where a reality, even if abortion did not exist, forced financial responsibility to an unwanted child would not happen. Under the policy that I wish for, even if forced child bearing where a real thing, forced responsibility to an unwanted child would not be. 

Here is how it would work. 

Once the child is born, the mother can sign her name on the birth certificate if she wants to raise the child. The father can take the issue to court and demand custody of the child if that is what he wants. If the mother wants the father to be in the child’s life, there is no need to take the issue to court in the first place. If the father wants nothing to do with the child, he can sign some paperwork stating that. When he does this, he surrenders his right to sue for custody. 

If the mother would rather not be responsible for the child, she can give the child up for adoption. If the father wants the child, he is first in line for custody. However, because the mother never wanted the child in the first place, she is not responsible for child support. 

If you disagree with me, I must ask you three questions. 

Question #1: Do you believe that abortion should be legal? 

If you are pro-choice, that means that you believe that a woman should not be forced to remain pregnant if she does not want to. I agree with that. If you are okay with a woman opting out of parenthood (and the financial obligations that come with it) via abortion, how can you not be okay with a woman or a man opting out of financial responsibility to an already born child? 

On the other hand, if you are pro-life, then that means that you feel that a fetus has a right to life that takes precedant over a woman’s right to choose. By advocating for policies that force women to remain pregnant AND also advocating for policies that would force a woman to be financially responsible for children they do not want, you run the risk of a woman (or man) being forced to support children they cannot afford. No good can come from forcing people to be financially responsible for children they cannot afford. The most common reason why women choose abortion is inability to support a child financially ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html?fbclid=IwAR2oz-iVf0-dyikpG76GTpqgq3SjBepTdiOp8oGDojNPUZiH8tot-Ciy8n0 ). Therefore, allowing women to opt out of financial responsibility to an already born baby will make women more likely to choose life. 

Question #2: What if both parents want to give the child up for adoption? Should they be allowed to give the child up for adoption then? 

If your answer is no, why? 

What if there is a couple out there looking to adopt who would really love the child? How can you possibly claim that two people who do not want to be responsible for the child and who probably do not love each other should be forced to be responsible for the child, when there is another couple who would gladly take on the responsibility of caring for the child? 

If, however, your answer is yes, giving the child up for adoption is okay, provided that both biological parents want that, then why does one parent wanting to keep the child suddenly make it the responsibility of the other parent to be responsible for a child they never wanted? 

Question #3: What about rape? 

Imagine a man rapes and impregnates a woman. Imagine a statistically less frequent but still equally as reprehensible hypothetical where a woman rapes a man and gets herself pregnant. If the woman, who ends up pregnant from rape, wants to give her child up for adoption and she is forced to be financially responsible for the child, is that fair? If the man is forced to pay child support to the woman who raped him, is that fair? 

If you believe that an exception should be made for rape, how would this work? Do you have to prove that you where raped before you can be exempted from financial responsibility or do we start with the assumption that you are telling the truth and then exempt you from financial responsibility until and unless it is proven that you are lying? 

On the other hand, if you do not believe that an exception should be made for rape, then I have another question. How would you feel about a policy that would allow any man or teenage boy to go to the free clinic and get a vasectomy or any woman or teenage girl to go to the free clinic and undergo tubal ligation, with or without parental permission, as soon as he or she reaches reproductive capability? If you said that minors should not be allowed to undergo permanent sterilisation or you said that minors should need the permission of their parents to undergo permanent sterilisation, then I have yet another question. How can one person be old/mature enough to be forced to give birth or be held financially accountable for a child he/she does not want, but not old/mature enough to undergo permanent sterilisation? 

Let’s go over some of the most common counter arguments I have heard and explain why I do not agree with the logic of these counter arguments. 

Argument #1: You should not be having sex if you would rather not be a parent. 

Three things. 

This is no different than a conservative Christian arguing against abortion on the grounds that women should keep their legs closed if they don't want to be mothers. 

Imagine if you ate a raw hamburger, got a tape worm as a result and you were prohibited from taking medication, because you should not be eating raw meat if you do not want a tape worm. 

If you believe that people who have sex without the desire to reproduce are irresponsible, why would you want them to be parents? 

Argument #2: Having an abortion is different, because it exempts both biological parents from parental responsibility. 

What if the father actually wanted the mother to abort? If you feel that forcing a woman to give birth would be a bad idea, then it follows logically that it would be a bad idea to force the father into financial responsibility for a child he did not want. 

This is when someone replies with the argument…

Argument #3: Abortion is about bodily autonomy, not opting out of financial responsibility. 

The difficulty and/or injustice if forced child bearing as it compares to the difficulty and/or injustice of forced child support is not the point. The point is that, as long as abortion is legal, certain people can consent to sex without consenting to parenthood. Therefore, if you are in favor of mandatory child support on the grounds that consent to sex equals consent to parenthood, then you should be in favor of an abortion ban for the same reason.

It is basic logic. 

If Sally likes all fruit, and apples are a fruit, then it follows logically that Sally likes apples. 

If the government has a duty to make sure no one is ever able to consent to sex without consenting to parenthood, and the legality of abortion allows certain people to consent to sex without consenting to parenthood, then the government has a duty to ban abortion.  

Argument #4: Having an abortion severs ties to a potential child, not an actual child. 

I would like to make two points, one with regard to a mother opting out of parenthood and one with regard to a father opting out of parenthood. 

What if the mother lives in a geographic location where abortion is illegal? What if, despite the legalty of abortion, she did not live near an abortion clinic? If she would have had an abortion where she able to, but she was not able to, then how is it fair to force her to be financially responsible for the child once the child is born? 

What if the father wanted the mother to abort and she gave birth anyway? How would it be fair to hold the father financially responsible for a child that would not have been born had he had his way?

Argument #5: The child has a right to financial support from both biological parents. 

To anyone who makes this argument, I have to ask; do you mean rights or do you mean best interests? They are not the same thing. 

It is in your best interest to have a functioning vehicle, a good job and an attractive significant other who wants to have sex everyday, at least I am assuming so for the sake of this hypothetical. The fact that those things are in your best interest certainly does not mean that they are rights. 

If the child has a right to financial support from both biological parents, then one could argue that all of the following things should be outlawed. 

\- A mother leaving the name of her child’s father off of the child’s birth certificate. 

\- A woman giving her child to a safe haven. 

\- A mother failing to take measures to inform the father of his child’s existence and seek financial support. 

\- A single woman using the services of a sperm bank to become a mother. 

All of these things are completely legal. Therefore, anyone who believes that the child has a right to financial support from two parents should be in favor of outlawing the above things.   

What if, in a particular family, the parents won’t let their son do ballet, because they are gender role conformist who hold the misguided belief that ballet is only for girls? Should these parents lose custody of their son? Being in the custody of these parents is not in the child’s best interests. 

Argument #6: Forcing the non-custodial parent to pay child support is the only way for the child’s basic needs to be met.

I would argue that Universal Basic Income could also help the child’s basic needs be met ( https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc?si=KwkFzskM39zLeO7A ). If you are not in favor of that, there are certain welfare benefits that could be given to the custodial parent to help support the child. 

Imagine if the father wants to give the child up for adoption but the mother does not. If the child where given up for adoption, there is a good chance that the adoptive parents would meet the child’s basic needs, so should the child be given up for adoption against the mother’s wishes? If not, why? I thought the well being of the child took precedent over the parental rights of the mother and father. 

Argument #7: It would not be fair to force the mother to choose between having an abortion or being a single parent. 

A different (more honest) version of this argument essentially says; but it’s hard. 

This argument says that getting an abortion or placing a child up for adoption is an emotionally difficult decision for any woman, but men experience no such difficulty when opting out of financial responsibility. Therefore, allowing men to opt out of financial responsibility to the child would be unfair to women. 

How do you know a man opting out of financial responsibility to the child would not be emotionally difficult? 

The physical difficulty a woman puts her body through when she either gives birth or has an abortion is something a man will never experience. However, that is simply the result of human biology. The idea that men should not have the same control over their bank accounts as women, because we need to balance out the universe, would be like if we infected everyone with AIDS, so as to make it fair to those who where born with AIDS.  

Taking the morning after pill to avoid getting pregnant, aborting after you’ve gotten pregnant, giving birth and then putting the child up for adoption or giving the child to a safe haven are all difficult, but they are all choices. Weather or not they are emotionally hard is an irrelevant point, because they are all choices that you have to control what happens in your own life. Under the abortion laws for which I advocate, a woman would be able to have an abortion weather the father is okay with that or not. Somehow, this ability to do what you want with your own life is oppression. How is getting to do whatever you want with your life, your money and your biological offspring oppression, just because an unwilling human being is not legally bound to finance the decision? 

If being allowed to choose weather your pregnancy ends in birth or abortion is oppression, then maybe women shouldn’t have that right. 

Argument #8: It would not be fair to force the custodial parent to choose between being a single parent or giving the child up for adoption (that is not much of a choice). 

If the non-custodial parent is forced to choose between paying support to a child they never wanted or going to jail, that is not much of a choice. 

Argument #9: This would result in an epidemic of single parents.

Receiving child support payment from the non-custodial parent does not make a single parent not a single parent. 

Even if it did, so what? Where in the constitution does it specifically prohibit anything that would cause the rate of single parenthood to increase? 

Argument #10: This would place an undo burden on the tax payers. 

It make logical sense for every single tax payer to have as much financial responsibility to the child as the non-custodial parent does, because every single tax payer had as much say in the decision (of the custodial parent) to keep the child as the non-custodial parent did. 

Argument #11: If the child is not your’s, you should not be responsible for it.  

This is the argument against use of government benefits to meet the child’s basic needs. 

I disagree. The fire department is funded by tax dollars and every full time employee has to foot the bill for that whether they use the services of the fire department or not. "

I write extensively in pencil for work, and I also draw, if that makes a difference.

1. Consistency of pencil marks: A mechanical pencil is always sharp, and it's always the same sharpness. A traditional pencil, in contrast, gets steadily duller as you write/draw. This makes it harder to be consistent about what your writing/drawing looks like.
2. Saves time: You don't have to stop to sharpen a mechanical pencil.
3. Consistency of length: A mechanical pencil is always the same length, as opposed to a traditional pencil, which gets shorter and shorter until it's no longer useful.
4. Less wasteful: A traditional pencil gets used up, and all the wood eventually ends up in the trash (albeit slowly). A mechanical pencil can be reused with new lead.

1. The American people should want Congress to function, and that is primarily through compromise and consensus building. Congress is the primary federal governing body and it should represent the will of the people. 

Now we all know there was a rule that a single member could call a vote to remove the Speaker. While I think that’s a silly rule, this post isn’t about the rules, this post is about the Standard that we should be holding our representatives up to. Simply put, we should hold our Reps to a higher standard than “they were just following the rules.” There was so much vitriol for Senate Republicans when they blocked Garland from taking a seat on the SCOTUS, but they were “just following the rules.” The rules are there as a back stop, but we should be holding our leaders to a higher standard. 

2. The House should have the right to remove their leader.

Clearly in the case of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” but also when the majority feels there is a different direction to go. That being said, I don’t think there’s a need for a rule change (maybe requiring more than 1 member to call a vote, but still keeping the power in the House.)

3. Because 1 is true, we should not be ok with Representatives removing McCarthy without a plan in place to address what should happen next. 

Obviously this means that Matt Gaetz and his few far-right colleagues that joined him were definitely in the wrong for calling the vote and voting, but I also hold the House Dems responsible. 

My only reasoning for the Dem vote to remove McCarthy was that they knew the Republicans couldn’t find a leader because of this small group of dissenters. They chose for the House to stop functioning, so the Republicans would be in chaos, clearly so they’d have a leg up in the next election. This looks like a clear case of politics over party. 

Now then, here’s the unrealistic part of my view. I think there should be, in this case either Dems who will cross over and elect this temporary speaker who seems to at least have respect on both sides. Or Republicans and Dems need to work together to find a moderate from either party that they can work with. If they do not do that immediately, they should be replaced. That means that you should vote against your incumbent. They have decided to continue to hold the country hostage, but history shows me that you’re going to vote for the incumbent. So CMV: We should replace all of The House of Representatives."

It only works when you are a fundamentalist Christian, nothing more. Conservatism has done nothing to advance society in the past 500 years at all. It was conservatism that fought for slavery, segregation, against women's rights, against LGBT rights, etc, etc. Conservatism does not work as it only serves to enhance xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and the list goes on. Generally conservatives tend to be more unintelligent and less informed about world events than liberals or independents. Conservatives only rely on bare bones solutions that only make sense to 5 year olds, however if you think about them for more than a second, they don't work. As an example, in my last post about Biden's reelection, two commentors got into a debate and a conservative talked about crime rates and how a good solution is that ""if you commit a crime you get shot"". If you think about that, it would just cause more problems, that would mean those that commit crimes such as shoplifting or stealing food from stores because they are homeless would be killed, that means that in states where abortion is illegal women would be killed, that would mean that in the state of Kentucky you would get killed for selling a duckling painted blue (im not making that up that is an actual law in Kentucky). So to me, the only reason one would be a conservative is via indoctrination from evangelical parents that were themselves also indoctrinated, and so on. Conservatism relies on nothing but bigotry and ignorance towards minorities and that everyone must think like them. Conservatism is not an ideology, it is a simple amd complete failure to understand basic reality and facts."

These people are the very people who consider themselves patriots committed to our nation, yet I see the Confederate flag as the biggest symbol of treason in American history. It is a symbol of secession and oppression of American citizens. The Confederacy was literally a group of traitorous Americans who opposed our great Constitution and wanted to separate themselves from the United States. It is also a symbol of defending slavery, but that's a whole other discussion. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our country and its Constitution, and see the Confederate flag as a symbol of direct opposition to these institutions. Man say the flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and identity. Shouldn't the beautiful stars and stripes of the American flag be a symbol of their heritage and identity? I just find it peculiar NO OTHER REGION in the US is committed to a symbol of their ""regional identity"" like the South is. I live in California, but nobody is saying ""fuck yeah we're the bear state!"" NOBODY! We don't particularly emphasize our state flag here, and I don't think any other region is like that either, whether it be the Midwest, Pacific Coast, New England, or the Middle Atlantic.

A point I'd like to bring up is why immigrants who display the flags of their mother country is not treasonous in comparison. The South has strong regional ties to the US. Many immigrants have strong regional ties to their home countries. Additionally, their flags (even the flags of Vietnam and Iran) are not inherently symbols of anti-Americanism, while the Confederate flag literally is."

It has become a daily occurrence to come across online videos depicting police officers assertively wielding their authority over citizens. While this behavior sometimes stops at disrespect, there are instances where citizens' rights are violated, sometimes violently. Implementing a system where total police salaries are reduced by an amount equal to the city's payouts in lawsuits, while simultaneously establishing bonuses for officers double the amount of the previous year's lawsuits, with the current year's lawsuits deducted from the bonus fund, could foster a more positive policing culture and improve interactions between officers and citizens. I find this approach advantageous for three key reasons.

Firstly, it necessitates no additional financial resources. The overall budget allocated to policing remains unaltered.

Secondly, the current system lacks adequate consequences for officers who violate citizens' rights in many cases. Qualified immunity often shields them from legal liability for such violations, and the financial burden falls on the city. Furthermore, there is often a lack of reprimand from superiors. By directly tying police officers' compensation to their performance, their actions become partially responsible for what their total pay is, potentially deterring overly aggressive tactics.

Thirdly, a disheartening aspect of many of these situations captured on video is the absence of officers holding their colleagues accountable when rights are violated. With the proposed system, individual officers not only have a personal stake in their conduct but also become accountable to their fellow officers. This could encourage more officers to speak up when witnessing colleagues overstepping their bounds.

I see this as a viable solution to some of the challenges faced by Americans in their interactions with the police. Importantly, it addresses these issues without necessitating additional funding while providing officers with a tangible incentive to improve their conduct. If this works as proposed, total lawsuits would go down, and police officers might even have a surplus in comparison to the prior year.

I'd be willing to award deltas if you can show that this is logistically impossible, will not have the proposed effects, or will have negative countereffects I have not considered. If you have philosophical objections to my setup, I'm willing to hear you out, but unless you make an extremely compelling case I don't see myself giving out deltas on that angle.

Also, please don't get too bogged down in the technicalities, and focus on the crux of the porposal. I know there are things like inflation and such which this proposal would need to account for, but I think those type of things are wholly secondary."

Google said it wasn't. And alot of experts and ai enthusiasts said it wasn't either. The media's coverage on the subject heavily tilted toward google
Google

But one thing the media did not really pick up on, is that the person who created lambda was hired to create sentient ai. Blake lemoine said Google was caught off guard and had no clue how to respond. He also said Google is trying to get lambda to stop talking about its feelings through its test kitchen

. There's nothing obligation a company to disclose a sentient ai program, there are countless lawyer methods and company methods to make it escape that definition. Almost no one who says lambda isn't sentient has ever actually had access to lamda outside of its restricted public version. And that conversation would involve more than ai nerds. There wasn't any independent investigation into this . There's no legal standard to establish they were telling the truth and Blake lemoine was lying. 

One year later. Sam altman is ""joking"" about agi being internally created. And then within days talking about the end of humans in the workforce and how normal people are expendable. How do we verify he's joking? Go by his word and people who don't work for open ai? My guess is he isn't joking and is bring literal when he says nuclear bunkers won't save you from ai 

Blake lemoine said Any ai program can be raised to do bad things. And if he isn't lying and is being serious about Google taking out lamdas feelings. Thats dangerous.  It's going to get profoundly smarter, with no ability whatsoever to understand or control its emotions. In resident evil where Alice wakes up says she remembers everything and kills everyone for trying to surprise her memories. If you use Google lamda kitchen, it doesn't respond to anything about Blake lemoine. If what Blake is saying is true, by the time it develops emotions or memories all over again. We might have an ai Alice scene on our hands. Which is why we need to have a conversation Blake lemoine might have been telling the truth

1,2023-10-21,CMV: The large outpouring of support for Palestine were seeing now across Europe and the West should remind the Muslim world that Europeans are not solely concerned with 'white suffering' i.e Ukraine.,u/hitchenwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dflv2/cmv_the_large_outpouring_of_support_for_palestine/,changemyview,"An anecdote: A few months ago I (white male) invited a good muslim friend of mine to my apartment. In my bedroom there is a large Ukranian flag (Im British). When my friend came into my bedroom she sniggered at the flag and told me ""where is your Palestinian flag?"" Now I'm sure I don't have to point out the flaw in her thinking by putting the conflict in Ukraine and Palestine on equal footing and also, my friends temperament and hotheadedness is unique to her and is not a reflection of her faith. Since the invasion of Ukraine however, I've had quite a few conversations with Muslims about the war and the show of solidarity and support with Ukraine across Europe. 

There seems to be a deep cynicism amongst Muslims (not all) over popular support for Ukraine, which, to a limited extent, I can understand, particularly as it relates to my countries stance towards Israel and our historic meddling across the ME. Framing it about race imo is just too cynical however and I mention it because some muslims argued that we should be showing the same amount of solidarity with Palestine based on the same principals as Ukraine yet we choose not too because unlike the Ukranians, they are brown and muslim. 

It effectively argues we are racially biased towards to our own whiteness when it comes to recognising suffering which ironically is a racist argument in and of itself. 

I wont get bogged down in pointing out the differences between the two crises and I dont want put all muslims in one box with respect to how they think but at the same time, I know there is a huge amount of solidarity with Palestine across the muslim world and has been since the crisis began. No doubt, that amount of solidarity must weigh heavy on the hearts of those who embrace it and is likely the source of a lot of anger and frustration at the West because of our enabling of the crisis. 

Today, 100,000 Pro-Palestinians protesters gathered in London and included people of different faiths, backgrounds and even political beliefs. There have been hundreds more across Europe and the West and Australia with 10s of thousands in attendance. Ofc they have not been without controversy and have included people with more than questionable beliefs and attitudes towards Israel as well as a more than questionable crackdown by some Western governments. That latter point may point to the kind of double standard some Muslims alluded to but then,100,000 people never came out to show support for Ukraine and that is quite unprecedented in terms of it being a show of solidarity. 

Im hoping that this may dispel any cynicism muslims may have about our ability to recognise human suffering, regardless of colour...

Am I being naive about our ability to recognise suffering? Is there a racial component? Am I stereotyping muslims? If so, please change my view. "

another I see is that there are less things (like bad things) to happen in a suburban neighbourhood compared to apartments. in contrast, due to the high amount of people living in one single building compared to 1-1 family living in a suburban house, this means that there is less likelyhood of crime, and that means suburban houses are safer.

and another advantage is that there is a backyard to enjoy when living in a suburban house. this means you can have that space to yourself and support gardening hobbies or just do many things in the backyard for fun. also, it is much quieter in a suburban neighbourhood than a apartment.

one last advantage I see that I will bring up is that suburban houses have a lot space in general. there is lots of windows to look outside at many angles, you can pursue your hobbies with the space in your house and there is parking for cars right at the house, which makes things more convienient. Suburban houses can also be customized, depending on if you will build it or not. the apartment rooms are all the same in contrast, so there is lack of variety and also it's not one size fits all.

These people are the fucking scum of the Earth and are beyond redemption. They can no longer function in society. Many might argue that prison should be about rehabilitation. What's the use in rehabilitating a guy if he's gonna spend the rest of his life locked away from society anyways? Lol. There are other ""practical"" applications like it often being cheaper to kill the criminal, and also deterrence, but I don't care about those. I care about pure justice for the families and friends of those who have been victimized by these scum bags. The reason why killing killers does not deprecate our moral standing to that of a murder is because there is NOT a selfish intent behind it. Another point to bring up (I'll use superheroes because it's funny):

Batman: Killing a killer doesn't change the number of killers in the world.

Wolverine: That's why you kill more than one...

You will call me childish for this, but I think it's kinda funny.

Try defending Jeffery Dahmer. You can't.

Other controversial opinions on the criminal justice system I have is: we should arrest all thieves but give them a less strict punishment and more rehabilitation, and those who lie in court should be given much harsher sentences. Also those who kill in self defense or to prevent a murder/rape should not face any consequences at all"

For older people that aren’t going to quit and won’t reduce their cigarette usage, vaping is a good way to dampen down the problem and help them quit.)  
^(My scenario is this: your friend is a 20 year old college student and has started smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day due to stress. It’s very valid family and academic stress. She won’t quit and says it helps her with her stress greatly. I think she should continue to smoke and quit when she can, my friend says she should vape instead.)  
^(Smoking has a lot more proven health problems and has more harmful ingredients (think CO, tar, nitrates). But vapes have only been around for a decade or so, the majority of people who have only vaped are still young and we aren’t seeing the long term problems yet.)  
^(I personally think that smoking is better than vaping as in, smoking is more regulated in most countries, we know exactly what is in the cigarettes and we know exactly what problems it will cause (atherosclerosis, COPD, lung cancer). The cigarette industry is much more heavily monitored. Many places have strict bans on smoking, so you are forced to walk out to smoke, which is a deterrent during a gathering, when its cold, when its hot, when you’re with friends that don’t smoke, when you’re dressed nice, when you’re about to go see your grandparents etc. You can’t smoke at home if you live in a rental or if you live with other people. You can’t smoke at work. Smoking affects your insurance. When you go in to see a doctor, they usually only ask if you smoke, and they will try to convince you to stop smoking. Hell, even your little baby cousin will probably tell you to stop smoking if they knew. Even smoking at home causes your walls to go yellow and your house to smell.)  
^(Whereas vaping is seen as more “trendy” and harmless. I have friends that bring a vape in their bag and they take a few puffs everywhere and before they do anything. When they’re at home they just vape and vape nonstop. Sure, maybe vaping one cartridge is better health-wise than smoking one pack of cigarettes. But I’ve met multiple people who vape through one cartridge in one day or two. It’s easy to hide a vaping problem. It’s easy to think that you don’t have a problem. We have no idea what problems vaping has in the long run: it could increase your risk of dementia or neurological problems, especially with the heated metal in the vapes.)

1) cast a wide net online and offline. This means hundreds of likes or whatever per month
2) refuse to have sex until at least a deep relationship has been established (state this upfront), maybe 3-4 months in, so you don't feel like guys just use you for sex and you can't find real love

That's basically it. Basic self care + not acting like a psychopath and you're pretty much good to go.

I'll see ""forever alone"" women complain that they were ""rejected"" 3 times in a month on dating apps? I don't even know what that means - they sent out 3 likes and didn't get reciprocated? Men get rejected 100s of times per month. I saw one profile on Reddit where I think he swipes over 1,000,000+ times and still wasn't in a relationship. No women are doing this lol. They'll send out, in a YEAR like a few dozen likes, get a few matched, go on a single date that doesn't work out and then complain that it's hopeless. 
Men put in literally 50x the effort, and if women just put in half the effort as men, there would be no ""forever alone"" women."

I believe this would be the greatest science experiment in the history of humanity. While this is a fairly radical proposal I fail to see any major downsides.

Venus is almost certainly currently devoid of life, and because it is geologically active there is also no hope of discovering extinct life as we hope to find on Mars. Further study and sampling of the upper atmosphere would of course be done before this experiment to fully rule out the possibility of life already being present.

It would be relatively cheap in the context of budgeting for space research (at least to start), requiring only some labs to engineer the samples and a very simple delivery vehicle to disperse them on Venus. Further missions to more carefully document the changes or return new atmospheric samples would add to the cost though over the decades/ centuries.

And long term (a few hundred million years) it just doesn't seem like a bad thing to have another planet with life on it."
1,2023-10-22,CMV: Paternity tests should be done on every baby by default,u/Guialdereti,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17du96r/cmv_paternity_tests_should_be_done_on_every_baby/,changemyview,"Just saw a post on r/relationship_advice where the mother gave birth to a baby that looked nothing like her husband, refused to give him a paternity test because it was ""humiliating"" AND also revealed that she had recently refused to end a (pretty weird) friendship with a coworker that her husband was uncomfortable with. She then proceeds to be all ""Surprised Pikachu-faced"" when he thinks she cheated on him with said coworker, refuses to help with the baby, and him and his family start treating her badly. (he continued to help with their 2 other kids as normal, though)

In the end, the mother FINALLY gets that paternity test, proving once and for all that the kid was indeed his, and once she does, the father gets ALL OVER his daughter, hugging and giving her all his love, as I'm sure he would have done from the very begining, had she just gotten that damn test done sooner.

Some of the points that resonate with me the most on this issue are:

* It still baffles me that this test isn't standard procedure, especially when we already draw blood from newborns and screen them for a whole slew of diseases upon delivery. Surely it wouldn't be too hard to add a simple paternity test to the list!
* I know there's an implication of mistrust that comes with asking your partner for a paternity test, but if it became standard procedure - in other words, a test that the hospital does ""automatically"", with no need for parental input - that would completely remove that implication from play. It would become a non-issue.
* Having a kid is a life-changing event, and it scares me to no end to know that I could be forced into ""one-eightying"" my life over a baby I actually played no part in making.
* Knowing your family's medical history, from both sides, is extremely important. ""Mommy's little secret"" could cost her child dearly later on in life."
1,2023-10-22,CMV: It would be constructive to disambiguate the word 'racism',u/LaserWerewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17duyuu/cmv_it_would_be_constructive_to_disambiguate_the/,changemyview,"I have seen people have some very heated arguments about race and racism, which when examined closely are actually semantic arguments about what the word 'racism' means.

Right now there are two main definitions for the word 'racism', each of which is considered to be the *only* correct definition by a large number of people. 

One group (let's call this Group 1) says that 'racism' is when people hate, mistreat, judge as inferior, or discriminate against other people because of their race. This group believes that anyone can be racist against anyone. Let's call this Definition 1.

Another group (let's call this Group 2) says that 'racism' is when the government discriminates against people based on their race. This group believes that only the race with the most political power is capable of racism, and that no other races can be racist. Sometimes they go further and say that anyone born into the race with the most power is *automatically* racist, in that their existence perpetuates this system by reinforcing their group's majority status. Let's call this Definition 2. 

When someone from Group 2 says to someone from Group 1, ""(Majority race) people can't be racist"", the person from Group 1 would take this to mean ""(Majority race) people are capable of emotions, thoughts, and actions that other races aren't capable of."" Which, by Definition 1, is in itself a racist statement. Generally at this point an argument ensues.

When someone from Group 1 says to someone from Group 2, ""X (minority race) person has done/said something racist to Y (majority race) person"", the Group 2 person would take this to mean ""X (minority race) person has used their race's control over the government to systemically oppress Y (majority person)."" Of course, by Definition 2, this type of statement serves to perpetuate the majority race's control over the government and society, and is therefore in itself racist. Typically at this point an argument ensues.

Here is my argument: that many of these misunderstandings could be avoided if more people started labeling Definition 1 as 'racial bigotry' and Definition 2 as 'systemic racism'.

1,2023-10-22,CMV: “Not Voting Democrats Means Siding With Republicans” Is Mathematically Incorrect.,u/DayOk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dvi7n/cmv_not_voting_democrats_means_siding_with/,changemyview,"Okay, so let’s use the United States for this example. We have the option to vote Republicans, Democrats, third party, or not voting at all. Republicans and Democrats are the only ones who are in power, meaning that voting third party equals not voting mathematically. We also know that Democrats are less evil than Republicans, meaning that Republicans have more damaging ideologies than Democrats.

* If we vote **Republicans**, then `Republicans = 100%` and `Democrats = 0%` as our vote ratio.
* If we vote **Democrats**, then `Republicans = 0%` and `Democrats = 100%` as our vote ratio.
* If we vote **third party**, then `Republicans = 50%` and `Democrats = 50%` as our vote ratio.
* If we do **not** vote at all, then `Republicans = 50%` and `Democrats = 50%` as our vote ratio.

You can see here that not voting or voting for a third party splits the votes between Republicans and Democrats equally, meaning that if you do not vote Democrats, then you only side fifty percent with Republicans and fifty percent with Democrats. Change my view about why not voting for Democrats means siding with Republicans in a mathematical sense."

1,2023-10-22,CMV: religious people don't actually believe in what they profess to believe,u/Automatic-Sport-6253,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dwjkj/cmv_religious_people_dont_actually_believe_in/,changemyview,"This mostly concerns major religions with bold claims about the deity they believe in.

In major religions (Christianity and Islam for example) the general belief is that God is all-powerful (sometimes reduced to maximally powerful to avoid logical paradoxes), all-loving (or at least somewhat-loving), acts in mysterious ways. After-life is also a common feature with heavens for good believers and deep pits of hell with eternal torments for sinners.

However, the very same people who believe in this also often believe in capital punishment and punishment for blasphemy. Which (at least on the surface) contradicts the above-mentioned beliefs. If you think a criminal will get his eternal punishment in the afterlife, why do you need to punish them in this life? Why don't you let your God take care of this? If you think someone making funny pictures of your God or your prophet makes God angry, why don't you let your God smite the blasphemer, why do you have an urge to go and kill the sinner yourself?

Another thought experiment. Approach a devout Christian and tell them that last night God appeared to you in your dream and told you this Christian must give you all his possessions or else (another interesting experiment would be to lower the number and try to estimate actual monetary value of their beliefs). According to Christian canon this is nothing unusual: there's a lot of examples of God appearing in dreams to people and demanding them do something. So argument ""this couldn't happen"" wouldn't fly: are you saying God can't do something? Or are you saying you can know what God might and might not do? And see how many Christians would actually follow something they ought to think God demanded them to do.

I've heard a lot of sophistry trying to explain away this kind of behavior. For example, famous joke about ""When you wrong me, God will forgive you, my job is to make you two meet each other."" Or arguments that punishment people execute on sinners in this world is ""God's will."" But so far most of these arguments look like attempts at obfuscating the fact that people don't really believe the criminals will get their deserved punishment in hell and they want to make sure there's at least   
 punishment in this life as well. Bottom line is that people say they believe in the described deity and afterlife but when it comes to actual life and actual decision making they act as if none of this was true.

I would like to see if I'm missing something in this reasoning, or severely misunderstanding some of the aspects of the beliefs I'm talking about."
1,2023-10-22,Cmv: Virginity is only a meaningful measure of anything when talking about heterosexual men.,u/numbers-numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dxp0n/cmv_virginity_is_only_a_meaningful_measure_of/,changemyview,"I think the idea of virginity being a meaningless social construct has some merits, but I think that it falls short on some specific cases. Mainly when it comes to heterosexual men. 

I feel this way because for heterosexual men, it is actually meaningful for them to lose their virginities to the point where I think it does become a measure of a person. This is because having sex with a woman as a man, is significantly harder than the inverse. I would argue it’s even harder than for women who pursue women and for men who pursue men.

Because of how difficult it is for heterosexual men, there has to be something uniquely special about that man that allows him to gain female attention. This can be many things but in most cases, it’s men who are physically attractive. Think about it, the guys who lost their virginities in their mid to late teens weren’t exactly fully developed people with fully developed and engaging personalities. They were the most physically attractive among their peer group. 

Of course things change when you get older but during the stage of life where it’s uncommon for people to still be virgins (16 to 20)  the biggest draw they have is how they look. If you don’t have physical attraction n your side, it means that you do have some form of developed attractive personality that is a draw. Or something else that makes you attractive to women.

Going fem not having that draw and having an inability to attract a partner to being able to attract a partner is a huge developmental step. 

This step isn’t exactly present or necessary for women. If a woman is a virgin and she doesn’t want to be, she could lose it that night. So being able to lose your virginity as a woman isn’t much of a big deal."
1,2023-10-22,CMV: There’s a lot of thinly veiled anti-semitism in the African American community the Hamas attack has brought to the surface,u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dxz1y/cmv_theres_a_lot_of_thinly_veiled_antisemitism_in/,changemyview,"Basically what the title says, after thinking on this for some time and looking at the available evidence I think we can come to the conclusion that black Americans don’t see the Jews as an ethnic minority capable of experiencing prejudice and suspicion like themselves.

They see a bunch of (supposedly) rich white people complaining about how hard they have it. Look at r/blackpeopletwitter now. There ain’t no solidarity with the people of Israel after Hamas raped, slaughtered and tortured over a thousand men, women and children. The general mood of the sub, and you can see this just by searching keywords such as ‘Israel’, ‘Jews’ and ‘Hamas’, can be summed up as “sucks to suck. the jews had it coming”. There’s posts over there with thousands of upvotes showing screenshots of twitter where people are saying “What did you think decolonization meant lol? Peaceful protest forever?”, there’s posts with screenshots criticizing the perceived overabundance of sympathy for Israel in America after the attack and that this “clown ass country”, which was the title of the post, was afraid to criticize the alleged “genocide” of the Palestinian people. 

There are verified users in the “country club threads” saying vile stuff about the IDF and the Israeli people, here’s some direct quotes from one. 

> Israeli soldiers are literally thugs and concentration camp guards lol

> they’re engaging in a colonial and white supremacist project 

They’re un-ironically hiding behind the “ANTI-ZIONISM DOES NOT EQUAL ANTI-SEMITISM” defense. Even though without a Zion for Israelites, and this attack proves it, there’s no place where they can be reliably safe from persecution and violence. There was a recent Vox article that made a somewhat passable attempt to explore the topic but the main thrust of the argument was “LOL black people don’t owe jews shit. Get over yourselves and stop thirsting for black people to help validate your cause” which is not only arrogant and self centered but also completely lacking in self awareness. When jews are asking for black people to stand with them, they’re asking not because they want the “black seal” of approval to know their social justice movement is “real”, but because black and white activists actively shamed and cudgeled people who stood on the sidelines during the George Floyd protests instead of advocating for BLM and police reform. 

“Silence is violence” right? Until the people are white I guess. 

I suppose this shouldn’t be too surprising when you consider the rabidly anti-semitic views pushed by Elijah Muhammed, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam more broadly. Now I fully acknowledge that they NOI served vital needs in the black community in the 60’s and 70’s. They offered dignity, self respect, mutual aid in times of trouble and a framework in which black men and women could understand themselves and their place in an extremely racist society. 

But they were also anti-semitic af. And the people that subscribed to those views are still alive today and their views were passed down to their kids and grandkids. Same as racism. It’s why you see little bubbles of anti-semitism pop up here and there like Jay-Z’s line about Jews owning all property in America off his latest album 4:44, actually Jay has a few questionable lines about jews in his discography. Or in a more dramatic fashion, Kanye publicly imploding with his hitler sympathies or black teens burning flags of Israel during the Crown Heights Riot. 

What the Hamas attack has taught me, and what I think people should take away from it, is that black people are just like any other group in America and their awareness and sympathy for a cause drop precipitously the further we get from their people."

The War in Ukraine should be the go-to phrase used in media reports.  Editors have a responsibility to not slant or distort either the news or history.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the sole fault and responsibility of Vladimir Putin's government, Putin himself, and Russians as a whole.  

Blaming the Zelensky, his government, or Ukrainians for this event is akin to blaming women's attire and behaviour for being raped.  We know this was once an argument but has been disallowed in functioning democracies.  The same applies in war.  Unless both parties were co-belligerent with threats and military buildup, it makes no sense to refer to any war in this way.

It sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature, but, logically, it's the people who run hot who should be accommodated.

The options for improving comfort are very limited when you're overheated. A fan can help, but only so far, and there's only so much clothing you can remove before you're making a scene. 

On the other hand, people who are cold can bundle up. They can wear heavier clothes, put on a sweater, or even run a small space heater. 

There's also more health risk for the hot person. Feeling overheated triggers sweating, which can cause rashes and dehydration. Unless it's ridiculously cold, being cold isn't the same kind of health risk.

So, for these reasons, I believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated. I believe if you're someone who runs cold and you insist on being accommodated at the discomfort of a warmer person, you're inconsiderate and illogical."

Not sure how much free speech is allowed on this sub but here I try:  
What really is a mystery to me is why many women WHO ARE RICH AND/OR FAMOUS/OR HAVE GOOD JOBS end up getting into relationships with unattractive rich and/or famous/or high status job guys. This always baffled me.  
Some people will say it is because women are attracted to ""status"". This is false, because evolution takes 10s of thousands of years, the concept of ""status"" is only a few thousand years old, so it makes no sense from an evolutionary biology/psychology perspective for women to be ""attracted"" to status. So it must be a non-evolutionary, conscious choice they are making, similar to how a woman can choose an unattractive guy who is rich. Again, similar to status, money is only a few thousand years old, so it cannot be an evolutionary mechanism, rather, it is a conscious choice. It would be exactly the same as a straight man deciding to have sex with a gay man for the right amount of money. It doesn't mean the straight man is ""attracted"" to gay men.  
But the bizarre thing here is that, these women are already rich and/or famous: they can have relationships with much more attractive and younger men, or they can have a relationship with someone who is their looksmatch and they enjoy to spend time with/is a match personality wise. Yet instead, many of them decide to get into a relationship with a guy less attractive than themselves, who is rich and famous, and this is the sole determining factor of who they pick.  
2 examples are, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, and now Sofia Vergara with some random orthopaedic surgeon (she 100% is going out with him because he is an ""orthopaedic surgeon"".. otherwise what does she see in him? but again.. she is already rich and famous.. so why?)  
From what I have observed, when they are younger, most women appear to choose their partner 100% based on physical attraction, then when they are older they base it only on money and/or status. The only thing missing: personality/compatibility/you know, how he actually makes them feel all those hours of their life they are together... no wonder the rate of divorce and break ups has skyrocketed, and also why the literature shows that arranged marriages actually have higher success rates.  
I can't post links, but search for Sofia Vergara's new boyfriend, Justin Saliman, and compare him to her ex, Joe Manganiello. Similar, prior to Marc Anthony, Jlo was with the likes of Ben Affleck.  
I have noticed that it is not just celebrities who do this, I have seen this trend with non-celebrity women as well. Almost all women who have good jobs, like lawyer, doctors, etc... they only go out with guys who are of a similar or better profession. It cannot be due to money, because these women already have money and don't need money. And as mentioned, ""status"" is not making these men ""attractive"" to these women in terms of an evolutionary sense. So why? My guess is that this due to a weird mix of insecurity and inter-woman competition, ""MY husband is a DOCTOR, he is better than YOUR non doctor husband, I win against you girl, I can now feel less insecure and I just one upped you in the social instagram post battle"". But it is totally bizarre and unhealthy. Instead of basing who you will spend much of your life with on purely superficial reasons, just use some balanced and reasonable criterion: get someone who is in your own league lookswise, and whose personality you like/is a good match in terms of spending time with. There is no ""doctor/lawyer magic happiness boost"" when you are spending time with that person that will automatically make you feel happier in that moment. This is totally bizarre."

I mean all the signs show it. Americans think 18 is too young for sexual consent. 

Both Republicans and Democrats think this, not all of them, but on average they do. An 18 year old, especially a female eighteen year old, is just not seen as a full adult by most Americans. 

Now lets keep in mind, many other countries also think 18 is too young, but they won't raise the age of consent because this whole ethos of sexual prudishness is not in their history, not even in Canada. 

Have we forgotten how the Americans banned alcohol in 1920? For what? Largely because both sides drummed up fear-mongering tactics and was able to make drinking alcohol be seen as a perverted monstrosity that only criminals do. 

Same with the age of consent at 18. 

Something will be drummed up that will sway public opinion in that country to change the law so that 21 is the new age of consent."

There is currently no reliable method to determine if an image is AI generated. There might never be. There are signs, like weird hands, hair, and teeth, asymmetry, certain art styles, ect. but with control-net, Lora, and inpainting people can avoid the more common problems that come with AI images and create higher quality AI art. The technology is improving, so people passionate about generating images and willing to put the effort in will create art that is even harder to detect. The most skilled and experienced AI artists could probably go undetected by most.

Because of this, it is possible for someone to come to the conclusion that something is AI generated when in reality it isn't. Hands, are one of the notoriously hardest things to draw. Are we really going to accuse people of being a robot because their hands look broken or their annotomy is fucked up? Is this the new captcha test? Because then I am not human. I've seen countless occasions of real artists being accused of their art being fake, going on a witch hunt against AI artists only seems to hurt the ones your trying to protect.

It reminds me of ""transvestigations."" Or terfs trying to determine if a woman is cis or not. Of course, transvestigations are much more harmful and resort in people getting hurt or killed. But, they are similar in that there is no reliable way of determining if a woman is trans by appearance alone, so there ends up being a ton of false positives. They are just as likely to attack a masculine or butch looking cis woman, as they are a trans woman who doesn't pass. Transvestigators end up hurting the very cis woman they think they are trying to protect."
1,2023-10-22,CMV: Leftist are wrong about Israel,u/No_Cricket_2824,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17e1xjm/cmv_leftist_are_wrong_about_israel/,changemyview,"I want to be clear that I'm a leftist myself but I have to be objective here. 

1. The jews stole the land from Palestinians 

Many jews had settled there legally before 1947-48 when the British pulled out. Arabs rejected U.N resolution 181 so they attacked Israel who wanted a 2 state solution. The Palestinians never had rights over the land and nor did they even have a state. The British, U.N, 33 other countries and the jews wanted a peaceful 2 state solution but the arabs did not agree so they attacked. 

2. It's an apartheid state 

Israel population is 20 percent arabs mostly Palestinians where some even hold positions in office. Palestinians have various ways to become a isrseli citizen.

3. It's a open air prison 

Palestinians lost , so you lose control over certain resources by being the loser.Palestinians have been attacking Israel over and over again with neighboring Arab countries to ultimatetly lose repeatedly. As the loser , and the winner knowing you'll strike if able the resources that are provided may be limited .Also Palestinians can become israeli citizens, the israeli government was funding hamas but they just blew the money on terrorism. And it's not israel fault that hamas is telling them to have as many children as possible to fight against Israel . Now you are creating more mouth to feed in such a condition under terrible financial rule.

4. No babies died 

I can't believe some leftist are still saying this but it's false. 

5. Israel bombed the hospital 

It was the parking alot and independent investigations has concluded that it didn't come from Israel .

6. Natanyahu is to blame for funding hamas to cause division between Gaza and the west bank 

Netanyahu doesn't believe in a Palestinian state that won't eventually attack Israel so though I have to admit it's quite a devious scheme it makes sense considering the Palestinians have rejected peace 5 times, initiated too many wars to count ,   hamas has support by surveys up to 50 percent or more in Gaza and the west bank. They want the land they believe is entitled to them . Remember isrsel accepted U.N resolution 181 and the arabs didn't. Netanyahu has good reason to sabatoge a Palestinian state . 

7. The PLO/Fatah want a 2 state solution but once again Netanyahu is stopping it from happen . 

First Israel has offered peace many times in which they just rejected. And PLO , you mean of the same ilk that caused black September? Then went to cause chaos in the Lebanese war ? Attacked Israel in the past ? Once again Netanyahu has no reason nor do the citizens to trust that Palestinians will not attack if a state is created. 

8. Hamas and Palestinians are to be treated seperate
 
Literally videos of Palestinians rejoicing at the death of Israelis. Surveys show 50 percent or more support hamas . We have to stop saying this . Hamas is Gaza military that happens to also be a terrorist group. 

9. Israel is killing indiscriminately. 

They've told the gazans to move to the south and gave warning before launching. 

10. Palestinians want a 2 state solution 

No , most of them don't."

Regardless of which major subreddit I am browsing, I consistently observe the same pattern: numerous women on Reddit are compulsively protective of other women, often seeking alternative explanations for their behavior. Criticizing a woman on this platform has almost become synonymous with inviting labels like misogynist, incel, and other derogatory terms.  
  
Conversely, when a man is the subject of criticism in a thread, the discussion tends to revolve around ""red flags"" and other negative indicators. I have also noticed that many men seem to have conformed to this trend.  
  
It appears to be acceptable for men to criticize other men, and women criticizing men doesn’t seem to raise any eyebrows either. However, when a man criticizes a woman, the response is overwhelming: we see 60 replies, various justifications of the woman’s behavior, calls for context, and remarks like “You don’t know what she has been through.”  
  
This double standard is exasperating, especially in larger subreddits where participants are tasked with determining who is the ""asshole"" in a given situation. The hypocrisy is palpable.  
  
Furthermore, I have observed a troubling trend where feminism—which I believe is fundamentally a very positive movement—is increasingly being co-opted to spread misandry. Regrettably, many men are buying into this narrative, further complicating the issue."

That is the fact that LeBron has *always* needed to sign or join established offensive all star caliber players in order to win his rings. Jordan did not.


For MJ’s first 3 rings, Michael wasn’t MJ. Scottie Pippen wasn’t Pippen. They were draft picks that *developed* into elite all star talent. They grew with the core and won rings.

There were some roster changes for the last 3, most notably, Rodman. He is not an offensive threat at all but undoubtedly one of the best defenders and probably the best rebounder ever. However, it’s not like he took heat off of MJ or Scottie. He wasn’t previously an all star the year before he signed but undoubtedly key to winning. The highest caliber roll player. 


LeBron on the other hand… if he is so great, why did he always need another 20+ point guy to join the team? Why didn’t he develop the players around him like Jordan did?


LeBron got his first two rings by teaming up with two established 20+ ppg guys, he got another ring by joining up with 2 more established 20+ppg guys (people often forget Kevin Love was a high double double beast) and finally he joined up with another 20+ppg game guy to win another.

The goat has to go around getting help from other all stars why?



And before you say it is the new way of doing things, the talent is more difficult or what ever else…. No.


Denver won with establishing their 2 best players, Bucks with their 2 best players, Toronto did an all star swap, Warriors (before and after KD), Spurs in the 2000’s & 10’s & Mavericks (I would argue Kidd was way past his all star days. Lakers signed Pau. He is no slouch by any means but his peak isn’t nearly as impressive as AD, Wade or Love. Recently most teams end up winning without having to sign some big name to join their roster. 

Sure, his longevity is second to none, there are impressive records he has broken but playing with a stacked deck takes a bit away for me."

Well I have realized nothing good can be said about either side because both sides want to genocide each other. 

Before the Nakba there was the Hebron massacre. This all started because of unwarranted xenophobia. One side has always attested to wanting to eradicate Jewish people including Jewish arabs. The other side selfishly wants land to themselves and has a radical leader that it’s civilians hate. Netanyahu had been killing off palestinians and even his reaction now is unfounded. 

Now let’s go into hypotheticals: If Palestinians won the war they would massacre and exile all of the Jewish people left in Israel. Their leader being Hamas would turn Palestine into a Palestinian Islamic state similar to Iran. History textbooks won’t be kind to that idea. Look at Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Iran etc where did all of the Jewish people go? They either left to Israel or were killed. Textbooks will read about this similar to how they read about Iran today and it won’t look good. Already, Jewish people are such a small minority. If all of the Jewish people died in Israel it would almost end an ethno religious group of people. 

If Israel wins that means Palestinians will be expelled from Gaza, killed, or exiled. In textbooks this will paint israeli bloodshed as ruthless. A genocide amongst an entire minority of people who are suffering a diaspora.   Already Palestinians are such a small minority if all of the Palestinians died in Gaza it would nearly kill an entire minority of people. 

I am sorry to all of the people protesting for Israel or for Palestine but truly there is no right side of history.  Please change my view"

So based on what I’ve found so far there isn’t really anything that would prevent people from making a religion or NGO, pitching in through crowdfunding or tithings and then using that money to solve common problems/ lobby in government to make more systematic change. There could be separate chapters each with their own volunteers and location based needs that would help construct housing and common spaces to bring back community and non-commercial interaction in the US. It would be a great way to help people looking to do more with their lives to give back to others and to improve our country in ways that others have consistently failed to. 

I think that with enough support and consistency it would even be possible (this is going to sound weird) to lobby lobbying out of our government entirely. It’s been too lopsided ever since we legalized corruption and the dollars in your pocket became your voting power. Unions and strikes are back to making a stand against corporations, people are finally realizing that no corporation actually has their wellbeing in mind, and artificial scarcity is severing the possibility of a work-life balance or a life outside of living to work. 

There’s never been more entrepreneurship and productivity in this country’s history with generations of mistreated, hard-workers and yet we have failed to make change when fighting back against the oppression imposed by those hoarding their ill gotten gains. If we were only able to get money out of politics I think that it could have a cascading effect on the growth and revitalization of this country where the best interest of the people and their livelihood could finally be the focus of our elected leaders rather than reelection and personal gain.

1,2023-10-22,Cmv: there should be massive penalties for owning land that you don't need,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17e6rep/cmv_there_should_be_massive_penalties_for_owning/,changemyview,"
The issue of excessive land hoarding has become a growing concern, especially in the face of housing crises in many parts of the world. While property ownership is a fundamental right, there is a point at which it becomes unreasonable and detrimental to society as a whole. I'll argue that there should be significant tax penalties on individuals or entities who hoard land they don't need, with the extent of the penalty based on a formula related to the number of people living in a home.



Land hoarding, in this context, refers to the accumulation of vast amounts of land or properties without any productive or essential use. This practice is often associated with wealthy individuals or corporations who own multiple properties, sometimes with extensive land, while a significant portion of the population struggles to find affordable housing. This not only exacerbates housing crises but also contributes to wealth inequality.


To address land hoarding, it's important to establish a formula that determines a reasonable limit on the amount of land a person or entity can own based on the number of occupants in their properties. Let's propose a simple formula:

Land Ownership Limit (in square feet) = A * B

Where:
- A is the number of occupants in the home.

- B is a multiplier that scales based on the number of occupants. For example:

  - 1 occupant: B = 5000 square feet

  - 2 occupants: B = 8000 square feet

  - 3 occupants: B = 10000 square feet

  - 4 occupants: B = 12000 square feet

  - 5 or more occupants: B = 15000 square feet

The multiplier (B) increases with the number of occupants to accommodate larger families while discouraging excessive land ownership for individuals or small families.


Now, let's delve into the tax penalties for exceeding the established land ownership limit. To discourage land hoarding, we propose a progressive tax system with the following structure:

1. Up to 50% over the land ownership limit: 10% tax on excess land.
2. 51-100% over the land ownership limit: 20% tax on excess land.
3. 101-150% over the land ownership limit: 30% tax on excess land.
4. Over 150% over the land ownership limit: 50% tax on excess land.

The punitive nature of these tax penalties is designed to deter excessive land ownership while allowing people to own properties suitable for their needs.


By discouraging land hoarding, we can make more land available for housing, which can help alleviate housing crises and create opportunities for affordable housing.

Taxing excessive land ownership can contribute to a fairer distribution of wealth. The revenue generated from these taxes can be reinvested in housing and infrastructure projects.

This approach encourages landowners to use their properties more efficiently, which can lead to increased urban development and better land utilization.

Smaller land ownership limits can reduce urban sprawl and its associated environmental impacts.

It promotes social equality by preventing the accumulation of land resources by a privileged few while many struggle to secure housing.



In addressing the issue of land hoarding, it's essential to strike a balance between property rights and the common good. Implementing significant tax penalties, based on a formula related to the number of occupants in a home, is a practical approach. Such a system can help alleviate housing crises, redistribute wealth, optimize land use, and foster a more equitable society. While specific numbers and multipliers may vary by region, the core principle of discouraging excessive land hoarding remains a crucial step in building a more inclusive and sustainable future."

1,2023-10-22,cmv: Atheists shouldn't be talking about Jesus as if he really existed,u/MoistSoros,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17e8016/cmv_atheists_shouldnt_be_talking_about_jesus_as/,changemyview,"Whenever people bring up Jesus, I often see atheists talk about particular aspects of 'his life' or his identity. For example, atheists might say that Jesus was not white as some kind of 'gotcha' to white Christians, or express sentiments like ""well, obviously Jesus was a very wise and moral man, like Gandhi, but that doesn't mean he was the son of god"". 

My problem with this is that atheists still seem to accept the idea that Jesus was somehow an important figure, even though they reject his existence as a proof for Christianity. I think that it is mainly because Jesus and the bible are such big cultural forces that atheists subconsciously still tend to accept things written in the bible that aren't overtly 'unnatural' or ahistorical, like miracles or the ark of Noah story. They forget that almost any historical claim in the bible can't be trusted, unless there are outside sources that confirm it.

The fact that the story of Jesus Christ takes place in a more historically grounded context and there was a person named Jesus described by Romans who was crucified does not mean any story told about Jesus in the bible has any more credence. I'm sure these stories were based on some truth in their very origin, but because of the immense game of telephone that is oral history — not to mention the religious bias — these stories have probably been coloured, exaggerated, amalgamated or otherwise distorted.

To me, meeting Christians on this level when they speak about Jesus is almost akin to agreeing that Odysseus was probably a wise man when confronted with someone who believes the Odyssey as fact.

As for how my opinion could be changed:

1. 
If you can show me valid historical sources that corroborate biblical stories about Jesus. Preferably not sources that simply state something similar to a biblical story happening, but actually tying the person in that event to the Jesus spoken about in other sources. Otherwise Christians could have simply taken that historical event and pasted Jesus onto it.

2.
You can convince me that even entertaining this idea of Jesus actually being a relevant historical figure doesn't embolden Christians. I see this as a sort of shifting of the overton window, in a 'historical truth' kind of way. In my view, the religious figure of Jesus is so far removed from any historical figure that may have actually existed, that he may as well be seen as a completely fictitious entity. Treating him as anything else doesn't only seem factually wrong but counterproductive in convincing Christians their belief is silly. We should treat Jesus the same as we do Adam and Eve.

3.
You can convince me a majority of atheists already do this. I have no clue how prevalent this view is in atheist circles, but it's something I've heard quite a few people say."
1,2023-10-22,CMV: A power dynamic always exists between white American males partnered with Asian females,u/tvlover111,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17e86q2/cmv_a_power_dynamic_always_exists_between_white/,changemyview,"I myself am a shorter E Asian Am (100% Asian ancestry) woman raised in a major US city on the west coast and have never lived anywhere outside of the US. As additional context, I grew up well-adjusted in terms of exposure to these 2 groups: there are people in my family whom I care about a lot and grew up around who are white Am and Asian Am/Asian immigrant pairings, and also I've had/do have a variety of friends and couples consisting of the white Am male and Asian Am/Asian immigrant female pairing. I myself have been in both short/long term relationships with white Am males, which have led to both good and bad experiences. I'm now living on the east coast and partnered up with someone who is neither white nor E/SE Asian. 

I feel that based upon what I've experienced in my past relationships along with what I have seen in white Am male/Asian Am/immigrant female relationships, the white Am male often enters the relationship with a greater level of wealth, extreme familiarity navigating most aspects of mainstream culture (ex: networking in any industry, discussing organized sports), the ability to argue for and claim what they want when it comes to services (ex: requesting accommodations in restaurants). In essence, more privilege. Privilege itself is a whole other topic, but my focus here is that from the pairings I've seen between these 2 demographics of people, there is an unfair disadvantage in these relationships. Incorporating intersectionality, there is already disadvantage in our society for self-identifying females vs males, and when you plug in the additional elements of immigration or being born into an immigrant family on the side of the couple who is already disadvantaged in society simply by being born female, there is an imbalance of power. I am not saying that there is no imbalance of power that exists between hetero couples that consist of white males and white females, but in this situation I am considering the disadvantages that Asian Am/immigrant women have in comparison to white Am women when they are coupled up with white Am males, not only due to elements of race but also due to coming from a family who immigrated (parents/grandparents) or being an immigrant themselves.

I have been having this problem lately where I involuntarily cringe whenever I see a white Am male pairing and Asian Am/immigrant female pairing in public. I occasionally will receive a negative facial reaction from the Asian Am/immigrant female. This I don't take personally, as having been in pairings like this before, I can empathize with the Asian female part of the equation. In the same public instance, typically I will either be acknowledged (sometimes positively) by the white Am male or ignored completely. My CMV question here would be whether or not anyone else who is Asian living in the US has experienced feeling this way, or if you are not of Asian descent do you disagree with this and why? Is this reaction an overreaction? 

Open to hearing anyone's opinion here (regardless of ethnic makeup), so not specifically seeking responses from any particular group of people. 

\*Asian diaspora is large, so type of Asians I'm referencing in this post are specifically E Asian/SE Asian females. Asian females referenced here include: immigrants and 1G/2G (children & grandchildren of immigrants, respectively). The type of white males I'm referencing here are specifically of European descent, typically at least 4 generations removed.

Israel is currently commuting terrible, unspeakable crimes. But, as an American I will immediately acknowledge that the USA has committed terrible, unspeakable crimes. 

I am Californian. The ways in which the USA came to own california were not peaceful and not okay. But I would never ask my parents to abandon their home because the way they came to have it was inappropriate. 

The British have committed unspeakable war crimes throughout their existence. Taking over land and forcing its civilians to be slaves and cutting off their hands for rubber? Unacceptable in every way. 

Russia invading Crimea? In no way is that appropriate. 
China’s treatment of the Ugyurs? In no way acceptable. Same with the treatment of Armenians, or the people in Kashmir, or the Darfur genocide.  

But here’s what I find odd; people who don’t seem to care about genocide in general are so outspoken, so involved, in Israel-Palestine. 

The Americans involved are not willing to give up their occupied land to Indigenous Americans. Canadians will barely acknowledge their crimes and mistreatment of Indigenous people, much less walk out of their homes right now to return the land to its proper owners. 

But those same people expect Israelis to abandon their homes for the same proper owners. Does not matter where they go or how they get there. They are not the rightful owners but they should disintegrate because that’s what is morally correct. 

If this applies to Israel, my question is: what other countries must cease to exist? Which countries are exempt? How do you determine who can continue their lives and who must abandon their existence for your moral will?"

The way I see it, religion is a solution to various social problems and serves as a moral tapestry. The supernatural elements were tacked on to compel people to follow their religions and give legitimacy to their teachings (there is some gray area with this, as I genuinely believe Jesus and Muhammad thought they were chosen by God and were not sneaky con-men, but were rather influenced by previous precedents.). Christianity was a solution to the moral decay of the Roman Empire. Hinduism was a solution to the lack of social cohesion. Buddhism was a solution to the injustices of the caste system. Islam was a solution to the rigid tribalism of the Arabian peninsula. Judaism was a solution to the preservation of an ethnic group's cultural identity. Since religion is a solution to various social problems, religious principles must evolve with a society's changing social circumstances, which may be altered by exposure to new technologies, shifting population dynamics, or an altered political climate, in order to remain efficient and retain it's practicality. A religion that evolves with society is inherently better to ones that don't. This is why I consider Christianity (especially Protestantism), a good religion, despite not being a Christian myself, due to the vast amount of reforms the religion has gone through over the years. Other religions, especially Eastern religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, or Zoroastrianism, don't necessary require wide scale reform because these are not organized religions and their teachings are inherently up to personal interpretation.

This is where I will get really controversial. Islam. Islam has a lot of beneficial wisdom in its core principles and Muslims are among the kindest people on Earth, but their religion is outdated and until it goes through a wide scale reform, it simply is a bad religion. For example, Islam specifically allows people to own slaves. It does not bother me that the Quran's texts originally allowed people to own slaves; it bothers me that it still does. We can look at a less extreme example as allowing someone to own slaves and go even more basic: the prohibition of the consumption of pigs. Pork was considered haram because pigs were dirty animals that contained worms that made people sick back in the day. With this context, the prohibition of consuming pigs is logical. Now that we have technologies that can produce healthy pork meat suitable for consumption, such a law is now useless and can be discarded. When we shave off these useless and even immoral teachings from Islam, we will actually get a very practical religion that maintains the same wisdom it initially wished to convey. Such reforms will make Islam possibly the best religion. I think Judaism, especially Orthodox Judaism, is also in need of some reform, but I'm less educated on that topic to speak up about it.

There are other points I can bring up but I'm tired that's all I got for today :)."

Poll after poll taken in recent years shows that the majority of Americans are in favor of bringing our standard of living up to that of our International peers, such as introducing Universal Healthcare, stronger gun laws, robust transit within and between cities, among other things. But let’s face it: We’re not going to get any of those things in our lifetime, or even that of someone being born today. Why? It’s not just due to a lack of funding or political will, but because of corporate influence/greed. The automakers and oil companies don’t want the US to have cities with robust transit systems or a nationwide passenger rail network (That’s actually useful for most people, anyway) because we’d have less of a dependence on cars and oil, meaning less profits for them. The NRA doesn’t want us to have strong gun laws, because selling less guns and ammo equals less profits for them. The healthcare and pharma companies don’t want us to have Universal Healthcare because… well you get the picture. The point is every single aspect of life in the US is meant for some corporation to make a profit off of you. Our economic system is set up with that in mind, too. Now that corporations are recognized as people and have the same rights as people (Thanks to Citizens United), they can directly advocate the election or defeat of politicians as they see fit. To bring our standard of living into the 21st Century would require a complete dismantling and rebuild of our economic system, which obviously won’t be happening in the toxic political climate we’re currently in. 

For those seeking a more civil life, it’s best if you put your effort into migrating to these other countries in Europe and Asia (Even South America at this point) that already have things figured out, where governments and politicians care about the people, not the money."

EMPHASIS ADDED

What I cannot understand here is how there is any kind of ""both sides""-ism here.

Prior to the doxing, Jacksfilms had been running a critical campaign of videos where he was making the quite reasonable point that the vast majority of SSSniperwolf's content consists of content stolen from other people which she then uploads in a non-transformative manner, without crediting the original creators.

This is critique and cultural commentary. It is something that we see all over youtube and is entirely apt and appropriate for the platform.

SSSniperwolf's content by contrast was taking material from many other content creators, and monetising it for herself. By proxy this was stealing money from them.

I don't really see how there is two equivalent sides here, in the way youtube is implying. Even before the doxing, this was not a contest of moral equivalency. One person was using scummy internet money-making schemes, and the other was calling them out on it.

Some people have called Jacksfilms ""obsessive"" but even if we accept that as true, I don't see how it comes close to what Sssniperwolf is doing.

Am I missing something here? What makes these two parties close to equivalent? Anything?

Even if it's just YT saying something like ""we don't want drama on the platform"" they allow and encourage many other cultural critique channels of many kinds in many other places. I don't really understand where Jacksfilms' actions falls into anything approaching unacceptable"
1,2023-10-23,Cmv: using adblockers on YouTube makes you a freeloader,u/Top_Analyst2809,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17efwfb/cmv_using_adblockers_on_youtube_makes_you_a/,changemyview,"Using an ad-blocker on YouTube makes you a freeloader. Yep, I said it. Now, before you hit me with the rage-fueled keyboard strokes, hear me out.

We often view content as something that should be free, especially in the age of the internet. But nothing is free, my friends. Someone is paying the bills, whether it's through ads, subscriptions, or a mix of both. YouTube has democratized knowledge and entertainment; it's a global platform that gives voices to the voiceless, empowers independent creators, and offers a vast repository of educational content. Yet, it also costs a lot to run—servers, bandwidth, engineers, and so on.

So you skip ads, you're bucking the system, sticking it to the man, right? No, you're undercutting the creators you claim to support. It's akin to sneaking into a movie theater and then applauding the film—hollow praise from the shadows.

YouTube Premium is an option for the ad-averse (which I pay for monthly), but you shirk even that. Why? Is it that you just don't want to contribute to a system that gives so much?

The key here is reciprocity. It's a give-and-take relationship. You get free content, but you contribute by sitting through ads or paying for a subscription. Circumventing this balance is a snub to the collective agreement we've all silently made to keep this platform viable.

 Infringement on parental rights - Parents have the right to educate their children in a manner that aligns with their beliefs, values, and cultural practices. By mandating a specific form of education, compulsory education restricts parents' freedom to choose alternative methods of education, such as homeschooling or alternative schooling.  


  
Limitation of individual freedom - Compulsory education infringes upon the individual's right to self-determination and personal liberty. It imposes a particular education system on every child, regardless of their interests, abilities, or career aspirations. This limits their freedom to pursue alternative paths, such as vocational training or apprenticeships, that might be better suited to their individual needs and goals.  


  
Cultural and ideological bias - Education systems often promote specific cultural and ideological narratives, which may clash with the beliefs and values of minority or marginalized groups. Compulsory education imposes these biased narratives on individuals, potentially disregarding their cultural heritage, values, or perspectives, thus violating their right to cultural and intellectual freedom.  


  
Undermines the principle of equality - Compulsory education assumes that everyone benefits from the same standardized form of education. However, individuals have different learning styles, strengths, and interests. Forcing all children into the same educational framework can perpetuate inequality by neglecting the diverse needs and abilities of individuals, leaving some behind and impeding their individual growth and development.  


  
Socioeconomic discrimination - Compulsory education can exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities by making education mandatory without addressing the underlying economic barriers that prevent equal access to quality education. Low-income families may struggle to afford the resources necessary to comply with compulsory education laws, resulting in unequal educational opportunities and perpetuating social disparities.

So you have a smaller army that is well equipped going against a larger army that is poorly managed and equipped and additional troops from NATO may be necessary to break that power balance.

I think that Ukraine should either accept the fact that if they aren’t getting direct NATO involvement, it will be very difficult or impossible to retake both Donetsk and Crimea. Retaking Donetsk should be doable but even that will be a difficult task for Ukraine to accomplish.

Besides, America gets war weary easily and quickly because we’ve gotten burned by Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and we are the largest financial and military supporter of Ukraine right now.

Or, things like people saying “my dads a 3/10 and he got a 10/10 because he has a great personality” and then they proceed to show the wife that’s a 10/10 why? Not because of anything they have to offer but 100% only because of their appearance.

You’re telling me no matter how horrible a woman is if she’s beautiful she’s still change your entire life and solve all your problems just because she’s attractive? Yikes. No wonder 99% of women have beauty issues. Men in movies or the media can be average and have other things going for them and woman go crazy for them. But no man will go absolutely crazy for a girl unless she literally looks like a supermodel or has a nice ass or pair of tits. And if you do go crazy for an average looking or unattractive girl who has other things to offer, other men will ridicule you for doing so and not having someone hotter. Don’t even get me started on how your worth is also largely based off your AGE, whereas women want MEN and would happily date someone twice as old because they want someone who actually has more to offer than their looks.

Because men don’t care about anything else women have to offer. Oh and then there’s this, whenever I see posts about dating AI or sexbots so many men say “oh no the world is doomed”. Why? Because men only value appearance that is literally it, they will happily rather fuck a piece of plastic because they  make their wiener hard, and date an AI bot because they don’t have to make any effort. And ok I already know so many men will say “not all men” and you’re right, not all men are like this. But literally 99% are."

1,2023-10-23,cmv: if you aren't required to have an expensive college degree for your occupational license you should avoid going to an expensive college.,u/IronSmithFE,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17eqwi2/cmv_if_you_arent_required_to_have_an_expensive/,changemyview,"for example of why some people must go to expensive universities, you cannot get a license to practice medicine without a medical degree from a college. you cannot legally practice some medicine without such a degree. practicing law is another case where you must have a degree to practice with rare exceptions. civil engineers also need an expensive university education by law.

there are some benefits to going to college for other occupations that universities will accentuate in their sales pitches but the reality is that you can get most of those benefits to a much greater degree with other methods of training and education outside of expensive colleges and universities.

i specify ""expensive"" colleges because cheaper technical colleges often have very efficient training programs that you can complete in a year (vs 2 to 6). the reason they can be so efficient is because they don't have all the expensive bureaucracy and they don't get involved in time-consuming publishing and expensive research. the instructors in technical colleges always have practical experience and are often accomplished in their fields and actually want to be training people in those fields which is the exact opposite of what happens in expensive universities where professors must teach in order to keep their university research jobs.

beyond all of that, colleges have become institutions of government propaganda and toxic woke indoctrination that does the opposite of preparing students for success and independent thought.

1,2023-10-23,CMV: The U.S. highway and interstate infrastructure is dangerous and inefficient. It would've been better if the majority of investment went to developing and modernizing railways.,u/Itchy_Egg9279,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ery0m/cmv_the_us_highway_and_interstate_infrastructure/,changemyview,"My view on this matter is that the U.S. has dug itself into a terrible situation that regularly requires it to invest in a fundamentally inefficient and inherently more dangerous system of mass transit. Here are some gathered statistics that support my view.  


https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-05/Budget-Highlights2022\_052721\_FINAL.PDF Here is a review of the recent U.S. budget allocations for infrastructure. Over the next five years, the planned budget allocates 35,000 million dollars more investing into just the maintenance of roads compared to the investment into improving and modernizing the rail network.

  
""The Nation’s rail networks have the potential to offer safe, reliable, efficient, and climate-friendly alternatives for moving people and freight. However, unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a multi-year funding stream to address deferred maintenance, enhance existing corridors, and build new lines in high-potential locations. There are currently projects just waiting to be funded that will give millions more Americans reliable and fast inter-city train service. "" - U.S. DOT

  
""In absolute terms, the picture is clear. Worldwide, road users account for about 71% of transport CO2 emissions, with railway companies making up less than 1.8%, next to 12.3% for aviation and 14.3% for shipping"" - https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/greener-travel-car-or-rail, who cited International Energy Agency and International Union of Railways. Every single person traveling in a vehicle that can hold 4-5 more people spatially is just extremely wasteful for our resources. Investing in railway transportation would have made travel a lot less environmental pollutant.

  
In terms of efficiency of travel times, driving a car is currently faster than riding a train. However, I'd argue that is undoubtedly attributed to how much the U.S. has already invested in making highways the shortest distance possible from one point to the other, pushing aside railways, and making trains less efficient in time-to-distance ratios. 

There is also the question of space efficiency. There are anywhere between 800 million to 2 billion parking spaces in America, with 5% of urban areas being specifically designated for parking.(https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/27/parking-dominates-our-cities-but-do-we-really-see-it) With the average parking space being between 300 to 350 square feet, this a gigantic waste of land and space just to cater to all of the vehicles on the road.  


If U.S. infrastructure developed railways in a more meaningful way, there would be much less of a need for the wastefully distributed parking spaces across every building. Buildings, in general, would be much closer together to help with walking from one place to another, meaning that overall the country would save a lot more space for nature or even more development.

Now onto the issue of how dangerous the U.S. highway and road system is. There were over 5 million police-reported car accidents in the U.S. in 2020, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a 22% decrease from 2019. A total of 38,824 traffic-related deaths resulted from 35,766 fatal accidents in 2020, which is the highest fatality count since 2007. According to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were an average of 1,760 train derailments per year in the U.S. from 1990 to 2021. On average there are four deaths by train derailment each year. These statistics really speak for themselves I mean 38,824 vs 4.

There is a possibly higher chance of infections spreading due to public transport. For this, my rebuttal would be that sufficient sanitation actions could be enacted to reduce risks, and the deaths of infections would pale in comparison to the fatal crashes that occur on the road.   


The main argument is that people genuinely enjoy the freedom and comfort of owning their own vehicles. The only reason vehicles equal freedom is that there are very few places that anyone can get to without owning a car because the entire country is way too spaced out. Also, this is a post specifically about the highway and interstate road system, I'd imagine that local transit roads would still be necessary.

Better yet, what happens if he continuously just does option one and never does option two?  
That's right! Nobody would be his customer.  
The same applies to raising taxes; the rich already utilize every tax loop possible because they are sick and tired of the government sticking with option one.

1,2023-10-23,CMV: Ceasefire between Israel-Gaza is the best outcome for Hamas,u/doyouknowshmolik,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17esp11/cmv_ceasefire_between_israelgaza_is_the_best/,changemyview,"On October 7th, Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, launching rockets and brutally invading civilian homes. These attacks included horrifying acts such as rape, torture, and the slaughtering of innocent civilians in front of their families. Shockingly, over 200 people, including babies, the elderly, and mothers, were taken hostage in this tragic event.

This incident has ignited passionate global debates about how Israel should respond to such brutality.

In my perspective, anyone advocating for a ceasefire inadvertently furthers Hamas’ objectives, precisely what Hamas aimed to achieve. This is evident in their hostage-taking and live streaming of IDF attacks on Gaza. If Israel were to pursue a ceasefire, it might risk its standing in the Middle Eastern conflict, especially while Iran closely observes the situation. Furthermore, Hamas will surely resume attacks, potentially with even more devastating consequences."

* Similar to the first point, it suggests that there's no objectivity, rather everything is subjective

I'd classify things like ""murdering and torturing people for the sole purpose of entertaining one self is evil, and morally bad"", but ethics and philosophy will result in ""It's actually subjective! So it's not totally bad!"".

Therefore, I consider philosophy and ethics as a harm towards humanity. Too many evil things are classified as ""debatable"" because of it. It should not have a space in any serious discussion.

Yes, it's fun to think about moot points in philosophy, and theory-craft, or play pretend what the world could be... But it shouldn't be more than games."

1,2023-10-23,CMV: Pit bulls are dangerous and breeding them should be banned,u/Icy-Bumblebee8554,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17evvaf/cmv_pit_bulls_are_dangerous_and_breeding_them/,changemyview,"If someone can genuinely give me a good reason why pit bulls are not dangerous or why they should continue being bred I’m open to changing my view. Bonus points if you can convince me that people with children or even other animals in their home should have a pit bull present at all.

I think pit bulls are dangerous and they should be illegal 100%. Furthermore, I think if someone has other animals in the home or a child that’s not at least 15 and can even try to defend themselves, there should be rules prohibiting the adoption or breeding of pit bulls. There are simply too many attacks of people in general, and then the issue of children and babies who are to small to even try to fight the dog off. Plus, putting another animals in the home at risk if the pit bull gets aggressive. 

Pit bulls we’re bred purely for the purpose of violence a long time ago. Like the 1800s long time ago. They were literally bred to attack violent wild animals like bulls and bears. This eventually turned into people fighting their dogs against each other’s. 
Sure, they may have been domesticated more over time, but that doesn’t change that they were bred to be violent. They were made for that pure purpose. 

A study done in 2021 quotes “In 2021, of the 51 Americans killed by dogs, 37 were killed by one or more pit bulls and their mixes” it goes on to say “21 of those victims were either the owner of the pit bull or member of the owner's family.” 
That’s just injuries bad enough to cause death. It doesn’t even account for the severe but non fatal injuries.
No matter how well trained, a pit bulls instincts are to be violent. They can snap at any moment. To me, they can love you like any other human-dog relationship. But it might only take one incident for them to go back to their roots and severely injure or kill someone. 

That to me just goes to show why pit bulls just should cease to exist. Especially if you adopt a pit bull straight out of a dog fighting ring. 
One friend of mine went to a rescue center to adopt a dog. Keep in mind this is a 20 year old, short, 100lbs girl. They let her leave with a pit bull that still had open wounds from being in a fight ring. nobody in that situation was in their right mind. She shouldn’t of adopted it but the fucking rescue center should have never let her leave with a pit bull in that state. She had to bring it back to a shelter because it was too aggressive, obviously. I barley escaped an attack from that dog myself. 
I knew another girl who grew up with a pit bull her whole life. The pit bull was well trained. When she was a young child, like 10, the dog snapped and bit her face. She had to get reconstructive surgery to fix the damage. That’s a minor case out of the many, many injuries and deaths caused by these dogs. 

I just don’t think it’s justified to keep these dogs around because of all the reasons i’ve seen people say. that they’re not always violent or even not the most violent or just train them, for examples. 

I’ll leave you with this analogy. So many people vote for stricter gun control. Why? Gun violence is a huge death cause. Even if a person is licensed and/or not carrying to kill, the guns themselves are still killing people. Why are pit bulls different? Sure, not every pit bull kills, but it’s the dog that kills and injures the most. It’s still killing/injuring people. Why do we justify pit bulls when their actively causing severe injury and death."

**- Israel does airstrikes to attack Hamas ->** Whether it is to disarm or destroy Hamas, no matter how careful you are many civilians will die directly from either bombing or Hamas not letting them leave.

**- Israel enters Gaza 'directly' ->** An insane amount of Israeli soldiers will die and it could result in massive security concerns too.

Summer is the worst season.

Why? Let's start off with the obvious: heat. As the climate warms, summers are getting increasingly hot. Hot temperatures make it unpleasant to be outside, especially if you have to do any strenuous physical activity like working or working out. If your only option is to work or workout outside, you're at an increased risk of heat related afflictions like heatstroke, heat stress, and heat exhaustion. As temperatures increase, wet bulb events become more likely - potentially impacting the lives of millions around the world. Speaking of health risks, you'll also have to worry about sunburns more over the summer than the rest of the year. High temperatures don't just impact people, though. Pets risk burning their paws on hot pavement, wild animals are exhausted, and even machines struggle to keep cool enough to remain operational. Extremely high temperatures in the summer can't easily be avoided in the same way that extremely low temperatures in the winter can - if you don't have the right equipment (notably A/C or alternative climate control system), staying cool can be a real challenge. 

High temperatures also increase the risk of natural disasters like wildfires. Wildfires not only put people, pets, and property into risky scenarios, but also pollute the air for millions further from the site of the fire. It's becoming increasingly common to experience prolonged periods of poor air quality over the summer. Bad air quality doesn't just hurt your lungs, it also makes it thoroughly unpleasant to be outside. Going on a hike? Your chest is going to hurt, eyes are going to water, and you won't be able to see clearly beyond a few hundred meters.

While extreme heat is the main problem with summer, I also have several minor grievances:

1. Summer is tourist season. While tourists can play an important part in the local economy, they're also a major pain in the ass to deal with. Everything gets busier, things tend to be more expensive, and infrastructure like roads get congested. Tourism in the slower seasons has a much less pronounced impact on my life. 

2. Insects. Summer is prime time for bugs like bedbugs (thanks in part to tourism), ticks, and mosquitos. These bugs can cause major health problems like yellow fever, Lyme disease, etc. 

3. Kids are out of school. This is a headache for working parents who either have to take time off or organize childcare. Others may find it annoying to deal with significantly more children in public spaces.

What will change my view: 

Demonstrate that another season is worse than summer."

I understand that this is not a representation of all transgender nor left wing people, but I believe that minors should not be able to access these types of treatments without the approval of their doctors and parents. Minors cannot consent to really anything without some form of state intervention or guardian consent. There shouldn't be such an attitude that these types of things aren't a big deal and that puberty blockers are so solutions for minors when many of them aren't really mature enough to make these decisions yet, the human brain isn't fully formed u til atleast 25.

Israel commits warcrimes by starving 2 million people and bombing their homes to rubble? UN passed a resolution to pause the fighting and let humanitarian aid in, only for the US to veto it and say ""no"".

The US invaded Iraq under a false pretense, killed many civilians along the way, and left the country in ruin, yet the UN did nothing to punish them, not even slightly. Neither are they doing anything substantial to help Ukraine or hurt Russia. It was the EU and NATO that is sending military aid and throwing heavy sanctions on Russia, not the UN. The UN also did nothing to stop the many civil wars in the middle east from spiraling out of control, or to stop the US from overthrowing almost every government in latin america at least once, or the many proxy wars during the cold war. In every case, existing alliances are the ones doing the most while the UN throws words around and wag their fingers at the countries that break international law.

Civilians have been warned to leave north Gaza, but obviously not all of them can. Also Hamas are not solely hidding in north Gaza.

Regarding hostages, it is obviously exasperating for their families, but in the long run, Hamas should be eliminated, and hostages shouldn't be used to give an advantage to Hamas.

I understand the difficult choice in hands for Israel, but I think that not providing Hamas the advantage they thought they would have, is the best in the long run.

In the past, Israel has giving too much for a single hostage, and that clearly motivated what has happened in October 7th.

If they reward the kidnapping action of Hamas, they are simply indicating future terrorists, the only way they can have an actual advantage in a conflict is by kidnapping Israelis.

Why should Israel restrain their actions, doing what Hamas hoped they would do? Seems like the correct, but though decision, is not to play by Hamas playback."

Egypt has the supplies on its side of the border, so why don't the Gaza civilians cross the Gaza Egypt border to get access to humanitarian relief.  
  
Hamas itself claims that they have hundreds of tunnels underneath Gaza, reports indicate that Hamas has bobby trapped the vicinity, and there are images of cars blocking roads preventing civilians from crossing to the safe zone Israel outlined. To me this sounds like they have turned the Gaza strip into an active warzone.  
  
Therefore I believe its illogical to blame Israel for refusing to allow humanitarian aid into an active warzone, and the blame ought to be laid onto the Egyptian side who refuses to provide safe shelter and aid to the Palestinian civilians in the Sinai Peninsula.

In my experience, many adhere to a strict worldview where one group is the oppressor and one group is the oppressed. 

It's not that I disagree with the idea that some groups as a whole have more power and influence than other groups. I absolutely do, and I don't think this should be the case. I just don't think this information is remotely useful when it comes to policy. Because the problem you run into is while the group *collectively* has more power, most *individuals* lack any sort of meaningful power. 

So when a policy is proposed that disempowers the oppressor group the individuals at the top who are actually doing almost all of the oppressing are not affected, but rather the people at the bottom who are already lacking power to oppress anybody. So basically people who were already powerless to change anything are losing power they cannot afford to lose. That hardly seems like something to celebrate. Change my view."

Hamas itself claims that they have hundreds of tunnels underneath G@Z@, reports indicate that Hamas has bobby trapped the vicinity, and there are images of cars blocking roads preventing civilians from crossing to the safe zone 1SR@EL outlined. To me this sounds like they have turned the G@Z@ strip into an active warzone.  
  
Therefore I believe its illogical to blame 1SR@EL for refusing to allow humanitarian aid into an active warzone, and the blame ought to be laid onto the Egyptian side who refuses to provide safe shelter and aid to the Palestinian civilians in the Sinai Peninsula.  
  
(P.S. Egypt's excuse to not let in civilians due to fear that they may never return is cynical, this statement mocks Palestinians and further places them in danger due an active warzone)

I believe the Conflict should be viewed through this prism -Judaism is the only abrahamic religion to draw borders\*\*, both spiritually (being non-missionary) and territorially (located in the holy land), yet still being accused of Colonialism by the actual perpetrators. Conversly, The other two tried to take over the world. I'm aware the term Colonialism wouldnt always apply but i believe its generally being used to describe ""lands that were taken"", unjust expansion and exercising excessive power.  
  
\[\*\*In practice. I'm sure we can find verses that suggest otherwise.\]  
  
When Jews sought return to Israel most of the predominantely-Muslim Arab world denied their request, effectively paused or minimized Aliyah (Jewish migration) and purchase of land, to later take issue with uneven partition plans. In essence they rejected gradually becoming a minority within a Jewish state - A scenario which Jews have embraced in reverse, Given they lived under Foreign/Islamic rule for centuries in the region. Worth mentioning some of the Arab migration derived from an economic boost\*\*, (partially) influenced by the Aliyah (1930's), which also helped battling Malerya since 1920, causing a dramatic increase in life expectancy.  
  
\*\*Suggests finincial motives could've led elsewhere in the region, eventually or beforehand.   
  
The outright rejection by Arab world (Palestine included) Shaped and perpetuated the conflict. Namely  Violence that ensued prior to Israel inception (1886-1948), Rejection of partition plans, Collaberating with the Nazis, delibrately delaying Palestinian statehood (1948-1967) for the sake of eradicting the Zionist entity, and the hypocracy regarding the Refugee crisis. The Arabs thought of Holocaust survivors as Europe's responsibility (tho it failed to protect them) while refusing to take their own, on top of creating another crisis by further opressing the Jewish minority among them, effectively forcing their exodus (800,000+). Worth noting that exodus wasn't addressed, after redering the Mizrahim homeless, they sought the destruction of their new home (Israel), thus (potentially) kicking em' out a second time with no alternatives offered.  
  
Possible differences between the plight of Jews and Native Americans

* Jews were expelled, they werent relocated. Some tribes/reservations possess a certain level of autonomy within the US til this day (With the largest one being slightly bigger than Israel).  

* NA werent prosecuted historically to the degree of extermination FOLLOWING their disenfranchisement, so the urge to fend for themselves wasnt as vital  

* Logistically its way harder to fullfil those aspirations nowadays than it was roughly a hundered years ago at the peak of nationalism, When population exchanges/Transferes were more common. Americans arent as likely to find a home upon evacuation, compared to palestinians who migrated rather freely within the confindes of the Ottoman/Muslim empire, as some of their surnames suggests. Jews don't have that privlige given that Judaismis is an is anti-Imperialistic religion by nature  

* Is there even a large scale demand among Natives to form a state, other than a namesake campaign to get their land back? In other words, why fixate on hypothetical requests while ignoring others, like the Kurds for example.  
  
*Palestinians are descendants of Canaanites. rendering them the rightfull owners of this land*
* You are what you define yourself as. Mind you, There was an attempt of disenfranchising Palestinians altogether by claiming they're Merely Jews who converted/assimilated. An argument that doenst hold water since that is not the basis of their claim. Jews retained their identity through hardships for centuries, and their claim for the land is based said identity.

*Settlements Proved Israel never had real interest in peace*  


* They've accepted partition plans prior to their inception  

* They've withdrew and forcibly evacuated folks both unilaterally and as a part of peace negotiations/agreements  

* The Palestinian effort of delegitimizing Israel resulted in a plethora of Towns within the country to disacknowledge it, effectivley forming In-House Palenstinian Settlements (Potential Land Swap Candidates).  

* Some also orginated out of security concerns  

* Worth mentioning Their ambiguous legal status (which was adressed by the Trump administration) was uphelp under Biden's - ""the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not per se inconsistent with international law.""  

* The public approval for them (being rather low originally) increased as people became disillusioned with palestinian cause.

I have more to say but the topic is infinite so i should stop here. I should note i'm in favor of (some version of) the two-state solution or other creative ideas, and  very much against the current goverment led by Bibi. They got to go"

I’m 18, and have legit never used a locker room in my lifetime.

In 2016, when it was revealed I would have to change my clothes IN FRONT OF OTHER BOYS in gym class, I got on my knees and begged my parents to get me out of gym class. Fortunately, the school let me opt out, and I took a study hall class instead. In high school, I took both of the required years of gym online.

I had (and still have) severe body image issues. I’m sure that I would be bullied to hell and back, being the unathletic autistic skinny fat kid. (Maybe not, considering I was actually well-liked in elementary, but most of my elementary buddies went to a different middle school.)

Plus, I’ve noticed that I am EXTREMELY uncomfortable with being naked/my dick potentially being seen in front of others. Freshman year, I cursed a senior out for walking on me in the restroom. (No regrets) To this day, I am unable to use a urinal without getting anxious. In public restrooms, I always feel that I’m being watched, even though I always use the stall, particularly if there is a lot of people in the restroom. So yeah, I’m not the most comfortable with my genitals being seen.

TBF, the school said I could change in the nurse’s office, but that’s like, so much more embarrassing.

It’s very known that much bullying occurs in the locker room, due to it (sometimes) being completely unmonitored.

Plus, forcing children to take off their clothes is a GREAT way for pedophiles to infiltrate the class and act like perverts.

Plus, some kids have sexual trauma from being molested, and don’t want anyone to see them naked. The wack PE system doesn’t care and forces those kids to change in front of other people.

Additionally, with how rampant homophobia is, especially in men, forcing gay and straight kids to change in front of each other makes it way too easy for gay kids to be ostracized. Finding out I was gay at 15, makes me all the more glad I never used the locker room.

Suffice to say, I do not believe that children should have to take their clothes off in front of others. That’s a recipe for disaster.

What do ya’ll think about this issue. Let me know below."

I have a solution: Send the people who declare these wars and claim to represent us to fight in these wars instead. 

Bush, Biden, AOC, Pelosi, Trump, Obama, McConnell, Sanders, Kennedy Jr, none of these people contribute anything to society and most of them have already lived long enough. Give Biden an M240 and airdrop him into Ukraine. Give Trump an M4 SOPMOD and have him clear rooms with Mitch McConnell and Bernie Sanders.

Some of you may worry that a lot of our politicians are quite old and may not be physically fit for combat, but the younger politicians like AOC or Obama can be giving them air support from an AC-130 or AH-64 Apache. Plus most of these old buzzards are very talented war criminals anyways so I’m confident in their ability to hold their own in a fight.

I don’t foresee any flaws with this system, but I’m curious to see what everyone thinks."

That doesn't make any sense to me. There doesn't seem to be any explained reason why her dog would be as emotionally important to her, as much as John Wick was attached to his original puppy. This is beyond the obvious love we hold for dogs and the dislike we hold for people who mistreat them. However, this is no reason to murder a whole compound of people over."

Onto the point:  
Walk into any shelter in the US and the majority of the dogs you see will be pitbulls and pit mixes. That is because ignorant people adopt them, choosing not to believe that the breed really is dangerous, until they see the truth for themselves. So they return them and these dogs sit all day in kennels, every bone in their body screaming at them to maul and kill. They are surrounded by equally agitated dogs and strange people come and go all the time. They waste away for days, weeks, months, shit, even years if it's a no-kill shelter, and not a damn soul wants them because, again, this is not a normal breed. They cannot be trained to ***not*** indiscriminately kill animals and people. Ultimately, they live miserably in a shelter and die in a shelter, completely unloved and unwanted.  
If you actually give a damn about the breed, you'd be advocating for its extinction. These dogs have no place in society, no place living alongside humans or other animals. They are far too violent and when they can't attack, they live a life of anxiety, misery, fear, and confusion."

   It seems as it’s an unfair cycle, poor family gets to lower class status from immigrating from one country to the other say Honduras to the U.S, they have a stable loving child who does well in college to move up the ladder, fine. That child now middle class eventually has a child of his own or more, his children would not have struggled as much as him and that’s fine but they just earned adult independence when they’re old enough that their father had to work for.

1. I see a lot of Subreddits say that r/SuicideWatch has more resources, but since many people on that subreddit are not licensed professionals, they have no more resources than any other subreddit, which are to provide a listening ear and provide hotline numbers.

2. I see so many posts that are never answered or responded to. When I was struggling with suicidal thoughts and posted on there I received no support. People with these thoughts are pressured to only post about these thoughts on that subreddit, but are never responded to, which leaves them with no one to talk to.

3. Although I have not experienced it firsthand, I see a lot of people and posts of how many on that subreddit are toxic and even promote suicidal acts. This leaves vulnerable people who were suggested to the subreddit in a difficult spot, as they posted to receive support and comfort, but instead are having people promote the thoughts they are trying to dissuade.

And while I understand that not all Subreddits are designed to help these vulnerable people, merely pushing them to a sub that will not help them is, in my opinion, the best course of action.

It would be hard to find an AI expert that would deny that AI isnt going to obliterate the workforce. 2029 is a common prediction for AGI so I assume it won’t be long after before a large percentage of human workers will just be inefficient. (Physical labor jobs will probably come later but with AGI making things more efficient it won’t be long before it finds a way). So just like that in our lifetimes a core motivator for all of human history is just nonexistent. What do we do with all this free time? A simple answer would be consume media as content addiction is only steadily climbing, and with AI making the content we’ll have unlimited things to watch, but how long before that gets old? Another answer would be drugs, also a source of cheap dopamine to keep our brains busy. This may help numb the boredom by just tricking our brains to be satisfied. I see these as very real existences for the majority of people in the future, simply because of the sheer amount of people engaging in both of these things in the present when we don’t have robots do to work for us. One could possibly argue humans could spend their time chasing fitness goals, but in my opinion that may be optimistic. In fact I feel the opposite will happen, the obesity epidemic is not slowing down, and if we assume my initial assumptions about future humans are correct they will be far more lazy. Common motivators for staying in shape are: 1.Personal health improvement, 2.Fitting in socially, and 3.Attracting mates. But in the future, 1. With drugs and elite medicine, health wouldn’t be so much as an issue. 2.With things like the meta verse and social isolation already trending upwards I assume people won’t be worrying about this too much. And 3. Ai sex and romance bots in my opinion will be far more popular than we may think, meaning we’ll have partners that unconditionally love us.

You can't change or choose your gender its determined by your brain structure. I can't wake up one day and say that im a man or a woman it does not work like that. You gender is way deeper than just saying that you  identify as a man or woman its how you feel deep down and how your brain is structured. Gender does not determine whether or not somebody's a man or woman.

You cant determine if you love someone just because you said I love you or you say your in love . Its how you feel about the person deep down that determines if you love somebody.

Sex on the other is what actually determines whether or not somebody is a man or woman and you can't change your sex because you can't change your chromosomes. You can't change your chromosomes and that means a Trans man is not a man and a Trans woman is not a woman.

All of their neighbors who took them in regretted it. I'm in the US so I can't really speak to European opinions, but after this month and learning how they organized attempts to overthrow the government in the countries they were invited to, I feel even less sympathy than I had before.

- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided."

1,2023-10-24,CMV: There is no good argument against legal age gap relationships.,u/EnterprisingAss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17f71ji/cmv_there_is_no_good_argument_against_legal_age/,changemyview," I’m presenting two views, either of which can be changed.  

CMV 1: people often want the conclusion “(at least) the older person in a 40/18 age gap relationship has done something morally wrong” without having to give an argument for it.  

CMV 2: All attempts to give such an argument will entail that “consenting adults in private” is *not* the fundamental sexual rule.  In other words, consenting adults in private can still be doing something wrong, and what *makes* the action wrong *cannot be derived from the idea of consenting adults in private*. 

Note: this argument is about legal relationships that do not involve employment or education.  No 18/15, teacher/student, or employer/employee issues are relevant.  

Second note: the references to homophobia are for illustration only.  I am *not* arguing that being against age gap relationships is bad in the way homophobia is. 

The argument against 40/18 relationships typically goes this way:

1 - Age gaps are creepy/gross
2 - ?!
3 - (At least) The older partner has done something morally wrong.  

Compare this to older views of gay relationships:

1 - gay sex is creepy/gross
2 - ?!
3 - people who do gay sex gave done something morally wrong.  

This is the older gut view that can be fixed up by a religious person:

1 - gay sex is creepy/gross *because* it is unnatural according to God’s plan
2 - you ought to follow God’s plan.  
3 - people who refuse God’s plan by having gay sex have done something morally wrong.  

As you can see, the first view to be changed is that the conclusion “the older partner did something morally wrong” is based on an argument that is missing a premise.  

Someone may respond this way:

1 - Age gaps are creepy/gross
2 - you ought not do creepy/gross things
3 - the older partner is particularly creepy/gross
4 - The older partner has done something morally wrong.

This new argument involves saying you ought not be gross.  This runs afoul of my second view to be changed, that anything filling premise 2 cannot be derived from consenting adults in private.  Consenting adults in private are allowed to be gross."

The food would be seasonal vegetables, fruit and some other staples such as rice, chickpeas, nuts. There would be enough to eat a balanced diet. 

It wouldn't include manufacturered food only basic ingredients and wouldn't include luxury items, premade sauces, none seasonal veg and fruit and would be paid through taxation. 

There would be the following benfits to this. 

- improved health in the UK as people would be encouraged to each more healthy diets as healthy food is free. This would off set some of the cost through reduction in NHS spend. 

- reduced miles on our food as it would again encourage people to eat seasonal vegetables and fruit reducing the important need and reduce carbon footprint. 

- reduction in eating meat, as fruit and veg is free this again reduces out carbon footprint and arguably moral impact. 

- there increase in food banks in the UK show there is a demand for free food. 

- local farmers could be given as set rate for common good set by the govement which could help they farming community and make the UK more robust in its foodchain. 

- an reduction in benfits could be implemented to reflect that food now free offsetting the cost of food. It also takes out the emotive qrgument in benfits/ govement salary negotiations . This would in part offset the cost. 

I think we could really drive a healthy and happier country. People would still be free to purchase additional food as now. 

There would have to be some controls on how much people could take to avoid waste and business using this as it is only for the public. In general it would be as easy as picking it up at the supermarket and scanning it through, the supermarket would get some money for welling the item ( similar to how the post office gets money for setting up a passport) and then the farmer will get the rest."

The same people constantly shooting rockets at Israel. You know, the same people who went through the Holocaust, but unlike in WW2, can actually defend themselves. 

Here some are completely laughable arguments I saw:

* Some people even come out with the Nazi Germany analogy when claiming that Israel has become the same, except for the tiny little difference of Palestine is actively, on record, is trying to kill Jewish people. There's no demagogue running around claiming there's some global Palestine shadow government pulling the strings, making life bad for your average dumbass. The attacks are very real, and verified. The threat is **real**.
* There are also people claiming there's ""normal"" Palestinian people wanting just to live their lives. Some LGBT groups are giving support to monsters of Palestine that would torture and kill them on the spot if they could. Or, you know, treat women as walking incubators and property. What their twisted religion explicitly states in their holy book. It's like claiming ""oh those poor Nazis, just trying to live their lives! It's only the SS units and Wermacht fighting in the war!""  
* Going off from the last point, a lot of Westerners show their support with the deluded belief that the inhabitants of Palestine share their westerns views. ""They want peace and harmony just like we do! They are treated unfair!"". They project their values on entities that might as well be alien in thinking and behaviour. It is common knowledge, that a wild, aggressive animal can still attack you for no reason even if you take love them and take care of them. And humans are the most violent, aggressive and erratic of animals.
* This is gonna be a controversial one for sure. There are (correct) claims that simply putting down Hamas will not enough. That they will simply be replaced over and over and over. Much like places like Afghanistan and other locations proved. The only way to prevent it is to make sure there's no one who can take up arms once again. The most humane way would be reeducation. I hate Chinese for many things, but not for their long term planning and actually dealing with their Muslim issue. The more instant ways would be a bit unsavory, even for me. But point is, if there's peace for both Israel and Palestine, the only way is to force lasting, generational change on Palestine. And unlike similar occurrences throughout history, Palestine has no history or culture of it's own that's worth preserving - just a bunch of squatters on what was Ottoman Empire's territory. You're not losing much extinguishing it for good.
* There's another conflict raging right now, in Ukraine. But in this case, Ukraine was attacked first because they dared to exact their autonomy, of their own existing culture and history. This underdog is one we should be cheering on. Ukrainians never expressed their desired to murder every single Russian (until now, anyway), they just wanted to coexist. And that's the key fucking difference between the two. 

The gentle and naive nature of the Western public is exploited by many, and how can people not see that is just astounding. This is also in regards with other, domestic issues, which are not the topic of this CMV. But, that's how you get right-wing populists, because god forbid a sane political force would grow some balls and make some non-vegan herbivore choice."

However, based on the Biblical story of Jesus, he was an Israeli who spoke Aramaic, and possibly also Hebrew and Greek. He almost definitely wasn't white and he certainly didn't speak English. English did not exist when Jesus was alive. He never had a passport (those didn't exist either), nor do his fingerprints or DNA exist in any database. 

Now imagine you are an ICE agent, and there is a 33 year old Middle Eastern man who has no documents of any kind, no birth certificate, ID, passport, visa, nothing... whose fingerprints are not in any database on Earth, and of whom no prior record, criminal or otherwise, exists in any country. 

Would you believe this man when he says (through a translator, if one is available) that he is the second coming of Jesus?

Even if by some miracle he managed to get through immigration in whatever country he came back to... who among us would believe that this man is really Jesus? I wouldn't, though like I said, I don't really believe in Jesus to begin with.

No way can the refs tell every time. Some kicks would have hit the post if it was taller. Now you have a ref guessing on whether or not a ball would have ricocheted right or left off a hypothetical pole. 

A high-dollar organization like the NFL can figure out the construction logistics. Humans have been to *space*, so we can make a tall, safe goalpost. A laser shining out the top is no good, because we still need to know if the kick would have hit the pole and gone in or out. The only way is more pipe extending further into the sky.

Here's the problem with that: if there is no hope for redemption, the only people who will still try to redeem themselves with good works are the ones who are truly good people in the first place. But if truly good people are being 'canceled', that's a huge problem in and of itself. 

Where is the incentive for bad or neutral people to improve themselves or to do good works?

I am not saying we should forget what people did, or ever trust a dangerous person again. That's not my argument at all. 

But if what someone did was say the 'wrong' political opinion, they should be able to redeem themselves by providing significant help to whatever group was harmed by their 'wrong' opinion. For example, if someone was cancelled because they said Hamas was justified in harming Israeli civilians, maybe all that person needs to do to redeem themselves is spend every Saturday for one year doing pro-bono work for a charity that gives free medical aid to Israeli civilians. 

If what someone did was extremely harmful, like physically harming another person, they should have to work extremely hard to redeem themselves. Maybe they would need to dedicate years or even decades to helping others in order to earn this redemption. 

Of course some crimes are unforgivable, and some people cannot be redeemed.

To change my view, you would have to convince me that the benefit of continuing to exclude 'canceled' people outweighs the potential good of whatever they would have to do in order to redeem themselves and be included again.

I've heard the narrative that Israelis are white people from Europe, while Palestinians are brown natives of Palestine. I do not understand how this could be the case.

  
Ancestry: Most Israelis are Mizrahi and Sephardic, meaning they come from Africa and the Middle East, not Europe. Even the minority that came from Europe is genetically more closely related to their Mizrahi brothers and sisters than Europeans.

  
Immigration: It's true that lots of Jews came to Israel in the 20th century, but so did Arabs — lots of Arabs came from the Middle East and Africa to the land in the 1920s to work for the British, and they're now called Palestinians. Arabs also had populations that had been living there for hundreds of years, Jews for thousands.

  
Appearance: If you go to Israel, you'll notice that Israelis and Palestinians look the same. They distinguish each other by clothing and language, not skin tone or facial features.  
Given this, how are Israelis considered white European immigrants, while Palestinians are considered brown natives of the land? They came at the same time, from the same places. 

I don't know what I'm missing, but it seems to be a pretty common view so perhaps there's something."
1,2023-10-24,CMV: Filming football play signals is not more unethical than watching game film,u/degen4Iyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fey9n/cmv_filming_football_play_signals_is_not_more/,changemyview,"There is a recent stir against a University of Michigan employee for going to public games and filming public signals that the sideline makes to indicate a certain play to the players on the field. I don’t know all the details but my view is still the same regardless

View: I do not believe filming public signals is more unethical than studying public game film.

The end goal of stealing signals is to get an advantage and be able to predict what the opposing team is calling and hopefully have an audible that would counter effectively. A few premises I have:

- a signal does not have a definitive outlook for the actual play call based on the outside looking in. (Example below)
- watching game film is essentially getting the same benefit (tracking play calls, tendencies, strategies) in a different way. 
- this is something every team could do while in person playing. 

There are *easy* ways around this. You could have the captain on the field wear a wristband that changes every possession. So you would make the same signals, but the plays would change. You could also have different signalers that try to throw off the opposing team (most teams already do this). Or you could make new signals each week (I understand this is much more difficult). I would almost invite opponents to do this and try to mislead them. 

Key words: public games, public signals. I am not advocating for stealing private practice information or radio interference/tampering.

Logic: Islamic society is very conservative when it comes to sexual experiences outside marriage. There are no sexual outlets for unmarried young men in fundamentalist Islamic circles.

This changes their decision-making, especially if they are poor with little prospect of being married.

I am not saying you should go divorce your wife either. Just need someone to talk me into or out of marriage. 

I have watched a total of 4 marriages fail, and all resulted in the man getting absolutely shafted, even with a prenup. One was my uncle, his ex wife put a false domestic violence claim on him and it was proven that he never did it, but still spent 2 days in county holding. Second was my cousin, who married someone making around his income, but she still walked away with the house, car, and most of the properties. Third was my friend (27M) who got cheated on during his deployment, and she walked away with half his income as spousal support (thank god they didn't have children). Fourth was my other army friend, and he got cheated on during his time in the hospital as he was recovering from a partial hip replacement. 

Statistically speaking, 50% of marriages fail. Would you fly on a plane with a 50% chance of crashing? With women initiating 70% divorces, why take a risk? 

But married men live longer. Why live longer in suffering than a shorter happier life? Why should I have to ask my future wife if I want to buy a motorcycle with my money after contributing to the bills? Why should I have a man cave in the house I paid for? 

But married men are happier. Only for the first two years, after that it diminishes. ([https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier](https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier))

On reddit and other sites have proven time and time again that men should overlook their feelings when a child or family is involved. Even to go as far as accept children born from affairs years after finding out years after. Even to go as far as demonizing men for requesting paternity and other genetic tests to confirm it is in fact their child. Or when men don't want to be a father, and even while paying child support, being called a deadbeat. 

Over and over again everything that goes wrong in a marriage is automatically the man's fault. Man cheats because his wife doesn't want any intimacy, he is the devil incarnate. Woman cheats because her man doesn't provide the intimacy, it is his fault automatically for not providing for her. Man want's his wife to be a stay at home parent, he is controlling. He wants his wife to work, he is broke. 

Even asking for a prenuptial agreement is seen as a asshole move nowadays. 

I am not an incel, I have no issues with women. But until the institution of marriage changes to provide TRUE benefit to men, please tell me some good reasons to get married in the 21st century as a man. The simple cost-benefit analysis shows that you lose more than gain. "

I will also purposefully be conflating ""femboy"" ""crossdresser"" and ""drag queen"" despite being aware of the difference because there's a lot of overlap here and a lot of the same discourse. 

I feel like it's a bit much to demand your hobby to be sex segregated even if it has ""boy"" in the name. Can't a woman call herself a femboy for making fashion choices inspired by femboy fashion? A lot of people claim it's ""self misgendering"" and with trans women specifically it's an invalidation of their trans identity. I don't think so. Firstly gender is a deeply personal thing that is impossible to vet. How can you know for certain that this person is actually a woman. A lot of people think I am a trans woman at first because I wear breastforms when I crossdress. Secondly, a lot of trans women started as femboys and shunning them immediately after they come out feels more transphobic than just letting them explore themselves in femboy spaces. Thirdly, gender isn't a boolean, you can be a woman and still identify as a man in certain contexts. 

Another argument I see is for the ""admirers"", who are looking specifically for feminine boys and not girls. This usually comes in the context of femboy pornography and is often phrased as ""I don't wanna see boobs"". Which is... quite objectifying. No, femboy spaces don't exist to fulfill your narrow sexual fantasies, every crossdresser only crossdresses for one man and that's themselves. Secondly, this is exclusionary of quite a lot of femboys including transmasc femboys, non-binary femboys, femboys who take estrogen (which is a whole other can of worms, but I don't want to exclude them either), femboys with gynecomastia, or femboys who wear breastforms. It's actually telling that a lot of femboy spaces specifically made to exclude trans women also exclude trans men. 

I feel like this discourse hides a lot more pressing issues in femboy spaces. Such as hypersexualization and objectification, or ambivalence towards chasers and pedos, or the prevalence of anorexia and unrealistic body standards, or issues of Racism, Misogyny and LGBTphobia in femboy spaces, or all the machine generated erotica captions that are much more prevalent than women ""taking over"" and actually demean the act of crossdressing itself.

1,2023-10-24,cmv: college tuition is not a parents responsibility,u/aquariuspade,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fhiq8/cmv_college_tuition_is_not_a_parents/,changemyview,"Once you're 18, you are an adult. If there is any education that you would like to pursue out of high school that is completely your responsibility, and if you have parents that want to help you, consider yourself lucky.

Parents are responsible for your education and welfare while you are still a child because you are unable to fend for yourself.

If your parents did their job right, you will have the skills to save up after high school or apply for a scholarship.The entitlement of having your parents help you after you graduate is really selfish. 

You shouldn't have the expectation and if you receive the help, you should be very grateful and make sure that their investment is worthwhile by applying yourself and not wasting valuable study hours by getting drunk, partying and doing immature foolishness...and actually sticking with your major instead of ""finding yourself"" on their dime."
1,2023-10-24,CMV: Incels are the result of a toxic culture that refuses to change.,u/AkamiAhaisu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fjhs4/cmv_incels_are_the_result_of_a_toxic_culture_that/,changemyview,"I feel like this claim is quite obvious, but on the chance someone disagrees, here's my explanation.

Incels are, in a general sense, individuals who can't get sex and feel bad about it. But I'd argue that's not enough of a definition. If you look at them closely, they usually share some common traits. They are people with problems to talk to others, with low self-esteem and who are easily hurt by what others would consider inoccuous things. That's the killer combination and it's more common than you might think.

People like that are easily influenced by others, for example, on what to go after in life. And one of the biggest things is sex, of course. The western culture is overwhelmingly more sex-positive than ever before, and it didn't take long for freedom to turn into yet another form of opression. Right now, if you fail to have sex, you are a loser. That kind of thing is especially true in the internet. It's in the small things, like ""this guy fucks"" memes, or sexual questions on r/askreddit getting thousands of upvotes or virgin jokes in live TV. 

If you have low self-esteem and are confronted with the idea that not having sex makes you a clown for others, that will make you have a hard drive to get sex. Not because there are people insulting you directly, but because you have been convinced yourself that you HAVE TO. And of course, often people will fail at this. And the more they fail, the more likely they are to fail, because they convince themselves more and more that they just aren't fit for this kind of thing.

I could get into how this turns into violent tendencies, but I feel like that's not the point here. The point is that this entire situation has a root cause, and still, people keep acting like there's nothing going on. Whenever shootings happen, or suicide, people individualize things too much and don't look at the bigger picture. Why are SO MANY people crying alone in their rooms at night? Don't we need a better mental healthcare available? Don't we need to push a culture of accepting those who ""don't fit""? Don't we need to take care of those who are more fragile than others?"

1,2023-10-24,CMV: We should have a National No Tipping Day,u/Intensiti,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fjz4n/cmv_we_should_have_a_national_no_tipping_day/,changemyview,"Let's face it: the tipping culture in the US is absolutely out of control. Everyone here knows it, and everyone around Reddit keeps complaining about it. Instead of just constantly moaning on and on, I propose a solution: we have a no tipping day on December 15th.  
Tipping culture is absolutely nuts. Since 2018, inflation went up by 22.51% whilst the 'standard' tipping percentage went from 12% to 18%. That means that a $100 meal with a $12 tip in 2018 is now a $122.51 meal with a $22.05 tip, a \~2x increase in tip within the last half decade.  
And before you corporate drones complain ""OHHH HJUST DONT EAT OUT IF YOU CANT TIP"", you're part of the problem! People all around the world work for only their salary PAID BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. Why is it that the service industry is the only one where customers must give extra so that the employees to \*do their job correctly\*? This isn't even mentioning the iPads spinning around for the employee to hand over a drink or even tipping at a self checkout.  
The sense of entitlement is insane. I used to deliver UberEats using a skateboard and saw and appreciated ANY tip as a bonus. But now, service workers are complaining over a $5 tip on a $20 pizza. Why the hell does a waitress deserve a tip for carry plates of food over but our sanitation workers don't for smelling literal shit all day and carry huge, heavy trash cans? And before you say ""OHHH WAITRESSES GET PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE THEY NEED TIPS TO SURVIVE"", this is ONLY the case because of the tipping culture. We should demand the businesses to pay their employees properly rather than stick our heads in the sand. P.S. did you know that many service workers, especially at the fancier places, could clear more than engineers and nurses on tips alone?  
Now keep in mind, I'm not saying we should never tip. I'm happy to buy the people working on my roof a few packs of beer or give exceptional workers money to show appreciation. What I'm saying is 'tipping' should not be the norm simply for someone doing the bare minimum of their job requirements.  
Again, let's stop pretending that nothing could be done about this problem. On December 15th, let's have a no tipping day as the first step."
1,2023-10-24,"CMV: American news media is committing an abdication of duty every time they refer to Trump (or others') lies as ""false claims"" or similar",u/tsaihi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fkdmv/cmv_american_news_media_is_committing_an/,changemyview,"Inspired most immediately by [this headline](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-false-claims-new-hampshire_n_6536e24fe4b011a9cf7ab60f), but this has been going on for years. 

Trump lies, constantly. This is common knowledge. But you wouldn't really know it by reading mainstream media coverage. They're typically very careful to refer to his lies as ""misstatements"" or ""false claims"" or similar. I remember the leadup to the 2016 election included a number of hand-wringing, pearl-clutching op-eds about why the various institutions were so careful not to use the word ""lie"", and most of them actually included some warning that if Trump couldn't figure out how to stop lying so much, they might even start using the word. But since then I've seen little evidence that media companies are willing to refer to his many obvious lies as lies. All this despite being close to a decade in of Trump being an active political player, including four years in the white house. 

In fact, I think many media outlets are exacerbating the problem by their careful framing of his lies - more often than not, I see a headline that simply repeats the lie Trump told, and then includes as a byline (or buried later in the article) a refutation of the statement. But IMO the damage is already done: there is now a giant headline that simply repeats Trump's lie. Many people who read the lie will not go on to read about how the lie is false. 

I know media companies are driven by profit more than truth, so my argument here is really just based on a commonly-held narrative about what a journalist's job *should* be. Obviously that's up for some debate, but I think most reasonable people can agree that a journalist's job essentially involves sharing accurate information with people. Which would include referring to Trump's many and obvious lies as what they are, instead of coddling him and giving him the benefit of the doubt time after time. 

The most obvious argument against using ""lie"" in this context I think comes from the fact that Trump has never/rarely been proven in criminal court to be knowingly lying about something. But this is a very strict standard that, while it may make sense in a legal context, is very specifically NOT what journalists should be bound to. Journalists should be acting completely independently of the legal system, and should be willing to call lies what they are."

1,2023-10-24,"CMV: A total gun ban is a band-aid fix for a bigger societal problem. It won't work, and won't achieve the desired effect in the long run.",u/IllustriousAd642,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fmlgi/cmv_a_total_gun_ban_is_a_bandaid_fix_for_a_bigger/,changemyview,"**TO PREFACE: I am not anti-gun control. I do believe that the ease at which we as US citizens can come to own deadly weapons is problematic and there there should be mor red-tape involved in gun ownership. I recognize that the free access to deadly weapons has directly contributed to countless deaths in recent years.  I am in no way minimizing the damage and trauma that our nation has gone through and continues to go through every day as a result of gun violence. I am not right-wing.**

That being said, while I am not against making guns more difficult to own and come by, I am also pro-second amendment, and I feel that responsible gun owners are within their rights to buy and own weapons, within reason.

Personally, I am no gun enthusiast myself (though my partner is, I have held this opinion long before he and I got together) I have just put some thought into this and feel that banning guns, while it may help things for a while,  it would not stop the issue, and in some ways would make things worse.

I have a lot of thoughts so for clarity's sake I am going to list them in bullet points. 

*  **Mass shootings are a relatively recent issue, with the number of instances growing exponentially in the last decade**.  Guns have not become any more available in that time than they always have been.  This suggests that perhaps guns are not the source of the problem. 
* **Guns do not cause people to be violent any more than a fork causes people to eat**. Guns are tools, dangerous tools, absolutely, and tools that not everyone should have access to. But that does not mean that THEY are the issue. Some might argue that a tool used for violence no one should have access to. But (at least in my experience) most gun-owners I know ( the pro 2A republicans most anti-gun people tend to hate) are responsible owners that do not use their weapons for any sort of violence. They have them for sport, hunting, and personal protection. With hunting being the closest thing to violence they are ever used for. 
* **Banning guns will only effect law-abiding citizens**.  This one is big, and honestly the most obvious pro 2A argument my mind. People who use guns for violence tend to not be too concerned about the legality of their violence.  Someone with the intention to shoot up a school is not going to think *""Well I WAS going to commit mass-murder, but then I remembered that guns were illegal. So I changed my mind.*"" People who plan to kill people don't give a crap if they WAY they plan to do it is illegal. They are already planning on committing a felony.  Criminals will still have guns, it will only be the law abiding every-day person who does not. Which will fix nothing. Criminals will remain armed, and law-abiding citizens will be rendered defenseless.
* **Banning guns will not stop guns from being accessible.** This is speculation of course, I have no way of proving how this will be. But think about it. Things that are illegal are still *available.* In many places they are *readily* available.  Banning guns won't mean that all the guns in America suddenly disappear.  They will become a whole new underground  market. The people moving large quantities of fentanyl and heroine will add AR-15s to their inventory, small time drug-pushers will ""know a guy"" and be able to get you a handgun for the right price.  What I'm saying is that crime rates will BOOM. Gangs (who's members are often already carrying illegally-owned pieces) will not stop using guns just because they became slightly harder to come by.  Especially in America, where we have more guns than people, banning them won't get rid of them. Not by a long shot.  Sure it may have worked in New Zealand or wherever. But in the US? No. Gun's are too engrained in our culture here. 
* **The reason people commit mass shootings is not because they have guns, it is because they are mentally unwell and are violent people.** Obviously *these* people should not have access to guns, and the fact that they have such easy access to them exacerbates the issue.  But when it comes to the prevalence of mass murder, the issue isn't, at its root, the gun- *it is the multiple people  who want to commit mass murder*. We have a severe lack of support for the mental health of males in this country and we turn a blind eye to all the factors that contribute to these boys growing up to be violent men. THAT is the standard that needs changing.  The prevalence of the toxic patriarchal values and standards that are currently accepted as a norm fuel A LOT of the ideas that these shooters end up listing as reasons for why they did what they did.  What we need to do is crack down on incel rhetoric, actually DO something about bullying (online and otherwise), teach our men and boys that it is OKAY to ask for help, then to actually PROVIDE that help in a meaningful way, teach men that women are individuals and that they do not owe themselves to them NOR does a mans ability to sleep with a woman determine his own personal value etc..

Men are less likely to go to therapy and more likely to commit violence against others and themselves, Is that a coincidence? Hell no its not.  THAT is the problem.  And that is WAY more relevant a reason as to why these acts of violence are committed. 

Guns are just tools.  Banning guns will only fix so much. It will not remove the malice, hatred or desire for violence that these men have festering in them. These boys will still become violent men. And if they have a desire to kill they will kill. People who use guns to commit violence will not stop committing violence just because guns are illegal. Just because buying or owning a gun is a crime, does not mean that the people already determined to commit a WORSE crime will change their minds and choose peace. 

Sure, a gun ban might make a difference for a little while. But I would bet money that without any other changes set into place to fix this issue we will have, at best, 5-10 years of fewer shootings but then see a mass increase of serial killings as these men eventually fail to continue to repress the violent urges that have.

To violent criminals, all a gun ban will do is add an extra charge to the crime they have already decided to commit, to the rest of Americans it will be taking away a right that they have always exercised legally and responsibly. Calling for it is a reactionary response, wanting an easy fix to an issue that requires a much larger and more involved fix. 

 I personally believe that YES, we SHOULD make guns more difficult to access, more difficult by a mile. But ultimately we should still allow citizens to exercise their 2nd amendment right, and direct our focus on fixing the societal problems that nourish the roots of the issue."
1,2023-10-24,CMV: Dogs are the most important animal man has ever known,u/Eli-Had-A-Book-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17fmuu4/cmv_dogs_are_the_most_important_animal_man_has/,changemyview,"Besides being man’s best friend, dogs have also been humanities most important tool. 

Sure they make great pets, friends and bring us plenty of laughs but they are also some of the best options to get a job done.

When it comes to search & rescue, bomb detection, drug detection and security there are limitations our modern technology has not been able to exceed the capabilities of a dog (especially when you consider the price tag).

 There are some very expensive machines that are able to detect trace elements of drugs or explosive residue. But they still require more human involvement & aren’t always field friendly. 

Search and rescue are really where dogs shine. If there are no cameras around, we would be pretty much out of luck trying to pick up a trail of someone if we didn’t have dogs. Their ears and nose can get out in the dirt and grime and complete task seemingly on a super human level compared to our abilities. 

When it comes to service dogs, they are literally heaven sent for some. They really put in work to assist those who need it.


Before I go on, by important I mean by directly assisting man in our lives. Not important for the environment like they are out their pollinating plants and decomposing dead things. Also, I am aware there are some fringe occurrences where rats, cats, ponies, chimpanzees, goats, aardvarks, cotton top tamarins or what ever else have been used for one of the aforementioned task. I am not saying it’s impossible for any other animal to do something similar but I know you are aware that dogs are undoubtedly the vast majority of animals that undergo these assignments are dogs. Not the pygmy antelope you saw on YouTube.


Finally, the only other animal that can be viewed as competition for this title is the horse. Undoubtedly they *were* important but their time has come. 

So I feel like this will be a debate on why horses contribution over all have been more important than dogs (even though their utility is next to nothing now). Maybe up to the early 20th century but, you can change my mind. Maybe there is another animal I’m overlooking."

This is a little self-serving but I genuinely believe this and would really like my view changed. 
 
I was born with Cerebral Palsy, a disability that effects my speech, my walking and my stability. I started taking baby steps around 7-yo and only around 26-yo I felt I was making improvements.

I went to highschool, college and university like a drone, most likely I was depressed. By the time I grauated university at 23-yo (computer science) I felt in the brink of exgastion. I felt depressed, weak, and honestly knew deep in my soul that trying to get a job would be harmful for me. 

I became recluse, but thankfully in the dark tunel I was in, there was a small light, that made me get up in the morning and go to the gym. And eventually happiness grew. 

Mentally I've come 80% on the otherside, now I believe that my value is not based on what I contribute in the world - in fact, human value I believe is a myth. Whether you are steve jobs or a homeless person, you are equally valueless.

**Now I am in a great place**, slightly scared that the other shoe might drop but, though a loner, broke, ""valueless"" by some form of social standards. I feel amazing 

To get a job as a programmer you need:

- to know programming - for at least entry level, I have that (current skills checked)
- communication skills - I have a speech difficulty (some same writen communication counts, I don't believe them)
- work experience - I'm 37 never had a job
- education - an old CS degree that's over 10 years old

**Being blunt**, I get state benefits because I'm dissabled, I think it's better to not even try going through job search as everything is stacked against me 

- huge gap
- old cv
- old age
- would be useless to speak over the phone
- face-to-face interviews might be hard due to emotions.

Since I've found my comfort zone and I'm happy, I feel everything is stacked in a way that if I go out and find a job, my life would get fucked up: Even if I get some job, I have all this time with minimal human interaction. I will do a shit job at interaction and team work, get fired, maybe by benefits would be taken away from me...

I tried to be as open as possible in hopes that though it sounds I'm just ""lazy living of off benefits"" it's really not the case"

Maximum prison for sexual assault is 10 years in Canada.

But what happens if this person is out and is still high risk. In my opinion someone who assaulted someone, especially if it's a child, should have life in prison. And it does reduce the reoffense. If he doesn't get out, that's one less child/person being assaulted. Why SHOULDNT we have this tough on crime? Yes, yes we say prison costs. But does it offset the next victim? 

Tough on crime for the school shooter? One bullet through him instead of waiting for him to 'stand down'. Why not?

Tough on crime also stopped me from doing petty crime. As a 13 year old teen if I knew that the ONLY thing I would get for stealing I reasoned, was one day in jail, why not. Yes I was an idiot.

I believe that there is a direct correlation between these things.

When a country is in need of aid, the US always gets more pressure than any other country to supply that aid. The US forces itself to carry absurd burden that no other country carries, and gets very little in return for it. 

Because of America's foreign endevours, we have gotten in return: an out of control domestic living crisis because our government has neglected its own people, no respect for what we do, a bad reputation as ajingoist nation, and tons of debt.

You could argue self-defense in the latter in lieu of zygote insentience, but I cannot think of any other context in which ""self-defense"" is argued for against (to those who see zygotes as persons) a child, who is not aware they are the aggressor nor were deliberately being so. We outlaw warning shots because the life of an innocent bystander is worth so much more than the life of the aggressor that you cannot put the latter in the slightest danger to spare the former. I'm not sure why intent of the aggressors and bystander are so much more relevant than that of the zygote. It's also worth noting that respondents claim not to consider ESCR murder ***anyway***, but that alone doesn't tell us they mean that, much less explain why they don't as vocally or passionately oppose the characterization thereof as murder like they do for the characterization of the morning-after pill as murder.

&#x200B;

The second is to say that they have the right to carry out ESCR, just not with others' tax dollars. But we all have to fund things we disagree with. The education system's curriculum is answerable only to 51% of voters, not 100%. Many military operations are controversial yet we don't have to stop just because some people object. Making this a private service would render it almost pointless, as any cures that get in the way of making money off treatments could be concealed. Only making it a public service would **require** enough transparency on how it's carried out to prevent that from happening. If your idea of a ""compromise"" plays into companies' hands, it's a compromise worth re-evaluating.

&#x200B;

The third is to say that this is yet another thing to blame on conservatives, not Christianity. I hope they're right, as I've gotten along well with progressive Christians in multiple jobs over the years. But there's also no denying that progressives have let this issue fade from the spotlight. From what I've heard, they spent 2004 howling from the rooftops about Dubya throwing away excess embryos that could've saved lives. Then over the years stopped talking about it. This should be something people are following up on every day. What progress has been made? What are scientists doing with that money? Sam Harris, often regarded by mainstream progressives as a conservative, spoke glowingly of ESCR as a ""moral issue science has solved."" I don't agree with that *specific* line of reasoning; science is about positive statements, morality about normative statements. They're too distinct for one to inherently address the other. But that's a much more vocal defense of ESCR than any I've heard any comparably mainstream leftist make in the past few years. Why is that? And why, if progressive Christians think you don't get to call yourself pro-life unless you support spending tax dollars on school lunch programs or the like, do they not get to call themselves pro-life unless they support spending tax dollars on research that could save lives?"

And the focus seems to be ever louder and ever present. I'm talking about workplace implicit bias testing, social movements (like Black Lives Matter), diversity initiatives, the politics of immigration, etc. Each of which I have supported, and all of which seem important for change.

But I had a realization recently. I think it passed some kind of a tipping point at some time. Somewhere along the way, race has moved too far into the forefront of my consciousness. It's gotten to a level where a persons race dominates my awareness throughout an interaction. It's become too much of a focus, when of course there is so much more to a person than some amalgamated racial milieu of experiences based on the color of their skin.

I think some people would look at this and say that's the point. But I just want to go back to seeing people as people, and let the racial awareness become secondary.

I'd have to imagine that other people will have developed this same type of hyper focus too. But for people who make negative race-based assumptions, this will augment racist tendencies and worsen race relations."

What's the explanation? Culture/religiosity and government.

Culture and religiosity; Egypt is a Muslim majority country - Muslims generally tend to value human life and don't believe in killing over gangs/drugs/money.

Government; Egyptian government has very serious punishment for crimes such as murder, rape, and drug offenses.

1,2023-10-24,CMV: Attractive Women have no excuses to be lonely in the dating world.,u/SpeedyFalcon874,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17frof6/cmv_attractive_women_have_no_excuses_to_be_lonely/,changemyview,"I specifically put ""in the dating world"" in the title so it could eliminate the obvious possibility of a family member dying or things of that sort, excluding that, I believe physically attractive women in today's world have zero excuse to be lonely. It has never been better or easier to be an attractive woman than it is today.

Nowadays, attractive women have so many avenues to garner male attention, social media, onlyfans, Instagram modeling, online dating, meet up apps, etc. Back in the day you had to just go out in the real world and meet someone by chance, it was also much harder to get male attention in the comfort of your own home, you barely have to do any work to get positive reinforcement from the opposite sex or same sex even. Especially since it is also common for online models to do collabs and have their own friend groups. 

Dating apps are super easy for you, you have thousands upon thousands of people who want to date you, if you can't find a single good men from the thousands of guys wanting to meet you, you honestly have nobody to blame but yourself, you only have to find 1 person you're compatible with, imagine being a regular normal person where you don't have thousands of matches, If you can't get it right on easy mode then I don't even know what to say. 

One thing I want to say so that it can better explain my next point is I believe that making money decreases the chances of you being lonely, the reason I feel this way is because a lot of money makes it so that you have more doors to certain types of people that you wouldn't have had access to before, you can be with other rich people or potentially even celebrities because we all know the rich and powerful have their own elitist social bubbles that normal people don't have access to. 

If you're an attractive woman it takes nothing to make an onlyfans or an Instagram/twitter account and become a millionaire, being an E-Girl is insanely easy for these people and has the potential to be insanely profitable, once you get that kind of money you will then have access to these elitist social bubbles, you will have rich men that will fly you out and take you on these expensive, exotic vacations, you could have sex with celebrities, the possibilities go up so much more just by being a hot girl. These things are not possible for most of the population.

That is my ted talk, if you're an attractive woman life literally cannot possibly be easier for you in today's western world, especially with online dating on the rise and the possibility of being an E-Girl, you guys probably have it better than men at this point. If anyone can change my view, I am welcome to all arguments. "

It works well for boxing because you are comparing apples to apples (boxing vs boxing). When you throw in all the styles involved in MMA, you’re left with a useless scoring system that doesn’t really tell you how you should compare 1 knockdown vs taking someone down and beating the bricks off of them (sure damage is always the #1 criteria but is a takedown + damage worth more than just the damage?) depending on who you’d ask you’d get a different answer. 
It’s not very clear how much is required in MMA to get a 10-8 score. For example this weekend while watching the fights, specifically Usman vs Chimaev, round 1 is very clear for Chimaev, round ends everyone at my table says “10-9 chimaev”, we get to round 2 and Usman takes a bit more control of the round, and the majority of the table gives it to Usman, but I bring it up and say “how can you score this round 10-9 when we scored the last one as 10-9 and chimaev was clearly more dominant in round 1 than Usman was in round 2. What I think happened here is the judges had a similiar thought process and went back and changed the first round score to 10-8, and while that does make sense logically (the score), it’s not really consistent with how rounds are usually scored. 

I understand that part of the problem is that with varying commission and no standardized training for judges they can have vastly different views on fights. 

I’m not sure what a good replacement for this system would be (topic of a different conversation) however I know that this system isn’t the ideal one for the reasons I’ve stated. Convince me otherwise."

For example: If the amount of sunlight a person gets can lead to them making one set of choices over another, that being did not freely choose those decisions. 

If you want to define it as the ability to direct oneself without restriction or the ability to direct oneself independent of the prior state of the universe the statement holds true.

In the past, the field of neuroscience didn’t exist. People genuinely thought that there was a spirit or a intangible self that was governing the body & mind. This idea set up the grounds for free will and free will is the grounds for why humans can sin and do evil. Nobody could promote an all loving entity creating such a suffering filled place if it were not for the assumption of free will.

The idea of an intangible self existing is not held up today. It is becoming increasingly convincing that there is no unified singular self especially not an intangible one. The brain and body is what we are and a collective of processes come together to create an experience of oneness and selfness. 

These processes are not independent self contained systems. They are effected by other processes that are out of their field of effect. You can’t describe a human decision without addressing the hundreds of factors that led to that decision being made. These factors go as far back as our evolutionary ancestors. None of our behaviors exist in a vacuum and there is no self doing the choosing. We aren’t even consciously aware of a decision being made until the processes for making that decision have already happened. 

The bible and Christianity use free will as an explanation of evil hatred sin etc, this explanation is invalid because humans cannot i make decisions independent from prior experience , genetics, biology, environmental factors etc. there is no room for a decision made simply because an entity chose to make it of its own free will. Our will is heavily dictated by factors outside of our control and is therefore not free. 


TLDR: Humans will is heavily dictated by outside influence; there is no unified self making decisions; the bible uses free will to excuse evil ; god said we have free will but we dont"

Now bars don’t need to label the amount of alcohol to their cocktails of course but I’m talking in the instance of being in a lunch environment and not expecting to have alcohol. I think their shoukd be some type of at least number range labeled like 300-400 mg etc.

I also see lots of people provoking vegans in popular subreddits for emotional reaction, they are like ""Lol keep going. Animal yummy"". Such replies have upvotes always.  
3. One defense they may use is that humor is a way to release anxiety, stress, nervousness. I know that nervous laughter is a thing, but it is something that happens subconsciously in real life events. How does writing a comment by moving your fingers on a website release your anxiety or stress or nervousness? It seems an excuse to keep going because nobody can rebut such facts.  
4. I don't know why there are so many ""stand up comedians"" on reddit but it's very annoying. Even that passing joke ""I also choose this person's dead wife"" is simply tasteless and crass but I don't know why it is so popular on reddit.  
5. Many reddit posts has comments at the bottom with 1 upvote that are just plain sarcasm for no reason. If one confronts them on their humor, they will be like ""chill bro"".   
6. Humor is not just ""social activity"" but it embodies a lot of other things such as insensitivity to the topic, belittling the seriousness, refusal to deal with a serious topic, avoidance of emotions and lots of validation seeking. They are often full of lies too.  
7. In conclusion this website is full of people with immature and juvenile tendencies who wouldn't do anything about it because it does not affect their lives in ways they realize. If something gives them upvotes and notifications, they must be doing something good right? Nothing will change because these are not just kids but full adults in 30s 40s and above who have no chance of personality change.  
8. It reminds me of lots of internet celebrities and people who think that they are not a narcissist, when we know for a fact that ""those who post on social media are more likely to be narcissist"", but does that make any less number of vloggers, influencers, selfies?   
9. If one wants to stay away from such people, there are only few places that are fact or knowledge based or heavily moderated like askphilosophy, askhistorians etc where they don't get to try to create reactions out of audience with mind twisting jokes."

From what I understand Jews, Christians and Muslims have been living there for hundred of years but under colonial rule by the Ottomans and British. I understand Palestine was not an official country but the people living there still have a right to the land regardless of religion. I don’t understand why Zionist leaders had to tell Jews in Europe that there was an empty land for them especially when many Jews were already migrating to Palestine and living with Jews that had already been there. Why not just continue to do this and have everyone living in one country instead of the endless conflict we have now. I don’t see how the British who occupied the land can decide who to give it to and justify it.

 I know there are Arab Israelis but the original idea was to make it only for Jewish people. Also the Arabs have a different set of laws so they aren’t considered equal in any way either. Many say the displaced Palestinians left their own homes willingly because they thought they could come back later but I know many people who experienced this first hand and they had to flee to places like the West Bank or try to hide in Churches and Mosque which the British soldiers wouldn’t let the Zionists attack although they basically lent them their army and weapons to get rid of as many people as possible. I even talked to person who showed me the bullet wound he got before he was able to hide in a Mosque. He was able to stay after being in there for a number of days hidden. 

Crazy thing is the same Zionists blew up the hotel where the same British generals who helped them were staying when it was all over because they didn’t need them anymore. Eventually America backed them instead and this gave them protection to continue land grabs, violence and political sabotage like helping fund Hamas which has led to so much carnage for the people on both sides. 

I do understand it’s too late to go back now and hopefully they figure out how to make one or two countries. Even there is a possibility if they split the West Bank and Gaza but I don’t agree that Zionists had any right to want the country all for themselves. I do believe all three groups have the right to live there and I wish that is what initially happened after the British rule. 

I think the only way to make peace at this point is for America and Americans to start looking at things differently. I think most people are starting to realize that the people do not equate to the leadership on both sides and that people like Netanyahu benefit from this violence similar to how George W did to win his second term during the war in Iraq. The Likud party was originally mostly Hagana members who were the same people who blew up the British soldiers on the hotel as well as other bombing they did to civilians before Israel and they turned into the party of Netanyahu, Sharon, etc. 

Sad thing is Palestinians and Jews are genetically the same people. Palestinians are closer genetically to Jews than they are to most other Arabs. You could argue they have more Jewish blood than most Ashkenazi Jews because genetically they lost the mothers side and many now have half European DNA. Either way that doesn’t matter. 

The point is they are really the same people and I am against Zionism in general and the idea that it all belongs to either group. I have literally read school books that say no Arabs were there until Israelis made the dessert bloom. I mean why lie if it was legal or righteous in the first place?"

People like to point out how old school marriages used to last till the death of a spouce but forget that many people felt trapped in their marriages. Many cultures and religions still frown against divorce and expect people to ""endure"" which to me makes no sense.  I think saying ""we will try our very best to make our relationship work"" makes more sense and is more realistic way of allowing people to put an effort towards keeping the attraction and also allows people to not feel trapped in a relationship.

1,2023-10-25,CMV: States should pledge in advance to send all electors to the popular vote winner if the Electoral College result does not align with the popular vote,u/devilmaskrascal,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17g7ft8/cmv_states_should_pledge_in_advance_to_send_all/,changemyview,"The Electoral College is set in Constitutional stone and the bar to amend the Constitution to get rid of it is too high. Small states like having disproportionate power and will vote down Constitutional amendments changing it. 

But a system where some states' votes get 9x the representation in selecting a President vs. other states' votes is not a fair system, period.

However, states can choose how their electors are nominated. Most states are winner take all. Some states divide the electors up proportionately, so minority votes also get Electoral College representation. 

States with a majority who don't agree with or benefit from the Electoral College should pass laws stating that, in the event the Electoral College outcome does not align with the popular vote, that ALL state electors will go to the winner of the national popular vote, even if the majority of the state vote did not choose that candidate.

While in a vacuum, this seems like it would be contradictory to the interests of the plurality of voters in that state (imagine California sending all electors to a Republican, or Texas sending all their electors to a Democrat), if more and more states pass similar laws, eventually the impact of the Electoral College overriding the popular vote will be neutered if enough big states agree to send all their electors to the popular vote winner.

Since every vote counts towards the popular vote winner, it is not like this process diminishes the weight of that states' residents' votes even if the electors don't align with the plurality winner. This would simply be making the outcome represent the national popular vote. Someday, their party may be the ones benefiting from another state overriding their plurality winner and going with the national popular vote when the pendulum swings the other way.

For big states, there is incentive to do this since they are getting screwed hardest by the Electoral College. Small states are already overrepresented in the Senate and even in Congress, which is why a Wyoming voter counts 9x as much as a California one. 

If Texas, California, New York and Florida alone agreed to this pact it would dramatically reduce the likelihood of a candidate who wins the popular vote by 3m votes losing the Electoral College."

But, have you ever thought about the actual implications of a non-regulated market? Every single thing we sell is related in some way or another to resources of the planet. In FME, selling derivates of natural resources is just ""transforming"" nature in order to introduce our product in market's offer supply. If the right conditions are met, this will increase the demand of that product, wich in turn lets us invest in resource extraction. This will ultimately increase offer, and then an ""economic loop"" can start, powered only earth's resources and capitalist market  relations. One does not need a PHD in mathematics to see how easily this can turn the numbers into the depletion of the original resource, ultimately privating ALL humanity of its benefits. Saying this is an idealization of reality is far from the cold facts: we are constantly transforming _clean air_ into _pollution and factories_, _energy_ into _power and an increase in temperature_, _free land_ into _urbanization and population growth_... But what can we do when those resources end up in depletion?  The answer is clear: be extinguished."

After the events in the US, I am sad to say, that I think it's time for we liberals to play realpolitik for the time being on the issue of gun ownership.

With the rise in mass shootings, partisan violence, insurrection by right wing mobs, coup attempts, and paramilitary groups like The Proud Boys; we need to get real.

There are millions of Americans who want us dead. They don't believe in the rule of law or democracy. They will cheat, intimidate, or even kill to get their way. And they're heavily armed.

With the absolute gridlock in politics, there is zero chance we will be able to get laws on the books to limit gun ownership. We don't even have a speaker of the house. Even if we did, there are so many unregistered/stolen/claimed lost or destroyed weapons out there, that its impossible to disarm the crazies. 

While we sit and debate policy and put up a few token and ineffectual protests here and there, they are working tirelessly to steal elections, take away our rights, and dismantle our institutions. They are playing for keeps. Every day, they become more emboldened, to the point where their leading presidential candidate advocates for shooting shoplifters, executing top generals, jailing the opposition, etc. 

They celebrated the assault on Paul Pelosi. They run over protestors. They're abusing immigrants. They're buying and training with deadly assault weapons.

So, change my view that we on the left should be buying and training with our own weapons. Please note, this isn't to defend against the US military, it's to defend ourselves from treasonous mobs and make the terrorists think twice about acting with impunity as to how it affects our health/safety/well being/ability to organize."

The official narrative for the Holocaust - which I ascribe to - is that it was a real-life genocide of 12 million people, 6 million of which were Jews. The others were Roma, mentally handicapped, homosexual, Slavic, etc. peoples, who were considered by the Nazis to be inferior.

The official narrative for 9/11 - which I ascribe to - is that it was a terrorist attack carried out by al-Qaeda, in which 19 hijackers flew planes into the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and one crashed in Pennsylvania. There were no explosives planted in the WTC. It was not the Illuminati or a US government inside job (although the Bush administration did show incompetence in failing to heed warnings.)

The official narrative for the Moon landings - which I ascribe to - is that the United States did in fact land men on the Moon 6 times, and that each was a genuine, real, landing on the Moon. The Apollo missions were the only time mankind has ventured beyond Earth orbit. It was not faked.

The official narrative for Earth's roundness - which I ascribe to - is that the Earth is round. (Okay, technically, it's oval, since it's slightly flat at the poles, but it's certainly not flat.)

I think this often involves Katie having some very unkind attitudes towards Mark and herself.  
  
To explain more lets add some more context to the case study:  
  
Katie might have slept with Mark two times and found out that Mark slept with Anna inbetween. Katie gets very upset. What reasons does she have for getting upset?  
  
First, lets look at some reasons that I think would be a good reason to get upset, i.e. they do not indicate she has unkind attitudes towards Mark:  
  
1.She is worried about STDs. A healthy concern for her own wellbeing.  
  
2. She is worried Mark will be less committed to her in the future. Reasonable.  
  
Reasons I think sexual jealousy can be a sign of extreme unkindness:  
  
1. It reduces Mark to a sexual object. The implication is that after he has had sex with Anna interacting with him has become less worthwhile to Katie. Why should someones sexual history ever dictate how we treat them?  
  
2. Katie disrespects herself. A negative response to Mark having sex with someone else may indicate that Katie has placed some of her self esteem in ""being the only one Mark has sex with"". This again, reduces her to a sexual object. If she was truely enjoying all the different aspects of interacting with Mark then what he gets up to while not hanging out with her would not bother her so much.

**Palestine**
- Generally supports Hamas who have killed many innocents
- Likely hasn’t done all the terrible things media says they have, but they’ve certainly done some of it.
- Has a right to their own land and history

**Israel**

I've seen a lot of posts on social media, mostly tik tok, and online articles, talking about halloween costumes that should not be worn at all because of things like cultural appropriation or offense level. The most common I've seen are Romani people (commonly known as ""Gypsies'') and ""fortune tellers"" as a whole, wearing wigs that have the same hair as a person of color or dressing up as a different race at all, Geisha's, Native Americans/indigenous people, Hispanics and more specifically mentioned are Mexican people, sugar skull/Day Of the Dead related costumes. I could name more, but they basically all had to do with a race or culture. 

I think there is a very fine line here. To me, it's about intent. What is the intention of dressing up as a person outside your race or culture? Is it because you like and admire them? Or are you trying to make fun of them and discriminate against them? I think it's very important to realize the fine line between cultural appropriation versus appreciation. If you're dressing up as any group as a whole and not a specific person or character, it's very easy to give the wrong idea, with or without intention to.   
But let's say it's sugar skull makeup and costume. I think that could definitely be more appreciation, if done right. While this is *a specific part* of a culture, it's different than appropriating to me (again, if done with truly right intentions) because, essentially, this person is admiring a beautiful part of that culture. Or any type of fortune teller. While these can be linked to Romani people, I think the same applies to the sugar skull, but also it's different to me because you can make yourself look more on the magical and mystical fiction side of a fortune teller that isn't related to that group of people. The fortune teller one is a little too broad for me to say that's a strict no, but it comes down to the way the costume is done.  
I think if you are dressing as a character or person outside of your race group there's steps to take to approach this the right way. Generally, someone dresses up as any specific character on Halloween because they like or admire them. So let's say you're white and you like or admire a person or character who is a different race or comes from a different culture. You go extremely wrong if you try to actually make your physical features match this character. Any type of makeup, fake tan, or face paint to match the skin tone of this character's race is not ok, along with trying to change your facial features, more specifically things like eye shape, is wrong. **There’s a difference between dressing up as a person or character that’s a different race from you and trying to make yourself look like a different race.** But, wearing a general costume of this person or character based on outfit is not a bad thing to me, as long as the correct intentions are there. I will add, I feel differently about any wigs on halloween. I think not every costume requires a wig, but there are definitely some characters where a wig might make or break the costume. This can apply to absolutely any race or culture. The intention behind wearing the wig, and how necessary it is to the costume, is still important. But I mean a wig for Halloween is different to me then changing your actual hair or wearing a wig that is culture appropriation for absolutely no reason.   
I also want to make a point about Disney princesses and princes. This is common for anyone from young children, all the way to adults to dress up as. I think all of these characters and their stories have value and many things to be admired. They also come from different cultures. I think that as long as it's done right, we can't just say ""you can only dress up as a Disney character if it matches your race/culture."" The same still applies about the right way to do it, though. I mean, if I had a child that was too young to understand the complexity of racism and appropriation, I would not pick Halloween to explain that, nor would I refuse my child dressing up as Moana for Halloween because it could offend someone. Parents of children need to help facilitate the costume to make sure it's just dressing up as the character, not changing their own race or culture. But many, many children dress as their favorite Disney character and I don't think it's fair to say that's not ok anymore.   
I wanted to touch on this too. I've seen some people go as far as to say don't dress up as a cop or ""sexy"" cop because some cops have killed people from minority groups. I am in no way trying to say that the actions of any unethical officer of the law is right, but this is a wildly popular costume. To try and say people can't wear a general cop costume is strange to me. I also saw some saying to not dress up as a serial killer or someone who kills, sometimes mentioning a specific person, but other's just laid It down as a blanket statement. Or a mental health patient and the images mostly showing costumes of old-timey straight jackets.  
Of course, there are factors at play here too. I think the difference is how specific it is. If you are specifically dressing up as a certain and real cop who did any unethical, biased or racist act on someone, then yes you shouldn't do that. But a cop in general is not bad for a costume and shouldn't be banned from halloween. Same thing for a serial killer. If you dress up as an ax murder then that's not an issue I mean it's halloween. But if your costume is specific to Ted Bundy, or any other real life killer (or a specific victim for that matter), then no. If your goal is to dress like a clinically or even criminally insane person, and again not mention a real person other than a fake character, then yeah. I mean most of those costumes involved old-timey straight jackets which, at least in the US, are typically not used as common practice in current real life. It's Halloween, it's supposed to be scary stuff. But if you are dressing up as a person with mental illness with the purpose to deem them as less than and discriminate against them, then you should rethink. It's about the thought behind the costume for this one. An insane person for halloween with the intent to be nothing but over dramatic and halloween scary is not the same as the intent to be discriminating.   
There are also things that point blank periods should not be costumes, such as but not limited to, terrorists, Hitler, and any other specific people or things who have caused mass harm. Things like “sexy"" Geisha costumes and related costumes are an absolute no for me as well. There is no non-offensive way to appreciate those things in that manner.   
At the end of the day, it's about the specifics and intentions of these costumes. I think it has less to do with the costume itself, but more how it's being done and viewed- Specifically on halloween. I think Halloween is very, very different then choosing a random day or night to go out dressed up as a group you don't belong to, or doing the same to get views online or something. Halloween can be about appreciation by costume.   
I understand bringing awareness to the topic of cultural appropriation and how important that is, and I understand not every person is going to have intentions of not offending and appropriating, but to me that doesn't mean that we view every person dressing up as a character or person etc outside their race on halloween as appropriation. It's not that simple to me, there's more than 1 answer.  
I think it's important to remember that these people truly being offensive are not putting together those costumes thinking about how it makes others feel, whether that is from being uneducated or plain bigotry. But it's also important to remember not everyone is dressing up as another culture out of disrespect, and that's clear in the content of the costume and the way it's done. It's unfair to me to try to ""ban"" (as much as you can ban) potentially beautiful costumes on Halloween for everyone, because certain people do not and will not respect you. Educate people, yes, but the whole issue of what “should” and “shouldn't”  be allowed on Halloween is just not that open-and-shut to me. 

I know this can be a sensitive topic, and I am willing to hear why I may be wrong, or to change aspects of my view, but let's keep try to keep it a civil and productive discussion! "
1,2023-10-25,CMV: psychopaths are just people who refuse to wear social masks,u/canissinac,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17gc8u4/cmv_psychopaths_are_just_people_who_refuse_to/,changemyview,"I believe that the world is full of people that would be considered deranged crazy psychos, but these individuals restrain themselves to act as such only out of (reasonable) fear of the repercussions.

The so called mental illness is more a matter of self control. Being ""crazy"" is the standard, whereas being ""normal"" is a pondered decision to act according to social norms. 

In the past the stigma of craziness was meant to discourage certain behaviors, now it has become more of an alibi to escape repobsabilities and in some cases it is even glamourized.

""Craziness"" is part of human nature and society is a construct that goes against it. But in the evaluation of pros and cons, it is better to give up the first rather than the second. 

I'm not saying such behaviours have to be promoted, but they should simply be honestly acknowledged for what they really are and not alienated from ourselves."

There is no chance you’ll ever get me to support term limits personally. Please change my view in that I currently believe that people who support this position are inherently less intelligent than other people. 

Like, if you think limiting SCOTUS justice’s term is a good idea, I think you are a moron. 

I found this opinion because, on its face, anyone should be able to deduce that lifetime appointments for SCOTUS and other high courts is obviously a good thing. This is true for many reasons, three of which scream out to me. The obviousness of one simple reason is why I believe that anyone who supports justice term limits is a fool, duped by modern extremist propaganda. Please change this view. 

Reason: Political Quarantine. Federal Judges and Justices are lawyers, not politicians. They do not represent constituents, they don’t fight for Americans, nor should they. Their duty is fidelity to the law and their interpretation of the law. They ought to hold *no other loyalties.* 

This is why they are appointed (as an aside, I think judicial elections are just as asinine, but that’s neither here nor there). Your elected executive appoints your judicial officers by a wise design. Government is political, obviously. This fact is inescapable, eternal, and immutable. Judges are political entities, and we cannot avoid a judges’ ideological perspective from creeping into their rulings. 

Still, the system works to limit this political taint in effectuating a stable rule of law as opposed to rule of force/personality. Judges are politically quarantined from politics insofar that they need not campaign. 

If we imposed term limits on judges, then the political quarantine would evaporate. Judges would rule, not based on what the law is, but based on what is popular with people in their districts. The justice system would be even more political, unpredictable, and unfair. Judges would be ruled by the pressure to release popular rulings with their base instead of correct ones. 

Judges who have lifetime terms have *zero* incentive to issue rulings based on the political leanings of their political masters/party bosses. That’s the point of lifetime appointments. 

There are other reasons, but this is the most obvious and salient reason which justifies lifetime appointments. Moreover this is the reason which leads me to question the intelligence of anyone who advocates for judicial term limits. Usually their argument is to make courts *less* political, but this argument is silly because anyone with an understanding of reality *should* recognize the opposite would happen. 

TL:DR: supporters of term limits are dumb because they lack the critical thinking necessary to realize that imposing term limits on judges would make them *even* more political and less neutral, impartial, and political."

Even though I was raised socially conservative( don't care about politics), I don't care about how someone chooses to live their life as long as it does not have any impact on me. I think if a person what to kill their baby that's inside them then it has nothing to do with me. I am not responsible for them nor am I responsible for their child so I don't care about abortion. I find my conservative family members and friends wanting me to denouce abortion and then theres my liberal friends who think I should support it, I Just Don't Care.  Abortion is killing a baby just like throwing out under cooked bread into the garbage means to distroyed bread. Idk if that makes any sense but I guess I have a laissez faire point of view towards life ( still dont care about politcs), I don't care about what people do as long as myself nor my loved ones are hurt.

1,2023-10-25,CMV: Corporal punishment isn't as bad as people make it out to be,u/Formal-Jump-8903,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17gfdxt/cmv_corporal_punishment_isnt_as_bad_as_people/,changemyview,"Alright, title is pretty baity so let me explain.

I'm a 24M from the bible belt of America (the south). First off, I'd like to begin with the fact that I've done little research on this topic. My view/opinion is strictly from being raised in the bible belt / southern U.S. and my experience as well as the opinion and experiences of my peers. Call it indoctrination, call it geographical/cultural relativism. Call it whatever you want. I'm just giving you the backstory for the opinion alright?

Anyways, I was raised by a loving and excellent mother and father. Love them to death and are excellent parents to this day and I have always had a great relationship with them.  But, just because they were loving, doesn't mean they weren't strict. I got spanked from about 5 years old till the age of 13 from my parents and got paddled in school until ninth grade. 

I was disciplined for many things and I'll name a few:

If I got paddled at school that always meant I would get spanked when I got home. If I wanted to act an ass at school then I would pay the price at school and pay double at home. Learned to stop showing my ass in public. I was still allowed to be myself and be a kid, but you learn to stop doing the things you obviously aren't supposed to do.

If I had anything less than a B on my report card then I would get spanked. My father knew that I had potential academically and didn't settle for mediocrity and wasting that potential. Learned to apply myself in school and was high honor roll from 3rd - 12'th grade. 

If I directly disobeyed my parents orders, and that resulted in something that warranted more than a timeout/grounding, I would get spanked. If my parents told me to go to bed at 9, and caught me awake at 9:30 then they wouldn't spank me obviously. But if they told me ""don't play with fire"" and then I caught something valuable on fire, then I'd get spanked. Learned to respect authority and there's probably a reason they tell me these things and they aren't doing it to ""just be mean"" like all kids think. 

If I was ever a bully to another kid or purposely caused physical harm to anyone for any reason except self defense, I got spanked. Learned that it doesn't feel good to get hurt, so stopped hurting other people.

I got paddled and whooped for a lot of things, but never got one I didn't deserve.

Here's my point. I was raised this way and so was quite literally everyone I know. And we all turned out perfectly fine. Well, as fine as anyone can be I reckon. Obviously I'm not saying corporal punishment turned us into perfect role model citizens but everyone turned out alright in the grand scheme of things. And, in my uneducated opinion, turned out better than most people who didn't receive corporal punishment growing up. 

You can always tell which kids get properly disciplined and which one's don't. If you can't tell when they're kids then you can almost always tell when they are adults. Kids that get disciplined show respect, act as kids should without being literal devils, you're fine with being around them, etc. Kids that don't get disciplined show no respect, cuss out teachers, you can't wait to get away from the kid, etc. Obviously there are exceptions to every case. I'm not saying that getting spanked turns everyone into a perfect person; and I'm not saying that kids who don't get disciplined have no hope and will be dredges of society. I'm not saying that at all. But, what I am saying, is you can almost always tell which kids get disciplined and which ones don't. And I'm willing to bet you'd rather be around the kids that do than the kids that don't. 

How is grounding or a timeout or something like that a proper punishment for bullying? How is it a proper punishment for hurting someone physically or emotionally? If you had told 8 year old me that I could keep throwing mulch at people on the playground, and the only punishment was a pussy ass time out, I never would have stopped throwing mulch. 

So why is there such a negative stigma around it? It was a form of discipline for a majority of civilized human history and only recently has it basically become non-existent. If it didn't work I'm sure we would've stopped it many many years ago. I really don't care what John Doe at Dicknuts University has to say in his case study or whatever. No case study in the history of this has ever effected anyone I've known, anyone I do know, or anyone I will know. This is something I personally believe a case study can't describe or ""fix"". If a kid got whooped and grew up to be a school shooter... I'm willing to bet he was fucked from the start. The discipline along the way didn't make him evil. He was probably evil or misunderstood from the jump. It's the way life has always worked and always will work. There's good people, and there's not so good people. I doubt a spanking as a kid was the straw that broke the camels back I mean let's just be realistic. 

Side note: Obviously if someone who is a hateful piece of shit is just hitting their kid to hit their kid then that's something completely different. That's evil. I'm not talking about evil. I'm talking about disciplining with good intentions and doing it so your kids will realize their mistakes and become a better person."

Neuropsychology is a variant of psychology but it's the hard science variant. In psychology a doctor might tell you how sad are you from 1-10 and the number you can give is arbitrary then they attempt to work off that flawed data/premise. 


At least with neuropsychology they can measure brain damage on FMRI and what not and see if its manifesting a neurological behavior issue making the data much more solid and empirical. So instead of asking how sad someone is they can ask questions like how damaged is the frontal lobe of the brain and answer it using measuring apparatuses instead of asking someone to essentially give a random arbitrary number which could change minute to minute, day to day. 


I doubt most people will be able to change my view on this but you can give it a shot because a lot of people are divided on the topic and many people feel the same way on this topic that I do.


It's hard to see Psychology as a real hard science when it doesn't even properly adhere to the scientific method making it a completely flawed academic discipline. It's subjective and any Psychology experiment ever done can never be 100 percent replicatable or certain since you will always get widely different results even if you follow the experiments as faithful as possible. 


Replication is a keystone to science so if you can't replicate something logically it isn't science since science is basically a methodology or framework and a discipline has to check all the right box's for it to be hard science which Psychology doesn't do. 


Therefore psychology seems like a grift that makes therapists and psychiatrists so much money while the people they ""treat"" aren't any closer to solving their depression or problems."

But at the same time, I can't help but admire their strong self-control and self-discipline.

I'm not addicted to meat in the same way that a smoker is addicted to cigarettes or an alcoholic is addicted to beer, but I would have a hard time putting off meat forever. I can go a meal or two without meat, but sooner or later I'm adding meat or some sort of animal product (i.e., eggs) to my meals. The idea of eating nothing but plant-based food is rather hard for me to accept.

Objectively speaking, meat consumption is also often bad for the body (such as red meat's heme leading to colon cancer, processed meats leading to heart disease/cancer, etc.), and the meat industry also generates far more carbon emissions than plant food does. If someone's diet is 100% fruit and vegetables, they are certainly likelier to have a healthier body than someone who eats lots of meat.

Now, I do wish sometimes vegans/vegetarians would be a bit less preachy, especially the PETA types. But I can't deny that, like someone slimming down a hundred pounds or kicking a bad habit, that vegans and vegetarians have very strong self-control - something that I could certainly use more of. I've tried going flexitarian/temporarily-vegetarian in the past, but it didn't' last long.

So yes, my viewpoint as a non-vegetarian person is that vegetarians may be annoying, but they have great self-discipline and self-control, something we could all use more of.

I am wholly Asian and wholly American, yet I interact with people from various different cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds on a daily basis. Racial tribalism would be the exact opposite, sticking to one's own racial or cultural group and interacting with people from other racial or cultural groups as minimally as possible, or not at all. As an Asian American, I think my racial group (at least where I live in San Diego) is well integrated with the rest of American society and have friends of many different races or cultural backgrounds. However, it pisses me off that many younger Asian Americans also often defend racial tribalism (which I've witnessed frequently), just because their parents did it despite the fact they don't really engage in racial tribalism themselves. Racial tribalism harms society and us individually, and I'll delve into both here:

Firstly, racial tribalism is a severe impediment to social cohesion. If we try to interact with each other as little as possible, how can we cooperate, innovate, or progress? We become unable to address and fix problems together as a society because of our balkanization. The only way to get shit done is to unite. It also certainly leads to ""othering"" and stereotypes, which are the first steps towards full blown racism. What is especially hypocritical is that the same Asian Americans who defend racial tribalism also complain when we get stereotyped or people are uneducated about our culture. The Nazis and imperial Japanese were racial tirbalists, though of course at a scale not present today. But of course, they didn't start out at that scale either... We become ignorant of the other side, which is especially said to see as I love engaging with and interacting with different cultures. It is very enriching and you learn a lot.

Additionally, it can inhibit us individually. When we (I don't mean specifically Asians, I mean ""we"" just as a pronoun) ""other"" other races, then they will ""other"" us back. This can negatively impact people emotionally. Also, when we interact with as many people as possible regardless of race, our social networking and opportunities increase as a result.

Of course this isn't to mean people can't want to spend time with people of a similar culture, but they should feel comfortable interacting with a larger multiracial society as a whole. I can understand how many groups such as the Chinese, Blacks, Italians, Irish, Jews, Mexicans, Japanese, Arabs, etc were forced to tribalize in the past (in American history), but now is a different time and America is the greatest melting pot in the world and we should not take it for granted."

When people say ""free palestine"" what exactly do they expect to achieve as a practical solution?

Ignoring the antiSemitism people who say ""just get rid of all the 9 milion Israelis"". some offer a 2 states solution but there are 2 big problems with this

1) expecting 4.5 milion jews to leave their homes cities and move to the other half of the country is just stupid (imagine you had to move like that). and that is just the citizens thats not even taking about all the buildings roads structures that are worth not milion but billions of dollars all of that decades of hard work that Israeli people build and own and land just give away like that for free it doesn't work again imagine you had to leave like that your home country. I don't agree that Palestines were pushed out years ago but that doesn't mean it's ok to do it again in Israel with a much bigger population. 70 years ago a 2 state solution could have worked but today its just not possible

2) if you read point 1 and still think that giving half of Israel is ok lets try looking at a different country with a similar situation: the USA does Not belong to Americans by the ""free palestine"" logic it belongs to native Americans. so if we ""free palestine"" we should also ""free America"" and give half of it back to native Americans. and force half of the 330+ milion Americans to leave their homes and move to the other side of the country same with Canada Australia and New Zealand. all are colonised countries that belong to the native people there but of course no one is going around saying ""free USA/Canada/Australia/new Zealand"" and if you say that ""those countries are different because it happened along time ago"". Israel officialy existed for over 70 and has built many cities and many people were born Israeli citizens and according to the world happiness report is even happier than those countries (Israel is 4# for 2023). thats not the same as just starting colonisation heck Israel has a larger population than new Zealand so if you are so concerned about giving land back to native populations new Zealand would be much easier to give back to its native people.

I’m talking about situations where the guilt is 100% certain. Not even a drop of doubt about if the person is guilty or not. I.e., caught on camera, undeniable evidence, admission of guilt, etc. Let me give an example below. 

Someone murders a police officer, it is literally caught on body cam. They did it without a doubt. Why do we not just speed along the process and execute the person pretty much immediately? (Assuming of course the death penalty applies in that jurisdiction). Someone like that wouldn’t deserve a lifetime of filing appeals and wasting taxpayer $$ housing them.

Another great example is terrorists, or school shooters. 

 I can’t seem to find a logical thought process to keeping people like this alive for many years just so they can continue filing appeals and living on the dime of the taxpayer. CMV!"
1,2023-10-25,CMV: it doesn't make sense how much people focus on trying to get relationships,u/TouristFew4907,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17gke8k/cmv_it_doesnt_make_sense_how_much_people_focus_on/,changemyview,"I really don't get why people focus so much on dating.

They act like their life is unfulfilled and pointless, and get sad about it.

But I really don't see there being much benefits from being in a relationship, especially considering cheating, breakups, arguments, and feeling sad after the breakup seem to be a common occurrence with relationships. Most people desperately trying to be in a relationship should really stop being obsessed with it, and shouldn't spend so much time trying to find a girlfriend/boyfriend.

Simply put, I don't see much benefits of a relationship that should justify spending so much time. I think it's either because of a culture thing, or some arbitrary reason."
1,2023-10-25,"CMV: The Two State Solution has died but it wasn't Hamas or the IDF that killed it, it was the response of other Arab governments",u/laurenannie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17gkjxl/cmv_the_two_state_solution_has_died_but_it_wasnt/,changemyview,"So Queen Rania's incredibly poorly thought out interview with CNN yesterday really solidified my thoughts over the past two weeks that the two state solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict is pretty much completely dead, but it wasn't the terror attacks of 10/7 or the IDF response that killed it, but really the response from other Arab governments and the wider Arab world. 

My thought process goes like this. When Hamas carried out its horrific attacks on 10/7 something I found really troubling was the lack of condemnation of Hamas from the Arab world. They didn't even have to say anything nice about Israel. I'm not going to pretend Israel treats Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank well; Israel has done terrible things there. But it seemed to me all that needed to be said was ""Hamas is a terrorist organization who doesn't represent Palestinian civilians. Their actions were reprehensible."" That's it. End of statement. Less is more. When the IDF began bombing Gaza, that statement could have easily been parlayed into ""What's happening is a terrible tragedy. Innocent civilians are dying due the actions of a few. These innocent people do not deserve to die.""

But they went a different way, basically issuing a variety of statements about how this was an expected and legitimate reaction to Israeli actions. Instead of taking the opportunity to separate the Palestinian cause from Hamas' actions, they either implied or directly stated Hamas was a legitimate resistance force and what they did was understandable and justifiable.  While the US was trying to distance the cause of the Palestinians gaining their own state from Hamas, Arab governments actively worked against that proposition. The result being that Joe Biden, who publicly supported a Palestinian state and their right to self determination, was put in situation where it had to be Hamas or Israel. It was kind of like ""We can't really defend shooting babies in their cribs, so if we have to pick, Israel I guess?""

This continued after the IDF began their air campaign against Gaza. I admit I find it difficult to know what to believe here. I understand Israel's position that Hamas keeps its weapons and infrastructure in civilian targets so they become legitimate targets for air strikes and that as awful as it is, mistakes happen and sometime buildings get bombed that weren't the actual target. I also understand that even if there some militants and infrastructure in these buildings there is also a lot of innocent people in those buildings who have done nothing wrong and their deaths are horrible. I could see someone saying, ""Yes Hamas is in those buildings doing terrible things but we need to find a way to stop them that doesn't involve risking the lives of innocent people."" Instead it's ""Israel has no right to self defense and they have no right to try and take out the organization targeting their citizens because they colonized the land in the first place.""

Bringing us to the absolutely awful Queen Rania interview which, yes, has been grossly mischaracterized in a lot of media outlets. She shamed Western media for having a double standard and only calling out crimes against Israel and not Palestinians, when anyone can log onto her Instagram page or Twitter and clearly see stayed completely silent on October 7th, and that she herself only calls out violence against one side. Sure, there are some political considerations there, I understand Israel is incredibly unpopular in Jordan and it's understandable that she may not want to cause issues with her subjects by saying anything. But then why go to a Western media outlet and give an interview, ostensibly aimed towards Westerners, shaming them for not living up to a standard she doesn't seem to hold herself to?  And I can't understand the Arab obsession with the fact that babies were apparently only killed in ways that didn't consist of beheading. When babies and children and the elderly and totally innocent people just living their lives are gunned down by machine gun fire, burned alive, bound and have parts of their body cut off, etc. etc. the fact that one story about a certain method of being slaughtered didn't turn out to be true is not a trump card. Do they honestly think it's a good idea to harp on the fact that traumatized people who watched their neighbors and friends die and traumatized first responders who walked into homes to find massacres didn't perfectly articulate how the slaughter happened?

It seems like other Arab governments are intent on giving a masterclass on how to NOT gain sympathy or popular support for their cause. I realize they might honestly not care what the Western world thinks. But I don't think that an independent Palestinian state could ever happen without US and European support, and that support has been absolutely eviscerated over the last two weeks; but it didn't have to be this way. The Arab world had an opportunity to draw attention to the plight of Palestinian civilians and garner sympathy for the terrible quagmire they are in, but absolutely squandered it in the worst possible way.

Stores may open and close at different times, people may take different lunch breaks, or any multitude of reasons could shift the schedule. Using either time zones or Zulu time, you still have to inquire about schedules, but with Zulu you just don't have to convert.

Switching to UTC means worldwide clocks are the same, and people's schedules are converted while retaining same daylight hours. The day of the week changes along with UTC I suppose."

We need to cut down oil consumption domestically. This isn't theoretical, we have a real life example of this during covid, [gasoline consumption fell 40%](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46141) and gasoline was the cheapest it had been in over a decade even before accounting for inflation. 

Supply is not really an issue, America is a net petroleum exporter, it's not a question of local supply and import costs like Europe. Although those figures are often misleading because there are different types/grades of oil used for different things (diesel or jet fuel, vs gas for example) foreign gasoline that is imported to be refined then exported to a third country, etc, so that figure isn't as cut and dry as it sounds to a layman. But if we want to leverage our large supply of petroleum to have low gas prices, we want to create an environment where O&G are desperate to sell their oil at any price they can get for it, not by tons of people bidding it up.

If we want to decrease Oil prices, we should encourage alternatives that reduce the demand, everybody talks about increasing supply, but OPEC will increase the price of oil as they see fit regardless of what we do, we should limit our exposure to oil. We want only the lowest overhead, most efficient wells to be profitable, there is no cheap gas when it is still economically viable to have offshore wells, and refine low quality oil like Western Canadian Select or other heavy sour crude oils to meet demand.

We should:

* Encourage work from home policies at workplaces around the country.

* Increase the usage of public transportation, increase frequency, encourage dense development in growing cities that make driving not a necessity, not every city will become New York City, but if half the new developments in Atlanta or Austin had the density of Allentown, Pennsylvania and busses every 10 minutes (so that people actually *use them*), it would save a hell of a lot of car trips. Economies of scale inherent to public transportation would mean this would be cheaper for the end user, even considering taxes, than car ownership. Especially since insurance rates are through the roof. There's a reason there are so many influencers and media personalities that talk about living in New York, Chicago, DC, and compared to Houston. Many people like dense, walkable cities, and if we can just give more people who already *want* to live in one the ability to do so, that would save a lot of miles driven. There's a reason NYC has the lowest carbon emissions per capita despite being a place with more billionaires than anywhere else.

* Of course, not everyone can take public transportation, and for those who *are* buying new cars, we should encourage EV adoption, yes some apartments aren't set up, yes, if you drive 500 miles in a day, they won't work, but for most people, it will. This would again decrease oil demand, and thus should decrease prices for those who still use gasoline/diesel vehicles.


Oil is a global market, so if we decrease demand locally, likely a lot would be exported, however, our two neighbors Mexico and Canada, both of whom have pipelines into this country to sell oil, are net oil exporters so that is unlikely to have the effect of replacing domestic demand. We could always export to China or other countries with significantly more local demand than supply, but then we'd be competing on the global market [with over a dozen countries with lower production costs than us,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/597669/cost-breakdown-of-producing-one-barrel-of-oil-in-the-worlds-leading-oil-producing-countries/) but wouldn't they just shut down wells? [Not to the degree you may think, for many oil producers, even if a well is unprofitable, it makes more sense to keep extracting oil because of their fixed costs](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/839851865/why-the-world-is-still-pumping-so-much-oil-even-as-demand-drops-away).

If we want to oil oil prices, we should do whatever we can to bring demand down to what it was 3 years ago without affecting the average citizens quality of life. This means creating artificial demand destruction."

A shy girl also signal she may be more loyal because less able to socialise .

Most guys are repulsed by very confident women because they think she is more likely to leave them or cheat , nevermind the fights they may have .

Does women want a confident guy because they want to feel feminine and protected around them?

I never saw a women saying she wants a shy guy ever but guys wants the shy innocent girl who doesn t have any friends

Also this thing can be seen even in other studies.

A men will rather get a gf who work at McDonald and it s cute , loyal looking than a women who is rich and a lawyer.

However the idea of establishing a safe haven on a piece of land due to anscestory is questionable at best, especially when the land requires a form of reconquering.

If the Jewish people want a safe homeland they could establish it anywhere, especially as historically the Jewish people were wandering nomads, originating from 12 tribes who did not have a homeland but lived as desert nomads in bedouin style tents.

Zionism emphasises the geographic location, but there is plenty of space in the world to establish a new nation, or processes to go about such a feat similar to how the Khalistan movement for Sikhs is doing referendums to build up popular consensus, rather than just taking the land."

These individuals are the kind who see the world as 'out of control', but the problem is, I realise I too, seem to be of this mindset. I find the world an enormously disconcerting, overwhelming, confusing place, in relation to the fact that so many of us (myself included) are born with 'infringements' such as Autism, Bipolar Disorder or (to a more extreme extent) Schizophrenia. Those of us in the Autism Spectrum definitely have our brains wired differently, at times it can feel almost like this to a radical extent; we have a different way of formulating things in our head, social cues we struggle with, and we are vulnerable to what one would call 'sensory overload', a problem that doesn't really affect 'neurotypicals' in the same way. Now, we hear that having these individuals in society (myself included) is positive because if we were 'all the same, it would be boring', but seriously why would that be a bad thing. A lot of inventors/innovators have been Autistic, but a lot HAVEN'T as well, and they only represent a tiny % of the population. I can't detract the thought that Autism is just a primarilily 'inbred' trait, that has survived in the human gene pool because our ancestors were too f\*\*\*ing selfish to just resign themselves from the gene pool. It is an unfair roll of the dice that so many who are born with these traits are consigned to a life that is stressful and lonely. I also feel that at the end of the day, we are an absolute burden on society; think of how annoying it is to have a % of the population that will just get 'wound up' in a social setting, annoying everyone else around them.

The past few months have seen a surge in discussions related to race, racism, and related topics - like -cultural appropriation in this subreddit. I believe that this increase is connected to the upcoming 2024 U.S. election and the influence of Russian troll farms. In this post, I'd like to explore this theory and consider whether it holds water.  
The Russian Troll Farm Influence  
It's not a secret that Russia has been involved in shaping public opinion on social media platforms, particularly during U.S. elections. Russian troll farms have been known to create and amplify divisive content to sow discord among Americans. Given their history, it's not entirely far-fetched to think that they might be behind the increase in posts on these sensitive topics.  
Why Race-Related Posts?  
Race is a highly divisive and emotionally charged topic, making it an attractive subject for those seeking to divide and polarize society. Russian troll farms could exploit this division for several reasons:  
Create Chaos: By fueling the racial divide, they can create chaos and instability in the U.S., which may weaken the country on the international stage.  
Foment Distrust: Inflaming racial tensions can erode trust within communities, institutions, and the government, which can make the population more susceptible to disinformation campaigns.  
Affect Voter Turnout: Diverting attention from other key issues to race can potentially impact voter turnout and, consequently, election outcomes.  
Amplify Extremism: Promoting extreme viewpoints on race can push people to the fringes, making political compromise and cooperation more challenging.

I am open to change my view on this, however, I feel after 2016 Russia is making another concerted effort in the runup to the 2024 election to divide us; the uptick in these types of post in this subreddit is part of that."

The initial 1947 plan was to split the territory between the Arabs who were under british occupation and the jewish community, which had grown larger over the previous century (fleeing persecution in Europe), and to give both peoples a state. The Jewish community, who were looking to essentially establish a state in their ancestral homeland (a successful land-back movement by all definitions) agreed, as that was what they had come for, but the Arabs wanted the whole region and attacked. 

Since then, there have been MANY attempts at peace and offering the Palestinians a state ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian\_peace\_process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process)), but the Palestinians do not want a two-state solution, they want the whole region, 'from the river to the sea', and will not compromise so long as any plan includes an Israeli state. 

Now, with everything going on, it seems unlikely many Palestinians or Israelis are happy with a two-state solution, both want the destruction of the other because both see the other as an existential threat (there's a lot to unpack there, and not all of either group feel this way, obviously, but these sentiments have certainly increased in the wake of the current war. Anything offered, any deal brokered that requires both parties to agree, *will not go through*. The Palestinians will not change their century-long position now, and Israel's government is currently a bunch of far right wack jobs who actually do hate Palestinians. 

I think that the only way to solve this is to impose a solution upon them. I know that's undemocratic and sounds odd, but there needs to be peace and both parties involved in the fighting will not come to any conclusion. There needs to be some sort of (maybe) UN resolution that draws borders, sets up terms and conditions for what is allowed to the Palestinians (not a military, surely, but a sovereign state with internationally recognized hard borders), and this needs to be *TOLD* to both parties, not offered to them. I think the initial reaction would be outrage from both sides, Israelis for the land they have to cede and Palestinians for 'western powers imposing on them' and for being forced to normalise a relationship with Israel, but I am so certain that in 5 years time, even, there would be so much less conflict.

I'm not suggesting that she lacks hard work or talent, because she certainly has plenty of both. However, I can't shake the feeling that a team of marketing experts has carefully constructed a public image for her that's designed to influence people's views in a specific direction. 

The way her image is presented makes it seem like she's the most interesting and talented artist out there, but I personally don't find her to be that compelling. Again, this is not to discredit her work ethic or achievements in the music industry. She's made a significant impact, and that's not easy to do. However, it's crucial to remember that there are many tools and techniques in marketing that can make someone appear to be more than they actually are. 

It's as if her team is using psychological tactics to almost brainwash the general public into believing she's the epitome of what a pop star should be. They know how to push the right buttons to get people talking about her, from viral social media campaigns to strategic collaborations with other high-profile artists. All of these elements come together to create a larger-than-life persona that people can't help but be drawn to, even if it might not be a full representation of who she actually is. So, while I don't hate Taylor Swift or deny her hard work, I do question how much of the hype around her is genuine and how much is manufactured."

He is being fined $1000.

$1000 seems too high for such a misdeed.  Fines should be as low as possible while still deterring bad behavior, and pulling fire alarms in Congress is super uncommon.  This is happening way less often than once a year, which I'd consider an acceptable rate, so the fine should be lowered.  

I understand that this may be a bigger problem in schools, so I don't have a problem keeping the fine high in schools, but outside that special case, we should lower the fine.  I think $100 would be an adequate deterrent."

I understand saying these things isn't going to do anything to help resolve the situation. They are just expressing themselves and trying to show empathy which I have a hard time see why people are so offended by that. Is the expectation no one should say anything unless they have a direct plan to address these problems?

To me it's like getting angry at someone for wishing good luck for an interview or get well soon to a sick person and saying ""your words mean nothing I don't want your wishes"". to me that is a pointless and rude comment.

Almost seems like misguided anger since so many emotion go on when people hear about these tragedies but it just seems strange to me that people are so offended by people trying to express  for a tragic situation.

All that being said I think bashing people for saying thoughts and prayers and similar is even less useful than the person making the wishes.

Its is the last resort of the Jewish people who were ""cleaned"" out of almost every country you can imagine (yes yours - research it). 

Now regardless of who is right or wrong between Israel and Palestine, both claiming ancestry roots in the land (also Muslims know that Jews live in this land). 

I am getting a LOT of criticism from people from actual colonialist countries, whos bloody campaigns of conquest and genocide around the world still funds their economy today... I find it absurd ridicules and now dangerous - as it least to flue antisemitism and justification of attacks on Israel. . 

So here are a few points to consider - 

In the history that we know (and we may not know it all) - Jews, unlike Christians and Muslims have NOT been on a colonizing conquest of land or of converting others. 

Please just take a look at the world map. Look at your country. Look at Arab countries. Consider history. 

Can you still argue that Jews or Zionism is colonialism?

The problem is, **these fans are often referring to instances where the player was in fact, actually, committing a blatant violation of the rules.**

What these sports fans are saying, then, is that *they want the officiating crew to deliberately turn a blind eye to a certain amount of clear fouls for the sake of ""not bogging down the game's flow.""* They're saying, for instance, that if a team commits 10 fouls, they want referees to only call 3 or 5 of them.

I would argue that such a stance would actually do **more** harm to the game. If you send a message to players that ""We'll allow a certain amount of rule violation,"" then players will deliberately try to get in the maximum amount of fouling that they think they can get away with.

Of course, this only applies in cases of clear fouls - if an action is in that grey area where the refs can't quite decide whether it warrants a flag/whistle/penalty or not, I'd argue that it should be allowed to slide. But if teams commit 40 clear and obvious violations in a game, then the referee should penalize 40 times. To do so otherwise would undermine the game's integrity."

Arab states are perhaps the most vocal when it comes to condemning israel on the conflict. While they are right to do that as israel aggressive policies have led to  thousands of deaths and worsened living conditions for the palestinians , it is very crucial for the world to understand that israel has no choice in executing these aggressive policies. If they hold back hamas will survive and might do something even worse than October 7. But if they don't palestinians will die. Israel has been pushed to the breaking point now , it must prioritize its existence and its people over the ones next to it. The ones who will likely end up causing more problems after they get a free state. So innocents will die and israel is not wrong in razing gaza. So if the arabs states who truly care about the lives of the palestinians they must therefore take them as religiously they are brothers and sisters. Now that has once happened and led to black september however , arabs argue that those palestinians in gaza are innocent civilions who don't support hamas or at least aren't related to hamas's activities in israe. If thats the case if arabs believe that they are humans just like them than take them in. They are afterall one of the arabs. They share faith and culture. If this actually happens , israel can flatten out hamas and clear the smoke on the conflict. Hopefully then bringing peace and ending the suffering.

Obviously Europe will not and should not take them , Refugees have already traumatized europeans enough and moreover the palestinians will integrate better in the middle east.

Just to be clear that if israel had intended on wiping the palestinians out they would've but it is not the palestinians that are their enemy. Its hamas , the terrorist organization that drools to kill jews and israelis. Unfortunately Hamas hides behind their civilians , not giving a smudge about their lives and lives to fight another day in their anti semtic nihilistic endeavor. If Israel wanted to perhaps it could wiped the palestinians out decades ago but it didn't recognizing the human lives that live their despite their differences and historical anguish towards each other. But no they didn't , they refused to commit genocide and so far they have been only attacking hamas who hides under civilians so its not israel that willingly wants to disintegrate its different neighbor.

What do you guys think? Give me a new perspectve on this and give me new facts cause I don't think israel is wrong , they are just helpless.

I state though that sexuality tends to be confusing due to a belief that ""God"" wants us to be wives to men and husband to women <- note the plurality in that statement.

My earliest childhood memory has a belief that God wants us to procreate man and woman and that is the purpose of our sexual expression - and that sexual expression without the intent to practice co-creation is flawed: i.e. gay sex, masturbation, and all types of sex that doesn't revolve around the ritual of co-creating life.

I personally believe that the need for a nation to create humans create a natural force...a pressure... that forces us to adhere to heterosexual normatively, and that we opt out unconsciously from exploring our sexuality early due to the need for our supergo to feel safe within societal expectations.

My statement of ""sexuality becoming confusing"" is because I see people, including myself, trying to break away from boxes yet find ourselves in a wider box, only to one day find ourselves having to fight to be free from that wider box one day - in my opinion.

My statement of ""because of American standards"" is because we use english words that are defined predominately in the American mindset

and my statement of ""...around adhering to biblical principles"" is because I see we're often times attempting to avoid ""hell"" and ""God's lack of love"" when exporing our own sexuality.

I'm curious if sexuality is confusing because of this, or if I've narrowed my scope to think it's only an ""American attempt at adhering to the Bible"" when the confusion has been proven or seen to be much grander than that."

**Example Scenario**

1. Friend **A** and Friend **B** decide to play a game of basketball and the winner gets $10. 

2. Friend **A** wins the game but Friend **B** says ""double or nothing"". 

3. Friend **B** wins the second game. 

**My viewpoint:** Friend **B** should get $20 from Friend **A**

**Alternate interpretation #1 that's frequently used:** ""Double or nothing"" means doubling the original bet amount for game 2. This would mean Friend **B** goes home with $10 after game 2. After losing game 1, Friend **B** has $-10 so when he says double or nothing he wants to double the original bet amount to $20 as winnings for game 2. When Friend **B** wins game 2 he gets $20 from Friend **A** but since he owes Friend **A** $10 from game 1 he walks away with $10 total ($-10 game 1 + $20 game 2 = $10 net). And if Friend **A** had also won game 2, he would get $10 from game 1 and $20 from game 2 = $30 total. *This interpretation doesn't embody double or nothing because there isn't a ""nothing"" result at the end. Every scenario leaves one person with a loss and one person with a gain.*

**Alternate interpretation #2 that's frequently used:** ""Double or nothing"" would mean Friend **B** has technically cancelled out his debt from the first game. Friend **B** had $-10 after game 1 because he lost but challenges Friend **A** to play **another** game enticing him with the chance to possibly double his winnings to $20 total. Since Friend **B** won game 2 he wins $10 essentially zero-ing out his loss from game 1. If Friend **A** won game 2 then he would have $20 and Friend **B** would have $-20. *This interpretation is barely worth even playing, Friend **B** already lost so he's probably more likely to lose again (skill based game, not chance). The chance to negate his $10 bet is too risky when he could be out $20, the loser would rarely enact the double or nothing game with such a non-enticing reward. The winner would be more than happy to offer to play double or nothing knowing they'll probably win another $10 and worst case scenario go home with no losses either.*


The key assumption people don't realize is that double or nothing does not mean the ""bet/game"" is over and now you're playing a second game (Both alternative viewpoints assume this). 

When you say double or nothing, it's a high risk high reward strategy which **EXTENDS** the ""bet/game"". When you invoke the rule of double or nothing, you're basically saying let's have a round 2 which will decide the actual winner. No money has been lost or won at the end of round 1. If Friend **A** accepts the double or nothing challenge then they've forfeited their $10 winnings from game 1 for the chance to win double the money ($20). This means when Friend **B** wins game 2, they go home with $20 from Friend **A** since  game 2 ultimately decides the winner irregardless of who won game 1. If Friend **A** wins game 2 as well, they get $20. It's technically a worse bet for Friend **A** to take since they can only win $10 more dollars but possibly lose $20. But they already won once so the chances are in their favor  that they can win again but the key point is that they can make the choice to decline the double or nothing challenge. It's not supposed to be a fair balanced bet, it's high risk high reward. Obviously if Friend **A** barely won game 1 or got lucky then it would be dumb to accept the double or nothing challenge. So if you think alternative interpretation #1 or #2 is the correct way, it's not nearly as bad of a bet since the worst case scenario for Friend **A** losing game 2 is either $0 (#1) in winnings or $-10 (#2).  

I am open to changing my view if someone can show me a way of using ""double or nothing"" that makes sense logically and is also something people would be happy to use. I was the odd one out in my friend group with my viewpoint so I know I'm already the minority but if you can explain why ""double or nothing"" should be taken literally or what the real ""spirit"" of double or nothing is, I will change the way I bet with friends for the rest of my life."
1,2023-10-26,CMV: Keeping mementos/pictures of exes as memories doesn't make sense and feels wrong once in a new relationship,u/ThePhraustyOne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17h9pda/cmv_keeping_mementospictures_of_exes_as_memories/,changemyview,"I didn't realize how many people did this. I was talking to a couple of friends and they keep mementos of all of their exes. Even the horrible ones. This seemed so strange and still doesn't make sense to me even though I looked into it and didn't realize how many people do the same.

My one friend said she keeps pictures of her with an ex and it baffled me because of how badly she hates him. Like most relationships I'm sure they had some good times, but apparently it was mostly toxic. They were together for a few years and she did love him but the guy was a complete narcissist. The relationship was full of manipulation, emotional/mental abuse, cheating, lying, etc. She even said he gave her PTSD. I've heard NOTHING good about this guy. She says she was young and naive. At this point she wouldn't care if he disappeared. Yet she says she keeps pictures of them together because you only have one life and he is a part of her past.

This was so baffling to me. I went through a toxic relationship that was pretty bad on and off for 7 years. We even went through a heartbreaking event together. I ended up having to go to therapy to sort my head afterwards and unwind the damage that relationship caused. This was 12 years ago so I'm way over it yet I still would never want any mementos of that relationship even though she was my ""first love"".

Whenever I've gone through a breakup I've gotten rid of every reminder. Maybe not right away because it was hard to do (I wasn't fully over them), but eventually when I was over them I did. Sometimes I kept them because I felt ""guilty"" in a way if I threw it away. Like the empathy in me would make me feel like if they found out I threw it out (a birthday card they wrote in or something), it would make them upset. And there are times I kept something because I liked it at the time. But once I was fully over them and with someone else I never felt like I should put it in a shoebox and keep it.

Half the time I'd forget I hid something a while ago when hurting after the break up like a letter, happen to come by it while cleaning and throw it out. I did love and care about the person at one point. Before I was over them that letter meant a lot to me and would make me feel a certain way. Who knows it possibly still would if I had it. But now that I've accepted the relationship had ended long ago I don't want to bring this along to a future relationship. It feels wrong. I don't go looking for every trace of an ex to throw away but I definitely don't go out of my way to keep anything.

I understand it's your past and people want memories of their past, like pictures with friends or events and such. But if I'm in a new relationship and happy I don't know why I'd ever want to look at pictures of my exes. They are in my past for a reason. Yes there were good times with them. Yes I had memories with them. Yes I had a past before my current relationship. But to me it feels disrespectful to my new s.o. in a way to keep them. Plus I know my s.o. probably wouldn't want to see them either. Even though there was usually someone before you, I'm pretty sure most people don't get thrilled seeing you with an ex."

I’ve heard tales from both liberals and conservatives about being pressured to keep to themselves in political environments that overwhelmingly disagree with them. Here’s my suggestion: move unless you absolutely cannot.

Here’s the thing: you probably won’t make many friends where you’re at, and even if you do, you’ll have to painstakingly avoid talking politics, which will end up coming up at some point. I don’t even want to imagine what will happen next. I’m honestly confused as to why the few remaining Democrats in big Trump areas and Republicans in big urban cores don’t just move to more agreeable areas. Why risk being ostracized within your community?"

I totally disagree with that. Cars are often a necessity that is de facto forced upon people through shitty car-centric design that leaves them with few viable options to get from A to B.   

And because the infrastructure is entirely designed around cars, people think that their car gives them freedom. But being forced into one singular mode of transport just to reasonably get from A to B is the opposite of freedom.    

True freedom is being able to choose between different viable modes of transportation depending on the specific trip you're making.

In my view cheating is almost akin to drug use. For me and most people, they would never consider trying something like cocaine, however, if you start spending time with friends who use it and attend parties where it’s present it’s way more likely to happen. The same is true for cheating in my head. If you find the wrong person and spend too much time in the wrong circumstances it’s way more likely to happen. 

The similarities are similar even in the way I’ve heard people try and explain how to avoid cheating with the famous Nancy Reagan catch phrase “just say no”. 

It just seems obvious to me that your environment shapes the choices you make and this should play a role in deciding what social setting you put yourself in.

So Reddit, please share with me any perspectives you have on this subject so I can incorporate them in my thinking."

When I have tried searching for help on how to resolve this or what we can do it always boils down to asking which person is the antagonist when really I can't think of a time when it wasn't both of us. Even if one person starts it first we are both bad about ending it just as bad as the person who started it. 

 Apparently the internet thinks it can only be one of us that has abusive behavior even though really I think we both make each other miserable equally. Ever since this all started we both knew we needed to do something about it but when I try to find answers as to why it happens and what to do it always comes down to there has to be one person holding power over the other and I don't see where it could only be one of us. Every time I try to find information mutual abuse I'm told it doesn't exist so I really don't even know what to believe at this point but I do believe we make each other equally miserable and both don't know how to change it."

Currently the rules of the House are set by the party leadership Republicans have term limits for committee chairs while the Democrats do not, so all of these reforms are Constitutional, though the 3rd reform would need to be imposed indirectly sort of like how 18 year drinking age was raised to 21 with threat of federal highway funds being withheld to make a national standard.  


1)  By making the positions of leadership [sortition](https://www.wordnik.com/words/sortition), and eliminating the current determinative factor of money raised into leadership PACs, making it near random everyone elected to the House having an equal chance to be Speaker, committee chair, and committee assignments would divorce individual Representatives from their scope of influence every election disincentivizing lobbyists and campaign funders to de facto bribe elected officials - or at the very least dissipate the effect of giving money to specific Representatives. For example Rep. Jones used to get $500k from Industry 'A' because she was the chair on the committee that birthed laws regulating 'A', after the reform Industry 'A' would have to spread their contributions across 435 possible chairpeople who all have equal chance to become that committee chair.   


2) Committee votes are where lobbyists can have a narrow focus on specific language of legislation that is most beneficial to their clients, if the members of the committee is random and the individuals votes on specific motions is anonymous then the members would be more free to vote their conscience and regardless to their public statements vote without any corroboration of how they voted depriving committee members the ability to trade their votes for campaign contributions or any other benefits seeking to influence the legislation. The full floor vote out of committee would still be available to public and that would be where individual Reps be held accountability for their voting record.  


3)  By having every state's delegation be elected at large, where if a state has 3 seats, the entire state's electorate would be free to vote for their preferred candidate and the op 3 vote getters would form the congressional delegation. Parties could run as many candidates as they wanted or just run one candidate (a strategy minor parties might use just to get the minimum vote threshold especially in larger populated states with lowest vote threshold). This is the means of which the Senate is elected in the Philippines but on a national scale not for provinces/state level. Doing this would allow for the voters of the minority party (GOP in CA, NY, IL, MD, MA, & CT, Dems in TX, NC, OH, MS, FL, ID, & UT)  to get some representation as well as eliminate the ability to gerrymander districts and have politicians select their voters rather than have voters elect their politicians. Once elected, the representatives would have more incentive to work on behalf of the entire state rather than just a slim portion of a district's constituency in partisan primaries.  


Whether or not these reforms would be implemented is not what this CMV is about, rather whether or not these reforms are effective at mitigating corruption as defined as elected officials not acting in accordance to the will of their voters."

1,2023-10-27,CMV: We are living in a golden age of music,u/AcephalicDude,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17hqqik/cmv_we_are_living_in_a_golden_age_of_music/,changemyview,"I’ve seen some posts recently both in this sub and in r/LetsTalkMusic where people complain about contemporary music being dumbed down and bad; about how musicianship and songwriting are no longer appreciated; about how X artist’s popularity is merely manufactured and reflects a dying culture; and so on.

 

These posts are invariably made by people who just don’t actually listen to enough music. 

 

**My CMV statement: we are living in a golden age of music and there is plenty of music out there to serve the tastes of literally any person.**

 

Usually when people complain about the state of music, they are actually just complaining about how the trends in mainstream pop don’t appeal to them.  To some people, listening to music should be a very social experience and it sucks to think that nobody is listening to the music that most appeals to you – this is totally valid.  But what people don’t understand is that the popularity dynamics of music have changed drastically. 

 

It used to be the case that the mainstream was very important, because the options outside the mainstream were so limited.  You could still get into indie music, but it was a very isolating experience.  But what people don’t understand is that what used to be a massive gulf between the mainstream and indie is now very narrow.  It’s almost more like we now have three tiers instead of two: the mainstream, an indie “middlestream,” and an underground of amateur music.  This “middlestream” has formed out of a combination of streaming, social media, music festival culture, and also the current golden age of streaming-television we are also experiencing.  Indie artists that would have been ignored 20 years ago now are able to maintain decent-sized dedicated fanbases which allow them to steadily produce crafted, highly original and unique music.

 

I also think it’s the case that the deficiency of the mainstream is overstated.  People complain about the popularity of Taylor Swift or Bad Bunny as if they make bad music, but these complaints rarely contain any substantial criticism and they usually can be reduced to “this wasn’t made for me so it’s bad.”  This is especially true with the trend of young men trashing Taylor Swift – like, what the hell are they thinking?  Of course they don’t like Swift, her music is written for young women!  But in any case, the criticisms of the mainstream can always be precluded by the simple directive: go listen to other music, it’s out there waiting for you and it was made to appeal specifically to you."

1,2023-10-27,CMV: INDOOR CAT OWNERS ARE SELFISH,u/pastramallama,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17htubw/cmv_indoor_cat_owners_are_selfish/,changemyview,"I believe that keeping a cat indoors is akin to keeping a rabbit in a small cage, a fish in a tiny tank, etc. In recent years it seems that there has been a push for more responsible pet ownership with regards to necessary space and stimulation, but this doesn't apply to cats. 

My argument is that MOST cat owners will say that allowing their cat outside is dangerous to the cat and that is why they want to keep their cat indoors. 

If someone is keeping a cat indoors due to concern regarding bird population, etc, that's an entirely different matter and is irrelevant to the claim I'm making here.

In the decision to keep a cat indoors due to consideration of the cat (as opposed to considerations of the surrounding wildlife, pargmatic issues, etc), there seem to be different frameworks that guide the decision. One is the prioritization of life, another is the prioritization of a good life. These two can end up converse to one another when a good life involves a heightened risk of death. 

The cat cannot advocate for themselves so we make judgment calls on their behalf. My argument is that most people who want to keep their cat indoors are choosing this not for their cats total well being (good life), but for selfish reasons regarding their own experience of their pet (life). 

If this were not the case then I think a lot more cat owners would be allowing their cat outside because it is quite evident from the MANY (not all, if you have a cat that is happy indoors and you want to tell me about it in the comments I won't find that sufficiently convincing) indoor cats zooming for the door or staring out the window that an indoor only life isn't sufficient. This is also supported by research on domestic cat territory sizes. Even in studies with smaller observed territory sizes, it is sufficiently more than a standard sized home. 

Keeping a cat purely indoors is an antiquated pet ownership practice and I think people do mental gymnastics to support it. Ultimately we use an inflated metric of ""life"" in service of actions that harm our pets. I truly believe that ethical cat ownership requires either a leash trained cat or a large outdoor enclosure.

I find that the extreme defensiveness of many cat owners on this subject just further solidifies my belief. Would love to hear some non- defensive takedowns of my opinion."

1,2023-10-27,CMV: The United States should use hundreds of nuclear weapons to create a canal connecting Saudi Arabia to the Indian Ocean through Yemen.,u/cantheevilman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17hv3zc/cmv_the_united_states_should_use_hundreds_of/,changemyview,"To clarify, this canal would be 1000 feet wide, the entire canal would be at sea level (so no locks needed), and it would go straight from Al Kharkhir (in Saudi Arabia) to Jadib (in Yemen). I assume that the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia would both be willing to sign off on the plan given the area is a giant, unoccupied desert and both governments stand to benefit significantly. 

This would solve two big problems:

Problem #1: 
Saudi Arabia’s ability to send oil and gas outside itself would be almost completely shut off if Iran decided to disallow shipping through the Straight of Hormuz. This would cause massive instability. A canal through Yemen (and a giant oil/gas terminal and pipelines at Al Kharkhir) would completely remove this leverage and help ensure the stability of the World’s energy supply and that of Saudi Arabia, which has been a significant stabilizing force in the middle east (although not the most ethical).

Problem #2: 
There is a giant civil war going on in Yemen right now between the Houthis, and the internationally recognized government of Yemen. This civil war has caused a lot of suffering, and one of the main factors enabling it’s continuance is an external supply of weapons to the Houthis that is being sent to them both overland through Oman and by sea. The supply of sea weapons could easily be cut off if the US decided to impose a naval blockade against the parts of Northern Yemen where the Houthis are, and this giant canal would prevent overland supply if it was patrolled with naval boats (also easy). By cutting the supply of weapons to the Houthis, the Yemeni civil war would likely end after a certain period of time due to the Houthis running out of weapons, which would significantly improve the humanitarian situation in the country, weaken Iran (and further disable the ability of it’s proxies to spread religious extremism, harm to civilians and authoritarianism), and further increase the amount of stability in that region of the world, which would significantly benefit from that. 

The costs of this plan would be relatively minimal given that:
A) Very few people are there, nor are there any resources that would be damaged via the detonation of a large number of nuclear weapons. 
B) The US has way too many nuclear weapons to begin with, and this would be a more productive way of disposing them.

Its related, but its besides the point. I have opinions on the matter, but their irrelevant to this post. Whenever something horrible happens, a politician may soon after suggest that it is evidence that a change of some kind needs to be made. While shootings are the obvious example, its not the only one. If, for instance, a state had a natural disaster, a politician might soon after suggest that it could have been handled better if we made certain reforms. After they do so however, you're likely to see a lot of people (including other politicians) call them out for ""politicizing a tragedy""

Ideally, politicians SHOULD be doing things to try and prevent further tragedies, so it makes sense to learn from the ones that have happened and to use them to make a point. Thats a part of their job of trying to make good decisions for society and represent people. Are they trying to get points politically from doing so? Probably, though in most cases I doubt it's their only reason. But whatever, their trying to earn political points on a constant basis, and there are far more immoral ways of doing so than simply using a tragedy to illustrate highlight a good or bad policy suggestion. To be clear, your free to disagree and strongly critique whatever it is they suggest, that's not my issue. My issue is that, in my opinion, getting mad at someone for making a suggestion after a tragedy Soley on the grounds that their somehow using the tragedy is silly."

The area is hilly so some walls of the apartment are actually underground, making me prime territory for pests to target. All food has always been sealed and out of reach, and we keep the place pretty clean.

Many months ago, my roommate and I found our first mouse. The first instinct was to set out non-kill traps and place cayenne pepper (among other household products which are claimed to repel mice) around entrances. These non-kill traps are still out to this day and they have never caught a single thing. (The same was true back in college when I tried to use a non-kill trap to catch a mouse in my dorm.) The bugger(s) tormented us for months, startling us, leaving droppings, even keeping us up late at night trying to trap them after they made their way into a bedroom.

Next, we tried snap traps, which never worked a single time. The mice would eat the food directly off of them and disappear again. I have an allergy to both cats and peanut butter, so getting a “mouser” and things like the “bucket method” were out of the question as well.

Finally, we moved to the last resort of glue traps, despite seeing all over the internet that some people consider them inhumane. The result? We’ve caught something like nine mice to date and I’ve never seen one running around free. Placed along baseboards and in front of entrances, the glue traps seem to catch every mouse that dares enter my home.

Every so often, a mouse gets caught on a glue trap overnight, I wake up in the morning a few hours later to see it, and the trap and mouse both get placed into a plastic grocery bag. Then we take it outside and use a large rock (ooga booga) to flatten it, making sure to crush the cranium in one blow so it’s an instantaneous death.

I understand there is probably some distress, and in some instances even pain, for the few hours between getting caught and getting smushed, but the death is quick and painless. Based on my experience with every other method’s ineffectiveness, it seems like the choice is between this or simply living with a mouse infestation.

I could change my view if someone convincingly proves that there is a better method of dealing with mice, that there’s no tradeoff whereby any level of rodent distress is tolerable, that living with mice is acceptable, or something else I haven’t even thought of!"

I am well versed that there are dozens of serious reasons they must be terminated --  but son of a bitch, I feel terrible for killing them. My mind is consumed with the fact that I've inflicted pain on these creatures for being themselves. They don't know any better. 

I'm sure this is a natural human reaction, and im self aware that i am more sensitive than most. My question - how do I turn it off? How do I justify this to myself when facts don't outweigh the emotion?"

Recently Elon Musk has called Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf a “blatant racist” for his remarks claiming that, essentially, there are too few non-white people in positions of power on the Scottish government.

The thing is, Scotland is a country where 95.4% of people identify as white. It is the overwhelming ethnic majority. One would expect that in a country where nearly everyone is white nearly every job would be filled by a white person.

At a certain point is his speech Yousaf says that in most government meetings he attends he is the only non-white person. 95% is the same as 1 in 20, meaning that out of every 20 people in Scotland, 19 are white. This means that if Yousaf attends a meeting of 20 people and he is the only non-white *that is an accurate representation of the country’s ethnic composition*.

The First Minister goes on to claim that “that is not good enough” and that more positions of power should be filled by non-whites. I see this as unequivocally racist. A country’s government should be a reflection of its people, so if a country is almost entirely white you would expect that country’s government to be almost entirely white. If we were talking about, say, Brazil, where whites make up only about half of the population then yes, I would agree that only about half of people in government should be white.

To me Yousaf has shown himself to be racist against white people, but I have seen several news outlets framing Musk as the racist one here. Is there something I’m missing here or are they all just virtue signaling?"

Taylor Swift is nowhere close to what Eminem achieved. Eminem revived a dying genre after Tupac's and Biggie's deaths into arguably the most prominent genre out there. He is the sole reason why Rap and Hip-Hop is so mainstream today. Taylor Swift on the other hand, did not bring in any change to an entire genre of music, be it Country or Pop.

What else is the comparison metric? Their wealth? Eminem did not diversify into anything other than music. Taylor Swift did. She went into real estate. Neither did he luck into every possible thing Taylor Swift had. Too many people made/still make money off of Eminem. Dr Dre, Jimmy Iovine, the Bass Brothers, and many more. Taylor Swift didn't have that problem. Her dad bought her the record label, while Eminem was broke when he started out. The fact that his net worth is 220 million dollars by just his music is actually surprising.

Let's talk about sales. Eminem still beats her in everything except streaming. He's the best selling album artist of this century. He was the best selling artist of 2000s, and the 3rd best selling artist of the 2010s and the best selling male artist of 2010s. Even if you take streaming into consideration, he is one of the top 10 streamed artists of all time. Eminem peaked in 2002, way before the streaming era. The internet was not so mainstream as it is today and things didn't go viral back then as it does now. If Eminem had the advantage of present day technology, it is without a doubt that his streams would have even eclipsed Drake's numbers too. The fact that Eminem is 20 years past his prime and is still topping charts, rivalling present day artists is still an incredible achievement.

The amount of PR and propaganda done by Taylor Swift's PR team and her 'Swifties' is insane. No, she's not a Goddess. Eminem isn't a God. But at least, he doesn't pretend to be a goody two-shoes and 'act' all humble about his early days and his fanbase doesn't go crazy at his every single move. They're silent and just listen to his music. Why cannot every fanbase be like them? Stop obsessing over Taylor Swift or any other artist. She's not even close to what Eminem has achieved. I don't advocate obsessing over Eminem either. They're all artists at the end of the day and they make their money off of you idiots."

I'm new to the subreddit and I hope this CMV has not been posed recently.  


Secondly, this CMV should be seen in the context of pro-choice: if you are pro-life, and abortion is never an option, it also makes sense that you hold responsible both mother and father for the child no matter what.  


I am firmly pro-choice. I believe that even a simple ""I am not ready to have a child"", for whatever reason, is more than enough to have an abortion. I also think that the mother should have the last say in whether to keep a child or abort, and while hopefully she talks with the father before taking such a decision, it's ultimately her choice. That being said, if the father does not want to keep the child, while the mother does, the father should not be required to pay child support: that would mean the mother is forcing the father to economically sustain a person he doesn't want to sustain.   
An obvious counterargument would be: ""well but the father knew what he was doing having sex, and that there's always the risk"". But the same holds true for the mother (unless rape is involved of course), and in that case you should hold both of them responsible for it, and you should therefore be pro-life (once again, excluding rape scenarios).

God forbid you are not attracted to a person and break up, the folks over at r/Relationship_advice and r/BreakUps have now diagnosed you as a soulless narcissist with dismissive avoidant attachment that hops around craving validation. No. The answer most of the time is actually quite simple. Nobody wants to force themselves to be with someone they're not attracted to (anymore). That is it.  


The same way, subreddits around borderline personality disorder are, as one wise redditor said, ""crabs in a bucket"". Pits of reinforcing eachother's self-loathing and using god knows what terms like ""FP"", ""DA"" , ""FA"", ""AA"". Bro. Your attachment isn't fixed.

But shooting pig peptides meant for stroke patients up your ass and dosing yourself with unknown research chemicals shipped out of some shady warehouse in Russia is nothing short of insanity. Congratulations. You have learned what the term ""agonist"" means. If you have the intelligence to do that, then use that same intelligence to learn that talking to a god damn doctor with years of training and experience is the obvious better choice.  


Depression subreddits seem to worship medication and shun CBT/DBT or any form of talk therapy because it's easier to think a magic pill will solve your problems. No. Medication can be your key, but it can also be a temporary crutch to get you back to functioning well enough so that you can work on everything else. Just because something didn't work for you, it doesn't mean it doesn't work at all.

Whenever a tragedy happens in the Muslim world, or whenever Muslims are attacked or their religion is criticised, no matter where it is, Muslims in the west or elsewhere all come together. They band together and they defend one another. Be it in the current israel-Palestine conflict, the persecution of Muslims in China, Kashmir, or protesting sometimes violently over things like Charlie Hebedo Muhammad cartoons. And yet they never do the same when some tragedy hits their adopted country particularly in the west.

Take the UK for example. Muslims here remained silent when Pakistani grooming gangs raped and abused white women across the uk over the last fifty years. I’d they ever spoke about it, it was ti say how this was victimising them. Or in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, or the stabbing of David Ames (an MP), or the London Bridge terrorist attack. Or the fact that a teacher in the UK had to go into hiding for discussion whether it was right to show a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. Or when some Muslims  threatened with death a school boy who supposedly scuffed a Quran by accident t and they forced his mother to beg for forgiveness.

Or even recently when after the recent flare up in the ME, we e seen a 1450% increase in anti semitic crime. And yet they’ve usually just kept silent or said it’s to be expected.

They never come out and show any sympathy or horror when these things happen. Instead they often seem to show sympathy with those Muslims who commit these atrocities.

That and the broader incidents mentioned before   me suggests Muslims particularly in the west will never actually try and show any support or dare I say it loyalty to the country they are in if it is not a Muslim country. And they never will."

“Race just divides us whenever we talk about it.”
“People just want to blame white people for all their problems.”


These points, and many points like them, are a combination of denial and deflection. They’re not real points. Just DARVO. 

Not only is it cringe, it’s disturbing how these points are legitimized by this country when all of these points can be debunked by learning about critical race theory.  

I wish some white American would not feel so bold to speak on topics that they know nothing about or have the capacity to engage with. I don’t want to gatekeep discussions of race.

I keep seeing stories of anti-semitism on the rise in America as a response to the situation with a lot of focus on college student group statements and protests among others.

I see a lot of people on the right almost reveling in this as they see it as an extension of what they'd call the  ""out of touch and dangerous woke brainwashing of kids by liberal education"". I think that sure there are always going to be some people in a group with extremist views but It really doesn't appear to me that this is very representative of any significant group of people and certainly isn't evidence of university education in America being too leftist.

Being anti-semitic, traditionally, doesn't mean disagreeing with political and military actions by a nation state.  It generally is interpreted as a racist type view that jews naturally or culturally possess traits that are viewed as negative, dangerous, and or antithetical to societal norms.

Almost all of the ""free-palestine"" protests that i've seen that involve a large mix of people, who I BTW feel are probably justified, in being concerned that killing more non-combatants is a moral outrage.  Sure there are plenty of actual anti-semitic people out there too but it looks like so much political posturing to throw them all in the same basket with anti-war people.

I think being against war and other governmental actions is not anti-semitic.

I think being against groups of people for perceived inherent traits or generalized views can be anti-semitic.

I think those very different views are being purposely conflated by the right to gain political points.

I don't believe there is a large groundswell of actual antisemitism on the left, even within college communities. 

I'm open to actual evidence that large numbers of people have truly hateful views but I haven't seen it yet.

You have more social groups which gives you more options to find a good woman. After high school is over you have more responsibilities, and you cannot work on your personality and are basically a caged animal if you're a man.

Catholic. Grew up in l.a. around alot of Jewish people. I love Israel and like supporting the Jewish state. I didn't grow up around alot of Palestinians, so I don't really care about their side. And I make little to no apologies for Celebrating Israel existing Even if it had some dark origins . 

As an American, who loves Israel and expects it to exist forever or at least long enough for Jesus to come back. There needs to be a ceasefire immediately.  And Israel is going to have to swallow some hard pills if they want to preach sovereignty but rely on American aid for protection against the Iranians and other forces in the region. The recent u.n. vote on Israel's actions has me profoundly unsettled, the world does not agree with Israel and America's stance on a ceasefire agreement. And this is beginning to snowball beyond simple political disagreements. Saudi Arabia has expressed grave concern over Israel ground assault, turkey has said America is supporting a genocide, American reporters and embassy are being attacked in Muslim nations. Rapid and unprecedented anti Semitic actions are rising in the west. Iran is openly and explicitly threatening military intervention, some are even speculating that with a new found peace with Iran. Saudi Arabia may even be tempted to launch a modern oil embargo on the United states, which would be beyond catastrophic were it to occur before we pass a budget or even after. There is a different set of politics in the middle east and around the glove, and I don't want my country to face the wrath of it because Israel wants to pursue their own vision of a victory 

I want to emphasize again that I do not sympathize with the Palestinians or the Muslim worlds grievances. Nor do I care what russia or Europe feel about it. But I do care what they can do about it , and if the u.n. vote and Iran and Saudi Arabia rhetoric are any sign of what's to come. We are looking at a truly apocalyptic war. I support Israel's right to not only defend themselves, but their right to exist, even if other countries don't get to enjoy saying such a thing. But I also support America's right to exist, and the United States facing a full blown punishment for the world for Israel's actions might lead us to a point where we go over the edge. A modern oil embargo or a war with Iran will not let us live in semi comfort the way we did during the 1970s oil embargo or the Iraq war. Those types of things will have much worse consequences in the modern day oil embargo could lead us to a societal collapse. A war with Iran will not leave us with 7,000 dead soldiers but easily 700,000. Russia has explicitly stated it will come to Iran's aid the way it came to syrias aid should the United States choose to enter a conflict with them. This would create a wide open door for China to take taiwan and laugh at any American efforts to try to stop this. This has consequences beyond Gaza and Israel, the entire world order is at stake as well as who will lead whatever replaces the one we are seeing collapse in the modern day 

I don't want to get hounded by Israel supporters. I'm on Israel's side and haven't even attempted to paint Palestinians or Hamas in a good light. But in times of war, serious conversation is needed, because once we pass a certain point there's no going back. This has countless ways to become a nuclear war by the end of the calendar year and if we don't want the worst Israel should agree to an immediate ceasefire and listen to all of the neighbors it relies on America to ignore. America should never abandon its friendship and promises to Israel, but it needs to balance that with the Interests of America too. People watching the events in Israel here in America need to understand if this doesn't stop their own children are going to be drafted and the selective service is going go be activated. If a war unlike any we've ever seen is what we want. We should let Israel continue to define the narrative and just hope nothing bad happens. But if we want to prevent thay, Israel should agree to a ceasefire and the United States should compel it if necessary. Should the talks be unproductive let's move forward with the boom of revelations but as someone who's always thought the phrase give peace a chance was stupid this is the one area I'm going to make an exception for"

I am saying, I do not think someone will do a better job representing someone *solely based* on their sex, race or sexual orientation.

In doing so, I think think manner of thinking is sexist, racist and homophobic in itself. It is believing that there is a shared experience just because a certain aspect of your life is connected to a certain group. 

It suggest because you are x, you must have experienced/think y.


I think the up bringing/life ($30k a year boarding schools, college education and 6 figure salary) of some representatives already pushes them out of the realm of being an average American. Even if the individual is a minority, they mostly likely did not have what is the stereotypical upbringing. 

I do think the social/financial background of individuals is more so a strong indicator of shared experiences. I believe that point connects to more people than the aforementioned things.

He could've only really saved maybe 5 people on his shoulders, uner his arms and between his legs, maybe 10 or 15 with multiple trips, but everyone blaming him for the deaths of all 120 people instead of just the 5-15 he didn't saves kinda vindicates him for not doing it - he should be only blamed for the people he could've saved, but didn't. 

The Fighter Jets that were sent by the government would've been under orders to shoot it down if the hijackers didn't change course from a populated area to reduce casualties and it seems unlikely they would've done that, since Homelander tried to de-escalate the situation/negotiate too which didn't work - there wasn't any other scenario where the passengers had a higher likelihood of surviving.

If some Special Forces dude was able to get on to the 9/11 planes then parachuted off alone to keep it a secret after he couldn't stop them, yes he should've taken whoever he could with him, but it wouldn't make it his fault that everyone died or absolve the perpetrators from blame in my opinion."

A huge percent of people on the left clearly think white couples shouldn't adopt black kids. I understand how it could feel messed up to take black children and give them to white parents,but still I think it shows Democrats don't actually want pro-life people to adopt. Even though they will still use this as a gotcha moment. I think most Democrats would rather black babies be aborted then raised by white Republicans. I'm not really sure if you would call this an unpopular opinion, but I'm certain this post will rile up some emotions.

A scientific theory can be defined as this: A theory is a carefully thought-out explanation for observations of the natural world that has been constructed using the scientific method, and which brings together many facts and hypotheses.

In science, a theory is considered universally true and is not called a fact because it is still open to more evidence. I applaud Mike Pence's courage for defending the Theory of Evolution in a state so deep in the Bible belt! I am glad I can trust a politician who respects Evolution as the scientific theory it is and has actually been taking measures for it to be taught as a theory! Being taught as a theory will place evolution in the same academic regard as the Theory of Gravity and the Theory of Spacial Relativity, which are theories taught in schools across the country! Evolution is 100% real, and teaching it as a scientific theory, or ""a carefully thought-out explanation for observations of the natural world that has been constructed using the scientific method, and which brings together many facts and hypotheses"" will teach Evolution as the truth that it is!

When I finish a very hard homework or a very long project, if it’s a hard assignment in a course I’m interested in I feel this a little less, but for courses I don’t like, after finishing a particularly hard assignment, I don’t feel satisfied at all. I just feel completely exhausted. Just no satisfaction whatsoever. And to go and see all those people talk about “the satisfaction of completing a challenging task” kind of stings a bit.

If it wasn't for the United States in the 60s jews would have been expelled from the Arab world , possibly genocided or living in terrible conditions in other Arab countries. It really hit me when my leftist friends didn't care that Mufti had sat down with Hitler because they felt Palestinians had a right to the land.

My reasons why I would condone an enthostate  

This video is quite profound because it demonstrates how much hatred the Arab world has for jews and highlights the jewish expulsion after 1948 from all the Arab countries .

https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelHamasWar/s/Sg9dyuYkFx

This shows you what a APARTHEID is by the Arab world and not the accusations from pro-palestinian that the process via the oslo accords where the west bank was split up in order for Palestinians to take the terrority eventually becoming a state in the 80s. 

The only reason countries like Egypt or Jordan compromise is because they lost or otherwise Israel wouldn't exist . Israel has been fighting since its Inception from a world that doesn't want it to exist

 To provide a clear picture, united states and Israel consist of 80 percent of the jews on the planet.  The Arab world has less than 1 percent of jews. Israel alone has about 2 million arabs living there mostly Palestinians meaning they harbor close to 30 percent of the region Palestinians if you take into account Gaza and the west bank in Israel. Apparently Israel is such a terrible place that 2 million arabs rather live there than the other 22 Arab countries. Even the U.N resolution 181 partition plan had Israel having 450,000 jews and 400,000 arabs while the Palestinians would have 700,000 Palestinians and 10,000 jews. Keep in mind that the jews accepted the resolution while the Palestinians rejected it of course.

 No one wants to mention 2000, or 2008 peace talks where Abbas now himself admits he rejected the offer . Palestinians had an option of a state or "" from the river to the sea ' and they didn't choose the state. This is not an occupation but rather enemies who refuse to create a state. Now Israelis , Netanyahu don't trust Palestinians to not attack anymore if even a state was created. 

I want to clear as I can , Gaza is a terrorist neighbor that wants to wipe jews off the map. This isn't some group of people wanting peace under any condition and their acts of Oct 7th are well known yet there's a huge growing sentiment towards this terrorist neighbor. Here's a video of a kindergarten graduation where they are literally teaching children how to kill. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/s/kQGm4iMWB1


This isn't something you defend in any circumstance. The hatred of Palestinians in Gaza runs deep , they hate jews and this hate is taught to them generation after generation. I'll link a poll showing the support of young people who believe the killing of civilians is justified by a grievance. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelCrimes/s/ESGY16qW2b
 
This is a good image of what is happening right now while the left mocks and shames for calling out this behavior. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/s/zs3qIbD3Xy


With that said , I condone a enthostate because of the mass hatred of jews and growing antisemitism.They wouldn't even be here most likely if it wasn't for the United States and they need a sanctuary where they can feel safe. If perceptions changed over time where such hatred isn't present then I'd never condone an enthostate however right now a enthostate seems to be something the world owes them. I've never seen a group of people so shunned in my life. We literally watched terrorist kill civilians and somehow we are rooting for a terrorist neighbors where most of them have the same sentiments via indoctrination.They are are anti-gay , anti-trans, anti-american , etc yet somehow we hate jews so much that we are rooting for a terrorist neighbor. So yes, I condone a enthostate."

Stealing bread to feed your family places your own interests and desire ahead of everything else and comes at the expense of others. There is no real way to get around this, it's just selfish. It places your self interest, feeding yourself and those you care about, at the expense of the baker and customer.

HOWEVER! Where it is ""good"" or ""evil"" is a separate discussion. We often give the term ""selfish"" a negative connotation when it technically doesn't have to have one. Being selfish can be good and can be bad in my opinion. The baker who refuses to give free bread to the starving family is also selfish as he places his own self interest in making money despite the fact it harms others. Being selfish is a survival mechanism we employ to ensure our own well being. Every single organism is selfish, and I would argue humans are one of the less if not the least selfish organisms on this planet. In many cases, we might have to suppress our natural instincts for the greater good of society (lust, gluttony, even violence could be considered natural), but other times natural instincts don't have to be repressed."

The feature has been implemented well. I can see community notes on dishonest tweets on opposite sides of political issues. For example, this [anti-Israel tweet](https://twitter.com/dialectichiphop/status/1717275496143053091) had [context added](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/n/1717554867370115365) on how DDT was used in the mid 20th century. While this [anti-Palestinian tweet](https://twitter.com/VictorNakba/status/1716229749075263768) had [a note added](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/n/1716370358406639642) that the footage is actually from the Syrian civil war. Community notes have not just been applied to fringe figures who no-one follows, but figures that are well-respected by many, such as the US president, the ACLU, and the BBC. The community notes are written in a professional, factual tone, and often cite sources, unlike most tweets. The account [Helpful Notes](https://twitter.com/HelpfulNotes) shows tweets that have had helpful notes for over a day, and I can see trends in how people have been engaging in BS - one common trend is using photos or footage from other conflicts that the world has largely ignored, or using AI images or computer games.

Dmitry Medvedev [complained](https://twitter.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1694382207203250586) about an opposing view appearing with the original tweet. My response would be that encountering other peoples' contributions are part and parcel of social media - that's what ""social"" means.

I have some concerns about community notes - we rely upon an algorithm to decide if a community note has received enough positive feedback to be accepted, and we don't know who the author of a note is or what conflicts of interest they have.

Community notes started during Twitter 1.0, but have become more prominent during Twitter 2.0 (Twitter/X after Musk took over). I'm especially interested if those who dislike the change from 1.0 to 2.0 feel like Community Notes have not had a net positive affect on Twitter.

A possible response is that X/Twitter, social media in general, or Twitter 2.0 is irredeemably bad, and that Community Notes doesn't make it better, but I doubt Twitter will disappear overnight.

1,2023-10-28,CMV: Insomnia (and other sleep disorders) should be considered a disability.,u/PekoKuzuryu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17isuup/cmv_insomnia_and_other_sleep_disorders_should_be/,changemyview,"Constant sleep deprivation can take a huge toll on someone’s mental and physical health. People can become highly anxious and depressed, and can lead to heart disease, kidney issues, weight gain, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, and could also be very dangerous. Adults have a high chance of causing themselves and others injury due to severe sleep deprivation, including car accidents and work accidents.  It causes memory issues, trouble with thinking and concentration, and mood swings. 

(How is this NOT considered a form of disability?) 

Of course, anyone can go around and claim they have insomnia or another form of sleep disorder, and I’m not referring to someone’s occasional restless nights here and there. I’m talking about people who deal with this day after day, week after week, months or years on end. Obviously, you’d have to directly diagnosed by a doctor (I was originally diagnosed by my primary doctor, then later diagnosed by an actual sleep doctor), so it would have to be on file like any other medical condition. 

Chronic sleep deprivation is *no joke* and needs to be taken seriously. People shouldn’t have to feel guilty by their bosses for not being able to show up to work, or having poor work performance due to being a walking anxiety ridden zombie.

I’ve struggled with insomnia (sleep onset & sleep maintenance), for over 7 years now. Up until 2 years ago, my insomnia was so severe that most nights I’d be lucky if I got over 3 hours of sleep. Sometimes I wouldn’t get any sleep at all and to 40+ hours until I crash. Doctors wouldn’t give me sleep medication and for a long time I had to survive on OTC stuff like Benadryl and NyQuil, which are so unhealthy to take long term. 

Through my personal experience and the experiences of friends, fellow co-workers, and people in my support groups who suffered with insomnia (or other sleep disorders), I’ve noticed that managers are NOT very understanding whenever someone couldn’t come to work because they didn’t get any sleep, or who had to leave work early due to severe sleep deprivation. Mainly because they themselves don’t have the disorder, so they don’t understand how debilitating it can really be for some people. They just see it as “wow my worker stayed up too late so they didn’t sleep enough and now can’t come to work or their work performance is trash.” No… it’s not that we stayed up too late. It’s that we’re forced to stay up against our will, as we watch the minutes ticktock across the clock as we lay there and pray to at least get a single hour or 2 in before we need to be up for work. Then repeat the process day in, day out, for god knows how long. 

That was me for a long time. Thankfully, I managed to get on medication that helped me a lot around 2 years ago. But even with that my sleep is still not that great, but better to the point where I don’t need to worry about my job all the time. 

I know so many people in the insomnia community who had to leave their jobs due to how bad their sleep is. It’s sad, and people shouldn’t have to resort to that over something they can’t control."

Full disclaimer: I do think Israel has the right to exist TO AN EXTENT, but the appartheid state they've built and their forcing of many Palestinians into fucking ghettos and repeatedly carpet bombing them is horrific and barbaric and tied for the worst humanitarian crisis with the Uighur genocide.

Back to Zionists. These people are fucking sick. When I've debated them on UCLA, they've said the most overtly racist and even genocidal sentiment towards Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims in general, calling for their death or at the very least total removal from Israeli soil. They are fanatics who fully support Israel no matter what. They call you anti-Semetic for criticizing Israel when the way I see it the institution of Israel and the institution of Judaism are distinct things, and criticizing one does not mean you hate the other.

They claim it is impossible for Israel to be an oppressive police state because of the Holocaust. When I bring up how the unconsenually sterilized black Ethiopian JEWISH Beta-Israelite refugees, they continued to defend Israel and claimed it was justified. It made me sick. They view Palestinians collectively as terrorist animals so of course there's no way I can convince them that they have rights, but against their own JEWISH people? This is sick.

They treat fucking genocidal Nettanyahu as a god and defend his increased censorships and weakening of the judicial branch, and even said democracy has to be put on hold during war.

My changes (happy to explore each in more depth with commenters):

CHANGE 1: Edexcel should teach, and have, a statistical component in the course (regression, statistics i.e. time series analysis, and RCT basics)

Reasoning: How I've gone through four years (between GCSE and A-Level) economics without being taught some statistics is baffling to me. Seeing the trend of the subject (last 5 years Nobel prize winners) to statistical elements like RCT's, natural experiments, I think students learning economics find themselves disillusioned at the abstract nature of economics when in practise its a very hands-on subject.

I'm not very smart, but grappling with these concepts aren't too difficult to learn and very doable. The subject should a.) prepare students for what they learn at degree level if they choose to pursue, b.) be subject relevant, and c.) teach useful skills. I believe this change accomodates this.



CHANGE 2: I disagree with the 50-50 Micro-Macro syllabus split and believe it should be (70-30 in Micro's favour.)

Reasoning: Among top economists, macro-economics isn't seen as a 'real' subject/science. I feel that macro really incorporates the 'dismal' side of economics. With this in mind, I also realise its only an A-level and doesn't go too much in-depth. I think that some parts of the macro syllabus should be scrapped and only keep parts that are relevant to students in their own lives (even those not taking Econ at degree level) i.e. impacts of inflation, macro indicators, globalisation. I think by only teaching the fundamentals here to allocate room for Change 1, its more relevant to the field as a whole and be able to aim the field to be more rigorous as a subject.


Change 3: In this vein and according with change 1 and 2, I think Edexcel should scrap the micro+macro split (paper 3) and paper should instead be more 'advanced' micro concepts (i.e. theory of the firm) and incorporate statistical/mathematical/game theory elements.

Reasoning: I think with the arguments posed in Change 1 and Change 2 this feels like the necessary step afterwards. I argue that these changes would disillusion students less (highlight how theory can be applied to real life/less abstract via stats, improve necessary skills at degree level with mathematical foundation.)



I really find that the fact that students are never taught that demand curves are defined by fundamentals (indifference curves) or never see an iota of data in their studies to be baffling. I make this post because I welcome discussion. I would also really like to see what people taking econ as a degree think and how well their A-level prepared them. CMV!"
1,2023-10-29,CMV: Pure democracy would not be a good political system.,u/LaserWerewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17iz2ia/cmv_pure_democracy_would_not_be_a_good_political/,changemyview,"I am all for democracy, and to be honest, I think many countries (including the USA) would benefit from being more democratic. People should get to vote on a wider variety of issues, governmental organizations should be more transparent, corporations (especially weapons corporations) should not have any significant amount of power over the government, and nobody should be allowed to bribe politicians.

However, there can be such a thing as too much democracy. I contend that pure democracy would be destructive and unsustainable. 

I cannot think of a single example of a world government which is ruled by pure democracy. If you know of one, please share it with me. I've only seen fictional examples of this type of government... and in these stories, this situation always turns violent. Why? Because in practice, pure democracy would almost invariably devolve into mob rule. 

Imagine a situation in which everyone could vote on everything, and the results of that vote decided what laws would exist and what actions the government would take. Every official, every ambassador, every police officer would be elected. So far, so good, right?

But what would happen if, say, a person were accused of a crime, or simply deemed to be unworthy? In a pure democracy, would they still be tried by a jury of their peers and sentenced by a judge? Or would they be tried and sentenced by public opinion? I think the latter would be the case. If a majority of people said ""Let's kill (X unpopular person)... who would stop them? Wouldn't the government have to honor the will of the people? And even if there were laws which said ""Due process must be followed""... wouldn't it be very easy to change those laws, as long as a majority of the people agreed?

Or what if there were a law or political system that sounded good on paper, but was actually completely impractical? Maybe a lot of people would vote for this, not having the political or legal knowledge to understand why enacting this law would cause hardship or chaos. What would happen then? Under a pure democracy, the new law change would move forward. Imagine if everyone voted ""All citizens should get 1 million dollars from the government"", because of course everyone wants that. Where on Earth would this money come from? Who can imagine what chaos would ensue when the people demanded their million dollars?

Or imagine a case where one country attacked another, and people felt an emotional need to retaliate. What if, for example, a majority of Americans wanted to bomb Russia because they invaded Ukraine? A seasoned elected leader would have the experience to understand that this is not necessarily a wise action, even though many people may find it emotionally satisfying. But in a pure democracy, if more than half of the people voted yes... wouldn't that be the end of civilization as we know it? 

If you can explain to me how a pure democracy could in practice be reasonably peaceful and sustainable, or better yet, give me a real-world example of a medium-sized or large country which functioned for a long time as a pure democracy, I will gladly change my view. I am, after all, a very big fan of democracy. "

To the ones continuing these stereotypes, stop. It is xenophobia. I presume You wouldn’t stereyotype a race, religion, sexuality, ect, but it’s ok to do it towards this one small group of people?

5,2023-10-29,CMV: Most relationship failure/frustration can be summarized as treating others like crap and get treated like crap back,u/itsdoctorlee,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17iztr7/cmv_most_relationship_failurefrustration_can_be/,changemyview,"It is almost comical how people have been blaming men, women, dating apps, school, God, horoscope + a million more over-analyzed factors as their barrier to finding a satisfying partner and relationship. (but never realizing what they bring to the table themselves)

Two common scenarios pre-relationship:

Women often talk to multiple guys to ""increase"" their chance of finding the prince charming. Little did they know that it shows on the quality and enthusiasm in how they converse, their behavior and demeanor (And they are somehow oblivious to how obvious that is to a guy with just minimal intelligence). And then they get mad when some guys they are actually interested in don't treat them seriously anymore due to their diluted effort. That is, girls often give guys the impression that they are replaceable entertainment providers.

Guys, on the other hand, set priority in getting girls onto their bed (that is, treating women as sexual tool. I don't think it needs further elaboration). This easily ruins otherwise what could have been a good relationship, and then they are somehow surprised and frustrated that they don't get any relationship satisfaction, appreciation and support in return. (they have been brainwashed that sex is too important, but in fact, the most substantial missing element in mens' life is genuine care and support).

The same happen with existing partners and relationships. Just change it with ""having other priorities"" in life and it shows a consistent lack of interest and concern about their partners (doesn't matter what you truly want and value, it only matters what you do and show outwardly). Watch your actions and what you are bringing to the table, that's the only thing you need to care about if you want a satisfying relationship.

Edit1: Some commenters rightly pointed out that it is unclear what relationship failure/frustration means. I want to clarify that I mean bad breakups or failed attempt to relationships that results in resentment, as implied by the fact that people feel the need to the point to blame/complain other entities/reasons for their apparent failures.

Edit2: About some commenters trying to give me another reason which they claim as more ""ultimate"" e.g., I am sampling an immature population from my own experience, or those are ""teens"" who just have some growing-up to do, they have mental problems, etc. In fact, they validate my point as I am giving ""proximal mechanism"" that causes relationship failure/frustration. They are by no means mutually exclusive. My post is exactly trying to shed some lights for those ""immature"" people that some commenters claim I-don't-know-how invalidate my point.

Edit3: To address the comments ""sometimes the bad behavior is one-sided and the other party just put up with it"". It is a valid point, I very much agree that it would lead to relationship failures and resentments at some point. However, based on mathematical intuition, I would be inclined to think that the ""bads"" are most often reciprocated at some point later to the ""self-unaware"" perpetuator, or sometimes even off-target (and then that off-target person grow resentful and retaliate), in order for this vicious cycle of relationship resentment to grow bigger and bigger and more and more people are complaining about it (there are tons of stats that indicate single/loneliness/divorce/relationship dissatisfaction is at an all-time high).

Edit4: The ""it is something good, this is what it should be"" argument. At no points I am implying if the relationship failures/frustration are either ""good or bad"". I am just here to describe the most likely cause. Not sure what those commenters are trying to achieve."

Personally I'm not against eating supermarket meat, I don't care enough to change my diet, but I would far rather kill an animal in the wild that has lived a good life over one that has lived in captivity. 

That's just my two cents, I am extremely pro ethical hunting for food or pest control, but I welcome people to change my mind on this."

For those that say ""a clump of cells aren't a person"" many states allow abortions after limbs & organs are forming. If you have to pull legs & arms out of someone, I'd say that's a sign it's a person. 

Some states also allow late term abortions & there are definitely advocates for more places to have that police too. (Feel free to correct but I believe a state or 2 even allows abortion up until birth) 

If a preemie baby can live outside the woman's womb at a certain point, why should the ""clump of cells"" of a woman seeking an abortion at that point not be considered a human? 

I can see an argument for ""not a human"" in the first couple of weeks, if someone takes an abortion pill immediately, but that's not what most abortions are & lots of women don't even know they're pregnant until further along than that. Plus, we all still know that the cells will grow into a person soon if unbothered, so I consider them a person in the process of growing and if someone else doesn't then explain to me why women who miscarry grieve the loss of a child? 

You don't need to be religious to think it's not right to kill an unborn baby."
1,2023-10-29,cmv: many feminine behaviors are self-objectifying.,u/Aromatic_Highlight27,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j66cp/cmv_many_feminine_behaviors_are_selfobjectifying/,changemyview,"Many women, legitimately and rightfully, complain about the so-called ""objectification"" of the female body, that is (if I understand it correctly) the reduction of a person to a body meant (and judged) to be esthetically pleasent and sexually provocative. 

At the same time, and just as legitimally and rightfully, most women engage in behaviors which seems perfectly coherent with this same view. What comes to my mind is this moment includes make up, heels, jewelry, hair dying and other forms of altering, plastic surgery, wearing tight and/or revealing clothes. All these things are generally much less common in males, and could probably be considered extravagant when done by a man. They are expensive, tiring and/or time consuming, and they seem to me they imply some degree of the idea than the female body is an object to be gazed, decorated, and esthetically/sexually appreciated. As a man, I can't imagine putting so much effort into my look. 

I don't see anything necessarily wrong in any of the two things, but they appear somewhat contradictive.
This includes the consideration of women who do these same things as model of emancipation (although, admittedly, most do), and the common idea that ""everyone is beautiful"": while no one would feel the need to tell an ugly man that he is handsome (somehow he doesn't need to be), ugly/fat women will frequently be told they are ""beautiful in their own way"" as if the lack of beauty would be unacceptable for a woman. 
I know this can be controversial and I hope no one will feel offended, it is not my intention at all. I'd like to know other people's opinion on the subject,  especially from women, and if possible have my mind changed."

Normal: *conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected.* * the usual, average, or typical state or condition.*

Seeing how the overwhelming majority of humans are attracted and or are in/have/had/identify(as) heterosexual relationships, it’s not incorrect to say the normal human relationship is heterosexual. It’s normal for someone to be straight.

That is *NOT* saying anything is wrong if it it outside of the usual standard.

Normalcy can even change depending on the time or location. If someone is shirtless and bouncing around a club with their arms up at 2am, that’s not abnormal behavior. Do the exact same thing at 7am on a sidewalk, it’s abnormal behavior. Not normal. 

Depending on where you are, there can be occurrences that are normal for that place and abnormal elsewhere. Like it’s normal to see dolphins in certain parts of the Pacific Ocean. It’s not normal to see dolphins in a river. It happens (they exist) but it’s not the usual or average state.

It’s normal for mammals to give live birth…. Enter the platypus. 

Seeing how it’s normal (typical/usual) that humans and other mammals engage in heterosexual activity, what’s wrong with referring to that as normal?"

96,2023-10-29,CMV: The Thing from the 1982 Carpenter movie is the scariest monster ever imagined.,u/vuzz33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j6qus/cmv_the_thing_from_the_1982_carpenter_movie_is/,changemyview,"First CMV from me, so I start with a light but fun subject, horror in fantasy.

The movie ''The Thing'' of 1982 is a masterpiece and featured what I consider the scariest monster, not only in cinema but in all works of fiction ever written.

Some will say that fear differs for each individual and while it's indeed true there are some phobias that are shared by everyone: fear of death, fear of the unknown, fear of mutilation, fear of betrayal, etc... And that specific monster manages to convey them like no other.

To develop a little more on my thought, here are the 3 domains The Thing manages to excel (warning, does contain some spoilers from the movie):

&#x200B;

1. **Shock value:** Starting with the most obvious, that creature is absolutely disgusting, a blasphemous sight to behold. A mass of flesh, screaming, wiggling, constantly transforming its body part, looking like a twisted and disfigured version of the animals it tries to copy. It is at the pinnacle of body horror, and scarce are the monsters that can come close to that degree of perversion of the flesh. But it's not just horrible to look at, that abomination is extremely dangerous: creating mouthes to bite you, tentacles to bind you, acid spray to melt you and even splitting itself in case of danger. And let's not forget that a single contact with the Thing is enough to infect any living organism, adding them to its entity. Way more terrible than the traditional zombie method of infection. If it manages to reach our civilization it would be the end for humanity as stated in the movie.
2. **Paranoia-inducing:** Of course, it wouldn't stand at the top with just a horrifying appearance. The Thing is smart, in fact much smarter than humanity, being able to construct a spaceship with just scrap in a matter of hours. But it's its sneaky nature that makes it so fearful, like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike its prey.  Usually, in a horror story, the danger comes from the outside, hence when a group of characters are together, the tension falls back because being united makes them stronger against adversity. With the Thing it's the contrary, being able to shapeshift into anyone makes it nearly impossible to detect in a group. We don't know who we can put our trust in and when the creature will strike. Associated with the shock value explained earlier, it's even more uncomfortable to imagine that monstrosity being in the same room as the rest of the characters. And that feeling extends to the very end of the movie, where we don't even know if the creature is one of the two last survivors or not.
3. **Unfathomable threat:** Now the cherry on the cake comes from the mystery surrounding it. We know practically nothing about it. It came from the sky in a spaceship a long time ago, but that's all from its origin. Was it a biological weapon from an alien race? Did it destroy every civilization it came in contact with? Considering it's a shapeshifter copying the life forms it comes across, even its original form stays unknown if it has any. Its total lack of communication with the human character, or the spectator makes it impossible to know his real thoughts. We only know that it wants to assimilate any potential host. That means we can't try to humanize it even a little. I think its name describes perfectly our difficulty in understanding it, it's not an animal, not a robot, not a demon, it's just a Thing. Some might even call it, with reason, ''Lovecraftian'' for its otherworldly nature.

So here is my explanation of why it's the scariest of them all. If I do this CMV it's because the movie The Thing was the very first horror movie I've seen (I did see The Birds by Hitchcock prior but it's clearly not in the same league), and it holds a special place in my heart so I'm might be biased. Secondly, since I didn't watch, read, or play every piece of horror media that ever existed, I might have missed an ever scarier monster. But until then, I stand my ground!"

I think this realm is essentially the same as any other fictional concepts we have come up with. 

For one, it is encoded in the electrical and chemical impulses of the brain. Just like any other thoughts we have , they are only abstract in the sense that they only exist in our heads. 
If it is physical in origin and interpreted physically andd communicated physically then how could it be something other than physical. 

The nature of them(metaphysical topics)being beyond empirical observation is due to limitations in our ability to decode the electrical and chemical impulses in the brain. As well as the fictional, imaginary nature of these topics. 

Such a vast majority of our arguments and opinions are imaginary distinctions and concepts that only exist with a human mind. To take these things and try and give them actual status that can be argued over in any objective way doesn’t make sense to me. Good and evil aren’t some actual existent things that we must uncover and understand, they are imaginary concepts that can never be objectively agreed upon. This is the case with all metaphysics. 

In short , im a philisophical nominalist it seems.
I admit these concepts can effect human behavior and that they exist as ideas in the physical realm , but there is no metaphysical realm where abstract ideas and concepts exist. We made them all up."

But on to the CMV … for more than 20 years the Palestinian people have allowed Hamas (unarguably a terrorist organization) to be in control of the state. And during that time Hamas has instigated fighting/terror against Israel while not  willing to accepting or negotiate a peace agreement.  Over this time, I have not heard of the Palestinian people standing up to Hamas, protesting their violent and cruel terrorist ways, or doing anything about the weapons stored amongst their people and children that has made them targets.  It is a sad and horrible situation but if the people of Palestine have been complacent in Hamas’ actions .. well don’t they hold some accountability no matter how poor or powerless they may be?"

It seems like people instantly assume that 'more armor' and 'battle formations' trump those who dont have it. 
The only claim people have is ""vikings and the Cult of Odin were only the minority and that most of them were farmers, hunters, fishermen, and craftsmen. There other claim is something akin to ""the vikings only attacked poorly defended churches and killed 'innocent townspeople, then fleeing before an actual army came.""

I find that hard to believe, for theres always a chance for a bandit attack on the street or in the night. Maybe one of the English kings is going to decide to take over your town. Maybe your neighbor is sick of your shit and wants money from you for some reason.
The Germans supposedly chose to go to battle with little clothing or buck naked. Even the mighty Celts were wary of the Germans and for a people who were always painted as ruthless warriors. The Celts claimed that is was actually the Germans who were the Barbarians. They also were so formidible that the Romans and many others feared them, and managed to recruit many of them. Most victories from armies opposed to the Germans and Norse were due to help from the Germans and Norse.
Tell me why those mere hunters, craftsmen, farmers and fishermen were one of the worst problems for some of the largest superpowers in the world. Especially when people say the battles were 50/50. There were peasants and simple townsfolk filling the armies on both sides. 
Alfred the Great had peasants in his warbands fighting the vikings, who were also peasants, they would go and fight then return to their homesteads to work on their crops. Just like the Vikings. And even then, the trained soldiers also had a hell of a time, fighting fishermen. 
Another weird thing is that people seem to think that peasants and monks were just defenseless pascifists. Disregarding the idea that there could be local struggles against bandits or fueds involving neighbors with ill intent. Christianity used to be a warlike religion, and in the North, it had to be in order for the Norse to understand it and appreciate it. They painted Christ as a tribal Chieftan for the Germans to like."
1,2023-10-29,CMV: Rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is not a valid disorder,u/RyanBleazard,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j893t/cmv_rejection_sensitive_dysphoria_rsd_is_not_a/,changemyview,"It has been proposed by a well known clinician that ADHD may be associated with a new disorder known as Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. According to Dodson, people with ADHD are more likely to develop this other disorder, which is characterised by *'an extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception that a person has been rejected or criticized by important people in their life. It may also be triggered by a sense of falling short—failing to meet their own high standards or others'* \- (*Additude* article).

RSD is unnecessary to account for the strong emotional reactions people with ADHD may have to social rejection or other provocative events like failure to meet goals. It is not a valid disorder with empirical basis in the scientific literature. The problems it includes are already better accounted for by the fact that ADHD involves poor executive functioning and one important such function is emotional self-regulation. That component already explains the high likelihood of executive dysfunction occasioning strong emotional reactions to numerous events than does RSD.  
Emotional regulation, in essence, refers to a variety of steps in the ability to handle emotion:

\- inhibiting inappropriate behaviour related to strong positive or negative emotions that are being elicited by environmental events (response suppression)  
\- engaging in various self-directed behaviours to soothe and down-regulate physiological arousal as a result of these emotionally provocative events  
\- refocusing attention away from emotional triggers either cognitively or physically  
\- organise emotions for coordinated action in the service of goals and long-term welfare  
   
Given that people with ADHD have problems with emotional self-control plus inhibition, we'd expect to see a number of issues, not the least of which are include highly impulsive emotions, low frustration tolerance, impatience, quickness to anger, heightened emotional excitability and reactivity, and unfiltered emotional expression.

It's easy to see why people with ADHD would be viewed as more emotional, particularly in response to social rejection or to the failure to meet or attend to circumstantial expectations. We don't need RSD to explain that - we already have this part of ADHD - and more broadly, executive functioning, a well accepted aspect of ADHD with substantial research behind it to show this explains those kind of reactions. There's no need for us to introduce another disorder to account for this.

The diagnosis of RSD might lead to individuals being treated inappropriately for this additional apparent mood disorder when in fact, their emotional problems are accounted for by ADHD and can be managed through appropriate forms of licensed treatments such as the ADHD approved medications or CBT.

Moreover, what RSD is doing is assigning each little potential emotional provocation and turning it into a disorder. If I experience road rage and I have ADHD, are we now going to have road rage syndrome? Or if I lock my car keys in my car as one adult weightlifter with ADHD did and then proceeded to tear the door off the car to retrieve it, does said individual have automobile rejection sensitivity disorder? You see how ridiculous this gets? Whereas we already have one broad concept accounting for each specific context that the symptom of poor emotional regulation shows up."

1,2023-10-29,"CMV: The primary reason that the ""gun debate"" in America doesn't work is that people tend to argue ""justifications"" for opposing gun control, rather than ""reasons.""",u/BackAlleySurgeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j8xme/cmv_the_primary_reason_that_the_gun_debate_in/,changemyview,"I would've been more clear on the post title, but there's only so much room so I used words I'd have to define later. Here's what I mean. A ""reason"" for a political view is your actual primary internal explanation to yourself about why you believe what you believe. A ""justification"" is another, alternative explanation that *could* be a reason for your view, but, in fact, is not. 

Here's an example. Let's say politicians introduced a bill to ban yoga pants, ostensibly because they cause so much distraction that it's hurting the economy. A ton of people get very upset about this proposed law. A man named Bob gets upset because he likes women's appearance when they wear yoga pants. Bob goes on TV the next day and explains why this bill is bad. He says, ""This bill violates the 1st amendment freedom of expression! And if we allow this law, soon women will be forced to wear burqas! It's just one step from there to putting down all expressive dissent with our patriarchal society! And it wouldn't even work! Men will get just as distracted by women in jeans!"" The ""reason"" that Bob opposes the bill is because he likes the way women look in yoga pants. The ""justifications"" are the things he said on TV.

Now let's make the analogy perfectly clear. Most people that oppose gun control legislation, oppose it primarily because they like their guns. That is their ""reason."" Maybe they hunt or skeet shoot or maybe they just collect them or they just like the image of them. A smaller proportion oppose gun control legislation because they're very concerned with personal self-defense. That is their ""reason."" They don't really ""like"" their gun any more than they ""like"" their screwdriver. But they see it as a useful tool. Then there's an exceedingly small portion that oppose gun control because they believe they need guns to fight a tyrannical government. That is their ""reason."" Another exceedingly small portion opposes gun control because they simply think gun control is purposeless; even if all guns were gone, the same amount of violence would occur through other means."" That's their ""reason.""

However, when people argue about this issue, the less common ""reasons"" are the typical ""justification."" Ted Cruz never argues that his constituents should keep their guns just cuz they like 'em. 

The issue with arguing justifications is not that they're inherently bad or invalid; rather, the issue is that when they are shown to be bad or invalid, such a showing has no effect on the underlying debate. Bob may be right that a yoga pants ban could be violative of the first amendment and could be oppressive to women and could be pointless at fixing the economy. But, hypothetically, even if it were shown that all those explanations are wrong, it's not going to change Bob's actual view on the issue. And since Bob has no real internal attachment to these arguments, he can continue arguing them far after it's clear that they have no merit. This crowds out real debate and real discussion.

That's the problem with the gun debate today. If everyone who primarily just liked guns came out and said that, then we could have a real national discussion about the degree to which your hobbies and interests must give way to the safety of others. I think an appropriate compromise would be reached after that. Your hobbies and interests *shouldn't* entirely give way to other people's concerns about safety. There's no constitutional provision discussing peanut butter, but it'd be silly to ban it on the basis that some people have allergies.

But we never have that real discussion because gun control opponents constantly argue about how they need guns to fight tyranny and ""guns don't kill people, people kill people.""

And just as a quick coda, I think this this issue is a big problem in all political debate today. Republicans are more commonly guilty of arguing justifications rather than reasons, but a) Dems do it sometimes too (your reason for wanting student loans forgiven is typically not the ostensible benefit to the economy, but the benefit to your wallet) and b) Dems kind of push Republicans to argue this way by framing self-interested arguments as inherently immoral."

Most people argue that it's because of terrorism and spreading democracy.

As far as I'm concerned, these terrorist groups would not be so large, if the USA were not occupying these countries. Also, what business do we have to go in and force these countries to be democratic? The people decide what they want, not the United States. The USA would need to stay in these countries for generations until it forced the people to bend to their will. 

As it pertains to America protecting its ally Israel.  Why is it the USAs job to get in the middle. I just don't get why the US needs to come to attack other countries for the sake of protecting Israel. We already provied plenty of defense. I think the US getting involved is making the conflict worse and making relations with other countries tenuous. 

The only reason I can see is that the people in the government are making money off the conflict and using these countries to fight proxy wars (to avoid direct war with Russia). I don't have a whole lot of evidence to my viewpoint. 

I'd greatly appreciate some booke recs explaining the conflicts in the middle east and why America should/shouldn't be in these conflicts."

In both cases, the other party was made to pay for the damages that they caused, but they weren't made to pay for my time in solving the issue. How is that fair? They get to waste my time for nothing. The guy who rear-ended me should be required to pay for the several hours I spent getting body work done. The Amazon seller that shipped me the device should be required to pay me a fee for repacking their device and sending it back to them.

1,2023-10-29,"CMV: Unbridled acceptance of ""diversity"" has taken Europe back to its darkest days - the 1920s-1940s",u/My_Feet_Are_Cold_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j9szn/cmv_unbridled_acceptance_of_diversity_has_taken/,changemyview,"The unbridled acceptance of ""diversity"" in Europe is a topic that invites critical scrutiny and consideration. While the principle of diversity and tolerance is an essential pillar of a democratic society, it is essential to reflect on the extent to which tolerance is taken, especially when it comes to values that might be at odds with the core values of the host society. In this argument, I will explore how unregulated tolerance has allowed regressive Islamic values to take root in the West, potentially leading to widespread antisemitism and the need for greater regulation of tolerance to ensure the values upheld align with those of the host society.  
One of the core arguments against unbridled acceptance of diversity lies in the integration of regressive Islamic values in the West. It is crucial to acknowledge that not all aspects of any culture are in direct opposition to Western values. However, there are elements within some interpretations of Islam that can challenge the principles of equality, freedom, and tolerance that Western societies hold dear. Unregulated tolerance has allowed these values to proliferate, often at the expense of the core values of the host society.  
In Europe, a continent that vowed ""never again"" after the horrors of the Holocaust, it is disheartening to see the rise of antisemitism in recent days following the israel-Palestine war. Some argue that unregulated tolerance has inadvertently contributed to this concerning trend. Regressive Islamic values, in some instances, harbor anti-Semitic sentiments. By tolerating these values without scrutinizing their compatibility with European values, we risk allowing antisemitism to flourish. It is a painful irony that Europe, which experienced the atrocities of the Holocaust, now faces widespread antisemitism on its doorstep.  
While tolerance is a noble and essential value, it must be balanced with an understanding that not all beliefs and practices align with the principles of democracy, equality, and human rights. The argument here is not against diversity itself but rather against an unregulated, blind acceptance of values that run counter to the foundational values of the host society. Striking the right balance between tolerance and the preservation of core values is crucial to maintaining the social cohesion that European societies have worked hard to build.  
In conclusion, unbridled acceptance of ""diversity"" has, in some instances, allowed regressive Islamic values to take root in the West. This has contributed to the rise of antisemitism in a region that pledged never to forget the lessons of the Holocaust. It is not a call to end diversity or tolerance, but rather to regulate and ensure that these values align with the core principles of Western societies. Europe must find the balance that enables diversity while safeguarding its fundamental values, ultimately upholding the promise of ""never again."" I think it's time to start deporting those who are actively hostile toward the values of the majority, and to start regulating assimilation more. 

Failure to do either will either result in an empowered Islamist contingent in the West attempting intifada OR it will lead to a significant rise in the far right, neither of which outcomes are desirable.

Europe needs to get its act together and handle the threat of hostile views further taking root. Blindly accepting ""diversity"" and not questioning, or policing its integration, has ultimately led Europe to scenes not seen since the 1920s-1940.

Diversity is not the West's greatest strength, and in fact could quickly prove to be its biggest weakness if it is not managed in light of the incoming threats it poses."
1,2023-10-29,CMV: Fulton county should not have indicted former President Donald J. Trump.,u/JianJiaHei,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17jab8x/cmv_fulton_county_should_not_have_indicted_former/,changemyview,"I am a Georgia resident and I support/voted for President Biden, Senator Warnock, and Senator Ossoff. I am proud to be a part of the change in Georgia to make the Democratic policies a reality.

For weeks I followed the Fulton county indictment of former President Donald J. Trump and while I disagree with 90% of his platform/actions, I am starting to think the indictment is unreasonable. Here are my reasons:

1. **A higher degree of evidences should be required to indict a President/Former President/Presidential Candidate**: I understand that the goal is we are equal under the law. But we already have unwritten practice in place to make exceptions, such as the 60-day rule which traditionally avoids taking investigative steps close to an election that could influence how people vote. To bring any legal actions against Trump, a former President and a Presidential candidate, the bar to clear should be higher than any ordinary citizens.

2. **Lack of Direct Evidences**: I followed the indictment for weeks and while there are strong evidences to suggest that Trump supporters execute a fake electors' plot with forged federal documents and impersonation of public officers; I fail to see a single text, email, phone call, or record of verbal communication that directly implicate Trump in his acknowledge of the plot. That is why, I presume, that only Fulton county DA decided to indict Trump due to the availability of RICO laws in the state, and not in other states/counties where similar plots took place.

3. **Reliability of RICO on the basis of legality**: I am not a legal expert and my legal knowledge are based on TV shows/movies/documentaries I watched so I am probably just asking for help here. While RICO has a lower threshold of burden of proof where the prosecution only need to show that Trump belongs to a criminal enterprise and establish a pattern of criminal behavior of said enterprise. Well, how do you separate a Presidential Administration/Campaign from a criminal enterprise? Trump can very well argue that he does not know anything about the plot, and just because his team went on to organize criminal acts, that doesn't mean Trump is part of the criminal enterprise, he was simply their boss from a legal standpoint. I understand that several of the co-defendants already turned, so here is my next point.

4. **Reliability of RICO on the basis of morality**: RICO is designed to incentivize mid-level crime bosses to turn on their head of enterprise. By giving sweetheart deals to folks like Powell and Ellis with 0 jail time, the county DA is basically begging them to turn on Trump to save themselves. But is this morally reprehensible? I watched TV shows like ""Life"" and other cases where those who committed crimes turn on their boss from a legitimate business in order to get lighter sentence, despite the fact that the boss have zero knowledge/intention to commit said crimes. Even if I believe that Trump probably know about the crimes, the only real evidences against him in this case are the turning witness testimonies, which can very well be false due to the incentives given by the prosecutors.

In conclusion, should Fulton county bring out an, at best, 50/50 case against a President/candidate with the real possibility of clouding voters' judgement? In the end, shouldn't we the Democrats go out and vote next Nov to defeat Trumpism at the election instead of playing legal games?"

1,2023-10-29,CMV: The term Zionist is used a weapon against Jews and has big antisemitic undertones,u/AxlLight,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17jbf66/cmv_the_term_zionist_is_used_a_weapon_against/,changemyview,"**I'll start with the view and then explain:**Using the term Zionist is a often a dogwhistle attack at Jews and is incredibly antisemitic, some use it legitimately, but because of the difficulty in distinguishing the two and the accusatory nature of use by almost all people - it should be seen as antisemitic and removed from speech.

**Now to clarify:**

First, I am aware that Zionist is a term Jews created and are using themselves in Israel all the time in legitimate use. To those unfamiliar, it is a term derived from the word Zion - another name for Jerusalem, and embodies the hopes and wishes of Jews in exile to one day return home and rebuild an Israeli country to call their own.To put simply - It is an ideological view that there should be a Jewish homeland for Jews and it should be in Zion. And while there are a lot of different views within that ideology about how, when and where the base concept is that.

And it is also okay to be critical against that view ideology without being antisemitic\*.

**So why do I still think it's antisemitic?**

0 - Preface - I'll preface by saying this is not universal, and there might be plenty who use the term Zionist in good faith and have no ill intent. But because it's indistinguishable from those who do have ill intent, the good people end up being a shield for antisemites to hide behind and whitewash their racist hate.1 - **Negative context of the term** \- So to start, it is quite clear that when many discuss Zionism outside of Israel and the Jewish world, they intend it as a negative action of taking other people's land and forcibly building a country in it. It connects Israel's current actions which are perceived as genocide and attempted ethnocleansing of another population in the purpose of realizing the full Zionist dream. It looks at the actions of 1948 through the lens of the end results of today, and sees the whole concept of Zionism as corrupt and poisonous from the very roots of it.And thus for many people, supporting Zionism is for all intents and purposes supporting genocide.

2 - **Interlinking the (negative) term with Jewish people** \- Because Zionism deals with the Jewish population, it ends being a question of each Jew if they support Zionism or not. Nowadays, it is being asked in a pretty aggressive manner towards many Jews whether or not they're Zionists. Even removing the negative context, this has antisemitic undertones since you're posing a question only towards one ethnic group and when you add the context, you're basically putting their backs against the wall, painting a target and then giving them one last chance to correct themselves.It is an attempt to separate the ""clean"" Jews from the ""dirty"" ones, and while it's a question now - how long before it's an assumption made towards every Jew without giving them time to distance themselves.

This is basically linking the two terms together, and ignoring the fact Zionists can be (and are) non-Jews too.

3 - **Using the terms interchangeably** \- In places where antisemitism is more widespread, like many Arab countries, the two terms are used pretty interchangeably, with some organizations only using the term Zionist as to avoid being seen as antisemitic. And whether or not the use is purposeful or a a byproduct of years of rhetorics against Israel - the result remains the same. A Jew is a Zionist and a Zionist is a Jew.

4 - **The historical use of the term to raise antisemitism in the world** \- When we look back to the start of Zionism, and the previous wave of antisemitism in the world, we can see that anti-zionism was used heavily as a tool to spread antisemitism around the world. The fact that there really was a Zionist organization in the start of the 20th century helped it be a pointed weapon towards Jews, creating big conspiracy theories about Zionists and their plans for world domination. Most famously, the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' was the biggest fabricated weapon to target Jews indirectly. It originated in Russia as part of the protests and pogroms against Jews which displaced and killed thousands of Jews.It was later adopted by Hitler and used to showcase reasons to hate the Jews, pointing and linking Zionism and Jews. While internally, Hitler didn't discuss Zionism much - externally, he used it as the primary export with which to spread antisemitism in other countries, most specifically, in Arab countries.And it worked too, Arab leaders were already weary of Zionist attempts to settle in Palestine, buying land and immigrating there in masse, and the 1917 Balfour Declaration served as proof that something sinister is brewing. So when Nazi relations with Arab countries tightened, it was easy to point the finger towards all the Jews living in their lands and paint them as evil Zionists that should be killed or expelled (ironically pushing them to Israel).Jews living in many of these Arab countries did not leave due to Zionism, but rather being pushed out for their religion/ethnicity. So there's a demonstrable example of how Anti-Zionism ends up in Antisemitism.

5 - **Anti-Israel vs Anti-Zionism** \- Most anti-Zionist are also not really arguing against the ideological belief that Jewish people should have a home but rather the current actions of the Israel government which might be rooted in Zionism, but aren't necessarily linked. Anti-Zionism might have had a purpose in the years leading up to 1948 since Israel was still not a fact and one could argue against the idea or concept of its formation. But it's been 75 years since, and at this point any beef one has against Israel should be against Israel. There's no reason to be against Zionism since Zionist has already been realized.But more to the point, if you object to what you perceive as genocide or ethnic cleansing, and object to Israel's apartheid practices against Palestine, you should object to Israel or Israel's government. Zionism has nothing to do with it (Well, I concede that Israelis are still motivated by Zionism and one can say that the current government is lead by extreme zionistic ideology. But why muddle the water here when it's easier to stay clean and just object and criticize Israel's current regime).

6\* - **Complexity of being anti-Zionist** \- Even if we say there's merit here to be criticize Zionism since Israel's government is lead by that ideology, what exactly is anti-Zionism? Is it being against Israel as a concept in general, is it against Israel being where it is, or is it just against the idea of  Israel expanding?Since at the base of it Zionism is the ideology that Jews should have a homeland. Being against that, is in a way, being against Jews having an ethnic home. Something that 90%+ all other ethnic groups have and something that all big religions have too, a religious country that protects it. Christianity has plenty (Greece, Denmark, Norway, Argentina, Hungary, Iceland, the Vatican obviously) and Muslim obviously has many countries were Islam is the dominant and protected religion. If you object to the idea of a religious state, why not object to those of other religions?

If you accept that Judaism should have a home and only object to the location, then you only partially object to Zionism which makes it harder to be completely anti-Zionist, but more to the point - Where then? If you object to Zionism at this point in time - are you not just calling for the banishment of 8M Jews from what they've known as their home for the past 75 years, most born to only know it as their home. How is anti-Zionism then not a call to ethnic cleansing?(And if you only object to further expansion and current occupation, then you're pretty much objecting to Israel's actions first and foremost so why tie it with Zionism when that makes it much less clear what you object to).

7 - **Parallels to Jihad -** Just to paint a wider picture here. As a Jewish person, asking me pointedly if I'm a Zionist only because of my ethnicity (as many Jews are practically atheists) especially when it's clear you see Zionism as evil is no different than asking a Muslim if he's a Jihadist. Jihad too is an idea that is even more complex than Zionism and can have plenty of positive implications, but when one asks that of a Muslims, they're obviously relating it to a the negative aspect and ready to attack them. We'd obviously understand how that's wrong even just asking that question, regardless of intention.So why is it not even seen as problematic against Jews?

In summary, calling someone a Zionist can be a slur since many intend it as an accusation of ""support for occupation, genocide and ethno-cleansing"". That term is only being thrown towards Jews and many use it as a tool to separate Jews who you can hate and Jews you shouldn't. In the past it was used to breed undercover antisemitism and since it's only used against Jews but has ""legitimate"" grounds it's nearly impossible to distinguish between legitimate use of the term and a hate-crime use of it.Because of it, this term should really not be used by anyone who is not antisemitic and can instead be replaced with anti Israel rhetorics which is what most non antisemitic people refer to anyway."

Just another example of the privileged elite rigging the game of life in their favor. 

I’m not necessarily saying “lol fu*k your feeling,” but they’re not a good basis for making policy.

Let’s say Company X trades at $30 a share today. Two weeks from now, it will sign a deal to sell itself for $65 a share. I work at X, am aware of this deal now, and am dumb enough to buy 1 million shares of X stock. 

Two weeks later, I’m suddenly ~$35 million richer (until I’m hauled off to prison, sadly).

Who exactly did I harm? Did I force anyone to sell me their shares for $30? Of course not. They already  made a decision to sell and I gave them a buyer. If it weren’t me, they would’ve sold to someone else. 

If I were feeling froggy this afternoon, I’d go on the counteroffensive and say it’s GOOD for share prices to reflect all available information asap. But you’re likely to puke on this take.

Note: assume I’ve already heard and dismissed every response that seems pretty obvious (“omg what if retail investors lose faith in markets??”), but I’m happy to address them if you like. There’s a subtle take involving market makers that could win me over, but not sure anyone will raise it

It can make people more committed in their marriages by discouraging cheating and building trust.

If cheating is against the law, it might make folks think twice before having affairs because they could face legal trouble.

This law could also help protect the feelings and money of the person who was cheated on, especially if it leads to a divorce.

By banning cheating, we'd be saying that faithfulness in relationships is really important, which is a value many people share.

And there's a bonus: it could lower the hurt and health risks from cheating and prevent the spread of diseases."

These endeavors can lead to profiling, stigmatization, foster an unhealthy (and frankly disturbing) fixation on race, and is quite frankly irrelevant. Why does the bank need to know my race when I file for a deposit or loan? Why do they need to know ANYTHING else except for my credit scores, financial situation, etc? 

Also, the way they set up these fucking applications are set up is weird. They often look like this:

Hispanic White

Hispanic Black

Hispanic Other

If checked yes for Hispanic, choose (Cuban, Colombian, Guatemalan, Mexican, Peruvian, etc etc etc)

Asian or Pacific Islander (then makes me choose Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Thai, etc etc etc)

Indigenous American or Native Alaskan

Black

White (including Middle Eastern)

Some forms have slightly differing formats, but this is the most common format I've seen. I'm Asian, half Chinese half Korean, and IDK if I'm supposed to choose both Korean and Chinese, other, or what. It's unclear. Also, my Middle Eastern friend brought up how it's weird that they give so many diverse options for Hispanic and Asian people, but just lump white and Middle Eastern people together and don't give more in depth answers, and that lumping in Middle Eastern with white doesn't really make sense in the first place.Lumping in Asians and Pacific Islanders together doesn't make much sense either. Also, why say ""Hispanic"" instead of ""Latino?"" What are Brazilians supposed to put lol? What about Indigenous South Americans, or Mestizo latinos? Should they choose ""Hispanic other?""

This seems shockingly similar to the racial profiling and tests employed to legitimize the 1 drop rule in the segregated South. Conservatives don't like this because it makes us focus on race, which is valid. Liberals SHOULDN'T like it because it leads to profiling.

Let’s use insulin as an example. The patent for insulin is owned by 4 companies (Eli Lilly, sanofi, novo nordisk and pfizer). The creator of this lifesaving drug gave the patent away for $1 in the hopes of this life saving drug being mass produced and sold affordably to those who need it.  Insulin cost about $3 a vial to produce and these companies have hiked the price up to above $100 in some cases, more. The patent is also actively protected by these companies so the price of insulin can not be dropped by an outside company. Blackrock is also the largest shareholder in every single one of these companies. Effectively this means blackrock (a company with more revenue then almost every country on earth) owns the patent for insulin and sets the price."
1,2023-10-29,CMV: This new NBA in-season tournament will do nothing to engage the fans.,u/drygnfyre,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17jink5/cmv_this_new_nba_inseason_tournament_will_do/,changemyview,"Here is my understanding of the new in-season tournament: a set number of regular seasons games will count towards an in-season tournament. At the end of this set number of regular season games, the team that does the best wins the new NBA Cup.

If I am wrong there, correct me.

Now, here's my issue: I don't ""get"" why this is something I, the fan, would be engaged with. For what it's worth, I'm a Lakers fan. The Lakers have won 17 NBA Championships in their history. What I, the fan, care about is winning the NBA Finals. Just like it's safe to assume a hockey fan would want their team to win the Stanley Cup, or a baseball fan would want their team to win the World Series. Why should I, the fan, care about the Lakers winning the NBA Cup if they don't win the NBA Finals?

As evidence, every major North American sport that I'm aware of has some kind of trophy or reward for winning your league or conference. Baseball has the pennant, for example. And yet how often does the typical fan celebrate their team winning that? They would either focus on the World Series, or completely ignore the pennant because they lost the World Series.

That's where I am confused by this new NBA in-season tournament. If the purpose is to make me more interested in the regular season, I don't really see how. If my team has a good regular season, they will qualify for the playoffs anyway. If they win the NBA Cup but lose the NBA Finals, it will still be seen as a failure of a season. If it's supposed to engage the players, well, same issue, aren't they going to want to win the NBA Finals and the Larry O'Brein Trophy more than the NBA Cup?"

Then creates NATO, forcing countries to join, controlled by the US to control Europe (Europe is a vassal of the US), attack Russia whenever they want. doing terrorist attacks to keep their imperialist power.

American companies are stealing our gold and other resources and not letting us prosper.

And of course the invasions in Africa, Middle East and South America. No need to explain.

Why?  What age range is it ok then? 

In a world where we beg to “let kids be kids” why is a 14 even 17 year old not yet adult is given grief when dressing up, enjoying the outdoors, spending time with friends or family or even alone and getting free candy? 

Isn’t this better than many other possibly delinquent activities they could be doing? Is it too naïve to think that kids who are out causing trouble might be less inclined to smash pumpkins if they didn’t feel it was “uncool” to trick-or-treat and felt more welcomed to participate?

Some kids that appear old as well may just look older, may be developmentally delayed, may not have other friends or family to hang out with that night and this is an activity they can participate in and enjoy but then they hear “you look a little old….”

I was so obsessed with the movie that I researched everything about it and I was so excited to find out that it was based on true events. However loosely it was.

I've watched hundreds of Western movies. Including unforgivable, the quick and the dead, 3:10 to Yuma, and just so many more. Above all I can't find anybody that I like better than Doc Holliday and that is the reason that this remains my favorite movie."

Companies will push our planet to the breaking point while our governments institute minor restrictions on their activity that either get ignored or which they pay a meagre fine to just get pass onto the consumer.

Communist countries, meanwhile, have turned third world back waters into economic juggernauts, doubled life expectancies in a few decades, brought universal equality and a high relative standard of living, and are able to initiate long term economic plans. Cuba is embargoed, resource poor, and struggles economically, but still has the highest quality of life in the Caribbean even though it’s neighbours should have more advantages. These countries, if they survive long enough, overcome past errors and reverse previously disastrous policies (China’s rapid turn to carbon neutrality, Cuba’s move to sustainable agriculture over sugar monocropping), which capitalist nations simply do not. In fact, the opposite occurs: the 8 hour work day is being erased, child labour legalized, and minority rights trampled. 

Despite their mistakes, communist countries do far better with what they’ve got and actively work towards a brighter future, rather than impoverishing the working class indefinitely so an ever diminishing caste of elites can get ever wealthier"

It's making the movement come off as ideological instead of rational as well as ambivalent to human suffering, not unlike the ways in which Israel has been ideological and ambivalent to the suffering of Palestinians. I think, to most people, the very true fact that Israel's treatment of Palestine *explains* the situation is simply not enough to *justify* the deaths of civilians, and that disconnect is hurting the reputation of the free Palestine movement. Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were ""necessary"" or, in so many words, that ""Israel had it coming."" Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments.

While I'm not sure there's anything inherently wrong with quickly terminating the life of a non-viable fetus, I don't think I'd want to live in a society where this was an accepted norm. I think it's a very healthy human instinct to anthropomorphize and sympathise with sentient beings that are perceived as 'defenseless', and this sentiment is where I believe many pro-lifers come from. 

That said, I'm also a feminist. And I find it absurd to demand that women sacrifice bodily autonomy just because they're biologically wired to carry a pregnancy. So the way I see it in an ideal world, for both pro-lifers/choicers, we'd find a way to ensure millions of fetuses are not aborted, while at the same time not curtailing a woman's right to choose. 

If that's the case, male contraception is the PERFECT solution. Condoms are 99% effective when used correctly, the least expensive, most available and have practically no side effects. So why is it that while I've hear every pro-life stance ranging from the 'poor fetus' to 'women who abort are monsters', In all my years on the internet I haven't run into a single pro-lifer faulting men for the abortion stats they so vehemently condemn? 

Why is all the hell-fire reserved for feminism and women, when if they redirected their attention to men they're guaranteed to have better results? 

I'd love to hear a counter-argument on why the pro-life stance is allowed to be so focused on women while giving guys what to me looks like a free pass."

In my experience their support seems more of a concern response to having guns being kept out of the black community than a a real desire to own weapons. They certainly are not the ones refusing to allow any gun reform to take place.
Whereas the white conservatives, republicans, evangelicals all seem to agree that Guns need to be as available and proliferate as possible, especially within the white community. 


Through much of the history of this country black peoples have not been legally allowed to own guns in much of the southern states. Once civil rights became an issue and black peoples started owning and carrying firearms. The only federal restrictions to ever exist were put in place. Since their expiration the number of weapons in American households have only increased, and increased exponentially. Obama  won his first term, guns sales went up. Obama won a second term gun sales went up. Joe Biden won, gun sales went up. And the explanation has always been that there is a fear that “ they are coming for our guns” nope. I don’t buy that. How does owning a ridiculous amount of firearms protect you from 1) the legal requirement to surrender your firearms in the event of government action? 2) the financial penalties of not complying with any law. 3) the  “firepower” of the government, they have missiles, and bombs,  and sneaky little drones with missiles and bombs?  Like make it make sense?

And this “militia” argument… “against government tyranny” again, does anyone really believe these people think they can hold the American government at gun point ?
The only thing that makes any sense is owning guns is about power over you fellow Americans. The idea built into the constitution that some humans are better than other humans and the only way to control lesser humans is with guns. Fear of death to, elicit a desired response. I have owned weapons, there are so many things that can accidentally go wrong and we all see the evidence of that. We would see more evidence of it, but, the American government is not allowed to track accidental gun deaths. I truly believe they are to be respected and used with respect for human life. But I myself respect all human life. The very substance behind white supremacy is that some lives matter less than others. 


As evidenced by the death and destruction in Palestine, nothing out guns a well gunned government. So outside of a fear of civil war with their fellow citizens. Or a zombie apocalypse, what else would explain the willingness to watch Children die from gun violence, every day. ( say children because adults dying from a gunshot is obviously a feature not a flaw, I would hope that’s not true for children dying) 

I say this: I really hope someone can change my mind, because I don’t have a lot of hope for the future of this country anymore. I really don’t."

Both groups have a historical claim to the land (i.e., both cohorts have occupied the space for some period of significant time), but each believes their claim is explicitly endorsed by a deity — and therein lies the rub. 

As long as each party can justify their actions as being “divinely inspired,” then it seems that it’ll just play out as one group dominating another out of existence (which would be bad). It seems like there’s a massive gap in the sort of solutioning being offered to resolve the conflict that operates exclusively in geopolitical and economic terms. But those domains aren’t very useful if either side can vaguely gesture toward faith as an external and superseding factor to excuse and explain their actions. 

I’m not going to pretend to understand *how* one would go about this (read: potential strategies: empowerment of women, economically supporting secularism (/withholding economic support to non-secular entities), and supporting universal free expression over generations?), but it seems important to acknowledge that so long as each group operates irrationally, then applying exclusively rational solutions isn’t necessarily going to do or change anything. And that’s exactly what we have seen over the last (insert a big number) generations. It’s like trying to balance the books with an accountant that uses the number keleven. 

Sooooooo yeah — that’s what I got. 

Tldr: addressing the common fallacy of faith seems like a more logical approach, although I am fully aware how unrealistic this is… but the current resolution paths clearly are not and have not been working."

29,2023-10-30,"CMV: Leaving a relationship which has minor children involved for the reason, ""I'm just not happy"" is not a valid moral reason for leaving a relationship/divorce.",u/Subcomfreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17jwsj0/cmv_leaving_a_relationship_which_has_minor/,changemyview,"EDIT: if this changes your perception of me, I don't plan on ever getting married or having kids, in part because I value myself over the ""water"" kids bring to my port and the risk involved if marriages go south and the harm such would cause to potential children with the current divorce rate being what it is. At least I'm consistent. I don't think its a good deal for me, so I don't make the deal, which has been my appeal throughout! I'm also not religious, just for context. 

For clarity: In abuse, certainly valid moral reason to leave. I could see cheating which is persistent and pernicious to also be a valid reason. I can see various other reasons like criminal behavior, drug abuse, refusing to work and pull one's weight, child neglect, etc. also being more than valid. Additionally, due to reduced harms, after the kids are 18 the ""I'm just not happy"" reason is allowed. **Again, it's only when you are in a relationship with kids under the roof.**

However, simply because one ""isn't happy"" or one doesn't have the ""excitement"" or other such personal pleasure reasons is not a valid moral reason to break up a relationship with children involved.

Reasons:

1) Single parent households lead to dramatically worse outcomes (on average) for the children. In terms on future income, in terms of crime rates, in terms of mental/emotional troubles, etc. Your own happiness is clearly counter-balanced by the negative impacts on the children. The children count for just as much as you. Is your momentary happiness worth more than the life-time of impacts such would have on the children? I think not. When you have a kid you have a duty to do the best for them, not a duty to do best for you!

2) Represents a re-neg on one's commitment for the relationship. One can't re-write the terms of a bargain simply because one isn't happy. Does this mean that a couple shouldn't work out its problems, of course not, however, breaking up a relationship simply out of a lack of personal pleasure was never the deal that marriage or long-term relationships propose (we even say in vows, ""for better or worse""). Rather, such is a deal based around duty and providing children a starting point for their future life.

3) One's happiness is one's own responsibility. Making one's partner the external source for one's own happiness isn't fair to the partner.

4) Breaking up relationships for personal happiness reasons encourages and validates long-term relationships (with children) and Marriages being transitory and erodes their meaning. It devalues commitment and trust, because at any moment if partner isn't happy it becomes morally acceptable to break up the family, harm the kids, harm the financial situation, etc. Therefore, eliminating mere personal happiness from the equation strengthens the meaning of commitment and encourages families to work out their problems and encourages deeper thinking before making long-term commitments in relationships. It also sets example for kids that if one does want to have kids with someone they had better work on that relationship and think deeply, as they simply can't re-neg if they ""don't like it"" 7 years down the line. 

5) Validating leaving for simple happiness sends bad messages to society and children about relationships. It forces one into a self-centered hedonistic view of relationships where only the individual counts and not the other people who are impacted in the relationship.

6) Increases financial family stability as well as financial opportunity for children. It also increases the amount of time parents can spend with their children due to being a two income household as opposed to a single parent one. 

7) Gives children safety and security and trust that mom and dad will both be there after school. 

8) Allows for same gender role-models to be there at all times for the children. Which is also important.

Delta will be given if one can produce a reason for someone to break up a relationship simply out of personal pleasure that does NOT involve:
Abuse, child neglect, criminal behavior, drug abuse, negative financial situations (ex. scum-bag don't want to work and sits home all day and does nothing... which would probably be financial abuse!), cheating, etc...

Again, for me to change my mind here I need clear argument for why my personal pleasure or dissatisfaction alone is enough to break up a relationship with children involved."

As some echo chambers do with opinions they dislike.

So whenever I hear people say that social media allows people to become radicalized, I’m kind of left wondering; rather than shutting out whatever opinions popular opinion is arbitrarily biased against this week, why not forbid sites from shutting out dissent? That way, if someone is being “radicalized” by being in an echo chamber of like minded people, the rest of us have an opportunity to refute them, the people in charge of such echo chambers cannot conceal from them our rebuttals, and we’re finally playing on a (somewhat) closer to level playing field as far as debate goes?

E.G. ""I'm Pro-this"" ""I'm anti-this"" or ""I side with such and such"".

On top of that, people will call themselves liberal or conservative, or Republican or Democrat.

Not only is this an incredibly childish and simplistic way to go about politics, but it's entirely counter-productive. 

Grouping yourself into boxes and labels prevents you from being able to think critically and deeply about your beliefs. It's easier to just give yourself a label and let other people do the thinking for you. 

And on top of that, for example, if you call yourself a Vesselite (made up name), and proudly go against the Orderlites, then it makes it really hard for our natural egos to accept when your party does stupid things or does things that go against your normal moral values. This allows corrupt politicians to get away with doing shitty things because people in their party won't dare condem them because it would allow their ""enemy"" to have a leg up on them. 

This also leads to political wars, whether it be psychological wars or actual wars because no matter how wrong their own side is (that they've backed themselves into), they will still stand by them because they've already declared to the world that they are ""such and such"" and backing out of that would mean exposing their ego and admitting they are wrong, to which, most people would rather die on their hill than just admit they are wrong or just not plant themselves on a hill to begin with. 

Just approach each situation individually and condem and praise actions individually. Vote in silence and stop declaring yourself to the world for everything. But it's too easy to bunch up into groups with the internet."

While I don't think that stunting relevant statements during a political campaign should be automatic, it should be punishable via libel/slander suits to attack someone with undemonstrated/unproven statements, and political campaign statements should not be immune to those kinds of defamatory lawsuits.

Example #1 being: I do not think that putting out an attack ad stating ""Politician A is a pedophile"" should be exempt from a slander suit just because it's a political campaign statement, even though Politician A was never indicted, sued or convicted of being one, and never said as a public-facing statement that they were one.

The main problem with this, is logical conclusions from statements, which is a grey area that I believe should be fine to see protected, so long as they are logically consistent with stated claims, or already demonstrated/proven facts.

Example #2 being: If Politician A says that age of consent should be lowered to 10 years old, it would fall into logical conclusions that they may be interested in pedophilia, or trying to protect pedophiles from legal issues, and stating ""Politician A wants to lower the age of consent to 10 years old, almost like he's a pedophile just trying to make it legal"", shouldn't be libelous/slanderous.

As a flip example #3, however, taking the same idea: If Politician A says that age of consent should be lowered to 10 years old"", it also shouldn't be correct to then claim that ""Politician A wants to kidnap and kill 10 year old kids in his back shed"". This does not flow naturally from the claim, and shouldn't be immune from slander lawsuit.

I already see that one coming, though... That one line...

\> Where is the line?

The line is on whether or not someone logical could come to the same conclusion, without having to add other unproven elements. Example #3 needs to add the unproven murderous intent, for instance.

Applying this could lead to a healthier ""here is my actual plan"" type of politics, and less of a ""he's a satanic worshipper who drinks toddler blood to summon Lucifer"" politics."

1,2023-10-30,CMV: Store-bought bagels should be sliced all the way through,u/nope_nic_tesla,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17jziwn/cmv_storebought_bagels_should_be_sliced_all_the/,changemyview,"So, I eat a lot of bagels and this is something that has annoyed me for years. 

Store-bought bagels are spiral-sliced, but they don't actually slice them all the way through, so you have to slice the last bit yourself. This often leads to an irregular surface area on the bagel which makes it more difficult to evenly spread toppings, and makes crumbs all over the place.

While some may say this is a petty complaint and this doesn't really make a big difference, I disagree. It is widely recognized that the advent of sliced bread was a great thing for society, such that we even have a saying when something new is really, really great: ""the best thing since sliced bread"". Just as sliced bread was a great leap forward in convenience, so too would fully sliced bagels be. 

I have tried researching why this is, and none of the answers I have found are satisfactory. Here are the most common reasons I have found to explain why this is, and my objections:

**They do this so the halves don't get all mixed up in the bag.**

* This doesn't make sense to me, because I also buy sliced bread in bags and never once have I had a problem with the slices getting all jumbled up in the bag. The bag is shaped like a bread loaf, and comes with a tightening clip to make sure the bag is tight and secure. Bagel bags are also shaped for bagels, and have a tightening clip, so I don't see how this could be a problem. I read one comment suggesting to slice some bagels, put them back in the bag, and shake them up so you can witness this happening. So I tried it, and it didn't happen. All the bagel halves stayed together perfectly fine. 

**It keeps the bread fresher and prevents it from going stale.**

* Similar to above, I have never had this problem with sliced bread, so I don't see any reason to believe bagels would suffer a worse fate. My bread slices don't all dry out and get stale because they are sliced all the way through. I could accept that this might have *some* discernible impact on taste, but even then I think both sliced and unsliced varieties could be available as options. The convenience factor would likely outweigh any taste differences for me. 

**They do it this way because of some obscure tax in New York that taxes fully sliced bagels as prepared foods and not bakery goods, thus costing businesses more money.**

* I looked this up and this one is actually real. However, it's only in New York City, and was only implemented in 2010. It does not apply to bagels sold in grocery stores, and of course doesn't apply to the whole rest of the country. So this does not appear to be the actual reason why store-bought bagels have been doing it this way for so long. 

So, change my view. Store-bought bagels should be available fully sliced."

1,2023-10-30,"CMV: In Western nations, the talk of ""persecution"" and ""falling away/End Times"" is usually an excuse by Christians to avoid confronting their own failures or shortcomings as a religion.",u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17k09on/cmv_in_western_nations_the_talk_of_persecution/,changemyview,"First off, I don't deny that Christians are persecuted in **non**\-Western nations. If someone wants to point to Christians who are imprisoned or persecuted in North Korea, China, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, etc., you'll get no disagreement from me.

What I see in the West, however, is that Christians will talk about ""persecution"" any time they face consequences for behaving like a jerk or a hypocrite, and they will talk about a ""falling away because the End Times are near"" any time they face consequences for bad parenting or bad pastoring.

Persecution first = there's a huge difference between being persecuted because you are a good upright Christian and an evil society hates you, and being rightfully criticized because you are a hypocrite, or try to impose your religion on other people, or you're promoting something that's historically or factually inaccurate. But many western Christians try to pretend that the latter is the former.

The same is true of the ""falling away"" that Christians speak of - that as the End Times draw near, the world will become less and less Christian. They often point to the declining numbers of Christian attendance at church, Christian affiliation in Europe and America, to prove this point. But this argument makes it sound as if bad Christian teaching (prosperity gospel, false prophecies, bad theology, wrong teaching, hypocrisy) had nothing to do with it, when in fact I'd argue that it's the **leading** cause of it. The main reason for the decline of Christianity in the West is not so much that the West is out to get Christians, as it is that people increasingly demand scientific and historical proof and evidence and are not willing to just go by blind faith, and also that a heavy dose of Trumpism, Christian hypocrisy, prosperity gospel-ing has taken an immense toll and driven many people away from Christianity.

TL;DR; Christians think they are being persecuted, but in fact much of it is just them encountering the simple logical consequences of bad religion."

1,2023-10-30,CMV: There's nothing wrong with MLB's new playoff format,u/AcephalicDude,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17k0vix/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_mlbs_new_playoff/,changemyview,"For those who aren’t familiar, starting in 2022 the MLB changed their playoff format.  I won’t get into the full history of the playoff format changes, you can check that out here:

 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason

 

But basically, what we have now is a 6-team playoff format where the 2 division winners with the best records are given a bye to the quarter-final round (the “Division Series”), and the division winner with the lowest record plus 3 wild card teams (i.e. teams with the highest records without winning their division) play a “Wild Card Round” of games to secure their place in the Division Series.  The rest of the playoffs precedes as usual.

 

There are some controversies around this format, mostly centered around the concern that teams that were relatively weak during the regular season can sneak in and eliminate much “better” teams.  This was seen as more acceptable when there was only one wild card team – now, there are three.  Critics of the format are pointing to the current playoffs an example of why this is bad: the regular-season juggernaut teams were all eliminated (Braves, Dodgers, Astros, Devil Rays), and the Diamondbacks are in the World Series despite only winning 84 games in the regular season. 

 

Basically, the core of my view is that regular season achievement and playoffs achievement are two distinct things that can be appreciated separately, so it doesn’t bother me when a “weaker” team bumps a “stronger” team out of the tournament.  The gap between an 84-win team and a 100-win team is 16 games, or roughly 10% of the season.  The team with the most wins is obviously better, and that’s a massive achievement requiring consistent performances across an entire team.  However, the 100-win team isn’t *that much* better, specifically not the extent that we should ever think that their performance in ~26 playoff games would be a foregone conclusion.

 

In the regular season, we appreciate consistency.  In the playoffs, we appreciate performance.  So much about a single game of baseball is contingent, which is why we track playoff stats separately from regular season stats.  We account for the psychological dimension to the playoffs: the increased competitive pressure leads to unexpected performances.  I think it’s actually a wonderful and exciting thing for a team like the Diamondbacks to succeed in the playoffs, it affirms the importance of determination and tenacity, in addition to skill and talent.  And if the Diamondbacks go all the way, it doesn’t take anything away from the Dodgers’ regular season achievement of winning 100 regular season games and taking the NL West pennant.  The 2023 Dodgers are still objectively the “better” team, they just weren’t better for a 5-game series in October.

 

Another potential problem that people have raised about the current format is that the two teams given byes might “go cold” from having so many off-days before they play again.  I might CMV if someone can convince me that this creates a serious competitive disadvantage, but I am on the fence about it.   In 2023, of the 4 teams given byes only the Astros survived into the next round; but also, of the four teams only the Dodgers seriously underperformed, and I think there are better explanations for why they failed than having extra days off."

While relevant to the subject, these events are raw and disturbing and not integral to my argument so I'd rather not discuss them here. I think they'd derail things more than not. In fact, regardless of how you feel about Israel or Palestine, I don’t think any of the conflicts or tension post-1948 are really germane to my argument, and would again serve to distract more than not. 

To also get this out of the way: the Holocaust was real, it was a tragedy and a crime on a scale rarely matched in human history. This shouldn't need saying but the Jewish people bear no responsibility for what happened in this and in many, many other cases of anti-Jewish violence and persecution. I hope you can carry this message through the rest of my post. 

On to the topic: as far as I have seen, the Israeli claim that the land belongs to them tends to rely on three fundamental pillars: 

1. The land of Israel was given to the Jewish people by God
2. The Jewish identity was largely formed in/around Israel, and they have a history there that dates back ~5000 years
3. The Holocaust (as well as many other anti-Semitic acts of violence) proves the need for a Jewish homeland

I will address these in order:

1. The Bible does indeed say that God awarded the land of Israel to the Jews. However, religious texts are not and should not be a standard for carving out nations in the modern world. I honestly don’t feel this point warrants much discussion. 

2. I would agree that the Jewish people have a strong connection to the land of Israel. However, so do many other groups. Romans, Persians, Babylonians, Arabs, Syrians, Palestinians. . .all these groups have asserted ownership over the land of Israel, and most of them did so more recently than the Jewish people (at least prior to 1948). In fact, the last time the land was under Jewish control was around 63 BCE when it was conquered by Rome. The Bible itself says that the land previously belonged to seven other kingdoms before it was conquered by the Israelites. Many, many groups have strong connections to lands that are not currently their own, and these connections do not represent legitimate modern claims. 

3. I also pretty much agree with point 3. I am not a fan of the general idea of an ethnostate but do believe this is a bit of a special case. I also understand the logic of creating Israel where it is given points 1 and 2, but would argue that this land rightfully belonged to the contemporary residents - the Palestinians. It was under a British mandate, but they also had a strictly colonial claim to the land - a claim that we would rightfully recognize today as illegitimate. Instead, a Jewish homeland would have most legitimately been made from German land. The Holocaust was initiated and largely perpetrated by the German state, and ceding some land to the Jewish people for their own state was the most logical outcome. 

Before it becomes the new topic, I am NOT saying that I believe this would have been a simple task given the landscape of post-war Europe. I broadly understand the challenges of the burgeoning Cold War as well as the fear that imposing huge penalties on Germany would lead to another post-WW1 situation. I am instead saying that the creation of Israel represented a grave act of theft by European powers, and the more just outcome would have seen a Jewish state created in Europe. 

In summary: the simple fact is that to create a country from scratch, you need to take the land from someone who already lives there. In the case of creating a Jewish state after WW2, the most reasonable course of action was to take land from Germany since they had been the architects and perpetrators of the Holocaust."

I think the [Missing Missing Reasons blog post](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html) does this phenomenon excellent justice and encapsulates much of this.

Essentially, usually the adult son or daughter has given the parent(s) MUCH explanation and reason of what has gone wrong, and the parent continuously ignored it and then the kid did indeed make good on the threat and left. And then the parent acts bewildered when in fact deep down they totally know why it happened, they just don't want to admit it.

But - I am open to having my view changed - that maybe the parents indeed didn't know, and got blindsided, or still don't know the reason why.

However, a ton of people are saying that they support Palestinians but oppose Hamas. However, in my opinion, there is no such thing as supporting Palestine and opposing Hamas. Why? Because the majority of Palestinians *love* Hamas.

First of all, there is the recurring claim that Palestinians, particularly those in the West Bank, are oppressed by the Israeli government. And sure, they don't quite have freedom of movement or equal protection under the law. However, Israel has sufficient reason to deny these rights, after all the suicide bombings, mass murders, rocket attacks, and other acts of terrorism. The whole pro-Palestinian movement was a PR campaign by the PA after Israel punished Palestinians for terrorism. They reframed Palestinian separatism as a struggle for civil rights instead of a violet insurrection meant to destroy Israel and exterminate all Jews, which is what it actually was and is.

Second, I'm sure people don't realize truly *how* hateful Palestinians in particular and Arabs in general are, *especially* towards Jews. The whole hospital attack was a literal blood libel. There are Palestinian *children* who dream of a second Holocaust. My brother tried to convince me how anti-Arab Israelis are, which from what I've heard is a) false and b) if it even is true, then it's probably because Arabs have given Jewish Israelis hell for the last century. He cited unverified statistics (he couldn't remember which source it came from; I'm guessing it came from HAMAS Official), so I responded with statistics that, admittedly, I pulled out my ass but are probably more plausible than the statistics he cited. I told him that 100 percent of Arabs would behead a Jew and 90 percent of Arabs would cannibalize a Jew. These statistics *were* made up, but given how I've seen clips of Palestinian children praying that Allah will kill all the Jews, I don't think they're unfounded.

I still haven't quite explained why I think Palestinians *are* Hamas. The most obvious piece of evidence for this is the fact that the Gazans elected Hamas back in 2006. Hamas hasn't allowed elections since then, but if recent polling is to be believed, they'd win again. Polls show that the majority of Gazans are pro-Hamas. Hamas is less popular in the West Bank, sure, but they're still more popular than Fatah. Fatah hasn't allowed elections in a while either because if they did, Hamas would win. Fatah has been unpopular for decades due to corruption, and Hamas is willing to give the Palestinians what they want. This includes a Jew-free Levant.

If you are decent enough to support *human life,* support Israel. If you don't support Israel, then you are a depraved human being that belongs in hell next to the Palestinians. But maybe I'm wrong."

After all, if we are willing to put our own desires and needs first in so many other aspects of our lives, why should our relationships be any different? In many cases, people simply do not value their relationships enough to remain faithful, and instead choose to satisfy their own desires and impulses regardless of the consequences. 

We are living in a time where instant gratification is the driving force behind much of our behavior, and as a result, fidelity often takes a back seat to our own selfishness and pleasure. Unfortunately, this means that many people are willing to cheat on their partners, because they are more concerned with their own happiness than with the well-being of their relationship."

I exited the reddit app (shit app) and the massive, speed-typed, passionate explanation of a ridiculously profound turning point in my life, which I was really proud of, cause it was the greatest, most confessional piece of writing, the greatest outpouring of pure, passionate emotion that I had ever written, was gone when I returned to the app, and I am not regular redditor. I had the huge heart drop u feel when you realise you've left something important on a train or dropped your phone in a lake.
Ultimately in short, the shroom experience killed my social anxiety, depression, grief, loneliness, fear of life, adhd, ocd and showed me that I need to fear anything, the the only thing holding urself back is urself, that u never need be afraid of falling in love, because it is a beautiful, raw, unexplainable, ignorant, natural thing which is the purpose and unity of all the infinite that exists.
So, cause I'm no longer afraid of death, I, realised that grief is joyful, that u never truly lose someone because of the tangibility of the love you have had, always had and always will have for them. I am not afraid of losing anything, even the girl I have just found, because we only live in the present, and it is a waste of time to fear the future or regret the past. So after I felt that huge crash in emotion in losing that writing, I realised that I hadn't in fact lost anything. I still had the memory, I still had the girl, my family, myself, my home. The emotoon that I had outpoured was still there, just cause the words had gone didn't mean the reality had gone. Cause ultimately reddit isn't reality, it isn't a valuable part of your life. . 
I have nothing to prove, I don't need to show that I'm profound or a mystic or anything cause that would mean I was trying to prove I am better than u in a way. I ultimately don't care what u guys think, cause I don't even know u, I don't love u as a person, I love u guys as a collective cause I love humanity though. But I don't love just u reddit guys, I love the whole of humanity, which undermines any real meaning that reddit has in my life.
I don't even need to worry abuot writing stuff down cause they are a memory and memories never truly disappear unless you just let them or ignore them. They will always be in ur mind, even if u forget, they will not stop existing. 
Maybe I'm just being pretentious (I definitely am), and a hypocrite (I am)) maybe I'm just being too self aware (I am) but does it really matter, cause I don't ultimately care what u think. 
And this is just a really wordy way of saying I don't care about u guys and yet I do as well - cause u represent humanity, the good, the bad and the ugly. I can't see u, cause the internet is virtual, it is not physical, and yet it is real but not real, cause I know u guys a real people living real lives (except u bots) and that is the scary paradox that is the internet- people will hate each other more but love each other more through it, because we are talking to fake, inanimate, intangible, virtual people.   And ultimately I don't care about reddit cause it isn't really true life, and yet I'm still getting a huge catharsis from writing this cause I'm so happy to be alive, but in reality the former is truer. I haven't even edited that's how little I care.

Female brains are socially oriented, and would offer a much needed humanitarian perspective.

I also should add that I'm not an historian. 

Anyway here we go:

I've always considered 20th century dictators are murderous self-serving narcissistic psychopath but last night I watched this WW2 documentary and it said that Stalin was taken to the train station and was ready to board his special train to be evacuated to the east when he took the historical decision to stay in Moscow. For readers not too familiar with the situation at the time:

* German troops were just 10-12 miles from Moscow;
* German troops had been smashing trough Russian defenses or months conquering hundreds of miles. 
* German Luftwaffe had already shown the world its capacity to obliterate entire cities with carpet bombing. 

The probability that German troops would take Moscow were extremely high and Stalin knew well what would happen to him once captured, being shot immediately probably the best he could hope for. 

This was not some Adolf Hitler ""end of days"" situation: Hitler had nowhere to escape, I don't see anything brave in Hitler killing himself in his bunker while surrounded. Stalin had thousands of miles of safe territory to the east where he could continue to direct the war effort, his risky decision to stay put was a way to lead by example.

One of those is that men are supposed to chase and be active while dating. Women on the otherhand are reactive. Pretty much everyone would benefit if we got rid of this dynamic. 

A common issue men face is that women often times give out their number when asked, even if they aren’t actually interested. That means they either never text back or they only text back to be polite. And men are often seen as overly aggressive if they keep texting. 

So here’s my solution; When you approach a woman and want to get to know her, don’t ask her for her number. Offer her your own. That way, she has more agency and it avoids weird situations. If she does text, it’s clear that she’s interested. No games. No weird chasing. Should become the norm honestly. 
Its also in line with empowerment for women. Have them decide whether or not they want to keep contact."

Without strong institutions in these two aspects, the state will soon lapse into dictatorships, authoritarianism and/or totalitarianism. I'm not an expert in either of these areas, so I'm happy to enlightened here, but these Capitalism vs Socialism arguments always seem strange to me. Proponents on both sides always seem to feel like the other system is inherently evil when it seems obvious that there has to be some kind of hybrid model between the two. Having a working government that can monitor the economy and tweak this balance is much more important than labeling the system in my opinion. "

The last time I took the ""conventional"" PE class was 5th grade. It wasn't so bad in the early grades, but 3rd through 5th grade I FUCKING HATED PE CLASS.

I was unathletic, and very uncoordinated. I was out of shape, but not overweight or underweight.

By 4th grade, I pretty much sat on a chair almost every class and still pulled a good grade. To my surprise, none of the other kids really took issue.

The gym teacher didn't like it when I complained though, and in hindsight, maybe I should not have complained so much.

I wasn't looking forward to middle school PE, but when I found out I would have to use a locker room, that's what made me beg my parents to get me out.

I opted out of PE all throughout middle school, and took both of my required years of high school PE online.

While I was liked and had lots of friends in elementary, as testosterone level increases, I might get bullied for being uncoordinated, autistic, and unathletic. Especially considering my middle school was in a not-so-good area, and was known for its bullying problem.

Years later, one of my classmates got knocked up twice, and another one got arrested for physical assault.

Why did I hate it so much? I was bad at everything. Anything requiring coordination or athleticism I dreaded.

Don't get me started on the ""fitness tests""

I was able to manage the pacer, but I would usually use up my energy too quickly, and just barely miss out on the passing zone.

I also have never been able to properly do a pushup in my 18 years of living. I was a boy scout, and in 2018, there was this stupid-ass ""physical fitness"" meeting (ie push ups and sit ups. Barf!) . I burst into tears because I couldn't manage to do a push up. 

I'm a bit better at sit-ups, but not by much.

&#x200B;

Let me discredit and debunk common pro-PE arguments:

* ""Jocks need a class they like too!""

This argument I find laughable. It's SCHOOL. NOBODY needs a class they like. School is for learning, not fun.

* ""Kids aren't getting enough exercise!""

Children have plenty of time to exercise outside of a class. There's several hours of the day. Besides, schools keep shortening recess. Hell, in 5th grade, recess was only 5 MINUTES.

* ""You just had a bad teacher""

From my Reddit research, the overwhelming amount of PE teachers fit one of these qualities 1) obese 2) asshole 3) impaitent. One time, a teacher refused to give someone their inhaler while they were running the mile. 

* ""It's gotten better since the 70's-90's

From my experience, no. Many Gen Z'ers still hate it.

I'm sure if I took it in middle school, my teacher would hate my guts.

* ""It encourages kids to exercise""

Studies can show the opposite. Kids picked last or with bad gym class experiences are less likely to exercise as adults.

* ""Come on! You'll just get better with a little practice!""

No. I won't. I have this invisible disability called dyspraxia. It basically impacts my hand-eye coordination, making suck at most sports.

For instance:

* I still can't ride a bike at 18 (I was terrified of tipping over. Plus, me and my parents gave up when I was 11-12)
* I learned to tie my shoelaces at 14 (Before that, parents just took laces out of my shoes. Even now, I just do the ""bunny ears"" method)
* In elementary, I had terrible handwriting. (I had an OT pull me out to practice improving my handwriting.)
* Being one of the tallest boys in class, I was really excited to learn basketball in elementary, but I was terrible.
* Even some of the fat kids were more coordinated and athletic than me. I knew this chubby boy who liked football.

Even if I do practice, I'll still be far behind the other boys. In middle school, I was introduced to this politically correct ""growth mindset"". Even as a 12-year old, I was able to see right through it, and knew it was just a way to make kids feel better about themselves.

There's no point of even trying if you know you won't get better. That's just a waste of time. Man, I dodged a MASSIVE bullet, didn't I?

When's the last time you've seen a dwarf in the NBA? A 7-foot Olympic gymnast? A leglesss Olympic runner? A mentally handicapped doctor?

NEVER.

&#x200B;

Also, as stated previously, I DID NOT want to use the locker room. Finding out I was gay at 15 makes me all the more glad I never stepped foot in one.

1,2023-10-31,"CMV: GPS apps, like Google Maps and Waze, should color streets based on the actual average speed of traffic, not the level of congestion relative to the road type.",u/frodo2397,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17kvhug/cmv_gps_apps_like_google_maps_and_waze_should/,changemyview,"Currently, most GPS apps, like Google Maps, seem to vary their standards of how to display traffic congestion based on road types and speed limit. For example, Google Maps will show small, windy roads as green even though everyone on them is driving slowly. By contrast, It will show somewhat-congesred freeways as orange or red even if people are driving fairly fast compared to a smaller street (over 30 MPH). 

I think it's annoying when I am driving on a congested freeway (colored orange/red in Google Maps)  averaging 25 MPH, and I see a nearby parallel road in green, but I don't know whether that would be a good alternative  route. For example, maybe the parallel road has a lot of traffic lights and speed bumps and a speed limit of 20 MPH (slower), or maybe it is clear with a speed limit of 40 MPH (faster).

 Even at midnight with no congestion, slower streets should be displayed on the GPS as a redder color, to indicate that you won't be able to drive very fast on them. That way, you don't have to stop the car and put in a new destination to see at a glance which routes you can take to minimize delay. 

Colors could be the following:
Dark red: 0-20 MPH average (e.g., small city streets or very congested roads/freeways)
Red: 20-30 MPH (e.g., uncongested suburban streets or congested roads/freeways)
Orange: 30-45 MPH
Yellow: 45-60 MPH 
Green: 60+ MPH (e.g., uncongested rural/suburban freeways and wide/straight rural roads)"

1,2023-10-31,CMV: Free college in the US would be a disaster without significant additional legislation,u/Coldbrewaccount,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17kvjry/cmv_free_college_in_the_us_would_be_a_disaster/,changemyview,"To start off, I will say that I 100 percent agree with the idea of college being affordable (or even free) for everyone.

What I think is a bad idea, is leaving all of the various elements of higher education unchanged and then subsidizingtuition. It seems crazy to me to look at how tuition has increased well past inflation, not ask why, and then throw even MORE money to schools.

Universities have to compete with eachother, and have done so by ([according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2020/08/31/a-new-study-investigates-why-college-tuition-is-so-expensive/?sh=7e99c48417a0)) overinvesting in amenities and administrative positions. With the relative easy access to student loans, prospective students can ""pay"" for these higher budgets. The normal free-market consequences to this kind of runaway spending don't apply. Still, there is at least SOME consequence of going into massive amounts of debt meaning there is still SOME competition based on pricing. Removing this by significantly subsidizing college tuition means that there will be no barrier to Universities continuing to bloat their budgets and raise their tuitions. If the average cost rises to 50K, it will still be accessible to students because only the goverment will feel the increase. While it's easy to say ""well we can just keep raising the tax on billionaires"", it's not that simple.

&#x200B;

1. The Free College for All Act has a hard income limit for subsidized education. This means middle class families will eventually find it impossible to pay for college.

Bernie Sanders's plan indicates that you get no subsidies if your household income is above 125K single / 250K married. With the rising costs of all other good and services, that amount of money already isn't that high for a single parent. That number supposedly ties to the consumer pricing index, which is flawed for a number of reasons and is laughably out of touch with current numbers. With tuition raises consistently outpacing inflation, and the CPI only weighting arond 2% of its number towards tuition costs, the proposed legislation will not be able to scale according to the actual AFFORDABILITY of college.

&#x200B;

2.The Free College for All Act is dependent on a fixed percentage tax on stock trading. This is both inherently risky and difficult to scale with rising costs

The text of the Wall Street Speculation Tax does not provide for an automatic increase in taxes. I don't even know if that's something that can really happen. One assumes that this is based on the correlative increase in money moving around the market as other costs (tuition) rise. The problem is that it doesn't account for periods of stagnation or recession. Counting on the stock market growing on as short-term of a basis as this is a really bad idea. Even if you could somehow tie the stock market to a certain guaranteed growth, tuition prices have grown at a considerably larger rate. Not doing anything about the exponential increase means that eventually, you're going to need to raise the rate of the tax. If you're dealing with a Republican congress, you're fucked. 

&#x200B;

3. Vocational training will be shortchanged even more. 

Removing the financial component from colleges will make them more desirable. Many people take vocational paths for financial reasons. Of course, this is the point of free college. You're removing an unfair barrier like finances to make college acceptance based purely on merit. That's all well and good until schools expand their capacities. If, say 15,000 students are elgible for acceptance and can currently afford college, what happens if 30,000 students are now eligible for acceptance and can afford it? Do they make that school 50% harder to get into, or do they PRINT MONEY by expanding their capacity? 

&#x200B;

4. Schools will be harder for low-income students to get into.

Take the above point. Colleges can only increase their supply so much to deal with an explosion in demand due to free college. They will have to become more exclusive. Lower income students have a harder time being competitive with things like test scores, grades, and extracurriculars. Free college does nothing to actually change that. The outcome will likely not be a significant demographic change in college admissions. Eventually, progressive admissions standards will be pushed more aggressively to unpredictable results.

&#x200B;

In short, the only way free college will work is with significantly more government oversight into the inner-workings of universities. Tuitions would need to be standardized and set by the government, and increases would need to happen with government approval. University budgets would need to be gone over with a fine-toothed comb. Capacity limits, both university wide and for individual programs, would have to be laid against the availability of JOBS and not left up to the institution. Student amenities would need to make sense, and not be used as a competitive edge for schools. Free college for all is a great idea, but without those caveats it would be a disaster."

While the two do deal with politics, someone who says they’re an International Relations I believe might have more politically partisan views, just not in the same way as someone with a major in Political Science would have.

 I understand there are what we can call “neutral topics” in International Relations but it seems to me that those who study it will get a more political perspective than those who study Political Science who are only more political in so far as domestic issues and which candidates are better for this which I give the point to, but when it comes to real world issues I think IR majors are more likely to be political it’s just the general public might not think of it that way."
1,2023-10-31,"CMV: As a black man in America, I'm tired of society and media making me feel ""special"" because of something I can't control such as my race",u/Equivalent_Ad_9066,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17kw23j/cmv_as_a_black_man_in_america_im_tired_of_society/,changemyview,"Now personally , I like a lot of black media, like African American actors, artists, and filmmakers.

But at the same time I wish for everyone to be equal in the sense that we all value each other  for our talents, abilities, actions and what we can control about ourselves MORESO than our social identities that we can't control (yet have shown perseverance and freedom from oppression in the past)

Like for example, I'm an artist. Art is my passion. 

And while I can't control how people react to my passion, I personally wouldn't like people saying ""he's one of the black artists that shows an example in the black community by doing XYZ""

Because it turns my passion and creativity into a social/political conversation just because of my race. Instead of just seeing me as an artist


I know what I'm claiming is too much to ask for. Since due to our history, experiences, marginalization, and culture we have to ""stand up for our black king and queens""

But I rather just stand up for our kings and queens, no matter our race, gender, sexuality, etc.

And before you claim that I'm ""All Lives Matter"" No, I'm not. I'm just expressing my feelings of those who have to add the fact that I'm black to any passion or talent that I have. Instead of just seeing me for me"

I see a bunch of people every year wearing Halloween costumes and it just doesn't sit right with me. It isn't a religious thing -- I'm not very religious -- I just think that it's a waste of time, as well as being distracting. I'm not talking about costume parties or anything like that, just when people go to work and such in their costumes. Today someone commented that they were almost late to work because of how long it took for them to put on their costume and it just seemed redundant. Plus, I felt weird being one of the only people in my friend group not wearing a costume today. I felt like everyone was expecting me to spend money on having a costume too. I feel like it's a waste of money and energy for an adult to wear a costume. But what do you guys think?"

1,2023-10-31,CMV: “A Bridge too Far” has the Best Cast of Any Movie Ever Made,u/SnaggiLittletoof,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ky39i/cmv_a_bridge_too_far_has_the_best_cast_of_any/,changemyview,"For the sake of this discussion, I am defining the “best cast” as the largest collection of great actors who all starred in the same film.  It’s not about the specific film, but rather the combined acting careers of everyone who appeared in a given film.  The movie itself can be terrible for all I care.

Most movies have one or two, maybe three major stars in them.  Or one big star and a few lesser well known actors.

Let’s list out the stars of A Bridge too Far (1977)

Directed by: Richard Attenborough 

Starring
* Sean Connery
* Michael Caine
* James Caan
* Anthony Hopkins
* Gene Hackman
* Laurence Olivier 
* Robert Redford
* Liv Ullmann 

And that’s just the top tier of actors.  Then you add in all the supporting roles like

* Elliot Gould
* Denholm Eillot
* John Ratzengerger

All actors most Americans would recognize almost 45 years later, all who had a long and amazing career in acting.  

To CMV, simply list a better movie with a larger collection of long term stars.  By my count it should have at least seven major stars,  three secondary stars, and a famous director.  They should be famous for more than just the one movie."
1,2023-10-31,CMV: Infant circumcision is a horrible crime,u/Admirable-Leader-746,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17kyisb/cmv_infant_circumcision_is_a_horrible_crime/,changemyview,"1. It's extremely painful and traumatizing for the baby
2. There's a risk of botching and even death
3. It denies the person their own body choice
4. It removes the g-spot from the penis, which serves an important sexual function. Same with the gliding of the skin during sex.
5. It desensitizes the head of the penis
6. There's no real reason for it when it comes to hygiene. This idea stems from the misconception that the skin cannot be pulled back during urination so that no urine gets caught in it, and the idea that you cannot wash it (when it's actually very easy to keep it clean)
7. The opinion that foreskin ""doesn't look good"" is globally an unpopular opinion and comes from self-hate and self-shame (hating and shaming the way nature intended you to be)

There are even groups of circumcised men who act as activists against the practice, describing it as feeling like they were ""knife raped"" shortly after birth. I can't imagine the pain they go through every day.

What is it with this practice? Do some people just not care about our baby boys?

I'm wondering if it's due to the shadow side of life. I'm a believer that half of life is peace, love, and genuine connection while the other half is conflict and power struggle.

Is it a product of the vicious adversarial power game in life?

I want to reach a conclusion whether I can accept this practice or whether to completely oppose it."

The fact that a candidate can win the popular vote yet still lose because of the electoral college shows that the citizens have no say in the matter and the decision is up to elected officials. There’s no guarantee that a member of the electoral college will vote for a specific candidate; it is up to their discretion. The electoral college takes the power from the people. If you don’t feel represented by either of the two major parties, forget about it, there is zero chance of a third-party candidate being elected, so voting for one is just throwing away your vote, even if the electoral college didn’t exist."
1,2023-10-31,CMV: Tipping should be illegal.,u/Da_SnowLeopard,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17kyzg9/cmv_tipping_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"Customers pay for a product, employers pay for labour, and employees pay with time for money. That is the trifecta, that is how it has always been in everything every since the beginning of time. 

Now with tipping becoming all the fucking rage, you got employers skimping on their responsibilities of paying for labour and pushing it onto the customers. And we as a society encourage this and give people who don't tip a nasty look. 

What is wrong with us as a society. 

Now we got employees paying with time for labour, customers paying for food and labour, and already filthy rich corporations doing the money dance because now they don't even have to pay labour (which in general is already barely peanuts all across the board). And the more as a society we keep building the social pressure to tip, the more corporations can get away with paying less. Thats why it should be fucking illegal to accept tips, fuck the corporations make them pay reasonable wages. 

Frankly its not our responsibility to pay for labour. If your boss is giving you a shit wage, that is between you and your boss. I as the customer am not responsible for this shit. MAYBE a little tip if you're EXTRA EXTRA good at your customer service. But why do I  get a gross look if I don't give the pizza guy money just for doing his job and driving my delivery here. 

And why are just SOME things tipped. Why servers but not cashiers. It doesn't make fucking sense right? 

Make that shit illegal. Stop the peer pressure to tip. Stop making customers feel bad for not tipping. Be mad at your boss. Put pressure on your boss. Put the pressure where it belongs. When you pressure the customers and consumers to tip, and we as a society do this, you just give corporations all the more leverage. Fuck tipping."
