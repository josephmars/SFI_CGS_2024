Individualism protects us from mass war, as the individual seeks to preserve their ego . The stark realism of war sheds our long-built shells of delusion by making known the fragility of the individual. Therefor, our best defense against mass warfare is to instill this sense of individuality in the populace.  


This does not go without consequence, however. Individuality is also the seed of corruption. The growth of corruption in a society accelerates cycles of power and wealth distribution. This leads to widespread internal conflict, destabilizing that nation and puts in question its core fundamentals. This eventually leads to societal collapse.

  
Collectivism and individualism pose equal threat to modern society."

Icicles:

* break easily, especially the tip which is kind of important for stabbing
* would leave a distinctive wound unless frozen into a specific shape, which leans back into the above point and also would require special freezing apparatus
* you have to carry an icicle to and from the murder scene. *It melts*, or to keep it frozen you must have a special apparatus

&#x200B;

A carved wooden knife:

* is much stronger than an icicle if made of the right wood
* Can be carved into exactly the shape of a normal knife, leaving a more generic wound
* Both of the above points make it much better for preserving a sharp point
* MUCH easier to carry/conceal/use in any environment
* disposes with less remnant if burned correctly 
* anyone with a pocketknife can make one at any time of year"

There are 2 distinct forces at play that make this exact statement accurate. 

If you took a ball of feathers that somehow kept its shape and a ball of steel and put them onto a very accurate scale (both exactly 1kg) , the steel ball would register higher. 

1. The feather ball would be huge obviously, and this higher volume would displace the air around it creating a larger buoyancy force than the steel ball decreasing its measurable weight

2. Again the size being bigger would mean the center of mass is significantly higher off the ground than the steel ball. The gravitational force between 2 bodies is calculated using the objects mass and the distance between  centers of mass. The feather ball is taller and therefore farther from earth meaning is gravitational force is less

This math only works when measuring weight given a perfectly accurate mass. If the objects mass is measured using its weight, than the whole argument becomes moot anyway."

I was thinking about the harsh posts in the past about women hitting the wall, men aging like fine wine, etc.  

I questioned, that if this is true and not just horse sh*t (as it may be), then why?

It suddenly occurred to me that I’ve never been one to use much make-up in my youth and none now plus I don’t slap on creams and products all the time.  

I wonder if the long-term application of facial products like make-up and creams causes the faster aging?  There are chemicals in all that stuff, makes sense.

Any thoughts?"

Skydiving Accident: If my parachute fails, I'm guaranteed a quick and painless death. End of story. RIP.

Bungee Jumping Accident: A lot of worse things can happen. I could hit the side of the cliff, my rope could break within a few hundred to tens of feet above the ground, I could fall into a river. But none of these would guarantee my death. If anything, I'm either guaranteed a slow and painful death OR a life of severe disability (i.e paralyzed from the neck down, from the waist down, spinal injury, can't talk, eat, drink, wipe my ass, a vegetable)."

You don't own your property (at least not in the UK - you are renters then landowners who are technically all on a lease then you have the crown/court who own all of England on paper) - you always have someone to answer to for any bureaucratic or otherwise mishaps and you need permission from any number of institutions to do XYZ to your property. You can't do some seriously unconventional shit with your own shit without someone else's go-ahead (be it previously implied or requested). This isn't in your interest as you cannot do things that you want to do but the highest make money from you not doing what you want to do as when you are not doing what you want to do, you are making every effort to feel satisfied with what feels unnatural to you - buying shit you don't need, gambling (and yes ther lottery is gambling too and offers worse odds than almost if not  all casino games), pandering, *get back to this later -too drink (that's one too)* 

Anyways - they want you to be sad (don't get me wrong, it's not all this us and them crap in my eyes - equal and opposite reaction and all) because they want you to be sad and anxious and angry because those people are more likely to spend more on shit they don't really need"

It seems obvious that all sunlight can’t go to earth, but it is insane how much energy goes off into space. That portion that hits us is 0.00000005% of the sun’s energy output. For comparison, the same proportion of the earths total surface area earth is 0.25 square kilometers (keep in mind when you look at google earth, you’re seeing less than half of the world). So, imagine everything on earth being wasted except a rural farm in an unknown town, and you have the rough proportion of how much energy from the sun goes nowhere."

And then, it evolves into Blastoise, and I’m sorry, Blastoise is clearly a *tortoise*. This fucker just changed entire species, in the middle of evolution.

Sorry, I’m calling hot farts on that. Squirtle’s evolutionary line defies the logic of evolution."

But the biggest change was that whenever anybody died in the Japanese Original, the English version would change it so that they got sent to the 'Shadow Realm'

Looking back that just sounds mortifying, you would be better off dead and possibly at peace. But the Shadow Realm basically just sounds like hell. Seems like they clearly didn't think about this censoring nonsense properly. Damn it 4kids! "

However, I've yet to see anyone refer to it as a plant based milk. I don't think I've made too much of a leap in this thought process, but that may just be me, lmao.

I've made oat milk, almond milk and a few others. In order to get the best flavor out of them you roast them, grind them up, mix with water and filter them. Now, please explain how this is different from coffee? That is a rhetorical question, I'm sure there are particular detailed differences of course, but I think the general concept is the same.

I'm now thinking of coffee as a plant based milk. lol"

Let's say you have two people of similar age, IQ, no physical disabilities, and no mental health problems. One could be jobless and rely on their parents for all support and the other could be the sole income for their family and run a medium to large company where hundreds if not thousands of individuals rely on this person for their financial well being. Some people create things that are enjoyed by millions, even billions, and some have never contributed anything of interest to anyone, nobody will ever know who they are outside of a very very small group of people.

The music was never intended to depict outer space, and yet it fits brilliantly. Not only fits but transcends the complexities of the story to convey the simplest yet deepest of human emotions: love."

We know the Romans copied the Greeks and by the time the Renaissance realistic paintings came around the standard was already set.
