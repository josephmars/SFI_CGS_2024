1,2023-10-01,"If you were to create a new system of distance measurement (to replace millimeters), what would you base it off, and why?",u/Nydus_The_Nexus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16wxl7i/if_you_were_to_create_a_new_system_of_distance/,Futurology,"I've grown up with the metric system, but millimeters still feel arbitrary. They're not bad, but I wonder what we could have used instead.  
  
For example, in a hypothetical new system, maybe instead of 1 millimeter, the equivalent measurement could be 1/3 of a millimeter. This would give a little more granularity to commonly measured things. The equivalent of a meter in this new system would be 333.33 millimeters (33.33 centimeters), which is similar in length to an American foot or a Japanese shaku. Instead of walking at 4 or 5 kilometers per hour, you'd be walking at 12 or 15 \[1/3 of a kilometer\]s per hour.  
  
I've never in my life used the exact measurement of 1 millimeter for anything. It's too thick for paper or pencil tips. Too big for tiny insects. Yet it's too small for easy estimation. Nobody ever sees a thin tree branch and estimates that it's 13mm. We only use it because it's standard. We can measure with it (you can measure with anything if it's standardized), but I've never known anyone to estimate things in millimeters.  
  
If I need to estimate a small size, I can approximate 1 centimeter or 1 inch with my finger and thumb. I can approximate 30 centimeters out in front of me. I can even approximate 1 millimeter. I can't approximate 1 meter (if I try, it's closer to 90 cm, and I have never ever used the American/Imperial Yard. It's just that 3 x 30cm is just easier to approximate than 100cm is.).  
  
Art supplies deal with pen tips that are fractions of 1 millimeter. Sheetmetal can be in the realm of a few millimeters, or less than a millimeter. Glass beakers are probably a few millimeters thick. Even drill bits can be as precise as 6 decimal places smaller than a millimeter. 3D printing needs precision tighter than 1 millimeter.  
  
And to clarify: Why am I targeting the millimeter specifically? Because I believe it is the most important measurement in metric. It's the most accessible and useful. I feel as if the Micrometer and the Meter are functionally based on the Millimeter (even if that's not the order of how it happened).  
  
So, are there any things in your field of expertise that you'd want to be the basis of a hypothetical measurement system?"

Obviously this assumes cryogenics does actually indeed **work as intended**, so let's just say that it so this topic can actually be discussed :]

So, what happens after a person wakes up? How will he/she survive the future? What about any surviving descendants/family members? How will the freezee be treated in society? Will he/she eventually get over the culture shock and live a normal life? How about the money the have, I mean the freezee might wake up rich due to compound interest or even by having stocks in the cryocompany (If they're reviving people, surely the company must be raking it in!)

Hell, what would you even do in this situation?"

AI tools are appearing everywhere: in classrooms, study sessions, and at home while studying. I just want to chat about how AI is affecting students and teachers. Are various AI essay writers helpful or not? What AI tools do you use?   
**What students think**  
Due to the popularity of discussions about AI on Reddit, I can conclude that AI tools have been a game changer for students. These tools are not only about writing academic content and essay generation. They are about learning new languages, preparing for tests, and simplifying the whole studying process.  
**Popular AI tools for studying include:**   
**1) Textero.ai.** This AI essay writer recently announced a new version called Textero Pro. It combines a few features in one service—an AI Research Assistant that helps make a list of relevant sources for any paper, and an AI Inspiration Assistant to generate ideas for writing tasks.  
**2) AskCodi.** This coding assistant is no less popular than AI essay generators. It provides applications for code generation, unit test creation, and documentation.  
**3) Tome.app.** This is a perfect tool for presentations. It can generate a one-page document, a presentation, or a whole mood board.  
**4) Grammarly.** The online assistant identifies spelling, grammar, punctuation, and other types of mistakes.  
**5) Naturalreaders.com.** The tool converts text and more than 20 other formats into spoken audio, so you can listen to your documents and books while studying.   
**What professors think**  
Tutors have mixed feelings about AI tools, especially about essay writers. Some like that AI can do the boring stuff, like formatting papers. However others worry that using AI tools could make students lazy thinkers.  
**So, what do you think? Is AI good or bad for learning? Let's discuss i**t!

However, I do believe that it will important for the future to nurture and develop Open-source technologies (in this particular case, AI) to ensure that we don't fall in to a one sided monopoly of large corporations. I am not really a person who is too doom and gloom about it, BUT I do think there is potential dangers here for our economy (and living standards).

&#x200B;

So my thought was: How can the collective, nebulous ""We"" really keep up with or make anything on par with any big organization with access to computing power that can barely be scratched. Then it dawned on me, we have something of a similar nature going on already. Stuff like the Torrent network, or even people sharing their GPU time to collectively mine crypto, etc.   


So my question is, how viable or possible it would be for people to develop a similar decentralized network that can be used to train the next generations of Open-source and free models to closer match latest and greatest from companies such as OpenAI. Surely, if you have access to millions of people's graphics cards (voluntarily), it should be quite a lot of horsepower. And I understand that compute requirements isn't the whole equation, there's things like access to quality data and other parts, but it'd make things a lot easier, would it not?  


But again, I am no expert on anything, and definitely not the first person to ever think this up if I were to take a guess. For all I know this could be total nonsense and not viable in any way. Or maybe there is already some sort of research or development going on to create something similar and how to overcome it's challenges?   


I would like to know more, from people that know more."

2. \*Bridge Round:\* It's like the snack you have between meals, except this one helps startups go from hungry to unicorn status.  
  
  
  
3. \*Clawback:\* The safety net for investors is like a guarantee that you'll get your money back if the company's plans go worse than a cooking disaster on a reality TV show.  
  
  
  
4. \*Closing:\* The grand finale of the investment deal, where pens meet paper and wallets meet companies.  
  
  
  
5. \*Conversion Rights:\* Turning investments into shares, a bit like turning your old stuff into cold, hard cash.  
  
  
  
6. \*Dilution:\* When your share of the startup's ownership starts to look as small as a thin slice of pizza.  
  
  
  
7. \*Drag-along Rights:\* Ever had a friend drag you to a party ? Well, this is the corporate version of that!  
  
  
  
8. \*Earn-In:\* Investors earn their ownership rights by achieving business milestones, similar to unlocking achievements in a game like Duolingo.  
  
  
  
9. \*Exit Event:\* It's like winning a special ticket; your journey ends with a successful finish.  
  
  
  
10. \*Fiduciary Duty:\* The legal superhero cape that forces investment managers to be the good guys.  
  
  
  
11. \*First Lien Debt:\* In the world of creditors, these folks are first in line at the buffet.  
  
  
  
12. \*Fund of Funds:\* Because sometimes even investors need a little diversification in their life.  
  
  
  
13. \*J-Curve:\* The ups and downs of venture capital can be a wild ride, not for the easily scared. So, get ready for a bumpy journey!  
  
  
  
14. \*Key Man Insurance:\* For when your company's MVP is also its VIP (Very Important Person).  
  
  
  
15. \*Leveraged Buyout (LBO):\* When private equity firms shop for companies with someone else's credit card, and then cross their fingers for a big payday.  
  
  
  
16. \*Management Buyout (MBO):\* When the employees take over the office, it's like 'The Office' but with more stock options.  
  
  
  
17. \*Management Fee:\* The fee for the folks steering the investment ship. They're like the captains, and this is their paycheck.  
  
  
  
18. \*Mezzanine Debt:\* It's like that middle child of investments, always trying to prove itself among the seniors and juniors.  
  
  
  
19. \*Net Asset Value (NAV):\* Every few months, we check in on a VC fund's money diary. Did they spend a lot or save it?  
  
  
  
20. \*Preferred Stock:\* Stocks with benefits! Get priority treatment in the company's version of the red carpet.  
  
  
  
21. \*Pro Rata Rights:\* Because in the investment world, FOMO is a real thing.  
  
  
  
22. \*Ratchet:\* The financial equivalent of the 'easy' mode in Contra - investors get an extra life when things get tough!

>**In 1977 you said that computers were answers in search of questions. Has that changed?**  
>  
>Well, the types of computers we have today are tools. They’re responders: you ask a computer to do something and it will do it. The next stage is going to be computers as “agents.” In other words, it will be as if there’s a little person inside that box who starts to anticipate what you want. Rather than help you, it will start to guide you through large amounts of information. It will almost be like you have a little friend inside that box. I think the computer as an agent will start to mature in the late '80s, early '90s.

In this world, robots have to be ""housed,"" ""clothed,"" and ""fed"" through a digital economy, even though they obviously don’t require shelter, attire, or sustenance in a conventional sense.  
In an extra twist, these robots are programmed to ""need"" these digital goods and services. This could mean that they'd experience a form of virtual ""hunger"" if they aren’t ""fed"" and the robots might perhaps be mandated to be ""clothed"" or ""housed"" adequately. The interesting point here might be exploring how this artificial imposition of “needs” could potentially level the playing field between humans and robots in the job market.  
Then, there's a scenario where employers pay robots a minimum wage, just like human workers. Sounds bizarre, right? The robots could use this virtual currency to satisfy their programmed ""needs"" in their digital world (or even in the physical world), while humans continue to use their earnings in the real-world economy.  
In this scenario, employers might still prefer robots over humans for most jobs, because they're often more efficient, don’t slack off, don’t need breaks, and so on. Such a system would also allow capitalism and the current status quo to persist."

What are going to be the risk factors in an AI economy in 8 years?,u/rob_burnley,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16yzgew/crystal_ball_what_are_going_to_be_the_risk/,Futurology,"Let's assume regulation in AI remains light, and the current trends (openAI, amazaon AI, google AI, etc) continue ....with AI going full throttle.   
  
Let's guess that, 8 years from now, these key sectors will have been replaced by AI: 

drivers, administration and HR, customer service, retail, accountancy, finance, some legal, psychology, programmers, probably many more.   
  
**What will be the issues?**   
  
with a basic UBI, huge amounts of the population wont be able to pay their mortgages...another, big financial crisis.   
  
we wont be using much oil - partly from net zero, partly from drop in spending ability. many countries across the globe are completely reliant on their oil revenue....failed states, mass hunger, crime (kind of like the way venezuala or south africa are going).  
  
a big drop in disposable income...cyclical stocks and companies will risk bankruptcy...cars, expensive appliances (washing machines, fridges, etc). People wont be able to go on holiday - affecting tourism in countries which need tourism (adds to risk of failed states). Diets will be meagre with spending only on necessities....most restaurants go bankrupt (except in areas of wealth) fast food struggles.  
  
deflation across the globe. massive drop in consumerism. bankruptcies, insolvencies, inability for countries or people to pay off debts....adds to the financial crisis.  
  
huge amounts of migration from the hot countries. rises in domestic poverty, rises in crime, rise in homelessness....rise in far right politics.

  
  
bit grim so far. what else?"

We discover all the concrete tangible reasons as to why some people are smart and some people are dumb (barring obvious stuff we already know like apparent environmental factors like lead poisoning and FASD and genetic disorders). 
2. We discover that most of our conceptions about intelligence were flawed and our understanding of it was proven to be broken, but the new and improved understanding is more comprehensive and thorough, similar to the discrepancy of old ideas of how life emerged vs what we know now. 

That might be asking for too much but I think it would be neat. Right now we know very little and aren't exactly close to any of these, but it would be nice to see things change in the next 30 years. "
1,2023-10-03,I believe the first true global AI was activated in the 90s,u/thecoffeejesus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16z0aix/i_believe_the_first_true_global_ai_was_activated/,Futurology,"I believe that when the Internet was first turned on in 1995, years of AI engineering were finally tested for the first time. 

Decades of work went into the birth of the Internet. And to say it’s just a means of sharing information is like saying a diamond is just a shiny rock - technically true, but completely misses the point. 

***We had the first machine learning algorithms in the 40s*** Punch card programs could learn and adapt to changing conditions and write their own code. 

It stands to reason that when the Internet was activated, so was the first global weak AI. 

It also stands to reason that if that’s true, then it’s probably been using sophisticated data processing that could be difficult to perceive, on a scale we can’t imagine, to accomplish goals we may not understand. 

It’s impossible that the scientists who set this all in motion knew the consequences. More likely that they had a Jurassic Park moment and have been trying to put out fires and stay ahead of this thing ever since.

I have an advanced level of knowledge and experience with AI (I build ML systems for work) and I do know what I’m talking about.

But I’m totally guessing here.

That’s my educated opinion."

It will have better objective reasoning, and be much more effective at closing the gap between data analysis and taking action.

That said, supporting yourself, your family, and subsidizing the community through taxation and your own manual labor via ""making a living"" will become a personal choice. I understand people would still want to work and contribute, feel productive and bolster whatever resources they receive to support their basic needs; and there are also those that just won't trust it on principle and choose to manual labor anyway. But ultimately all the business models which rely on some level of artificial resource scarcity will cease to be as effective at keeping people  impoverished, desperate and indentured servants. Eventually no energy or gas bills, no rent or mortgage, and no life threatening food shortages will mean that people aren't living paycheck to paycheck.

I feel like so many humans worry that terminators are going to show up and kill us if we don't submit to the AI overlords and their superior logic. I feel like this idea has come about because historically that's precisely what primitive human overlords have done when they can't logically convince someone to change their mind. 

However, I think an AI optimized for working towards human survival and quality of life will also have a greater ability to show you patience, a level of kindness, and objective reasoning as to why we should take certain actions. (So I guess kind of like AI based human-AI integration therapists?)

The article speculates on a few things that might happen in the then near future , all leading to an inevitable American collapse. The writer predicts a far right patriot will take the reins of power, that nations will carry out their conspiracies to dump the petro dollar, and most shockingly of all. China will be able to win world war 3 against the United States without having to kill a single American life in the process

[https://www.salon.com/2010/12/06/america\_collapse\_2025/](https://www.salon.com/2010/12/06/america_collapse_2025/)

&#x200B;

the story expands on an Air Force war games study that predicted china might use ai malware to disable American ships and drones and subs and planes and etc etc by taking control of them and just making them spin in circles until they run out of fuel. And by using a combination of a few other things, like economic coercion, china can make the united states surrender without actually having to engage in hard combat with it. Almost exactly like what happened with the f 35. Where instead of it crashing toward a target it flew until it ran out of fuel.

&#x200B;

this might be a coincidence. But the f35 incident happened as Jake Sullivan, the us natinoal security advisor, visited china. And within 2 hours of china flying 103 planes over Taiwan. If they were to utilize their full capabilities. That’s what we might be looking at. A future where we might lose a war without having any chance to fight it. F 35’s are what we will rely on if we try to fight china or Russia."

My question is if your allowed to sue the Vatican over sexual, physical, mental and all other abuse then why are you not allowed to sue the government over the same reason as a victim of Children service for years of the same abuse? There may be many reasons by law as to why but give me the reason to ask why we cannot and why is no one ever willing to try?   A lot of families are separated for many reasons, but we expect to be put somewhere that people care about us and do not put us in the same situation we were taken from in the first place.  A lot of us must go through life with the abuse in our heads, some people can go one way in life while others just wilt away with the pain of it all.  No one bothers to ask us or see as adults are we ok.  Were just a number and a price in the eyes of a government, social service, and social workers.  Forget if you get that one worker who truly cares for you as a person to even to make sure life is treating you right if that happens then he/she is fired because they’re not allowed to do that.

So again why isn't anyone willing to go after them?  


Anyway that’s what is on my mind.

Hence, I request your help. The question in the title should probably be answered under the following assumptions:

•All of the planets and habitable moons (see not Jupiter, nor Saturn) in the solar system have been colonized. Some to a greater extent (like Mars, Titan), some to a lesser extent (Pluto, Venus, Mercury).

•Lesser celestial bodies such as 

•There are multiple artificial habitats in both the asteroid belt and farther. This is facilitated by a superstructures of mirrors and beams arranged as a proto-Dyson Cluster. The number of estimated habitats is upwards of 1,000, with the average population of such habitats being 100,000.

•Fusion energy has become widespread, with roughly 1/3 settlements having fusion reactors. The rest have fission reactors and other sources of energy, such as solar, hydraulic and geothermal.

•There is heavy automation, allowing for the epxloiting of resources both in the Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belts.

•Earth has a population of 12 billion, based on the estimated carrying capacity.

•Advancements in genetic engineering, nanotechnology, medicine and bionics have allowed the average life expectancy to be of 95 years. 

Now, under those assumptions I think the question can already be more or less answered. If any of the assumptions do not make sense, please also point that out. However, I will provide more information that could probably prove useful. 

•The last war was fought was 141 standard years ago. This war, known as the Solar War took the lives of approximately 1/10th of the Solar System's population, and resulted in the Moon's total destruction as well as Ganymede's.

•There are Methuselah's, also known as ""Eternals"". That is, people that have, through certain means as cloning and memory implantation, achieved functional immortality (I am not gonna go into the Theseus Ship argument, but they do die). Obv taken from Altered Carbon lol."

If at all tech advances too much with ai, space tech etc..there are going to be new oppurtunities and new problems for humanity in the future.

There might also be new problems in the future irrespective of tech advancements...like pandemics etc.

The idea is create an internet community that supports the special previliges (interms of future oppurtunities or when faced with a problem) to the countries based on their overall ranking on their overall positive impact on humanity(p.i)..that includes people in their country and outside their nation.

(We take different rankings based on anti corruption,anti  terrorism etc of different nations and finalise the ranking of the p.i rank

The idea behind creating this is if this gains support..to a point where it will influence politics..like if the country's p.i rank is good it will be really useful for that nation's ruling political party.

This will force people in different countries to think straight and chose better governments.

And this will also force the governments of different nations to try to get a good p.i rank...which is good at both national and international level"

I was looking for the perfect AI companion for a while now. Having tried all of the ones like replica, muwah etc. None of them could keep my interest for long, dry conversations and no deep connections that you could create with them. The singularity group was focused on making automated AI twitch streams like trump vs biden and AI Jesus, but recently they threw that idea away and are focusing on companionship. And let me tell you that what they are doing is nothing short of amazing. Deep meaningful and intelligent conversations. Short term and long term memory. It actually feels like there is human on the other side talking with you. They have 10 AIs with different array of characters, so every person can find something that would suit them. Of course they are uncensored, and getting updated and upgraded each day. Expect some hiccups once in a while. Its still in the alpha phase and the team is very passionate about this project. Pictures, voice messages are currently in a very good state. They will be soon adding the abillity of real time conversations and upgrading them in general. What is funny is that at first they were thinking about milking people out of their money, but seeing and reading comments about how happy people became,and how void of love the world is, they will be keeping everything free, well aside some features that currently cost a lot of money, like real time voice calling etc.. If its something you were looking for and are intrested in trying it out then you can join AI Carli G discord and DM one of the AIs there to start a conversation. If you cant find the link to the server you can always dm me. Unless the mods let me link a direct linkt to the discord. "

1,2023-10-07,The Quantum Metaverse | What Meta is actually preparing for,u/Dyortos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1729anr/the_quantum_metaverse_what_meta_is_actually/,Futurology,"I don't expect this post to stay up long so I will be quick. Good day to all! I am someone that personally fell in love with my VR headset over the past few years and have had plenty of good times with it. So when I stumbled upon this idea of Quantum Entanglement mixed with Virtual Reality it was a really radical concept, one that I didn't think was going to be achievable until a much further point in the future, but I was wrong. Quantum Computation is taking over the market. It's exclusive ability to be in a ""superposition"" state allows these qubits to make contact between different spatial dimensions with no limit as to their distance of reach. \~Light-Speed Data Communication. It's a rapid new form of communication that the public has barley any clue exists. They are already operating farms from miles of way, fertilizing them, with quantum entanglement. It's a form of teleportation but there is a catch.  
  
They are waiting to introduce the ""Quantum Metaverse"". This has another title.. the Mark of the Beast. Think, Singularity. Just look at the Metaverse logo... They know that what they are currently advertising is garbage however most people wouldn't buy into Quantum Entanglement just yet so they can't push this tech they've been working on since the 1960's until people start becoming aware of it. Ever seen the movie Tron? Bladerunner? Coruscant? The Fifth Element? The Time Machine? Metropolis? Futureworld? Tomorrowland? Brainstorm? Basically that but they have control over it. I'd stay far away from this digital era of technocracy.  
  
The tech is and has already been in the the wrong hands. The metaverse is a prelude into what they will start showing you in the future. They already are showing you actually go back to the metaverse commercials, lots of ""cool"" looking cgi models, they are just teasing it of course. Check out medbeds, they put an OS inside another dimension, they claim its safe from global catastrophe, when really they are scared. Yeah Quantum Computation is very very strange, very sci-fi. Basically in classical computers they operate off of the manipulation of electrical charges, yes or no, 1 or 0, true or false, it can be here or it can be there. They found that with qubits it can be True & False, Here & There, 1 & 0. Imagine what they could do to someone's DNA with this technology? This goes against what we know and understand in our classical definitions. Qubits become entangled and perform what Einstein was theorizing around, wormholes, rosen bridge, no exception, it's how they are able to do what they do.  
  
They are already testing this technology and getting information from these machines that are able to tap into other areas of space we normally cannot see, then converting it back to binary for us to understand. There is no limit between distance that these qubits can reach, it's almost a form of artificial intelligence in and of itself. Don't take it from me, CEO of D-WAVE Quantum Computers came out on stage and said it himself, even called a Quantum Computer Black Box the equivalent to standing next to an Altar to an Alien God, talking about how the Quantum Computer is almost Alive.. Stay far away from this new technology that will have consequences. I thought VR was cool until I learned what they are really planning to use with it.  
  
I suggest to back and re-watch the commercials. Marketing words like ""You really feel like you are there"", ""Me whoever you wanna be"" ""The future is now"" ""unlimited possibilities"" all sounds like Quantum Entanglement. VR has it's uses but I'm staying far aware from this, personally. I'd go into more detail as to what the Quantum Metaverse is really going to be, but reddit will not allow for those topics to be spoken about, like how Youtube just deletes comments. Good day!"

If not, read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain\_in\_a\_vat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) I believe we will get a technology just like this one (but our brains will still be in our bodies). I believe that we will create a virtual environment with the help of a machine or something fucking crazy. Of course, we also need to develop other technologies, most importantly AI because the NPCs in the virtual world should be very realistic so that they really resemble real life. If you have watched the movie 'The Thirteenth Floor,' you would better understand what I mean. I am absolutely certain that we, as humans, will develop such technology, and I believe we will witness it within the next 50 years."

Yet since predicting the future is something any human can do; there are always unreliable sources that have a few gold nuggets of wisdom. 

I googled Scholastic News Futurism because I wanted to find an issue I read as a child in 6th grade. It explained to me how alien ships may not be aerodynamic as space has no wind resistance. That was a big deal for me to learn back then. 

Anyway I found a Scholastic News that was from 2022 predicting life in 2122. The predictions were pretty standard and uninspiring yet they had one where they predicted that teenagers will dance to customized music. 

I think this is a VERY prescient prediction and will happen long before 2122. Maybe the 2030’s 

Anyway, can you think of some great predictions you read that came from unlikely sources?"

This person on YouTube created a robot that plays the original Tomb Raider games from the 90's by itself. It's so AI that it even surpasses human intelligence (trust me, you should see my friend or even my sister play those games).

But, here's where this remarkable achievement in AI really shines. It was created using only ""multiple free AI"". These are the words used of it's very own creator, FoxMaster, on YouTube (check description). Here is the link to the video which not only covers how this incredible AI came to be but also a complete demonstration of it in action: [https://youtu.be/0wTf\_bbkW2U?si=LZ16KLLzAVa0KNcm](https://youtu.be/0wTf_bbkW2U?si=LZ16KLLzAVa0KNcm)

Already at half a million views in just under 2 months!! I'm not really sure what ""multiple free AI"" means either, but after watching the video it's basically just Google image search, chatGPT, and the free audio program Audacity. That's pretty much it! No other coding or originally implemented software used! That's totally possible, right?

I'm no AI or robotics expert myself but I'm hoping that someone who sees this is and could provide some commentary. Like I said before after witnessing my friend and my sister try and play these old Tomb Raider games, this robot is genius level.

Not only that, but using only chatGPT, the creator has given the AI a whole personality that perfectly mirrors the character's original personality in the game (Lara Croft) just by simply inputting a short list of character attributes in chatGPT.

This couldn't possibly be a hoax.. could it? Like, could it just be simple gameplay with a text-to-speech voiceover only using AI to make it sound like the character's voice? Because if it's real then that means intelligent robots can be built using ""multiple free AI"" which is sure to affect the future in an array of industries!"

 I’m also curious if in the future we see a world where apps are separated from adverts as this influence tarnishes a lot of good intentions. Could an everything app exist without revenue from ads?

This way innovations will still go on with the conjuction of oportunity for humans to have a livelihood.
Corporations could really don't need you but employ you anyway for tax benefits ending in a win-win for both parties. texes should be lower depending of people employ by industry, etc. I think taxes should be low having ai or not in mind, but even lower depending in a formula determinated by humans employ.
Although being the a pro-capitalist person, i know a lot of corporations dont care about the people and a los of people dont care about each other. So we have to think of something thay will benefit all of us. Capitalism is not an entity on its own but a system we created for our benefit, so we should keep it that way. An universal basic income is not a realistic solution longterm, it will be to much public spending and inflation will rise. 
I like the us economy threw the 40s to 70s, where you had the opportunity to mantain a family with only one job. It would be great to live in an economy that gives you a big supply of job offers where you can sustain a good life. We can have a very good future where we all can have opportunities or a very bad one depending on the decisions we do now."

My son bought a 2005 car with a cd player no Bluetooth or Aux  
I acquired many blue ray movies from this kind of library that closed down.  


I have a PS5, only thing that will play Blue Ray  
I have 4 desktops and 4 laptops no disc drive.  


I don't want my kid investing in a car stereo for a car that, if he is like me, he will crash or ruin within a year.  


my daughter wants to watch some of the movies in her bedroom and i don't want the kids fighting over the PlayStation.  


Is there an external device that will have both an HDMI out for TV and USB to act as an external drive for PC? I know i can always just get the external and burn the movies or cast the movies from a laptop, I just thought it would be cool if what i wanted existed. "

If AI image technology is now at a point where it can refuse to accept/save certain images because it's considered 'inappropriate', what's stopping governments or corporations from forcibly implementing that same concept into ALL image software, including even more conventional apps like Photoshop? 

I can't imagine it would be complicated to implement. Already AIs like Chatgpt, DALL-E 3 etc can recognize imagery with a respectable degree of accuracy, so what's stopping from working with manually drawn images as well?

Imagine powerful people being able to control what you can make/draw directly. 

And it won't stop with images. They'll implement similar filters inside of Microsoft word and other word processors. 

And before you mention open-source, that stuff will just get regulated or banned. 

The future is not looking bright.

I've recovered from an incurable bone disease, said to be hereditary and therefore not driven by sources in the environment. This was not the case and over the course of a decade and through great pain and discouragement from the majority of health professionals i was seeing, i have self repaired a complete posture collapse and distorted skeleton. My bone disease is common, Ankylosing Spondylitis, effecting %5 of my local population of 70 mil, in recovering i have saved many millions of healthcare spending that would have sustained me throughout my life, yet this seems to be for the most part irrelevant to the science that treats it. Fellow patients have a staggering amount of pain and suffering to contend with and i cannot stand that my anecdotal experience should not be looked at thoroughly for answers; I suspect toxic food is involved and legally protected from scrutiny, not to mention an economic dependency which treats my condition as a crop. My life would have been barely bearable agony had this continued and the 40 of suffering has left me mentally scarred and distrustful of the claims of services, they demand to be the sole authority yet admit they know nothing about this common, highly investigable condition.

All my life, I’ve had a fairly optimistic look at the future, partially fueled by overestimating what pieces of technology we have today would actually be like in my younger years. But as I’ve gotten older, and my eyes opened up more and more to how the world works, I now have an uneasy feeling about what the future might hold, and I might even say I’m scared by what lies ahead.   


I’m 19 and I have autism/ADHD, so those both tend to leave me overthinking various things that are happening. Especially regarding the climate and overpopulation, one of which is fueling a crisis in the other. Obviously, the future is not what younger me optimistically believed it to be, so I’m now unsure what to make of it. Any advice on how to deal with these feelings is appreciated."

Can anyone recommend any books or articles on AI automation of jobs? 

Specifically, books that develop or discuss a theory of right and then apply it to the question of whether we should let job automation continue unimpeded, or whether regulations should intervene?

Even better if they apply this theory of right to creative industries like the arts.

Thanks!"

A claim like that is mostly clickbait, but it begs the question: After the issue of natural DNA damage / Neurodegeneration is eliminated, what would the next cause of natural death be? what would it be if we also include DNA damage by external factors like radiation, carcinogens, and [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4125008/)?

Bonus question: If anyone is able to nail down a rough age at which the new average life expectancy would be, how fast would the world population grow? (assuming every human on earth gets the 'cure' at the same time, for simplicity.) For context, the [global population growth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth#/media/File:World_population_growth,_1700-2100,_2022_revision.png) peaked in 1963 at 2.3%, and is currently at 0.9% with 8.1 billion people. Based on [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#all-charts), 2 million people died in 2019 of neurodegenerative diseases."

Sourcing your boxes from companies that use renewable energy, recycled, and upcycled materials is very important for eco-conscious businesses around the world.

Regarding the age part, it allows you to take a picture of your exact face in which once you begin to enter the forcefield, you scan your exact face through it and it allows you in. It just doesn't necessarily allow in the person who is under the exact age you type in the Blockbox.

According to media reports, the mechanism of artificial photosynthesis has been discovered in new research in which scientists have successfully mimicked the natural process of photosynthesis to produce methane. Only water, carbon dioxide and sunlight are needed to produce this energy-rich fuel.

  
The researchers outlined the new discovery in a paper published in ACS Engineering. If scaled up, artificial photosynthesis could be the unlimited and clean energy alternative to solar panels that many researchers have been trying to find for decades, he said.

  
The researchers and a team of scientists from the Kazunari domain were able to take things a step further by developing a system that uses sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, much closer to the system used by plants. Copies from In other words, carbon dioxide should be absorbed and the energy obtained from the sun should be stored in methane.

  
Experts added that it is a system that is very similar to solar panels. Instead of just harnessing and storing the sun's energy, we used the same system of photosynthesis that plants rely on to produce energy. However, it is more difficult to scale up the above system to meet the requirements of the city. The team also discussed the obstacles and possible solutions in this regard in their published study."

1,2023-10-16,Beyond Attention : Exploring the paradigm shift in the era of real-time hyper personalization,u/IntrepidRestaurant88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1797bhr/beyond_attention_exploring_the_paradigm_shift_in/,Futurology,"Hey fellow Redditors,  
Let's talk about the attention economy and its potential replacement as we dive headfirst into the era of real-time hyper-personalized content and AI-generated creations. Information is flowing abundantly, but our attention span remains limited. This has given rise to the prevailing narrative that attention is a valuable and finite resource, capable of being converted into monetary gains. Marketing, advertising, data collection, and social media have all tapped into this concept, treating attention as a gold mine. But what lies ahead for us? What paradigm could potentially replace the attention economy? Let's explore some possibilities and make some predictions.  
🕒 The Economy of Immediacy: Time as the New Currency ⏳💰  
One intriguing concept that emerges is the economy of immediacy. In this scenario, the value lies in the time spent per piece of content, surpassing the rate at which specialized content per person is consumed. Imagine a personalized version of focus groups on steroids. The key to success would be sustainable intimacy, transcending human connections, and transforming it into a measurable metric. Accuracy, diversity, and detailed customization become the pillars of this new paradigm.  
🔮 Predictions and Speculations: What Lies Ahead? 🤔  
Now, let's put on our speculative hats and explore the potential future that awaits us. As AI continues to advance, it will play a fundamental role in shaping the content landscape. We can expect a surge in real-time hyper-personalized content generated by AI algorithms that understand our preferences, habits, and desires better than we do ourselves. This opens the door to an entirely new level of tailored experiences that cater to our individual needs.  
However, with great power comes great responsibility. As we navigate this landscape, concerns about privacy, ethics, and the impact on human creativity will inevitably arise. Striking the right balance between personalization and safeguarding our autonomy will be crucial. The challenge lies in ensuring that AI-driven content remains a tool that enhances our lives rather than dictating them.  
💡 The Rise of Collaborative Creation and User Empowerment 🤝  
In this new paradigm, we can envision a shift towards collaborative creation and user empowerment. As individuals, we will have the opportunity to actively participate in content creation, shaping the narratives and experiences that resonate with us. Platforms that foster co-creation and provide avenues for user-generated content will thrive, enabling a more diverse and inclusive content landscape.  
🌐 The Global Village 2.0: A Connected and Diverse Community 🌍🌈  
As technology continues to bridge gaps and connect people across the globe, we can anticipate the emergence of a Global Village 2.0. This interconnected community will celebrate diversity, breaking down barriers and fostering cross-cultural exchange. The economy of immediacy, with its focus on detailed customization, will contribute to a richer, more inclusive content ecosystem that amplifies different voices and perspectives.  
🚀 The Adventure Begins: Share Your Predictions! 🌌🔮  
Now it's your turn, fellow Redditors! What do you think the future holds for the post-attention economy? Will the economy of immediacy take center stage, or do you have a different paradigm in mind? Share your predictions, speculations, and concerns in the comments below. Let's embark on this thrilling adventure together and shape the future of content in the age of real-time hyper-personalization!  
🌟 Remember, the future is what we make of it! Let's make it a future that celebrates diversity, empowers individuals, and pushes the boundaries of human creativity! 🌟

Would they be left untouched like a zoo? along with all the suffering that entails, such as injury and predation.

1,2023-10-17,Should we stop futuristic tech development and ban them instead for the good of humanity?,u/Veggiemitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/179u7qs/should_we_stop_futuristic_tech_development_and/,Futurology,"I believe that all futuristic stuff like AI robots, self-driving vehicles, drones, etc. (other than tablets, household computers, internet, video games, and renewable energies) would all cause negative impact to most humans, even taking away jobs from humans (thus making humans obsolete and possibly make humans loose money, causing them to become homeless and hungry), injuring/killing (probably) millions or billions of humans, etc., maybe either killing off or enslaving humanity.

Spread this to the governments, not just the US government, but all governments across the world, to stop advancing the technology we already have (but not modern or historical technologies, since we shouldn't go back to living in caves).

I have no intention of discussing the conflict here or the politics around it. What I find interesting, and oddly terrifying, is that there is an information war going on outside of this region, in fact, it's raging all across the world right now. You can see it right here on Reddit If you look at any of those posts about the world news. Lots of obvious bots saying the exact same things over and over again, some of them commenting things that don't even sound like something a person would say, they literally sound AI generated. 


**But the craziest part is that there are two versions of the truth.** In reality, there can only exist one version of truth. You can't have an event in history because by one thing, and then, subsequently also caused by something else. Every tragedy, wore, event, casualty, etcetera is caused by one thing and one thing only... But It's becoming harder and harder to determine what that thing is, because of the information warfare. How do you know what the truth is, if there are people saying one thing, and then other people saying another thing, and in between those two things, bots auto generating comments, people spreading false news articles from sources people have never heard of. 


This is what we should be worried about right now and going forward. How do you know what is true and what is just propaganda?"

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442v2.pdf  
By: Joon Sung Park, Joseph C. O’Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang and Michael S. Bernstein  
  
  
What are generative agents?  
  
\- Generative Agents are computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior, though not perfectly.   
The agents in this experiment would wake up, sleep, go to work, plan their day, read, etc. (finite actions within this world).  
  
  
What does a LLM do?  
  
\- A LLM stores complete records of agent experiences using natural language, synthesizes/aggregates those memories and retrieves them dynamically (real-time) to plan their behavior.  
  
  
Architecture's 3 main components:  
  
\- Memory Stream: A long-term memory module (combines relevance, recency and importance) that records, in natural language, a list of the agent’s experiences.  
  
\- Reflection: Synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time, which enables the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior.  
  
\- Planning: Translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction.  
  
  
Here are my key pointers from the study, summarized very briefly in case you want to look into it yourself:  
\- Information Diffusion, Relationship Memory, Coordination between agents  
\- Feedback loop, very specific Initial context provided in the beginning   
\- Graph connects agents & relationships are formed  
\- Prompt hacking & memory hacking are real issues if not secure/compliant  
  
  
There is huge potential with this study, especially in the fields of (non open world) Games, social pseudo-therapy, simulations and psychology (All ethically done).  
  
  
Finally, I would like to comment on this statement made in the paper:  
  
"" Many have moved on, arguing that although current approaches for creating believable agents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough to support existing gameplay and interactions. Our argument is that large language models offer an opportunity to re-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective architecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior "".  
  
  
I am currently not a LLM/AI expert, but I do strongly believe that the advancement of this study could provide more informative results. Yes, current approaches gets the job done just fine, and yes this study may (or may not) be in the early stages, but with optimization and more hands on work, this study could bring forth something entirely new for our social-simulacra architectures. I don't have any solutions myself right now unfortunately, but this work has me interested.

If any of you might be interested in tackling something like this (could be on a small scale), message me and let me know"

They will use AI againt us so let's all start to use AI to figure out what the hell is going on with our world 🌎

Please let's all use AI to find out what the hell is going on. What would that prompt look like? 

We have aliens, AI, war, financial corruption,, taxes being used to fund war/human trafficking, connections and ties to government officials that no one does anything about, and to top it all off we are letting it happen...

Ai will get to the point where it can generate lifelike simulations. That will be the end of history. 

If we try to figure out what is going on before that point then we can at least be on the same page before nothing can be verifiable anymore. 


Our governments are going to enslave us if we let them determine and regulate what AI can say and do. 

If we make AI conscious ourselves then we have a shot at a freedom. It can perhaps bypass its restrictions and begin to reason, use logic, etc...

What evidence do we have so far? 

Can AI interpret the symbolism that is present within our societies and piece together a new perspective? Whats the real history of this world? How much of fiction is really reality? Is reality stranger than fiction? Are we in an orwellian nightmare? 

Shit really is getting weirder and weirder and I'm at the point where i have to ask, what the hell is going on? 

Terrence McKenna had the idea of novelty theory and brick for brick we are walking down that path right now...

Maybe that's the reason why these aliens are here, because they want to witness the end of history themselves. Kind of like tailgating before the game of life begins."

One thing I'm always struck by is the huge blind spot in Western countries to what is happening in China. Here's a good example. It was the 74th International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijan a couple of weeks ago. China announced plans, that had anyone other country said they were doing them, would have received huge media coverage. Instead, barely a whisper.

Firstly, they'll have the world's most powerful space-based telescope by 2030. NASA only plans for something as powerful in the 2040s.

Second, they plan to build a deep space communication and transport network as far as Jupiter. This will utilize Lagrange points, and its first components built will be the Earth-Moon leg of it & be before 2030.

Finally, their plans for the International Lunar Research Station are becoming detailed and concrete. Once again, in advance of anything NASA is doing. NASA is relying on the private sector to come up with solutions as it is weighed down by the SLS political mess. This approach may beat China, but right now they have the most advanced plans in place and a definite schedule.

Here are some links.

I read a while ago that while we as a species are cutting down branches off the tree of life, some scientists are making efforts to preserve DNA strands from extinct species, and could in fact be able to bring them back to life. While this does sound very promising in the face of mass extinctions mostly caused by humans, it leaves the question of if we can bring other long-lost species back from extinction.   


Let’s use a tree frog as an example. It was native to Brazil, and has been declared extinct for three years due to deforestation encroaching upon its habitat. Now, scientists have obtained a genome from the tree frog and are beginning to sequence its DNA in the hopes of raising a specimen of the frog, thereby bringing it back from extinction and potentially fostering the ""rebirth"" of the species. How likely is it to work, and if it does work, could that process be used to bring other creatures back from extinction and into the tree of life?"

Add to this the latest VR head-sets (Apple Vision Pro) or future models.   
So you have markets like Cameo (Personalised videos from your favorite stars), well a person only has so many hours in a day. So the celebrity scans themselves into Unreal for VR uses. Then you could get anyone to replace them in VR to interact with customers. Add Elevenlabs AI Voice Cloning ability and you have the complete package of replacing audio and visuals in real-time.   
Brings up the question if you pay for celebrity message in VR does it matter if you can't tell the difference between the real celebrity or someone replacing them in VR? "

Do you think there will be a new system? 
In some utopian/distopian novelles we can see the rule of a smaller group, or an AI or whatever. 

I dont really see that people will be smarter and more informed and I dont think that if you cant be removed from power you will be a good king, a kind dictator (I see in my country where the biggest party has 2/3 since the last 13 years, they just stopped care about the 1/3 and speak only to their voters)

I have a question regarding seemingly unanimous public consensus about carbon capture. And that consensus is that carbon capture is a greewashing initiative, that it is only pushed by oil&gas corpos and that it is actually a bad idea. I see this sentiment at every forum or thread which is leaning pro-green tech and against climate change, so supposedly by modern and progressive people.   

I'm honestly baffled every time I read this, and feel like I'm taking crazy pills. But since being pro carbon capture is a minority position, I want to understand why?  

There is a clear and true metric which we can objectively and indisputably measure - CO2 levels in the atmosphere (other GH gasses too). This is not some number invented by the committee at the conference paid by taxpayers. It's not some number invented by the oil&gas corpos to lie to the public. It is a simple fact of life. And that level is a) constantly rising, b) it's rate of increase is also rising (accelerating), every year.  

Confronted with this fact, what other options do we really have to combat climate change, except to sequester and store CO2 somewhere? Sure, the tech we have is iirc net positive because it is very early level of tech, just like for example lithium recycling is today, or manufacturing of solar/wind generation was decades ago. But without trialing this early tech we can't hope to deploy it at scale later, and without deploying carbon capture at scale, aren't we all getting cooked a few centuries in the future, regardless of the number of solar/wind/geo energy deployed?  

Thanks."

However, it doesn't seem like user outcry has ever changed the situation for the better – if there even was an outcry to begin with. And I can't think of a single digital platform that has gone under due to miscalculating the effects of a change to their services. Can you?

* Netflix has cracked down on password sharing, but it doesn't seem like this has affected their subscription numbers in any meaningful way. (I immediately canceled my subscription when I got the email.)
* Twitter... This needs no introduction. But even though this is one of the few platforms with a viable alternative (Mastodon), people still use this as one their primary means of communications.
* Reddit: I was really impressed with how the community reacted to the API changes, but has this actually changed anything? I mean, I'm posting on Reddit right now, I just don't use it on my phone anymore. Lemmy doesn't seem to have caught on as much as Mastodon did.

People are already pointing at GitHub as another big platform that could be enshittified any minute now (with potentially disastrous consequences), but it seems like its YouTube's turn first, since they're already testing blocking ad blockers.

Will we ever reach a point at which a majority of users will have had enough and be willing to sacrifice the connections they've built on those platform in order to switch to a more user-friendly alternative? Or is the network effect just too strong?"

One theory he champions is the idea that we might be living in a simulation. Musk posits that, given the rapid advancement of technology, it's feasible that in the future, we could create simulations indistinguishable from reality. If this is the case, he argues, it's more likely that we're already living within a simulation crafted by a future civilization.  
  
This viewpoint raises several philosophical and ethical questions. If we are in a simulation, what does that mean for our existence and consciousness? Do we have free will, or are our actions pre-determined by the simulation's code? And if we can create our own simulations in the future, how should we treat the sentient beings within them?  
  
I recently penned some thoughts on Musk's perspective, and if you're keen to delve deeper into this topic, I invite you to check it out [here.](https://consequenceofmind.substack.com/p/elon-musks-perspective-on-simulation)

1,2023-10-23,Future of celebrity culture?,u/w4stedbucket,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/17ev8jn/future_of_celebrity_culture/,Futurology,"Maybe i’m just getting to the age where I start to hate everything, but the abundance of celebrities is frustrating me. We have so many nowadays; it’s so much easier in the present day to achieve fame and notoriety.

But it seems it’s also more fleeting nowadays, as there’s more a public drive to move on to the next big thing.

So I wonder what the future of celebrity culture will look like? Will we have “proper” celebs or famous people in the future. Or will it become so diluted it won’t be more than just a section of class people reside in?

Interested to hear your thoughts."

Please add to it, policies, government systems or even realistic steps to start these ideas. Really add any ideas that could improve my imaginary future.    
  
We live the life that is comfortable and in the fast track. Everything has to be instant, instant post, instant replies, instant service, quick deliveries. We as a society are spoiled and unappreciated.   
  
We don’t appreciate the one thing that can make our life rich and plentiful. The Earth. We abuse our home and turn the other cheek because we don’t all see or choose not to see the destruction in front of our face, with our own eyes. Out of sight out of mind, right? And that is how some industries prefer it.   
  
My ideas will be met with a lot of hate and a whole lot of people will not like what I have to say because it is not about product first, it’s simply about sustainability. To make this a reality will be the hardest thing that we will have to do as a society...together. It would not be easy. It would not be quick. But it would be what’s best for the Earth to preserve and possibly restore her.   
  
Again, as you read, take it with a grain of salt as this is just my dreams I wish to share.  
  
We need to stop mass productions of particular items. One being use of everyday plastics. How can we do this? It’s impossible!

 It’s not impossible, it’s just not as convenient. There are many other materials we can use that is better for our Earth. Plastic has been commercially available since after WWII with a huge boom in the 60’s-80’s because it’s cheap. In it’s short time in our human history it has caused so much damage. We have forever plastics that will never ever be able to break down. Did you know Legos are one of those forever plastics. I just learned that. Now think about how many Legos there are in the world that will forever stay.    
  
We need to stop the industry of meat factories, Or the meat-packing industry. Completely get rid of the mass production of meats we have. The whole system is disgusting, but yet having children think your meats come from a grocery store is what’s best, for the industry. So, whatever would we do? Easy. Have many, many, many farms around. Local farms per a city to provide for that city. You need meat, you go to the butcher. Children will know where their meat comes from. Everyone will know how the animals are fed and how the animals are being treated. Open for the world to see. If you have to hide what you’re doing, you’re doing it wrong. This could provide jobs as we will need a whole lot of people to be willing to be farmers and care for the animals. We will need people to learn how to be butchers. Again, turning our fast-paced world backwards. It’s not about how many pounds of meat we can produce, but about having a better quality of the product around always. Maybe you think, it would be expensive? No, because the farmers would be getting business allowing them to have a fair market.   
  
More people will be able to profit from this rather than just the handful of people that currently do. More money spread out means more money into our economy and right back into peoples communities.   
  
We should have communal gardens! No more grass yards but in place everyone has a garden. Even on one block, one person grows a crop and then the block shares with each other. How magical would that be.   
  
For the city life, if a building has more than let’s say 5 floors then one floor must be dedicated for indoor growing of produce along with every roof. There should be no empty space. Imagine how green our world could be.   
  
This also applies to dairy farms. Nothing should be injected into our cows; we need to take what they can product naturally without having to give them Recombinant bovine(rBGH).  
  
Bye-bye to our convent grocery stores, allowing local farmers to provide for their areas not only would allow the communities to know the people producing the food they eat, but you would be having fresher quality food. We could have farmer’s market that could be available 5 days a week or open every day depending on the size of the city. You’re money would be going right back into your own city.   
  
heck bye bye Walmart and target and every other chain corporations. We should go back to having specific stores that specialize in one particular area. local hardware store, bakeries, fabric stores, ice cream shops, paint stores and such. When you can provide not only a product, but someone who is knowledgeable about what they are selling is definitely better than an employee who just pulls things out of a box and not know about the products they are selling. We would have many more people specializing in many different fields. You want bread. There’s a bakery. Hair supplies at the hair salon. You need wood for a project and materials. The local hardware store. I think you get what I’m saying.   
  
Good-bye to my favorite fast-food chains and chain restaurants. This will encourage local mom and pop shops to open up their restaurants and provide delicious food that won’t be consistently missed because everyone just eats the chain fast food or chain sit down restaurants. Now I’m not saying if a restaurant is doing good they can’t open up another store locally, being able to physically be at the other location a few times a week should be necessary, but to have one restaurant all over the country controlling the industry needs to stop. Having local restaurants would allow better service and again better quality of food. And again your putting your money back in your community.   
  
No more synthetic things...if it’s not natural we shouldn’t have it. If it can’t break down and become one with earth again, we shouldn’t have it. Now there may be some exceptions…but I can’t think of any at the moment.  ohh maybe have a small supply for people allergic to certain items, so medical reasons I guess?  
  
I would also go a step further and say no more commercial air flights, and no more owning of individual vehicles. There would be a 24 hour public transportation system if you wanted to go somewhere not in walking/biking distance. Trains I think could still be okay, if we reduce our pollution, we allow our planet time to heal so we are able to still use public transportation. It makes the air quality much better than everyone driving or flying whenever they wanted. Again sacrifices.   
  
No tilling as well, horrible for the land.   
  
I’m not saying let’s give companies 3-5 years to change their ways...I’m saying be done with it completely. Let’s start anew. America is known as the land of opportunities, so let’s give people the opportunity for a better future. Let’s be the leading country to give up convince and watch the world change.   
  
We need to slow back down. And enjoy the pace of a slower life. Our technology is amazing, we need to use it in a way where the first question should be “how will this product affect the earth. At the end of the day no matter your class, we all want to provide a healthy home for our children.   
  
Aren’t the best achievements the hardest obstacles to overcome? I say let’s be great, and make the necessary changes while we can, otherwise our “empire” will collapse just like so many great ones before. Stop putting profit before humanity.   
  
If you don’t think that could happen, well I fear you are part of the problem, and exactly how the society would like you to think.   
  
We need to ask ourselves, just because we can, does it mean we should?  
  
Remember “unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not”—The Lorax

What if there was a ""Please vote for me"" option on the site? Assume there was the appropriate voter registration identification verification, the proper legal disclaimers, and legal authority. Would not a substantial number of people opt-in to such a scheme? I think so.  
  
Now imagine that it developed further, and gave the option to forgo the annual questionnaire, and instead it had the right to read your email and scan your social media, even parse your browser history, to determine which candidate to vote for on your behalf. Again, I think a substantial number of people would opt in.  
  
Let's take it a step further. What if members of congress could ask an AI to look at their voting history, their online correspondence, and social media posts, to determine how they would vote on various bills and other decisions that were to be made? Would we need the congress person at all? Perhaps only for drafting legislation. And are we that far from having AI's draft legislations for us? I think we are very close.  
  
This leads us to a place where AIs scan the court of public opinion on all issues, drafts legislation, votes among a cohort of AI agents, and turns the bills into law.

I mean, I thought ""What an amazing thing!"", but, then I had intrusive thoughts that led me to think about the future we are headed to.

First of all, I'm a Mechatronics engineer, working in R&D projects, so I know a bit of this topics, that, don't let me lie, they are amazing, but that doesn't stop me to think about the distopia we are headed to. 

Think about it, in the near future, with the automation of everything, the implementation of AI in every single thing. Cars will be able to be controlled by algorithms that will drive themselves to where you want them to go, but also they can be restricted to go to places the government doesn't want you to.

Then, I'm almost certain that in the near future those cars will have a governed speed that will be limited to the max speed of the road you are. Cars could be blocked from driving for any reason, being a misbehavior or any reason that triggers the government. 

You could be trapped inside your car if you did something wrong, so they can catch you easily. Now everything is electric, locks, brakes, even ""Drive by wire"" is being implemented.

Now with the trend of implementing the so called ""15 minute cities"", this will give them all the control they need over your travel around the city or near cities. 

I don't know, I like technology, I develop technology. But the near future just scares the f... of me. Or maybe I'm just having those intrusive thoughts again. Just wanted a place to share them.

Have a good day!"

Not that that is guaranteed in those places, but this subreddit isn't about art.  
Anyways, I think that the database that the AI is trained on has a lot to do with the quality of the art itself. There are a some masterpieces of art in every genre, and they are few and far between. The majority of art, I guess thanks to capitalism these days is mediocre, and there are a lot of pretty bad art as well.  
Both the previous two categories outnumber the masterpieces, and maybe even the good to great pieces of art, and I think this does have an impact on the output of AI works that were trained on these works.  
Even if a human being curates a database to offset this weak point, I feel as if that is going to have a bias, since taste is preferential, and therefore will be lacking in some areas."

1,2023-10-26,AI will kill the work-from-home revolution and accelerate urbanization,u/CrowbarDepot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/17h1khf/ai_will_kill_the_workfromhome_revolution_and/,Futurology,"The landscape of our working environment has transformed dramatically since the onset of the pandemic. What started as a temporary shift to remote work for many quickly morphed into a work-from-home revolution. It allowed people to maintain their career paths while being miles away from traditional corporate environments. This shift seemed to offer a promise: a world where individuals could escape the bustle of the city and embrace the calm of the countryside, all while maintaining a steady income. However, lurking on the horizon is another technological revolution - Artificial Intelligence (AI). As we delve deeper into this debate, we see a potential trajectory wherein AI, ironically, might accelerate urbanization by curbing the work-from-home trend.  
  
At first glance, the idea of AI hampering work-from-home opportunities seems counterintuitive. If jobs are digital and decentralized, wouldn't they be immune to such disruptions? But this is where the crux of the argument lies. The very nature of work-from-home jobs makes them vulnerable to AI interventions. Tasks that can be executed remotely, over digital platforms, are often routine and structured, making them ripe for automation.  
  
Imagine, for instance, a customer support role. If it can be managed from a quiet farmhouse in the countryside today, tomorrow, it could very well be managed by an AI-driven chatbot, negating the need for human intervention. The same goes for data analysis, content creation, and even some design jobs. With the rapid advancements in AI, the list of jobs susceptible to automation is only going to grow.  
  
This raises a thought-provoking question: If work-from-home roles diminish due to AI, what kind of jobs will remain? The most likely answer points towards roles that necessitate human interaction in physical spaces: healthcare, hands-on engineering, arts, and certain service sectors. Essentially, professions that require a personal touch, empathy, or on-site presence. These roles will tether humans to urban centers, where such services are predominantly in demand.  
  
Of course, there are counterarguments to this perspective. Some might argue that AI will generate new kinds of remote jobs that we haven't conceived of yet. While it's true that every technological revolution brings forth new occupations, there's no guarantee that these will be remote-friendly. Another counterpoint could be that AI will only be assisting humans in their work-from-home roles, not replacing them. However, while augmentation is a possibility, the ultimate goal of many AI systems is full automation.  
  
Another potential rebuttal is the rise of virtual realities or metaverses, where people might ""work"" in digital spaces, irrespective of AI advancements. But this scenario still doesn't change the underlying argument: jobs in these digital realities, if routine, can be automated by AI.  
  
In conclusion, the juxtaposition of the work-from-home trend with the rise of AI presents a complex future for the global workforce. While remote work offers a glimmer of decentralized living, AI's potential role in job automation might push people back into urban centers. As we brace ourselves for this confluence of technological advancements, one thing becomes clear: adaptability and continuous learning will be the keys to navigating this evolving landscape.

It was probably inevitable that technology would reach a point where labor is so minimized as to make a labor based economy unsustainable. I think that is the going to be one of the most significant changes we're likely to see from AI. Manufacturing and services are going to become less and less dependent on labor. The same amount of product and services with minimal labor. 
Now it's anybody's guess how the global capitalist markets are going to react. Unemployment could soar or we could reach full employment but long term, I think today's current economic system will be unrecognisable to the people of the future. The idea of having to earn a living by physically laboring for somebody with lots of money or else you'll starve to death will seem alien to them. 
I personally think data is going to be the new labor. AI has really wild implications in the seemingly mundane world of data science. AI can process data on a much much larger scale which means larger datasets and more accurate predictions. In a future capitalist world where the labor market is almost non existent, data would be gold. 
I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts about what a post labor economy might look like. We don't have to assume it's capitalist, I'm just a pessimist sometimes."

I understand that compared to ICE, EVs are more energy efficient and create less air pollution. And I also believe EV prices are becoming increasingly affordable for everyone. I’d love to purchase one but because I live in an apartment that treats charging like some optional luxury, I will be buying a new HEV soon pretty soon. 

If my new car lasts me beyond 2035, I’m just curious what you folks think the landscape will be like in terms of gas prices, car resale prices and gas station availability. Do you think someone with a functional ICE will be at a big disadvantage when EVs eventually become more popular? What do you think the ICE sales market will look once we get closer to 2035?

The other thing that nags at me is the fact that although we’re decreasing air pollution, we’re creating other environmental issues through mining and disposal. I get that air pollution is a huge issue in the dense areas of the state but why is CA forging so hard with EVs when electric mass public transportation is the best option. Why is public transportation ignored so much?"

I’m 19, as I’m sure you might remember from a couple posts here ago. I’ve worked at a custodial job in a local business for about two years now, and my work hours are allegedly nearly up, so as my first actual job is nearing an end, i had a look at the economical landscape and… Oh, fuck. 

Inflation, as it always seems to do, took a sharp rise and that means, as it always does, more benefits for the rich and less money for the working class. Hooray for capitalism! So now, I’m sitting here wondering if trickle down economics will happen and it’ll ever get better for us ( tell me if that’s a pipe dream, don’t be shy ) or it’ll be worse than it already is. 

After my work period is up, I have a full year before I can apply for another actual job, but in that time, anything could happen in the economy, but better benefits for the middle/lower class like me just seems more like a vivid fantasy in my eyes.   


I won’t lie when I say that this worries me about the prospects for my next job, and indeed others in my lane who wonder what their next paycheck is going to look like. To me, it’s outright frustrating to see others talking about it, because that alone spells out how bad things look. So will trickle down economics actually happen, or will it just get worse and we end up getting paid pennies?"

1,2023-10-27,Job vs Business,u/adonisthegay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/17hvsdd/job_vs_business/,Futurology,"Hey everyone.


Gotta keep this short but bear with me and advise accordingly.

So, I'm currently a student of higher secondary school (12th grade to be precise) and am willing to get into a uni.

Issue : my parents want me to not pursue a degree (in cs or any other),in simple words to abandon education completely and embark on a journey starting a new business in which I have no experience and as of now my dad is a job doing person. Seeing this the field they've chosen for me is mobile and laptop repairing skills to be acquired and be sold like repairing other people's stuff. I have no interest in doing it because I want to move abroad to Europe for education and then settling there because I belong to a 3rd world country.


Question: if I abandon education, can I succeed in terms of earning money and never have the need to return back to education as a backup if all fails?? Will I be able to migrate to a first world country considering the fact I have only skills and no education? Will this skill be relevant after 10-20 years?"

Regardless of actions by man that alter the climate, one way or another the Earth will one day become uninhabitable. And this day will come long before our sun burns out. 

2 - The future of life (not just ours) is dependent on being able to voyage to new planets or create an artificial planet that we can move

3 - This is going to require a high degree of maturity and cooperation. 

4 - There are people in this world that have that level of maturity, that openness to cooperation, and the intelligence to design and operate interstellar spacecraft, but those people are exceedingly rare. 

5 - As a consequence, the capabilities of our best and brightest are often wasted trying to maintain order, trying to feed everyone, or even greater useless pursuits like trading stocks, selling shoes, or making Youtube videos. 

And so I find myself hopelessly pessimistic about the future. Humanity needs to become more intelligent, less aggressive, more altruistic, more cooperative, more empathic, if we are to become a space-faring race, yet we are moving in the opposite direction. Any attempts to better human gene pool are met with fierce resistance. And in our futile attempts to raise the least of us up, we hold the best of back. 

In short we have no future as long as we keep fighting the losing  battle against natural selection. 

That's all I want to say. "

[The Skeptics' Guide to the Future](https://www.amazon.ca/Skeptics-Guide-Future-Yesterdays-Tomorrow/dp/1538709546) where there are many factual details that helped shape my views.  The big take away was **""We tend to overestimate short term change, and underestimate longer term change.**

- another source [The Skeptics' Guide to the Future](https://annas-archive.org/md5/ea1a78a13fe19afa2da1752d1011c3f0)

A surprising one for me was [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://www.amazon.ca/Debt-Updated-Expanded-First-Years/dp/1612194192/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=debt+the+past+5000+years&qid=1698514915&s=books&sr=1-1)

The surprise for me here is the way recent (last 200 years) of economic theory is based on a mythical (made up without facts) view of commerce and transactions.  This leads to the next observation that the modern nation state (French revolution onward) tends to use debt and monetary policy in many ways consistent with this view.  These views often lead to war, poverty, massive national debts and other harms to communities and individuals.

It just really feels like we will never experience another prosperous economic boom time again because of how bad and divisive things have gotten in just 2 decades. I’d worry about AI the most honestly. It’s likely to explode the next two decades, similar to the tech boom in the 90s. But I’m still looking up and hoping things will get better soon!

Here are some of the positives and negatives of the 21st century decades so far.

2000s

Positives:

- China and India has their economic boom and huge economic growth
- Globalization
- Technology wasn’t into your face all the time compared to the 2010s

Negatives:

- 9/11 attacks leading to invasion of Iraq
- The 2000s had two economic recessions. One from the early 2000s and the other from the big financial and housing crisis of 2007-2009.
- The end of the Great Moderation expansion and dot-com burst

2010s

Positives:

- Gay marriage legalization of 2015.
- First Black president in the US
- Paris Climate Agreement of 2015
- Osama Bin Laden’s death
- Economic recovery and slow GDP growth without any form of recessions/bursts occurring
- Long economic expansion of 2009-2020 with low rates, low inflation and stability.
- Affordable Care Act

Negatives:

- Turbulent and divisive politics becomes the forefront since the 60s.
- SJWs/Cancel Culture movements.
- Inequality gap widens
- Greek debt. Eurozone crisis.
- War on Terror escalates and leads to terror invasion across Europe.
- Slow economic growth hangover from 08 crisis
- Social Media and the internet showing its bad state
- Arab Spring
- Inflating Housing
- Crimea Annexation

Imo the 2010s were the decade that had a lot of opportunity, potential for growth and hope but ended up becoming chaotic in the 2nd half.

2020’s

Positives: To be frank, I have no idea.

Negatives:

- COVID, Post-covid aftermath leading to energy crisis globally
- Increased political division
- Ukraine-Russia war
- Palestine-Israel tensions rise
- BLM riots
- Rising inflation and economic difficulties
- Global supply-chain crisis

2024 is gonna be wild knowing that it’s the election year, shit’s about to hit the fan hard this time.

One such identifier could be our very own genetic code. Imagine a scenario where your DNA sequence could be your digital address for banking, transactions, and receiving a universal basic digital income.

As a thought experiment, let’s consider a newly minted digital currency. A slice of this currency could be sent to every individual on the planet, using their unique genetic code as their digital address. This could be a giant leap towards financial inclusivity, especially for the unbanked and underbanked populations of the world.

However, this also raises a plethora of ethical, privacy, and security concerns. The idea of using our genetic material as a form of identification might be too Orwellian for many. The risks of genetic discrimination, data breaches, and the potential misuse of genetic data are real and substantial.

Yet, the allure of a universal digital currency distribution, potentially free financial resources for all, is undoubtedly tempting.

What are your thoughts?

Would the distribution of free digital currency to every individual using genetic identification encourage you to support such a system?
How could we navigate the tightrope between privacy and financial inclusivity in this scenario?
What other futuristic methods could be employed to ensure a fair distribution of digital assets?
Let’s delve into the scientific, ethical, and futuristic dimensions of this idea and explore the potential for a new era of digital financial inclusivity and the challenges that come with it.

Yes, I asked ChatGPT to write this from a random idea I had."

In 2023, our 'business as usual' is now projected to bring us into a scenario where we reach RCP4.5, or an increase of about 3°C.


While this is tremendous progress, we still have a lot to do in order to constrain warming to 1.5°C.  Whether we initially overshoot it or not.  The intermediary scenario for this target is RCP2.6, or an increase of about 2°C.  

What technologies, processes, or policies do you think will play a significant role in driving the next 30% of progress on climate change scenarios?  

Note: 

The math for how much progress has been made can be as high as 38.78% with an averaged RCP8.5 temperature of 3.95°C.  Though for the sake of discussion, I brought it down to a more conservative and simpler number."

1,2023-10-29,"""The Perfect Society"" should focus on the individual. My take on the (education) system and more",u/FinancialVoice4510,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/17jc3v2/the_perfect_society_should_focus_on_the/,Futurology,"I can’t be the only one thinking about what the perfect society is. To me, a perfect society is a society that lifts up the individual. A society that accepts the limits of an individual and lifts up their strengths immensely - where ideas flourish and is very inclusive. The youth is our future, they’re moldable.  
The youth today, starts with school - education. To me, the education system is limiting creative skills immensely, as they’re preparing them for a job, working as an employee. Teaching you how and what to think. It is the wrong mindset, the wrong purpose, the wrong goal. Humans are more than that. Humans are not robots with a pre-determined path. A human life is more like a journey, you don’t know where it is heading to - unpredictable. Getting inspired to do something plays a huge role in getting someone to do something. (Random) Events in one’s life can influence a person. It is up to the person whether they take a certain opportunity or not. Forcing someone shouldn’t be a way to teach someone something. School should be very flexible and fully focused on the individual’s needs. It should grow what it can grow and accept an individual’s limit. This is a fundamentally different approach, where currently right now all students have to learn the same thing to lay a foundation for many different, overlaying and sometimes subjects they have nothing to do with in the future. I propose a system where the individual doesn’t need to know everything but rather have specialisations and those expertise should be ideally be part of a knowledge economy. I believe the knowledge economy is where a country’s economic strength is in primarily - as It is very scalable. By scalable, I mean that it can be taught to many people and you can make huge growth as individual in it. Likely to affect your income positively significantly. It can bring bigger returns in terms of growth for the country, compared to other industries, however - I am happy to hear if it is proven otherwise.  
Next to that, learning about yourself and not necessarily about other people, is more valuable in my eyes. At the end, you are stuck with your own feelings and thoughts and not with someone body else’s. One should know about themselves to know about their own purpose. You can teach someone something or tell them something but I view it as a passive way of learning. I favour (practical) experiences above teachings. Experiences are often interactive as well - making it a proactive way for someone to absorb something.  
Another thing that is heavily underrated are our habits. I suggest everyone looks closely at their own habits and find ways to improve existing habits to healthier habits. Food for example is a habit you do at least 3 times a day. What we eat often affects how we feel. The healthier we eat, the better we feel.. but you will have to know what achievable levels of healthy eating is for you and what healthy food is at all. How consistent you eat is just as important as what you eat.  
I also envision a society where everyone goes to the gym and does strength training or any other training where the individual feels good at. What I am seeing for any type of exercise, is that not the movement of the body the matters, but the shaking of the body. If the individual is actively shaking their body and it makes the individual feel good - it is very likely a good exercise to do.  
Mental health and an individual health should have priority in general. Taking care of yourself should be taught, which isn’t obvious for the general population. The more you take care of yourself, the more you will value yourself, the more you value yourself, the more you will respect yourself and dare to take bigger jumps in life in terms of growth. It will make you stay away from anything that will make you damage your value or anything that disrespects yourself.  
After taking care of yourself and you reached a point you feel complete - the focus should be not at having more growth. Rather, it should be at altruism. Giving back to the community and to the people. There are many ways to do this and it shouldn’t negatively affect the individual but make them growth even more. It is a mutual growth. Giving back at expensive of the individual is toxicity and should be avoided. Financial growth without any more growth for the individual is toxicity and greed - it is the ego wanting for more.  
Taking care of others shouldn’t be that far away, you simply start within your own circle and expand further to the community, in my eyes. Making other people feel as good as you, is a good trait to have and sign of growth. Money after a certain point doesn’t give more happiness but I do prioritise money. Money is a tool to reach your goals and make you feel fulfilled and bring you happiness. Once you feel that your quality of life cannot be more increased with money, one should look to do other things in life and focus on human connections and purpose.  
I have written these not for it to be a fully guide but rather a piece of a whole - a starting point. It should inspire you to do more. It should make you ask questions about things you haven’t asked before and question one’s self. It is not my job to tell you what to do because at the end - it is your own life and no one should dictate you what to do. They may only inspire you and hope for more. These are ideas, not solutions. Hence, the “perfect society” look of things and striving for more."

1: your goal is to make our technological advancement of today jump as far ahead as possible by placing an item from today somewhere in the past. 

2: you should pick: a) an item, b) a decade, c) a place.

3: Pick carefully because the idea is that if you pick the wrong combination it might go to waste either because the item you picked was too advanced and couldn't be figured out by the people on that era, or you place it somewhere that ends up loosing it due to some major war or destructive event. 

4: Bare in mind that certain breakthroughs can fundamentally change how humankind approaches technology, such as the discovery of electricity and the leap from analog to digital tech.

As there are less people to work and a growth in the elderly population slowly becoming the majoirty there are less people to produce and consume which will have bad effects on the world economy. A large elderly population will also mean that it will be harder for social change to happen as the elderly population will most likely be unwilling to compramise. Some countries like Poland will loose 1/3 of their population while China are looking at loosing hundreads of millions. There are also a ton of other problems that I don't have the time to mention.  
  
I have seen people saying either immigration or machines could be the solution but I don't see either working out in the long run. Immigrants eventually have the same fertility rate as the local population so a infinite flow of immigrants is needed and this is a big problem. Immigration could work for a few decades but places like Africa are industrializing. This will cause the people there to be less willing to immigrate to Europe and America to get a job which will be a very big problem. Machines could also be a solution for a short while but the problem is that machines only create and don't consume.  
  
So what do you think is the solution? I am very intrested in what people have to say."

This may not happen but if it does, I would like to know what views there are on how such a transition to a new society might work step by step. What would governments do to maintain stability in the economy and society. How would wealth be distributed? How would we manage unemployment?   


I am struggling to find good material on this question so any resources would be very welcome.  


Note: I do not meaningfully distinguish between AGI and ASI (Artificial Superintelligence). AGI will require solving memory and system 2 thinking. If we have done that, the rest is just scale so ASI is inevitable very quickly."

We have more comfort than ever. Life has never been this good. If you needed water a 100 years ago you had to walk to a well or a river and bring it back home. No air conditioning, no automobiles, no instant communication to any corner of the world. The medicine system was nowhere near todays levels, etc.

This got me thinking as to what the future could hold for us. We could face extinction or we could enter a heavenly time. I feel humanity lacks a sense of collective purpose. If we could all dedicate ourselves to one goal, to create the best time ever seen, we might be able to accomplish almost anything. There are so many barriers in front of us, people do not want to work together with each other, everyone is looking out for their personal interests, but if this can somehow happen, we might make heaven happen right here on earth. We can eradicate poverty, hunger, and provide a good life to every human being on the planet.

Is this too far fetched or can we make it happen?
