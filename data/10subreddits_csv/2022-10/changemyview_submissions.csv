You get home to clean your soles. Is your first instinct to wipe it with tissue or wet wipes?

This is basically where my argument rests. Lots of people complain about having “spicy hot” or “stinging” backsides. Usually, not cleaning properly is the cause. 

That’s why hose bidets are a solution. You clean up well, and then you can go on with your day (you can even use soap, mind you for extra cleanliness).

One downside would be what people call “swamp ass”, which isn’t a problem until you decide not to dry after you are done. Just clean up, use TP to dry off and throw the TP in the bin, and don’t flush it. You don’t want to cause clogs.

60,2022-10-01,"CMV: left-wing people should be against mass migration, even more than the right.",u/fantasy53,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xss9dr/cmv_leftwing_people_should_be_against_mass/,changemyview,"I would say that I’m fairly left-wing in many of my views, but it’s never made any sense to me why leftists ignore and understate the left-wing argument against mass migration.
Mass migration predominantly benefits businesses, because workers from cheaper countries will generally work for less money than their native counterparts,, this forces wages down for everyone and severely limits the power of unions, since any striking workers can just be fired and replaced with new ones.
The counter argument I hear sometimes is that eventually the immigrants will align with the native workers to demand higher wages and better working conditions, but I don’t understand how this is possible.
To be frank, a Polish taxi driver can make much more money in the UK than he can in Poland doing the same job, I don’t see him jeopardising that to stand in solidarity with working-class people in the UK.
Many right-wing parties, which are essentially at this point mouthpieces for big business, claim to be tough on immigration but in reality they are not.
Consider, there were more migrants coming to the UK under the government of Boris Johnson than there were before, though he claimed to be quite tough on that, but he knew more migration means lack of power for workers, it’s simple supply and demand."
10,2022-10-01,CMV: The UK media must wean itself off its obsession with the Royal Family - especially if it claims to value democracy,u/FaerieStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xssixh/cmv_the_uk_media_must_wean_itself_off_its/,changemyview,"The last few weeks in the UK have been a bizarre and terrifying place for those of us who don't see why the death of a wealthy elderly celebrity should be given a single second of media attention.

Through excessive coverage, even liberal outlets like The Guardian have been tripping over themselves to show deference: you'd expect this sort of medieval nonsense from The Express of course, but it was a shock to see liberal outlets crooking the knee, even if they did give some time to [republicans like Clive Lewis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/16/mourning-republicans-system-privilege?fbclid=IwAR0wDr23uEBz4SxZrhjfnxv2PIKqgnzMxIzyBdCLtmc7fegoI_ydYrSi67Q). And the BBC was rightly dubbed 'MournHub' for its Diana-level of cult-like coverage.

It's a disturbing idea that through this bombardment, British citizens have been made to feel like they have an obligation to care more about the death of this disgustingly rich woman than the deaths of other strangers who died in the same week as her, people far more deserving of our tears not having been born into gilded lives of wealth and power. Chris Kaba, for instance, the black man shot dead by the police in London, or the dozens of drowned migrants in foreign waters who are only ever a news footnote.

I do understand the concept of vicarious mourning, and to slightly revise my hyperbolic opening remark I am not saying that celebrity deaths deserve no news coverage. Recently the deaths of Hilary Mantel and Jean-Luc Godard have shocked and saddened me: they've made beautiful and bold contributions to culture and society. But even though I think everyone should read Wolf Hall (it's a masterpiece) and perhaps most people should watch Breathless (it's fascinating) I would be appalled if the news was so deluged in tributes to these individuals that any British citizen (or French, in J-LG's case) were made to feel they 'had' to mourn someone they did not know.

The worst thing about the terrifying mediascape of September 2022 has been the doublethink at play. Britain loves to call itself a democracy ('democracy' is even taught in schools as a so-called 'British Value') but you can't claim to be in favour of democracy and simultaneously celebrate an institution operating on a basis of hereditary wealth and power.

We need to stop giving this celebrity family/institution, a symbol of vast wealth inequality in the UK and a relic of colonial times (and before that, feudal times) any attention, and I believe that this should start with the media: firstly the media which styles itself as liberal, left-wing and valuing democracy."
0,2022-10-01,"CMV: A ""culture of imperialism"" is as valid as any other culture.",u/Presentalbion,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xssrsa/cmv_a_culture_of_imperialism_is_as_valid_as_any/,changemyview,"Under cultural relativism culture is understood on its own terms and judgement is not made using the standards of one's own culture.

Imperialism is about the spread of power, exerting influence via colonies, military force, coercion, and many other means.

Christian missionaries are an example of religious imperialism, it is their religious duty to spread the word of God to those it had not reached. Christianity thrives under this imperial methodology.

The US exports culture, and establishes military bases all over in order to maintain a seat of power within that country.

Often the motivation is framed as humanitarian, influence over less developed places in order to benefit and extend part of your own culture into them to grow together.

Imperialism as a culture can be looked at from a standpoint of cultural relativism, understood on its own terms. Many cultures have questionable practices, but that doesn't make them less valid, even though they are open to criticism they are not automatically in the wrong.

Attempts to force change to a culture is itself cultural imperialism. Looking to change someone whose culture involves imperialism is a paradox.

There aren't many cultures that don't look to grow and expand and exert their will on others. I don't think that imperialism is limited to any specific groups, although I've offered some examples above. All culture involves imperialism to some extent.

If you'd like to change my view I'd want to see an understanding of why one culture may be more absolved or not of such philosophies, how double standards can be justified to see some imperialism as OK and some as not OK. I'd want specific examples of culture where their imperialism is acceptable contrasted with examples where it is not, and a good basis of why that is through a cultural relativism framework. What authority can arbitrate such a topic? Who can really claim that one culture is valid while another isn't, even if using toxic practices? Are there any cultures that exist without toxic practices?"
89,2022-10-01,"CMV: When the age of consent is set over 16 years of age, there should be at least a 2 year, close in age exemption when both people are 16+",u/BOfficeStats,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xsszeo/cmv_when_the_age_of_consent_is_set_over_16_years/,changemyview,"In the US, the states of California and Wisconsin set the age of consent at 18 without a legal exemption when one person is 16/17 and the other is 18/19 (assuming they are unmarried).  Thus, it would be a crime for the older partner (18-19) to have sex with the younger partner (16-17).  I think it is bad for there to **not** be a legal exemption in these cases:

1.

The damage caused by these relationships due to the age gap alone isn't that substantial.  People do change as they get older but a difference of a year or two at that age isn't that large, often unnoticable.  There are many 16 and 18 year olds who are in a similar stage in life, have the same interests, have the same social groups, and are be able to have a healthy relationship with each other.

2.

A lot of people are unaware of their region's exact age of consent laws.  It is likely that many of the teens in the states I mentioned would not know that it would be a crime even if the younger partner and older partner were just a couple days apart (assuming they are unmarried).  It can be very easy for a teen to commit this crime without realizing that they violated the law.

3.

A couple could get together at a younger age without taking the law into consideration. When the older partner becomes an adult, it may be difficult for them to break up and/or abstain from all sexual behavior until the younger partner is over 18.  

4.

Criminalizing these age gaps leads to money and resources being spent in the legal system to resolve useless cases that shouldn't exist.  A younger partner or parent might try to get the older partner in trouble with the law for unimportant or ridiculous reasons.    Blackmail could also be a problem.  

While these problems exist for other violations of the age of consent, I think that the percent of reported cases which are a waste of resources are much greater than that of other cases where the age gap is bigger or the younger partner is younger.

5.

Most places around the world legally allow 16/17 year olds to have sex with 18/19 year olds yet there doesn't seem to be substantial evidence that they are worse off for it.

EDIT:

The Texas age of consent is actually 17 and there are Romeo and Juliet laws there."

I’m under no delusion that anarchism is an answer to all the worlds problems. Wars would still be fought, probably for the same reason. But people would be free to associate, trade, and have control over where they spend their money/resources.

If we can exist on a global scale without government…why not on a national level? Why not on every level?"

This is an illegitimate position to hold. Anyone who genuinely believes in this fear-mongering is an unserious person and we should be highly suspicious of their other beliefs (to the point of outright dismissing their claims).

That said, I want to make this perfectly clear: *I am not saying* that we should ignore anyone and everyone who has *ever* expressed concerns about threats to a society's young folk. That is an absolute position and in general, I do not think that absolute beliefs are valid (with a few exceptions). The topic of how a society should go about protecting children from harm \~ including how we define harm, and the relationship between actions and harmful outcomes \~ is a highly dynamic, complex and nuanced thing. Therefore, I wish to explain my position in more detail, so that the reader might fully understand how I've come to this belief and what I mean when I summarize it as I did above.

First, obviously, a progressive society has a duty to organize itself in a manner that promotes the health and well-being of its members. We also have a duty to care for those who cannot care for themselves. Children fall into this group \~ though the exact line of distinction between a child (who requires adult supervision or aid) and an adult (who can generally look after themselves^(2)) is a blurry one, in an ethical sense \~ thus, as a responsible, mature and advanced society, we must be concerned with the possibility of harm to our children, and we must be prepared to adopt policies and procedures which mitigate that risk of harm.

Second, unfortunately, there are disingenuous actors who make use of these legitimate concerns to push their agenda. To take just one example (and there are many), let's consider the Satanic Panic: in the 1980s, a number of alleged cases of Satanic ritual abuse came to prominence across America and the UK. The movement was fueled (in part) by the book *Michelle Remembers*, which purported to be a biographical account of a child raised in a Satanic cult. This book was later discredited due to a lack of supporting evidence. Indeed, *most* of the over 12,000 cases allegedly linked to Satanic rituals were discredited in one way or another; and none of them were found to be linked to a nationwide organization. This conclusion is critical to understanding my point because while *some* of these cases were legitimate examples of sexual and religious abuse, the *overarching claim* of the Satanic Panic was that they were all linked together; that there was a nationwide group of Satanists who had infiltrated various levels of society; and that these devil-worshippers were preying upon our children, often in plain sight. In the end, this conspiracy was found to be total garbage, but not before it had the effect of causing harm to innocent people.

Third, the Satanic Panic is just one example of a moral panic, or a widespread feeling of fear that some nefarious person (or thing) threatens the well-being and values of an entire society. While I do believe that such threats exist \~ we need only look at something like World War II and the Holocaust to see that this is the case \~ moral panics that revolve around concerns of mass abuse or indoctrination of children are largely founded on baseless accusations^(3). Furthermore, these accusations have always existed, primarily as a means to organize a society to fight against a perceived enemy. The intent is quite simple, really: there's a group of people within a society who hate another group of people (who might be in the same society or part of another society) and wish to see them come to harm; but the society at large isn't exactly on board with taking steps necessary to bring harm to these perceived enemies. Thus, the hateful group needs to turn their society against their enemy, if they're to advance their goals; and one of the best ways to do this, is to lie about the perceived enemy; and one of the best lies you can tell about your opposition is that they're a danger to your children.

Fourth, and finally, I do not think it's possible for someone who genuinely believes in a moral panic \~ *absent any form of legitimate evidence that such a threat exists* \~ to participate in society in a manner that is considered decent or appropriate. In other words, *if you genuinely believe a threat exists to your child's well-being*, ***you are obligated*** to take action to protect your children, up to and including outright murdering your opponents. Such persons ***CANNOT*** be trusted with positions of influence or authority in our society. Their beliefs will lead them to courses of action that undermine the fabric of society. They will lie to and mislead the general public; they will fabricate and twist evidence to support their delusions; they will champion policies and laws that cause more harm than good; and when push comes to shove, they will have no qualms about using whatever resources are at their disposal to harm and kill their opponents.

Therefore, whenever I see someone going on about ""indoctrinating children"" or the ""risks"" of allowing children to learn about the world around them, I'm immediately suspicious of the claims. And when I learn that those claims have no basis in factual evidence, I'm left to conclude that the person making them is a disingenuous political actor and someone who should be shunned from normal society^(4).

Change my view.

*Notes:*

*1: I acknowledge that there* ***might*** *be some left-wing sources that adopt this attitude. I haven't come across any but if I did, I would evaluate them according to the same criteria listed above. If I find that they meet that criteria, I would take the same approach: stop consuming their content and ignore any points that they make.*

*The difference between these hypothetical fear-mongering left-wingers and the* ***actual*** *fear mongering right-wingers is that the various opinions of the former are properly backed up by rational thought, research and consistent beliefs* ***as held by other leftists****. I don't see a fair comparison to right-wing rhetoric or ideas, since so much of it is formed from irrational thinking and lacks supporting research or data.*

*2: Not accounting for adults with mental or physical conditions that limit their ability to properly care for themselves.*

*3: An astute reader might point to things like America's and Canada's repeated attempts to assimilate indigenous folk into their Western/European culture. This would be a legitimate example of a moral panic* ***on the basis*** *that we have evidence demonstrating both the intent and the actions of these respective governments. The difference, however, between these historical events and illegitimate moral panics (apart from the lack of evidence for the latter) lies in the organizational capabilities of the persons carrying out the plan. A government* ***that sends an army*** *to break up families and place children in a boarding school with the expressed goal of separating them from their cultural background and heritage* ***is absolutely*** *a threat to the well-being and values of the target people; thus, those people are justified in expressing a moral panic.*

*4: Naturally, I am not advocating for government censorship or the denial of basic human rights. While I acknowledge that it* ***might*** *be possible to establish laws or policies that limit a person's participation in the public sector, such rules would clearly run afoul of America's First Amendment; and I generally consider the First Amendment to be an unequivocal Good Thing**^(TM)* *for a society. However, there are other ways to discourage harmful ideas and ideologies. I don't necessarily have all the answers on* ***how, precisely,*** *we should go about limiting the spread of these ideas; but I believe that, as a society, we should make a conscious effort to push back against these people, to reject their baseless accusations, to avoid associating with them, and to otherwise demonstrate through our individual actions that their beliefs (and any actions that arise from these beliefs) are not acceptable in a decent, good and just society.*"

It's a broader definition of revenge porn than even the law in the United Kingdom uses.

All over reddit there are examples of private, intimate media being shared without the subjects consent. There are entire subreddits like r/WifepicTrading set up specifically for this purpose.

Countless posts on there and many other NSFW subreddits make it clear that consent has not been gained for those images to be posted and yet, the posts are allowed to remain up and users are allowed to continue trading people's nudes like they're pokemon cards. 

It's deeply disturbing to me and I'd like to see reddit take action to deal with the issue, like other adult sites have had to do, Pornhub being the prime example. 

I understand it can be difficult to moderate content on large subreddits, but site wide a rule should be introduced to ban these sorts of subreddits and posts and the accounts engaging in that activity. 

I'll admit, it's going to be rather difficult to CMV on this one, because it is something I feel very strongly about, that being said I'm open to hearing criticism of it and I'm interested to see what the arguments against prohibiting this content are. My views on porn generally probably aren't the standard, so I'm willing to concede I might be taking too draconian a line on this, but let's see. 

What are your thoughts reddit?"

I think the football workd cup should have never been allowed to be hosted in Qatar and it would be morally good to boycott the event. This means not supporting it financially (no merchandise/ticket/paid streaming) but also not supporting it in terms of public attention. If I talk about it, comment about it or generate clicks for it, I help the event.
Now I don't really care to do this to let other peoplr knoe about it, I just want to hurt the organizations behind it as much as possible. Therefore if I simply do not spend any money it and tell people that ask that I am not following the world cup, I am doing the most to achieve my goals.
If I then watch the matches alone on online (EDIT: pirated!) streams and don't talk about it, it is not hypocritical because it makes no difference to the moral goodness of my actions. Yes, I am lying to people, but since I only really care about hurting the organizations, I am not being an asshole."

So this is when the animal industry becomes an unofficial mutually beneficial arrangement.

Flipping burgers, wiping floors, stacking shelves, these jobs will disappear while people take care of more specialized jobs.


But the exact opposite has been happening over the last two decades. We were led to believe that creative jobs and white collar jobs will be the safest from automation, but with advances in neural networks and deep learning it turned out that they are the first on the chopping block. 


Just a few years ago the idea of AI creating original art was a complete fantasy. It is now 2022, and AI is able to create  [award winning art](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html ) with a minimal input from the human. 
And this is not limited to AI generated painting. There are AIs that can write stories, create music, hell even create whole videos. Chances are that your kids are watching AI generated content on Youtube.


This goes completely against the idea that white collar jobs which require high levels of creativity and technical expertise are resistant to automation. Art, which was claimed to be the last bastion against automation, is the first to be automated.
And the exact same thing is happening in white collar office jobs, albeit much more quietly. Tons of low level office jobs are disappearing, offices are closing en masse. Why is that? Automation. Modern office workers have tools that allow one person to do the job of an entire department. Looking at the jobs which are projected to be automated in the coming years all you see is low level office jobs and specialized blue collar jobs.  


On the other hand retail, what most people see as the pinnacle of menial low paying dead end job, is doing just fine.  It is one of the most stable jobs sectors currently. Similarly, gig economy which is characterized by low wages and instability is exploding.  


Automation will cause a massive societal shift where the middle class disappears and is replaced by AI workers, while most of the society will be forced to work low paying menial jobs. The elites will grow ever richer thanks to their unchallengeble control over the AI"

Law-abiding citizens being able to protect themselves against killers, thieves, bullies, and perverts is a fundamental right. Unfortunately, too many elected officials don't seem to understand that.

Any lowlife who's willing to kill, maim, cripple, injure, or traumatize an innocent man, woman, or child just for a quick buck, sexual gratification, or purely out of spite doesn't deserve an ounce of sympathy or compassion. You reap what you sow. If what these bad folks reap is a lead sandwich when victimizing the wrong person, oh well.

That being said, individuals with a medical and family history of clinical depression who regularly think about suicide should strongly CONSIDER not bringing children of their own into the world, particularly if they are not adequately managing their mental illness.

Your children will suffer tremendously in the event that you do end up taking your own life. Your suffering may end, but your child’s will only be amplified after such traumatic experience.

An added bonus that may come as a byproduct of not having children under these circumstances is that there will be less undesirable alleles in our genetic pool directly linked to depression and suicidal tendencies — at least in theory. Things are obviously more complex than this when we consider the Social-Ecological Suicide Prevention Model, which accounts for general and population-specific risk and protective factors. Again, in theory, nature will favor alleles that protect rather than predispose us to clinical depression and suicide, and admittedly, this point will come across to some of you as a pro-eugenics argument. I distinguish myself from a eugenicist because as previously stated, I strongly support individual autonomy, while a true eugenicist believes in playing an active role in controlling our genetic pool, whether through policies or acts of genocide. Whether one procreates or not should not be decided by our government, our medical institutions, or a random redditor like myself. Nevertheless, I would love to hear what you all have to say on this matter given how relevant the discussion of mental health is today.

*Clarification: I should have made it more clear in my writing that my emphasis is on individuals with poorly managed clinical depression and recurring thoughts of suicide. This can be managed under the proper care and should not disqualify one from the beauty of becoming a parent. I know this to be true from personal experience. When our depression is properly managed — whether through antidepressants or therapy — it makes living and being a parent that much more beautiful and meaningful."

Where I’m at, we banned plastic bags to save the environment. However, I believe this change has done very little good, if not more bad. Plastic bags are one of the most reused [items](https://www.bagtheban.com/learn-the-facts/reusing/) as many people keep them and then reuse them for trash bag liners, cat litter bags, etc. People still need trash bag liners and poop bags so when the ban happens, people still will go and buy these plastic goods (I know there are compostable or recycled brands, but the majority of ppl will use the cheapest products). This changes the good from a multi use plastic to a single use plastic. Secondly, the purchasing of reusable grocery bags are now needed.  There are some studies which show that these create more waste and will need to be used hundreds of times to break even with plastic bags.  In my opinion, an average reusable bag probably doesn’t have hundreds of uses (as I can tell my Aldi bags are starting to get worn out after about 100 uses so far).

If we really want to make a positive change why not eliminate junk mail from being sent out? Or, at the very least, put very large taxes on it to dissuade companies from sending these out which just get thrown out immediately?  The additional funds could even go towards environmental restoration organizations.

In my opinion, people want to feel like they are helping and, by having an inconvenience, they feel more like they are doing good. If you eliminated all the wasteful junk mail, ppl wouldn’t feel any better about themselves. Also, I believe the usps gets about half their revenue from junk mail so I feel like it would be a bad “political” move to cut down on the mail usps receives. Even though the govt would be able to reduce their usps budget since it is only needed about half as much. Naturally, reducing the budget would also benefit the taxpayers."

7,2022-10-01,CMV: We should add a 13th month,u/JudgeSabo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xtd0bz/cmv_we_should_add_a_13th_month/,changemyview,"#The Problem With Months
Units of time are meant to be exact. We have very consistent measures for seconds, minutes, hours, days, and so on.

The one major exception to this is the month. Depending on the month, it is either 28, 29, 30, or 31 days long.

This leads to unnecessary confusion. If someone on January 31st says ""Let's meet up in a month,"" what day do they mean? February 28th? March 3rd? When?

#The Length of the Year

Part of the problem here is the length of the year. A solar year takes approximately 365.2422 days. To keep the calendar consistent then, the Gregorian calendar resynchronizes the year according to the position of the sun by adding in leap days every year divisible by four, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are divisible by 400.

This is the best we can make out of the situation. The length of a year is a useful unit of time because of seasonal changes. We should not get rid of it. For the same reason, we should not move toward lunar calendars or try and set the year around the Zodiac or something.

But if we are stuck with a year that is 365 days long, we cannot cleanly divide it into months. Or rather, we could only have 5 months that are 73 days long, or 73 months that are 5 days long.

Neither of those options seem particularly appealing.

#The 13 Month Year

I propose that, instead, we have 13 months that are 28 days long.

This closely matches the current length of the month, so would not require any radical shift.  And as 13 times 28 is 364, this closely approximates the year.

With one day remaining, we could simply tack that onto the end of the year. So there are 13 months, then New Year's Eve as its own special day, not part of any month. On leap years, we would have 13 months, Leap Day, then New Year's Eve.

This also makes each month exactly four weeks long.

Like a proper unit of time, it would be consistent, and easily broken down into our other units of time.

#Other Minor Changes

While we are fixing the calendar, I also propose a few other minor changes.

Firstly, the year should start on the winter solstice of the northern hemisphere, currently falling on December 21st or 22nd. The current start of the year makes no sense.

Secondly, we should rename all the months. The current month names have also been messed up. September, October, November, and December were originally the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th months of the year.

An octopus has 8 legs. An octagon has 8 sides. But October is the 10th month? Nonsense.

And while I'm fine naming months after gods and goddesses, like January being named after Janus, the god of beginnings and endings, we shouldn't have months named after emperors like Julius Caesar for July or Augustus Caesar for August.

We might fix months if we flipped January and February to the end, along with the 13th month, but at that point I'd just say we should scrap the whole thing. I am open to suggestion for what these names should be.

#Anticipated Objections

A problem with having 13 months is that 13 is a prime number, while 12 is easily divisible.

With 12 months, we can easily talk about the first quarter of the year, knowing we mean the first three months. This is especially used in finance, and could disrupt things majorly if we switched.

But we can do this with 13 months too. The quarters of the year would just be the seasons of winter, spring, summer, and autumn. If we start the year on the winter solstice, it is especially easy.

I have also seen someone propose that, in addition to making leap day and new year's eve not part of any month, they should also not be any day of the week. In other words, it would not be a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.

The argument here is that, since months are perfectly divisible by weeks, it would keep months consistent not only in terms of length of time, but what day they start on too. Every month would start on a Sunday or Monday, and end on a Saturday or Sunday.

While that is appealing, I don't think we should do that due to weekly religious observances. For example, practicing Jews would need to observe the Sabbath on different days of the week each year. It seems unreasonable to ask for that, or to ask them to change their religious customs to adapt to the new calendar and ignore New Year's Eve.

I suppose someone might object that 13 is an unlucky number on this ground, but I don't think that's quite the same, and not nearly as well established an observance. We haven't eliminated the 13th day of the month, for example, nor does anyone seem to be seriously demanding that we do so.

#Updates and Edits

Edit 1: Noted that the winter solstice applies to the northern hemisphere, not the southern. My bad for not specifying before.

Edit 2: I have to say, I'm kind of disappointed.

I had hoped that there might be some creative answers here, proposing other alternative ways to set up the calendar, or finding some new defense of the 12 month year I had not considered. Or maybe we keep the 12 month year and just match it to the Zodiac.

But it seems like almost every response here is ignoring the calendar itself, and instead seems to have spun some fantasy about Y2K, or about how courts would suddenly enforce contracts written with the old calendar system through the new system.

These are very silly objections. Programmers are perfectly capable of adding new calendars to systems. They are, actually, very easy to program. And Y2K wasn't an issue of us switching calendar systems, but of a potential error build into older programs. A potentiality we were largely able to address without incident. And that was when we had a deadline, which I have not proposed here.

Courts, documents, contracts, and so on could also easily be distinguished from whether they are using the new system or old system, especially if we give all the months new names.

I think these objections are really just masking a fear of change or a reflexive opposition to anything new. It's not really focused on defending the current calendar system or objecting to the one presented. So instead its just imagining the worst method of implementation possible, and then objecting to that.

I concede that smoothly transitioning to the new system would take some work, and there'd likely be a period where both calendars would be in popular use.

But if the world can switch over to metric, and people can still advocate for the US switching to metric, then I don't think there's any serious objection to moving to a 13 month calendar."

The only way that our country could pay back £72 billion is if the rich were paying taxes. As soon as he announced his plan, he ran off to a champagne lunch with all his financier mates and proclaimed the day as “freedom day”. 

The world economy has no idea how we are going to pay back the money since taxes have been cut so the £ has gone into free fall.  

This has real life consequences, Kwasi’s champagne lunches aside, my father-in-law’s pension has dropped by 20%. 

She’s appointed Jacob Rees-Mogg as business secretary who refers to the climate crisis as “climate alarmism”

She told our green-fingered King to not go to COP27 as he’s always been an environment activist. I think she’s gonna U-turn on net zero promises.

I’ve tried to see the alternative, I scrolled through sympathetic comments who said “wait and see” but there’s no time as pensions take a nosedive. 

The one sympathy I can find for Truss is that within two days of coming into office the Queen died. Maybe Truss missed some essential time to carve out her narrative and vision due to the constant royal coverage. That narrative could have been essential to put economists at ease.

2,2022-10-02,CMV: The British Labour Party should promise Indyref2,u/one_of_orlandos_hos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xtle9v/cmv_the_british_labour_party_should_promise/,changemyview,"I believe the UK Labour Party should run on allowing a second Scottish referendum in their first term if they win a majority, and on leading the Remain campaign.  By ""should"" I mean purely for their own electoral advantage.  Let's leave the debate on whether it's good for the country, etc, for another time (unless you feel that plays in to electoral advantage).

Labour are currently between 20 and 30 points up in the polls, but the betting markets still have them probably not forming a majority.  A lot of that is to do with the fact that those markets don't believe the lead will persist until the election, but even with a big lead, it's hard for them to form a majority without a *massive* lopsided win in England and Wales, or taking significant seats from the SNP.  Even with a big poll lead over the Tories, they're probably not going to get a big enough majority to implement everything they want to, if they get a majority at all, so that leaves eating away at the SNP.

The best way to do this would be to tell the Scottish nationalists this:  Vote SNP in the Westminster elections, you get 50 SNP MPs at Westminster, some great moments out of Ian Blackford at the PMQs, and another 5 years of Tory rule with absolutely no chance of another referendum.  Vote for us, and you get a progressive government in Westminster, and we'll give the Scottish government the power to call another referendum, and then may the best campaign win.

I believe this strategy would lose virtually no voters in England (the English don't care) lose virtually no votes in Scotland (where's the unionist left going to go?), and win a lot seats from the SNP, if handled properly.

That led me to believe there might be something to this. Then I read this article:

https://nypost.com/2022/09/30/uc-berkeley-blasted-for-creating-jewish-free-zones-with-pro-israel-speaker-ban/?utm_source=reddit.com

I know, I know, NY Post is a right wing alarmist rag so anything they say is usually either blown out of proportion or flat out incorrect as is the case here. The same goes for any “news” with an extremist political lean so please don't deflect to CNN. 

However, when I read this particular article three things became readily apparent.

1. There are no university enforced zones where Jewish people cannot go.
2. Jewish people are not specifically being banned from speaking. Only people with Zionist viewpoints are being banned. 
3. The banning of Zionist viewpoints is within student groups, not by the university itself.

Therefore not only are there no “Jewish-free zones” it's not even UC Berkeley banning any particular viewpoints from campus. 

I think there are many ways one could change my view on this. You could successfully refute any one of my three points. You could find some error in my logic or show me that they actually mean something else. You could do something completely different, I don't know, I'm generally open to ideas. 

One final note. This post is not about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. I understand there are nuanced views on the topic even if I'm not personally in favor of Zionism. I will pretty much always defer to Israeli and Palestinian people themselves as they are obviously closer to the conflict."
0,2022-10-02,CMV: The happiness of society would improve if we lifted the cone of shame from most taboo subjects and activities,u/OutdoorzExplorerz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xtti63/cmv_the_happiness_of_society_would_improve_if_we/,changemyview,"(If you aren’t interested in my long-winded explanation as to how I came to this position, stop reading now. You can respond without hearing my life story, lol. Also, I am referring to LEGAL things that people shame others for, not illegal things.) 

I come to this conversation having grown up in a very religious household. Sex wasn’t discussed. The body was covered at all times. We’d spend many hours in church (and church related activities) each week. My parents were pretty cool, but there was definitely a divide between what was worldly and what was Godly. There was pressure to be kind, happy, respectful and “religious” toward the outside world. 

Im a generally content adult, yet I often reflect on things that cause me a degree of stress, anxiety, insecurity or unhappiness. More and more, I realize they are often things that were repressed or shamed during my formative years…

1. Body Image: I am definitely one of those people who grew up with an image of the ideal body. It made me insecure in my myself, and often judgmental of others. 

2. Sexual Thoughts: We didn’t talk about sex. My current thoughts on the subject are probably no different than most people…yet I still get that guilty church feeling from time to time…like I’m some outlier because I enjoy sex and think about it as often as anyone would think about something they enjoy. 

3. Money: We never discussed money growing up. We discussed how to earn it….but not how to budget, save, etc. To this day,  I’ve heard very few people admit they have money issues. I’m that guy currently, and it feels very shameful. 

4. Relationships: I’m lucky that my parents got along well. I just think it would have been cool to get some more insight into the highs and lows of navigating a relationship. The same goes for parenting. 

One thing I’ve noticed through the years is that it is very cathartic when you find someone you can bare your soul to. It feels cleansing. It makes me wish I had more of those people…or that society overall can drop its taboos so everyone can be that friend to someone. 

For the past three years, we have spent a chunk of our summers at a clothing optional resort. The place we go to is crazier than most clothing optional places. There are a lot of swingers there. Hard partying naked people, lol. We are not swingers, and we are quite “vanilla” by their standards, but we enjoy hanging with them. I think I appreciate them most because - more than anyone I’ve ever known - they have let down their guard. They don’t judge. Yet they seem happier than your average person. I feel like I’ve stumbled upon the fountain of youth whenever I go there. And my wife, who has a lot of trauma in her background, becomes the best version of herself. 

Spending time at a place with few taboos, those taboo subjects that occupied chunks of my mind started to dissipate. For example, after a day at the resort, my body image improved considerably. I was more accepting of myself and others. And when you are with people who talk about sex as casually as others might discuss basketball, the topic suddenly has less power/control over your mind. My mind chatter is actually less focused on titillating thoughts while at this resort than it would be at “normal” resort. 

I’m open to a mind change. The story above is my own experience, and I completely understand that my personal experience cannot be generalized to the world population."

I think that if there will be a significant interest on job market for AI art creators, there will be a lot of people that would want to make it their hustle. To understand how to generate good art you surely need to spend some time training but I feel like it's relatively easy to achieve that kind of level. It's very rewarding to learn for a lot of users and the time you need to spend on it is not huge. Considering this it is very attractive as a job perspective.
If there would be a lot of people trying to get job like this, employers would have plenty of choice, possibly resulting in low salaries. There is also not much of a perspective for future advancement like promotions, at least looking at it right now.
Also I see communities of people that say about finding your own style in art generation and mastering it, but employers would would usually not give a shit about your specific style, they would tell you to generate whatever they need, not really trying to compromise on style. 

This whole topic is a lot of speculation obviously, so there are no right or wrong answers, just different opinions so I'm curious to read what you think about it."

Here's how it would work, let's start both already use the new shekel, so that would be a huge boost to the concept already, another too would be one military, say Palestine and Isreals security forces merge into one, so a Isreal-Palestine Confederacy, would have 1. CURRENCY 1. MILLITARY, along with free travel between each other, along with 1 legislature, for the Confederacy, and there would be one Constitution, but 2 members of the Confederacy would make independent decisions as long as they don't violate the Constitution of the state 


Why do I want this, I would benefit the people of Palestine and isreal, by boosting their economies, on top of that it would decrease conflict by enabling the authorities to better respond to threats in the region such as radical militias, and this can also lead to Jerusalem reuniting meaning Holy sites, won't need to be guarded and everyone can just pray, without a guard, now if you still favor 2 state tell me why and we can talk in the comments"

To me this says more about the critic than the media. While there are without a doubt bad fanfictions out there, I'd argue that their frequency is not greater than in ""professional"" works as well.  How many shitty TV shows and movies can we name off the top of our heads? I can think of  a fair few that had millions poured into them, getting award winning writers and directors onboard, only to make a disaster.

  
Just because something has the original authors or studios seal of approval, it does not guarantee quality. ""The cursed child"" is a great example, while it wasn't written by Rowling, it was endorsed and canonised by her. Game of Thrones season 8 is ignored by some fans, opting for fan endings that are far better in terms of quality. In a case like that it's not a matter of taste, rather getting an ending that makes any sense.  A similar thing happened with the Attack on titan manga, people drawing and writing their own fan endings that improve on the original.  


The majority of people who write fanfiction do so because they have an honest idea they want to explore, a scenario that others might not have considered. On the flipside the majority of ""professional"" projects are little more than corporate cash grabs. There is the odd auteur driver project, but that's the exception. Putting the two in the same bucket shows makes no sense."

The following portion is what I am against:

\*\*\*Teachers in public schools are required to ""indigenize/decolonize"" their lessons. For example, teachers in training must officially declare exactly how they will implement indigenous perspectives on their lesson plans. \*\*\*

My current view is that this is a form of ""atonement"" for the horrific crimes and atrocities committed against Indigenous people in the last century, and especially in regards to Residential schools. The reason I believe that this educational policy is wrong is because I don't believe that teachers nor students should bear the brunt of wrongs committed by their ancestors and that without evidence that indigenous perspectives as a whole are beneficial to the success/happiness of students, that it is unethical to force teachers/students to adhere to them.

I'd like to clarify that I absolutely recognize the atrocities committed against indigenous people and also recognize that they face ongoing difficulties today both due to generational trauma as well as ongoing conflicts, political pressures, and other external factors. I am also very much in support of students learning about these atrocities just as we would teach about the holocaust and other historical or present wrongs.

But just as I wouldn't expect Germans to force teachers to take on a Jewish perspective in atonement for the Holocaust, I don't think it's right for Canadian teachers to be forced to take on Indigenous perspectives for the Residential Schools and other atrocities.

EDIT: As a clarification, I'm in in support of indigenous perspectives being taught in the sense that we should know how they see the world and learn about their values. I am not in support of teachers being forced to exemplify their values and teach in accordance with their values."

When you eat soup from a bowl, there's always some of it you can't reach and what most people do is lift said bowl and drink the rest. The thing is, that is considered bad etiquette, and looks quite bad from a 3rd person view not to mention sometimes troublesome for the person doing it when there is a much simpler solution. So this is what I propose:

Drink soup from a glass

A simple glass, like a water glass. There are so many advantages:

- There's less stuff to clean up and put away afterwards;
You only need the one glass- no need for bowl, spoon or plate;

- Instead of eating from the bowl with the spoon and then at the end drinking the rest, you drink it from the start! No need to go on switching tactics;

- It's much faster. I mean think about it- the time it takes for you to eat soup with a spoon from a bowl vs the time it takes for you to drink a glass of water- you'd be saving so much time and energy!

(Of course this only applies to soup without solid elements)

I've been doing this for as long as I can remember and I was completely gobsmacked when I couldn't find anyone else who did it, so here I am spreading the word/ tradition. 

This is the Way."

By this I don't mean gaslighting or manipulating, or situations where I have specific knowledge of falsehood (and even then it doesn't mean that I should treat someone badly as a result, and I can still pity or feel bad for them). I mean that whether or not someone actively needs or is asking for empathy from a genuine place that we shouldn't withold it.

If someone's relative dies and they are upset we should console them.

If someone claims their relative has died in order to receive empathy, there are a few reasons they may do this. I think they are likely projecting, or need affection and can't communicate that. I think that someone unhealthy may manifest this kind of behaviour and that they do genuinely need help but aren't able to get it through healthy means. 

Help should still be what they receive though.

Even criminals, or morally corrupt people are human, and should be treated like humans.

As an individual I can choose how to approach people in the world. If someone needs help, whether that's in good faith or bad, I can't change that, I can only choose to be a person who helps. If someone takes advantage of that then that's on them, not on me. Better to help a few people who don't need it while helping more who do, than to help no one and let those who really need it suffer further because of those who don't.

I'm looking to have this view changed, or expanded on because of a conversation I had on this sub, the person was very adamant that walls can and should be put up against someone acting in good faith. I don't reasonably see how the average person could really know that sort of thing outside of assumption and prejudice. I'm not going to do background research on everyone before I decide to bestow empathetic feelings, they are my natural response. I don't think empathy is a choice in that regard, and that choosing to repress it because of arbitrary walls makes for a more distrustful, less productive person in society, which relies on trust and cooperation, and empathy is a huge part of that."

But in my opinion a justified conflict doesn't require a draft. Many people want to fight evil, and your fighting force should be those individuals, not those that don't want to. 

I think it could be morally justified to conscript into non combat roles in a defensive war. it would still require some caveats. 

I have a son and I gotta be honest, if someone attacked Canada I would leave the country before I allow my son to be fatherless. People can call me a coward but I am not the property of my state and I have the right to self determination just like every human being does.

Edit: good convo. Made a couple concessions. Still believe dodging is completely justified no matter the war."

As such, it is clear that this issue should be prioritized by those who study and detect ADHD, rather than just reiterating the existence of this problem. Furthermore, we also push updated standards in educator evaluations of signs, specifically in reference to the silent presentation of inattentive ADHD.

&gt;ADHD is way over-diagnosed in young white males, and imo this has caused the common ideology that ADHD is over-diagnosed, when in reality, it is underdiagnosed in pretty much every other group, and this is a big problem.

If teachers are trained in how to identify hyperactive ADHD in boys, they can be trained to identify inattentive ADHD in girls. I am not looking for perfection, for everyone with a disability to get a diagnosis regardless of the cost to society. I want a more equal playing field, which can only be achieved by some resources being invested in this problem. CMV

# Background

***Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Overview***

ADHD, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is a type of neurodivergence characterized by a diverse collection of specific traits which are different from what is considered neurotypical (Bolte et. al 2021). The observability of these traits differs from person to person, and some of the most informative characteristics are internal to the individual, invisible to others. This being said, limited novel data on these informative characteristics exists and provides a direction for further analysis (Sedgwick et. al 2019).

Concrete data on ADHDer strengths is limited due to an inclination for researching neurodivergence through a deficit model, but our current incomplete scientific understanding—as well as vast anecdotal experiences of ADHD—are able to illustrate a general set of strengths associated with ADHDers (Sedgwick et. al 2019). Higher levels of empathy, creativity, agreeableness, and willingness to help others have been found in ADHDers compared to the neurotypical population. Most notably, there is “hyper-focus”, an extreme form of sustained attention to a certain task or topic that results in intense concentration, completlete absorption, and powerful feelings of enjoyment from accomplishing sub-goals (Sedgwick et. al 2019).

On a neurochemical level, ADHDers tend to have a deficiency in dopamine, and this deviance from typical neurochemistry levels is widely believed to be significant enough to warrant describing ADHD as a dopamine deficiency disorder (Sergeant et. al 2003).  As such, most ADHDer weaknesses are believed to be directly influenced by this chemical imbalance. Common traits such as executive dysfunction, making careless mistakes, inability to follow through on goals, impulsivity, and difficulty mentally prioritizing tasks (leading to procrastination) can all be understood through this lens. Dopamine and analogs are found in all vertebrates; it is a conserved chemical driver of action towards any goal. With lower levels of dopamine come lower levels of chemical motivation, thus inhibiting ADHDers from spending time or mental energy on personally undesirable tasks at times.

&amp;#x200B;

***ADHD Pathologized: The Medical Model***

The *Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* is the primary authority for psychiatric diagnoses in the United States. It defines what set of symptoms a psychiatrist needs to identify in their patients to give any diagnosis. This then allows the patient to seek treatment for their illness, and possibly have accommodations from their workplace or schooling while recovering.

The *DSM(V)* considers ADHD a disorder with 3 presentations, each with a specific set of symptoms to qualify for diagnosis. Inattentive ADHD symptoms include carelessness and lack of attention to detail, forgetfulness, and difficulty sustaining attention on undesirable tasks, among others. Hyperactive ADHD presents with more impulsivity, restlessness, and other externalized symptoms. And finally, the diagnosis of combination ADHD is given when the diagnostic criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive ADHD is met. Men also tend to be diagnosed with hyperactive ADHD when compared to women, who tend to be diagnosed as inattentive (Huang et al. 2016).

Because diagnostic criteria is based on symptomatology, this means only recognized, detrimental traits are able to be by-the-book qualifiers. ADHDer strengths and neutral characteristics are irrelevant to and undescribed by the *DSM(V)*. This distinction, although seemingly trivial, undermines ADHDer’s access to medical treatments and work or school place accomodations for their disability. For ADHDers who appear to have an appropriate level of function, there is little chance for a doctor-initiated discussion for testing because the difficulty or ease at which ADHDers move through life is not considered until their symptoms become debilitating to their life functions.

If not identified through early screenings, ADHDers are unlikely to seek treatment until adulthood with “persistent suffering” (Gershon 2002). Therefore, the importance placed *symptoms* of ADHD rather than *traits* of ADHD has another repercussion: undiagnosed ADHDer children have no access to medical treatment, academic accommodations for their disability, and a connection to their neurodivergent identity in a neurotypical-dominated world.

&amp;#x200B;

# Findings

***ADHD Diagnostic Criteria: Written for White Men***

When beginning to scientifically understand ADHD, research was conducted to create an assessment for its presence. The DSM has altered and updated these symptoms throughout its many editions, but the findings from this initial research still serves as the backbone for diagnostic criteria.

A simple glance at this project shows an appalling flaw—the sample was almost entirely composed of men (Nadeau &amp; Quinn et al. 2002). The results were then extrapolated to women to produce a universal diagnosis. Considering the female-male skews in inattentive-hyperactive subtype prevalence, it becomes clear that there is a deep systemic bias in the foundation of *DSM(V)*’s understanding of ADHD.

ADHD data based on males should primarily describe the hyperactive presentation, meaning that, even within males, the presentation of ADHD typically found in women, was underrepresented. This opens the possibility for limited male inattentive data points to be functionally lost in analysis among majority hyperactive datapoints.

Another critique of the *DSM(V)*’s validity comes in the form of its own application. Current literature on comparative ADHD subtype prevalence is blaringly inconsistent. Notably, even within the same hospital and research group, estimates for relative subtype frequencies conflict each other. In 2005, the organization approximated relative inattentive prevalence to be 45%, combined prevalence to be 34%, and hyperactive to be 21%; but in 2015, they reported 29%, 64%, and 7%, respectively (LeRoy et al. 2018). There is nothing to suggest the true comparative prevalence of ADHD subtypes changed to this degree within 10 years, making the more likely explanation simply being a difference in doctor’s diagnosis and further calling into question the validity and accuracy of diagnosis. Intercountry comparisons also show discrepancies between ADHD’s relative subtype proportions. One study focusing on ADHDers in Italy, New Zealand, and the United States found these conflicts in spite of a nearly race-controlled analysis (London &amp; Landes 2019).

Finally, there is compelling evidence that ADHD in East Asians is neurochemically different from ADHD in caucasians. The association between dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and ADHD remains one of the few points of consensus within western ADHD research. In humans and other mammals, the DRD4 receptor has been widely studied and certain polymorphisms have been linked to impulsivity and other risk-taking behaviors comparable to hyperactive ADHD diagnostic criteria. However, this genetic association was not found in a study of Taiwanese people with ADHD (Brooks et al. 2005). This adds more doubt to the *DSM(V)’s* universality given the historical and residual emphasis on hyperactive presentation in males. More damning, out of 216 patients, none in this study were diagnosed with the hyperactive subtype despite the especially male-heavy sample compared to Western studies.

&amp;#x200B;

***Teachers as Sentry for ADHD: Trained for White Boys***

Teacher and primary school staff referrals for ADHD testing contribute to the vast majority of childhood diagnosis. Grade School teachers are trained in detecting behavioral signs through the guidelines of the *DSM(V)*, and thus are informed by male-cenetered, hyperactive-majority diagnostic criteria. A meta-analysis on ADHDer gender and perception-of-teacher found that grade school teachers rated their ADHDer females as less impaired than ADHD males on hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity (Gershon 2002). While the female-heavy skew for inattentive subtype can explain teachers lower rating of ADHDer girls’ hyperactivity and impulsivity, it also has alarming implications for their lower rated inattentive symptoms—teachers are not able to reliably identify prognostic characteristics in ADHDer girls.

Beyond the guidelines of the *DSM(V)*, another interlaced problem emerges: Women are more likely to experience interalized symptoms than men, and because of hyperactivity’s nature to produce apparent, undesirable behavior, even with appropriate training, teachers are more likely to miss ADHD symptoms in girls (Gershon 2002). A study finding teachers’ success rate of 14% for identifying inattentive girls gives credence to this notion. In fact, the same study found that girls with ADHD are often misrecognized as having behavior or emotion problems by teachers, have lower rates of clinical referral, and only 15% of teachers felt medication might be helpful for girls meeting diagnostic criteria (Groenewald et al., 2009).

The concern for this gender disparity becomes more apparent when considering that ADHD girls have been documented to have greater intellectual impairments than ADHD boys, as well as more internalizing problems, suggesting a greater risk for comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety (Gershon 2002). Overtime, the oversight of ADHDer girls can result in internalized feelings of low self-worth from being unable to function like their neurotypical peers. Suicidal ideation (SI) is significantly more common in ADHDer women compared to neurotypical women, a trend absent from male data; additionally, SI was their dominant “problem with self concept”, whereas males tended to struggle the most with impulsivity (Kakyuszi et. al 2018).

Racial disparities in teachers’ ability to identify ADHDer children is likely even more pervasive than gender differences, but insight into this missing data is very limited. This being said, the meager amount of hard evidence for this problem is enough to warrant immediate further investigation. In a California hospital wide study, it was found that only .6% of all Asian or Pacific Islander (API) girls were diagnosed with ADHD in 2010 (Getahun et al. 2013). Given estimates of true ADHD prevalence typically being from 3-6%, this study has two possible implications: either, by chance, this hospital treats far fewer API girls with ADHD; or 2.4-5.4% of all API girls being seen at that hospital are ADHDers lacking an appropriate diagnosis.

This paper wants to focus particularly on this group, API girls (and to a lesser extent, API boys) because of the unique intersectionality that comes with being an API and neurodivergent in the United States. The socially awkward, in-their-head, high-achieving, weird-talking ADHERer sitting in front of a teacher aligns almost exactly with their internalized view of Asian Americans—Occasional social faux-pas are due to cultural differences, and not because of neurotype differences between peers; quietness in class is seen as expertly trained politeness and obedience, not as an indication that the student may not be processing their lesson; high achievements can be attributed to discipline and good work ethic, rather than to hyper-focus coupled with rejection sensitive dysphoria; the stumbling-over words, “hard to follow” style of speech, along with frequent misspellings or grammatical errors, are because of the child’s mother tongue being an Asiatic language, not because of executive dysfunction manifesting in misorganized spoken ideas or forgetfulness or carelessness.

&amp;#x200B;

***Scientific and Medical Communities: Reinforcing White Male Bias***

A meta-analysis of research on gender-based diagnostic discrepancies shows the scientific community reinforces these inequalities. It found that, in any given work of literature, the gender of the first author significantly moderates parental teacher ratings for a child’s hyperactivity, as well as parental ratings of their externalizing problem; female first authors were associated with teachers’ lower ratings for hyperactivity in ADHD females than males (Gershon et al. 2002). This provides evidence the scientific community surrounding ADHD gender discrepancies is, itself, introducing additional bias in the form of interview or information.

As for the medical community, their lack of drive to balance diagnostic inequalities can only be described as negligence to the highest degree. Almost three decades of data suggest there being a mass underdiagnosis problem for women and some men of color, but there has been no meaningful change (Chung et al. 2019). Besides the \*DSM(V)’\*s spotlight on white male presentation, medical professionals continue to act according to rules which were fundamentally constructed with only one subpopulation in mind. By doing this, they reinforce white male representation in ADHD, which then cycles back to a greater understanding and ability to recognize white male ADHD.

# Conclusion

At the dawn of American understanding of ADHD, already-existing inequalities in socioeconomic status allowed datasets to nearly solely consist of white American men with hyperactive ADHD. Over time, the ramifications of these biases spread to negatively impact all ADHDers not represented in the original study. Diagnostic criteria, system for early childhood screening by teachers, and response from the medical and scientific communities is preferential to identifying, treating, and improving life outcomes of ADHDer white males at the cost of everyone else.

Although data for these systematic disparities is not concrete, the risk of not investigating their validity and determining action steps is too great to ignore. Attaining diagnosis remains one of the only ways ADHDers can secure medical treatment and accommodations for their disability, yet, already vulnerable populations tend to have more undiagnosed ADHDers. As such, it is clear that this issue should be prioritized by those who study ADHD rather than just reiterating the existence of this problem. Furthermore, we also push updated standards in educator evaluations of signs, specifically in reference to the silent presentation of inattentive ADHD. It may be harder to identify these individuals compared to boisterous hyperactive boys, but the intricacies of inattentive presentation cannot be used as an excuse for a mass failure to detect ADHD girls.

I am in no way against women's rights but I feel that the current feminist climate is about exacting revenge for things done in the past, like some sort of 'men had their time, now it's ours'.

I recently read an article about how office air conditioners are sexist towards women. This attitude makes me think how they are in contrast to facts like a female child is literally killed in my country for just having XX chromosome(female infanticide).

I also read about the overturning of Roe v Wade and the storm it caused. After just a little bit of research I found that the supreme court didn't ban abortions, they just left it to the states. I was just bewildered to see feminists including reps.(eg. AOC) leaving all of their productive time and protesting in front of the white house and the SCOTUS. If they really wanted to do something why not actually leave their abortion allowing states(eg. New York, DC) and actually go to those who banned it(eg. Mississippi, Texas).

And I don't understand why this was such a big deal in the first place. If they had say ridden the US of sanitary products, then this storm was understandable. But abortion is a thing whose need in exception to rape and sexual assault cases ceases to exist. There exist condoms for protected sex, women can actually say no as consent in the western world has the level of importance I dream my country of having. It's not like the middle east where a man can just barge in demanding sex and a woman has to have 'unprotected' sex which can culminate into an unwanted pregnancy.

Instead of trying to be a little more conscious about who and how you have sex with, feminists just blamed everything on 'cis' 'white' men which (even though I'm not white) seems unfair.

Feminists in the US often show that they live in a dystopian society where their every move is resisted by a 'patriarchy' while often forgetting they have such basic human rights women in other countries can't even dream of.

Please help me understand if I'm justified in having such views or if not how and why I should rethink them."

Free or discounted rent for a cushioned apartment or house, with heating, electricity, and water. Not having to deal with the stresses of making rent or paying the electricity. Being able to get whatever you need fixed on behalf of the government. Sounds great! But what is the government getting out of what is essentially providing free or heavily subsidized housing? Personally, I don't see how they're getting anything of value in return. 

Consider the costs that goes behind building these houses and apartment styled buildings. The HVAC / plumbing / electrical / brick and tile laying work that needs to be done. The planning and engineering behind it. The safety procedures. The maintenance. That's a hefty bill on the government's dime for a bunch of people that are probably not qualified for anything above unskilled minimum wage labor. You're going to tell me a bunch of burger flippers are worth a cushioned apartment or house that has all the comforts you can dream of? I fail to see how. It's a horrible net loss for the government as it's not like they're providing this pricey housing for professionals that bring value to our economy, but a bunch of entitled minimum wage workers who wont lift a finger after  20 hours of work a week. There are kids in certain parts of Africa carrying buckets of water on their head day in and day out, doing hard labor all day, but what do they have to show for it? Where's their cushy apartments and houses with fridges and stoves? This system just makes so many lazy minimum wage earners unjustifiably entitled. You shouldn't be able to live like royalty when all you do is mop floors. 

Also I don't care how politically correct you want to be, but there are many abusers ot this system. There are many ways where you can sustain your eligibility by making more offspring when convenient, meaning you have entire generations of families who never lifted a damn finger in forever. This system has made a fraction of social housing recepients complacent, entitled and lazy. And I know for a fact the government is smart enough to KNOW how many are abusing the system and who they are. So the original intent of having these ""workers"" actually provide SOME value to society by mopping floors or flipping burgers is never even fully realized. The government is spending thousands on a bunch of human sized rodents who leech off the system and are objectively worthless and would have died from natural selection years ago if it wasn't for the public housing paradise that we working citizens contribute to sheltering them from that reality. 

It shouldn't be the governments job to shelter unskilled people from the brutal realities of life; if you don't provide much value, you won't get much value in return. Capitalism is a reflection of nature. That includes housing if it's out of your budget, even if the cheapest apartments are out of your reach. That's just something you have to deal with. Either provide more value and earn housing or fend for yourself. The government would be vastly more wealthy if they stopped providing such luxuries for those who can't pay for it any other way.  

I personally have friends in social housing situations and some were brave enough to admit that they get a lot of freebies for not much effort from their part. Some went to school and became valuable citizens of society. Others just ended up leeching and gaming in their room all day after high school. 

Either go to school or learn a skill or suffer the consequences of not providing enough value."

0,2022-10-03,CMV: peacefully protesting near abortion clinics is not wrong and can provide a net positive,u/stocktismo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xungnm/cmv_peacefully_protesting_near_abortion_clinics/,changemyview,"I used to be Christian and we used to do peaceful protests across the street from abortion clinics. No yelling no harsement and no graphic signs and guilt tripping imagery. We pray together and talked to anyone that approached.

We also had information on local resources to help new and expectant mother that were struggling financially. You would be surprised how often people approached and how often people changed their minds after having their early appointment at the clinic. One that stands out in particular was a woman who left the clinic very distraught and came over to talk. She cried happy tears and told us she thought she had no other choice. We were in contact for a while and her and her child are living a happy life. The mother was obviously Happy because she wanted to keep the child.

 There is a statistically relevant number of women that regret their abortions. If those women knew about all the resources available to them during the pregnancy and after the birth they may have not gone through with an abortion.  If there were people giving this support and information at every clinic all the time i think it would be a huge net positive."

I'm here to say, it's not feasibly possible for YouTube to fix their platform. 

There are millions of YEARS worth of continuous video on YouTube. 500 hours of content are uploaded every minute. People are being absolutely delusional if they assume humans are manually dealing with any of that data on the backend in any but the most extreme circumstances. 

Realistically, 99.9999...% of the process is automated. And there are no other solutions unless you want to hook the entire population of Norway up to Clockwork Orange rigs for a few years. 

Does the system give false positives and remove innocent videos? Yes. But it's hard to argue for innocent until proven guilty when bad actors try to teach toddlers to kill themselves
 https://abcnews.go.com/US/youtube-kids-video-featuring-suicide-instructions-removed-reports/story?id=61326717

Does the algorithm bias against certain demographics? Almost certainly. But that's not a secret racist cabal of YouTube Execs deciding that. It's machine learning. If the algorithm learns to be racist, it's because the viewers were consciously or unconsciously biased towards those results.

So why doesn't YouTube just ""fix"" the algorithm and the bots? Well, interestingly, it's because machine learning has outpaced human understanding. There is no nerd squad that can just open up the hood and turn off the racism line of code. Modern bots are made using the Monkeys with Typewiters method.

Yes, YouTube has a lot of problems, but those problems are largely societal. And honestly, until Skynet comes out, I think it would be easier to fix society than try to reign in an ocean of data by yelling at it."

Not fine-dining, nor Applebees, but somewhere in the middle. During the summer months, servers with whom I work easily make around $40 an hour. Of course, this is basically 100% tips, plus the $6.15 hourly wage. They’re (some, not all) clearing $80,000 annually. 

If we abandon tipping, what’s the correct starting wage for a server? Is it your states minimum wage? Is it similar to that of a Host? I honestly don’t know, but restaurants have a low profit margin, usually between [3-4%](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/average-restaurant-profit-margin), I can’t imagine many of them would survive if they suddenly had to pay at least minimum wage to servers. Increasing food prices is a huge gamble, as eating out for a steak that used to be $25 is now $33, people may head to the supermarket instead. 


In regards to the burden on servers, many people choose it as a career, rather than just another job, because it pays so well. Many of the servers I work with were able to buy homes because their jobs pay so well - what happens if they take a 60% pay-cut?  

Lastly, the overall restaurant experience would decrease, as servers wouldn’t go above and beyond to fulfill your needs as the incentive to do so no longer exists. 

Tipping is just a part of the luxury of eating out."

251,2022-10-04,CMV: There's nothing wrong with edgy/offensive jokes (dark humor) in private,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xv7tiw/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_edgyoffensive_jokes/,changemyview," 

Edgy jokes, or dark humor, is a touchy subject, I know. A lot of people take issue with this type of dark humor. To them, a rape joke is sexist and ""normalizes"" rape, or a racist joke is racist and ""normalizes"" racism. I disagree because of the very nature of dark humor.

To me, making a racially charged joke (again, we're talking about privately here) is no different than making a dark joke about something like a school shooting. It's not because you *support* school shootings or think they're good or funny, it's entirely *because* it's messed up.

Think about some comedic tv show characters, like Joey from FRIENDS. Joey is a womanizer, in this regard, he's a pretty bad person. But we laugh at that part of him *because* it's bad and we all know it. Or Archie from ""All in the Family"" who is extremely racist, we laugh at him *because* racism is wrong.

Or look at some comedic skits. Dave Chappelle's skits like the ""Black White Supremacist"" are hilarious, even though they are racially charged throughout. They're not funny because ""hur hur, racism,"" though, they're funny because they are essentially mocking how screwed up racism is.

In this regard, edgy humor like this is essentially satirical. The joke *is* that it's wrong, it's messed up. The joke isn't that sexism, racism, etc, is actually funny, it's making fun of those very concepts.

Now, I need to throw an asterisk on here because there's obviously some exceptions.

First of all, some people make edgy jokes because they really do think those things are funny. I'm sure there's some out there who, under the guise of dark humor, really do think racism is funny, for instance.

Second, you should never makes these kinds of jokes publicly or with people you don't know well. Different people have different sensibilities and you should definitely take this into consideration; it's not funny if someone is actually hurt by it.

And, finally, I think you should be 100% certain that all parties involved *know* it's a joke, because, otherwise, it could serve as a means of normalizing these things. I can only speak for myself here, and, generally, I only make these kinds of jokes around ***very*** close family, because they know me very well and know I am strongly against all the things I listed above, and they also know that this is my way of ""laughing at evil"" (i.e., mocking evil). I also know them and know that they, too, are strongly against these things so I know it has no overarching effects of normalizing. Everyone involved knows these things, knows nothing is meant by it, knows the other person is *firmly* against these things, and knows the other person is using it as a means of satirizing or mocking evil, which, in essence, makes it *anti*\-\[insert subject matter of joke\].

If these conditions are met, I don't see the issue in using edgy/dark humor. Words, even offensive ones, only have the weight of *offense* because we have assigned certain definitions to those words. Those definitions change depending on context. If I walk up to my brother, slap him on the back, and say ""good morning you son of a bitch,"" my brother will laugh and know it's a joke. If I do this to my boss, I'll probably be at the unemployment office by midday. Similarly, if I say an edgy joke to my brother, he wont take offense at it because he knows me and knows where I stand on issues and knows what I mean by it, whereas if I were to say one of these to say, well, one of you guys, you don't know me or anything about me and would take offense at it. In order for a word or joke to be harmful, it has to, well, cause harm. 

Given all of this, if under the right circumstances, I don't think it's morally wrong to say edgy/offensive jokes in private: CMV!"
0,2022-10-04,cmv: spectators running onto field should be treated better,u/SagittariusABCDEFG,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xv8z1a/cmv_spectators_running_onto_field_should_be/,changemyview,"During the recent Monday Night Football, a spectator was leveled by pro athlete Bobby Wagner. The spectator was running around with a pink smoke stick.

One of these days a spectator on field is going to be seriously injured (if it hast already happened).

I argue that the reaction to the crime does not fit, and there needs to be a better way to react to spectators on field. In fact, it is bizarre that security, team staff, or an athlete can violently apprehend such a tresspasser, and nobody seems to question it. In fact, it's
expected and cheered for.

Counterargument A: but we don't know what the trespasser will do. They could intend to kill.

Rebuttal: Is there precedent for a fan running into the field with intent to cause hamr? Why is this the default assumption? That's like someone running into my store naked, and I decided to pile drive the person head first into the gorund because my default assumption is they want to kill me.

Counterargument B: you would do the same to a trespasser in your home or business

Rebuttal: If I did, I might be sued, depending on the given law. Given that trespassing is a highly variable act, most laws require a reasonable reaction to specific circumstance. You can't violently body slam someone only because they stepped into your store after you said they could not. Trespassing itsef isn't a green light for absolute carnage on the trespasser.

Counterargument C: all it takes is one bad egg to do some damage. think of all the mass shootings in the USA

Rebuttal: Fair point. See solution below.

Solution: be proactive, not reactive. If you truly feared a tresspasser this much, then redesign your physical boundaries. This is a reasonable thing to ask of NFL owners, for instance. If a fan still makes it onto the field, assess the situation and get everyone off the field and/or away from the person. Decide what degree of physical restraint is needed, if needed at all (just let the person run to exhaustion?).

0,2022-10-04,CMV: a hybrid of government and private insurance would help solve the healthcare crisis in the US.,u/Importantlyfun,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xvd1vy/cmv_a_hybrid_of_government_and_private_insurance/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I do not work in the healthcare industry, finance, or insurance. My opinions are not based in anything but a lot of thinking and a knowing that something needs to be done. While I am generally libertarian in most of my views, I accept there is a basic cost to live in a modern civilization. Just like roads, military, fire/police services, protecting citizens from financial ruin for getting something basic like healthcare.

Starting premise: I think we have evolved as a society enough to say access to healthcare should be a human right. In the US, it’s estimated that the number one reason for personal bankruptcies are due to medical debt and over half of Americans carry some level of medical debt, even those with insurance. Currently, there is an estimated medical debt of about $200,000,000,000. This does not include medical expenses paid for via credit cards and does not include the cost of medical care during the pandemic. It's not controversial to say medical debt is a significant problem in the US. 

Additionally, medical debt has an impact on the overall economy. People with debt often delay purchases of everyday items like food, clothing, rent/mortgage, etc. It can even delay or prevent someone from buying larger purchases like a vehicle, house, student loans by directing funds from those items to pay off the medical bills or past due medical debt causing negative credit reports which would prevent loan approval. 

I’m not convinced a sudden move to universal healthcare will be a positive for the country as a whole. The effect of a sudden surge of people going to the doctor would cause a major bottleneck and would cause a collapse of the healthcare industry. Our hospitals, clinics, doctors, and nurses are already overworked and adding more patients would be too much to sustain. It would also have major negative impact on the financial institutions and insurance industries, which contributes to the overall economy, employment, and retirement investments. 

My view is that a hybrid of government and private insurance would be a viable solution. This plan is structured that it could, over many years, slowly be shifted to universal healthcare. It provides a safety net and limits the chances of destroying your financial life if you had a major medical event. But, it would also make individuals responsible for their own healthcare costs and keep the majority of healthcare costs away from the government. 

Here are my thoughts:

1.       The US government provides catastrophic health insurance to all citizens at no cost. Any balance above a certain threshold ($50,000?) would be covered by Medicare. The threshold could be slowly (over 20 years?) reduced, eventually phasing out private insurance. 

2.       Private insurance would then be used for the medical expenses below the threshold and be the responsibility of the individual/family. My assumption would be the cost of the insurance would be very affordable because there would be no exposure for the insurance company for large payouts, as the government kicks in at the threshold. Private insurance would not be mandatory, but the individual would still be responsible for whatever care they received. With additional people being able to afford the private insurance, costs would come down even further. 

3.       All medical expenses are 100% tax deductible, no limit, including premiums, medication, medical devices, etc. Does not include purely optional procedures like Botox injections and other cosmetic surgery, like it is now.

4.       Guaranteed coverage, no preexisting condition exclusions and no special exclusions (plan covers all medically necessary procedures, including experimental and off label treatment). No more picking and choosing which treatment is covered and what is not. Lifetime maximums are no longer a thing due to government catastrophic coverage. 

5.       Health insurance is purchased the same as car insurance and national insurance companies can sell across state lines.  This increases competition and reduces cost. 

6.       Any private insurance plan is accepted everywhere and the “in/out of network” concept is no longer allowed. 

7.       Employer sponsored plans are still allowed, but not at special rates and the same insurance plan would cost the same as an individual plan. It would be tied to the person and travel with the employee, not stay with the employer.

8.       States could create a department that would offer insurance to compete with private insurance which would keep rates competitive. This department must be self funding through premiums, but could be funded by the state if voters choose to. This insurance stays with the citizen only if they live in that state, but is valid for treatment out of state due to specialty care or emergencies. Tax exempt, nonprofits could also join the private insurance market to provide another alternative. 

9.       Not directly related, but I’d also like to see significant oversight to fight fraud and big penalties for insurance company misbehavior. 

10.   To help lessen the overburdened healthcare industry, government subsidies for medical school and nursing programs. The lack of healthcare professionals is a major cause at delaying care. 

Anyone with direct knowledge or experience to know if this is a feasible plan? Any feedback or criticism is welcome.

623,2022-10-04,"CMV: there is not a homogenous ""white culture""",u/Presentalbion,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xvgnfi/cmv_there_is_not_a_homogenous_white_culture/,changemyview,"This is a view which comes from a discussion I had on this subreddit, when I saw someone use the phrase ""white culture"".

I don't think that there is a set of customs or shared behaviours that apply to white people. I think that being white/Caucasian presenting in terms of skin colour is a physical trait and does not automatically translate into a certain way of life, or attitude.

I think that when looking to define some kind of culture, white is as broad as to not mean much of anything, and even being region specific like saying ""American White Culture"" or ""Bulgarian White Culture"" isn't useful because it still doesn't point to a lot outside of context. I'm sure a white person's experience and culture in Portland Oregon is very different to a white person in New York.

These broad brushes are divisive, if I wanted to describe a culture I would be very specific, including regional and behavioural, but not skin colour. I don't think there is ""white people music"" but there is classic jazz. That is a far easier thing to define, and less open to a racist perspective.

The person who originally used white culture went on to describe it as
""the culture that developed when Americans decided that class would be based on race. Some of it's features include draconian police laws, a lack of support for the most needy and vulnerable, and shitting on black people while taking their stuff. White music includes the pedophile works of Ted Nugent, or the plain theft and drug use of Eric Clapton.""

I think this view of white people, and the idea of white culture it contains, is straight up racist.

For reference I'm South Asian and would find someone calling something South Asian culture pretty odd, as that could mean Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and a few other places, all very different from one another overall and each containing great diversity.

I'd like to expand my understanding because maybe this is an American thing, but even in America I do not think there is an all encompassing white culture, or even white attitude. Just as with South Asia, the USA is home* to diversity of all kinds. I doubt there is a black culture, white culture, and any denominational culture that can be defined by skin colour. I doubt this in America, and certainly across the rest of the world.




EDIT! Thank you all for engaging in this discussion so far, its been interesting hearing your thoughts, although I think some have misunderstood me to mean White American Culture, which isn't what I said.

This comment was especially enlightening, about defining based on what is, not on what isn't: https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xvgnfi/cmv_there_is_not_a_homogenous_white_culture/ir227ho

I think that's a good way to refine the direction for those looking to define based on what isn't, because that absence doesn't make for good patamaters!"

I'll come right out and acknowledge that companies use the power of FOMO to compel people to buy their product/service. I believe it is still the responsibility of the consumer to choose what they do and do not buy. I'm aware that compulsive shoppers exist, so for the purpose of this CMV I'm excluding them.

I've noticed more and more people acknowledging their own FOMO and acting as though a company offering a product/service that results in their FOMO is somehow plotting against them or scamming them into paying more for something than they want to. 

Where the entitlement comes in is the idea that if a company offers a product/service someone wants (not needs), the consumer decides how much it is worth to them. If the consumer cannot get the product for what they feel like paying, they believe the  company has done something wrong. They believe the company should not even be allowed to offer the product/service for that cost because it's unfair to people that want to buy it but can't. If they cannot acquire the thing they want, they would rather it not exist for everyone else than simply not buy it themselves.

We ""miss out"" on many things because they are beyond our means. Yet we pick and choose which of those things to be angry about. Something I may have strong FOMO feelings about, someone else may not care at all they do not have. So for me to say this particular thing should cost less or be easier to obtain because **I** *want* it is just purely entitlement imo.

As stated above, this applies to wants, not needs. In some cases though the line of want/need is a bit blurry. Something like affordable internet access has arguably become a need in many places these days. You cannot CMV by giving an example of something that is a want for some people and need for other people in certain cases. This view applies only to things that are clearly wants."

This is a very big problem as voters continue losing more and more trust in the institutions American democracy stands on. I feel like taking the trust away from the bodies that have misused that trust (in this narrow scope) by using something like [The shortest splitline algorithm](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~adanner/cs97/s08/papers/benn_german.pdf) solves a portion of this problem handedly with almost no unintended externalities.

Most of these methods (at least the popular ones) tend to be fairly simple to understand and incorruptible by nature. 

I see a possible negative externality being that some communities may be split into separate districts, when they consider themselves of the same ilk. My counter is twofold.

1. We can account for this if we choose to, though it adds complexity and the ability to corrupt the process.
2. or, so what? If the congressperson in Pasadena suddenly had to care about voters in east LA, is that not a good thing?

I guess, I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing here, because it seems like such a no-brainer and such an easy reform, it's a wonder to me that this isn't on the tip of anyone's tongue who's entered a conversation about voter suppression/fraud/disenfranchisement. It's such a slam dunk. 

I'm sure there are cynical poly-sci majors in the peanut gallery who are standing by to give me 101 reasons why we can't have anything nice, but I'm more interested in the ""should"" or ""should not"" of this argument. Fielding the old arguments of ""stop bringing up reforms because our government sucks to much to change"" is uninteresting and unhelpful.

* B) Equity demands we recognize strengths, weaknesses, propensities, and aversion - impose burdens according to ability and provide support according to need.
* Therefore C) Setting equal expectations for men and women in each dimension of adulthood, relationships, marriages, and family life inequitable:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pregnancy / Postpartum / Infant Care: Childbirth and infant care place burdens on mothers. Fathers can assist and support her, but he cannot ""share"" these burdens ""equally.""
2. Given (#1) that men cannot equally share the burdens of pregnancy, postpartum, and infant, THEN ""equity"" demands that men assume greater responsibilities in other areas to reduce burdens on women (e.g. fathers earning money to support mothers)
3. Since (#2) men have a responsibility to earn money to support their wives - and that this usually requires men to be physically away from the home to earn money - THEN daily homemaking and child rearing responsibilities will equitably gravitate toward the mother who is at home with the children (if only during the period that she is pregnant, postpartum, caring for infants \[""maternity leave""\]).
4. Similarly (#2), since men are physically able to perform greater manual labor and are unburdened by pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care, THEN responsibility for any manual / physical task will equitably gravitate toward men.
5. Given #3 &amp; #4, it is also in-equitable for women to displace men from educational and employment opportunities because when she does so, she is depriving wives and children of the income that their husband/father is responsible for providing them.

I don't think this is true at all. Here are the supporting points that come to my mind:

\- If I'm drunk, I don't really stop to think about what I'm saying *before* it comes out of my mouth. I'll say something, and *then* I'll realize that it doesn't actually make sense and/or I don't agree with it. This doesn't mean that I secretly hold that opinion and am only comfortable expressing it when I'm drunk, it means that because I was drunk I didn't finish deciding what my opinion was before I started talking about it.

\- Being drunk makes my emotions more intense, so while drunk I might get into an argument over \[whatever issue\] because in that moment it feels like a big deal. But when sober, that issue isn't something I care about in the slightest and that same conversation wouldn't turn into an argument or even be something I had a strong opinion about. It's not that I *secretly* care and only express it while drunk, it's that being drunk makes me over-emotional about random things.

\- Beer Goggles. If I'm drunk I might hook up with someone that I don't find attractive when I'm sober. That's not because I'm repressing or denying a secret attraction to this person while sober and only acting on it while I'm drunk, it's because when I'm drunk they literally look different to me.

So my argument is that being drunk isn't ""revealing who I really am"", it's legit making me into a different person.

CMV?

**EDIT: My view has been changed (partially)!**

**Mainly, I understand now that “in vino veritas” and “drunk words are sober thoughts” are not supposed to mean the same thing. I was thinking both phrases were bullshit because I’ve almost always heard them misused and/or have misunderstood the meaning,**

**So I now think that “in vino veritas” is a reasonable concept, because it means:**

* **it’s harder for drunk people to convincingly lie**
* **when drunk, you’re more likely to let a secret slip in conversation**
* **your underlying emotional state often comes out when you’re drunk**
* **when drunk, you reveal aspects of your personality that you might normally keep hidden**

**But I still think that “drunk words are sober thoughts” is a largely misapplied/inaccurate concept, apart from this meaning:**

* **when drunk, you might say something that you normally would only think and not share, because while drunk you don’t care that there will be backlash or consequences for your words**

I am not aware of any bluetooth earbuds that allow you to replace the battery without having to do surgery on the bud. This often makes them impossible to fix when (not if) they die.

All the material to make those earbuds will probably end up in a landfill. This is a waste of materials that could be better used elsewhere. If you are part of the tiny minority of people that actually gets recycleable buds and then actually recycles them, you get a pass here. But I believe that the amount of people who actually do that is negligible.

Basically, I'm open to the idea I might kill myself one day and I don't see anything wrong with it.

Where I disagree with most people I know is they consider life is inherently good and death should always be avoided. Whereas I want to live to have a good time and being born is not, by itself, a good time. If my life is 49% pleasure, 51% pain (and likely to stay that way) I'm better off dead, as 0 pleasure, 0 pain is a better ratio. It's not quantifiable as exact numbers ofc, they are just here to simplify the explanation.

I wouldn't want to live the life of most people I know and that's ok, if they do that's their problem.

What made me first think of this post is the people who say ""if x accident happened to me I would kill myself"". People to whom it did happen, and are disabled because of it, take it as an implication *they* should die and get angry at the suggestion, calling it ableist. To be fair this anger is justified if people say it to their face, which is extremely rude and you should never do that.

But if someone thinks *their own* life as a blind person, or with one arm wouldn't be worth living that's their problem. Hell sometimes I wish I had a third arm, what if I decided my life with 2 arms wasn't worth living? That would be no one's business but mine.

Likewise someone could make it their life goal to have a billion dollars and kill themselves if they don't reach it. This sounds stupid to me, but I don't mind as long as they don't claim all non-billionaires should die or go around killing non-billionaires.

There is one thing complicating this opinion, which is that whether I should live depends not only on whether I enjoy my life right now, but whether I'm likely to enjoy it in the future. It's impossible to predict, and as suicidal people are often depressed they often have an inaccurate assessment of it. Still, it's not like anyone else has enough information to know any better: if I met a complete stranger about to jump off a bridge I would still try to stop them, but with little conviction as they know the value of their own life better than I ever could.

The reason I'm posting this is that while I don't want to kill myself now, I want to keep my options open. That way I can choose to live because I enjoy it, however if I say ""I have to live no matter what"" living becomes an obligation instead, something to fit on my list of chores between the laundry and shopping.

Note that this post is not promotion for euthanasia/assisted suicide, not that I necessarily oppose them but they open other cans of worms.

I've always thought the 40% number was a dubious statistic, especially considering its source and outdated nature by now. It uses data from 1992 based on a survey done at some sort of police conference IIRC.

Well I came across this [USA Today article](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/) from 2019 and according to the data collected over a ten year period, we can glean some very interesting information if it's accurate. Most importantly we see that there were 2300 cases of official recognition of domestic abuse by cops. And this is collected over a 10 year period, so if I am correct in doing so, if we divide 2300 by ten, that gives us an average of 230 cases of domestic violence committed by cops every year.

However, there are roughly 800,000 cops operating in America. That would mean that only **0.2%** are abusing their wives each year, at least in an officially recognized capacity. You can say that a lot of women/families are kept in a prison of fear which keeps them from reporting the abuse, but that's quite a gap to close from 0.2% to 40%. That seems very unlikely.

I was looking for some corroborating data and I found a [less recent study from 2013](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1005&amp;context=crim_just_pub) that says:

&gt;281 officers from 226 law enforcement agencies were actually arrested for domestic violence.

That's very intriguing because 281 is not too far from 230. It seems that number might have some serious validity.

So I found this all to be very intriguing. One of the most common talking points from anti-police advocates you'll see on Reddit is this 40% domestic violence number. But according to this data that seems to be wildly inaccurate. According to the data, the true number seems to be well under 1%.

Should I have reason to doubt what I've learned? CMV."

Example: [Oregon 1st state to decriminalize hard drugs](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-1st-state-to-decriminalize-possession-of-hard-drugs).  Criticism of tough law enforcement is widespread.  Criminal justice (CJ) reform advocacy seems to be accepted by more and more people. This [2018 criminal justice reform article](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/correctionalcontrol2018.html) writes:

&gt;The U.S. has... 2.3 million people behind bars....(many more) are on probation and parole (“community supervision”)... injustices plague (the) systems, which set people up to fail with long supervision terms, onerous restrictions, and constant scrutiny...these....conditions that make it difficult for people to succeed...(help) channel people into prisons....

The Meek Mill case, [pleads guilty to gun charge to end 12-year case](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49485075) is often cited:

&gt;(Jailed) in 2009.....gun and drug charges... released on parole after five months...failing to get his travel plans approved...five months prison in 2014... rapper was arrested for...reckless driving....another five months in jail.... 

Aside from prison and community supervision, our system uses fines and community service.  Neither seems particularly effective for people who commit a large amount of crime: low income people.   My orientation is pro-law and order, but I've argued for a [Day-Fines model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-fine), which fines people according to their income level.  The day-fines idea has been shot down broadly in the U.S. Not going to debate day-fines here.  But CJ reformers make a good case on the limited effectiveness of fining people who can barely pay rent. 

Another class of offender: homeless with addictions, mental illness -- often habitual offenders of public disorder and theft.  Fine them? They have no money.  Community service? How do you compel them to work? What should we do -- put them in jail? Will their behavior will be different when they get out?  In our current system, these people seem mostly  immune to sanctions, if they do not get violent.

Recently a rise in crime, [Homicide spiked 30% During COVID](https://www.voanews.com/a/why-homicide-rates-spiked-30-during-the-pandemic-/6420391.html), has boosted Law and Order Advocacy (L&amp;O advocacy).

Still, CJ reformers  seem to have the upper hand. L&amp;O advocacy appears  off-balance -- weak on defending their prime 3 primary sanctions, prison, community supervision and fines,  as ideal tools for *low income, non-violent, sometimes dysfunctional offenders.*  

I have no problem with long prison terms for violent offenders.  But repeat 5-month terms for Meek Mill every time he violated parole?    Too funny L&amp;O advocates' love affair with the  2,000-years-old sanction of locking offenders in cages.

**Part II:   Law and order advocates should develop new Offender Sanctions.**    This section might address some rebuttal points to the above.


We hear all the time the truth that America has the most prison inmates in the world.  How do many Asian and Islamic nations deal with  crime?  Are they easier on offenders?

Common in many parts of the world: incarceration in strict conditions of shorter duration. (Yes, Europe is noted for much more pleasant prisons.) In the U.S., inmates set up gangs that disrespect guards and threaten other inmates.  Some weak inmates are regularly sodomized. No wonder many American prisoners come out worse.  The preference for long prison terms is the primary reason that the U.S. leads the world in people incarcerated.

Can the U.S. use some of these other approaches?  Nations that flog criminals find the punishment equally fair to rich and poor and expedient. Offenders return home the same day. Flogging is banned by the 8th Amendment on Cruel and Unusual Punishment.    I'll back off on advocating flogging, but it's  odd that we seldom discuss *acceptable versus non-acceptable punishment*.   So corporal punishment is deemed abhorrent, but this is OK: 2021:  [Man who spent 22 years in solitary confinement fights to end the practice](https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-spent-22-years-solitary-confinement-fights-end/story?id=77632919).

What about other alternatives?  For probation violation and the homeless guy committing his 17th drunk and disorderly, how about 5  days in jail under a bread and water diet only? [The military ended that only in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/magazine/navys-bread-water-punishment-newsletter.html).  It is not that onerous of a punishment. Think it's oppressive? OK -- the offender should be free to choose 60 days in jail instead.

Proposing new punishments is the job of L&amp;O advocates. CJ reformers are unlikely to propose anything. They  [generally don’t like punishment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/crime-and-punishment/201804/why-punishment-doesnt-reduce-crime).

Electronic monitoring is a tool that warrants expansion, [once problems are fixed.] (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2017/09/21/decades-later-electronic-monitoring-of-offenders-is-still-prone-to-failure/).  Most CJ reformers [oppose electronic monitoring (BrennanCenter)](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-electronic-monitoring-incentivizes-prolonged-punishment). This monitoring is akin to community supervision, but it has relatively minor use in the justice system today.   Expanding this monitoring could results in a big decline in prison populations.  It has big value for *semi-quarantining* disruptive drug  addicts to the outskirts of cities, where their chronic disruptive behavior is less bothersome to the public.  (I do not agree with the Brennan’s criticisms, except the complaint about excessive fines attached.) 

Check out this horrible punishment widely used in historical China. It is extreme, but reflects an  intelligent *Incapacitate and Release* logic.   [Cangue](https://www.google.com/search?q=ancient+chinese+punishments+for+crimes+cangue&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZ6f0IdDzsYiZtIvDAeOMmYt9b7uw:1663057099706&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid8Ky9qpH6AhVHBEQIHSTSBJ4Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=713&amp;dpr=2).  Huge deterrent impact, both to  the offender and passersby. 

Note that a minor criticism of electronic monitoring is that the ankle bracelets are annoying to wear.  Same principle,  right?   There are probably 50 ways to punish/discomfit an offender by making them wear something uncomfortable, with a huge range in severity.   In lieu of 90 days in jail for a non-violent crime, we could release an offender with chains on his ankles he must wear for 14 days.  If they do not want to be out in public and face *stigma*-- a concern of so many  CJ reformers--offenders with leg chains can stay home.  Also we  can set up *Open prisons* (must be there at night, allowed to leave in the day.) No offender will be mandated to be out in public.  No more stigma than prison.

The control sanctions I suggested are options.  There could be others, better ones.  Will progress be made on any of this? Seems unlikely.  L&amp;O advocates are convinced their current models for offender control are best. 

L&amp;O advocates seems to under appreciate how CJ reforms increasingly dictate the level of crime and disorder on the streets.   Example: homeless addicts disruptively occupying  public spaces. 30 years ago all these people went to jail or prison. CJ reformers lobbied for years to end incarceration for addicts.  Provide  rehab instead, they said.  In west coast states L&amp;O advocates  mostly accommodated the *no-jail-for-drug addicts* policy. Here is the outcome from [Oregon, first state to decriminalize.](https://apnews.com/article/health-business-europe-oregon-salem-158728e57e1d48bc957c5b907bcda5f5)  

&gt;In the first year after the new approach took effect, only 1% of people who received citations (for hard drugs)...asked for help.

1% is not a satisfactory outcome. Drug addicts and petty criminals occupying important public spaces in many American cities reflects how CJ reformers increasing have the upper hand over L&amp;O advocates.



= = =

Note: Because of the large number of issues covered here, I will not address many subsidiary assertions. Example:  If CJ reformers want to insist that the core problem with drug addicts is not enough money put into rehab, fine --  not going to debate that.  The primary discussion  points include 1) the OP title sentiment, and 2) the value of alternative methods of offender control and  **the failure of L&amp;O advocates to pursue them.**"
0,2022-10-04,CMV: The Russian People collectively are to blame for allowing the war in Ukraine to continue,u/bhte,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xvqk8b/cmv_the_russian_people_collectively_are_to_blame/,changemyview,"I understand that my title is quite direct but I believe this to be the case based on what I've read and I'm interested in hearing concrete arguments that disagree with my statement.

Firstly, I want to point out that I believe Putin is the manufacturer of the war in Ukraine. If he wasn't in power there would be no war and it's clear that his own geopolitical insecurities are dictating his authoritarian agenda. My problem, however, is that the Russian people have not done enough to avoid the blame of allowing the conflict to continue. 

I have seen protests and riots by young Russians in Moscow but equally I have seen interviews of Russian citizens saying that they are under threat from the West and what Putin is doing in Ukraine is justified. You could argue that they are being brainwashed into believing this but based on the fact that Russians have access to the internet, it's hard to believe that they don't have enough facts to have a good knowledge on the reality of the war. Also, up until recently, Russians have been travelling to places like Dubai, Turkey, China, India, Africa and South America where the war is spoken about from a more neutral perspective. Based on all of this, it's difficult to believe that the consensus is simply ""we are under immediate threat and Ukraine is that threat"". They definitely know the conditions of the war currently - just like we would want to know if we were ""under immediate threat"" and could leave our authoritarian country to find out. 

Putin has ruled over 140 million people for 10 years without facing massive opposition. According to [statista.com](https://statista.com), Putin's approval ratings had risen from 69% of Russians approving of him in January of 2022, before the war, to 83% in March - the first full month of the war. This is also the same man who invaded Crimea in 2014 without facing massive opposition from Russians that time too. According to the same study, his approval ratings jumped from 65% before the annexation of Crimea to around 84% after. 

I'm also aware of the fact that large numbers of Russian soldiers have been deserting the war since the beginning but the Russians have equally taken huge amounts of territory in Ukraine and have not been unsuccessful in their efforts to counter the 700,000+ strong force of the Ukrainians. This means there is definitely some willingness by soldiers to fight and willingness from Russians to support that fight. 

I'd be interested in hearing a concrete argument against what I've written and I am prepared to change my mind, especially because the Western world seems to believe that this war is between Putin and Ukraine and the Russian people are somehow off the hook."

They aim to restrict voting rights and accessibility (upcoming court case in SCOTUS, Moore v Harper).

They refuse to recognize the results of an election, going so far as to violently attempt to enter the Capitol building in an effort to block the certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election.

They stand by lies and deceit, stating anything negative about them is ""fake news"" while simultaneously putting it out themselves and using the gullibility of the GOP voting block to give those fake headlines credibility.

They put person over country, putting more faith in a man with multiple criminal proceedings than the agencies in charge of disposing justice, and uses violence against those institutions (FBI attack in Cincinnati).

They circumvent justice by sweeping things under the rug, installing biased justices with predetermined decisions and utilizing their positions of power for personal gain.

Their hypocrisy, complete and utter disregard for the people of the United States, lack of empathy, greed and their intent to unravel this country's democratic processes, as well as their desire to use violence to achieve those means in the sole purpose to achieve power for themselves alone, makes them fit the definition of a terrorist organization.

The reason for this is that most developing countries are hodgepodges of different clans, religions or ethnic groups that were forcibly grouped together for the purposes of colonial administration. Sometimes, infighting amongst local leaders was encouraged by these same colonizers.

After decolonization, the groupings remained alongside the divisions among the people. This means that the necessary conditions for democracy and economic development such as independent institutions, a functioning justice system, etc. were absent or severely underdeveloped.

For example, let's say that ethnic group A and ethnic group B hate each other yet still happen to live within the same borders. If a member of ethnic group A suddenly becomes president, do you think he will look out for the interests of ethnic group B? As a result, the Bs resent their consequent treatment, and once one of their own wins the presidency they will take it out on the A’s, and so the cycle continues. *People with such diametrically different interests cannot be trusted to share independent institutions and reach the compromises that are necessary for stable democracies.*

There are two options for this hypothetical country:

1. Ethnic group A and ethnic group B split their country down the middle to form countries A and B. The ethnic groups then can govern themselves how they see fit, thus fulfilling the ideal of the nation-state. This is also nationalism, but of course there have been problems with this in the past like the Indian partition, Sudan and the Israel-Palestine issue.

2. Another option is to forge a new group C out of the two warring ethnic groups, whether it be through propaganda or a police state or general assimilation. This becomes the new nationalism. There is no more civil strife, because there is no more ethnic group A or ethnic group B. They will have little reason to be resentful or sabotage development if they all have the same interests in mind.

The problem with #2 is that it often takes the form of dictatorships and other forms of authoritarianism unpalatable to Western liberal democracies. It should be restated here that not all autocratic governments are necessarily good. However, the kinds of governments that are likely to change their nations into free and democratic societies most likely have had authoritarian leanings in the past. More often than not *these so-called ""dictators"" were the only ones in their countries with the vision and foresight to unite the country towards a common goal of national development rather than just perpetuating the cycle of warring tribes or religions.* Institutions like pluralism, democracy and equality before the law can only function with solidarity and consensus--which some people will only come to understand through the necessary force of nationalist movements."

Civilizations are either destroyed or enslaved by empires, or adopt similar militaristic practices in order to more effectively repel potential threats.

Domestically, fascist and nationalist ideologies appear to be the strongest. Nationalist ideology taps into in-grouping mob mentality and enjoys a level of fervor that more critical or nuanced perspectives lack. If anything, rationality and debate weaken factions, because groups that focus on ideas have constant infighting as a result of them being self-critical, whereas people united under fascist ideology are more consistent in cooperating.

Bigotry and prejudice are useful tools specifically because they hinge on making judgments on an individual's innate nature (race, religion, country of origin.) Because these signals are immutable, bigots do not have to ask questions or seek clarification in order to maintain a consistent ethos."

Consider their first paragraph:

&gt;As title suggests, recently I have been thinking that human lifespan is very, very short. Considering the average life expectancy to be around 72-85 years (in developed countries) is a woefully small span of time.

72-85 years of life expectancy ([or 81.2 for men in my country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy)) is too short? I constantly remind myself that I've consumed so much of the world's resources, at age 26, and that I need to live in a way that justifies this use of resources (i.e. by contributing to human progress). Imagine how pathetic it is to live 72-85 years, consuming resources at a developed nation's citizen's level, and not meaningfully contributing to the world, because you were too unintelligent, lazy or unambitious to do so.

Consider their third paragraph:

&gt;My view is that 70-80 years is still very very small. A major chunk of our life span (0 to 15-25 years) is spent on just understanding the basics of life, 25-50 years are probably the actual most productive, healthy and stable period in an average humans life (again talking generally, with respect to people belonging to upper socioeconomic strata in developed nations). And 50 to 75-80 years, is generally involving various health issues and all (though still good if someone is not suffering from any crippling illness).

As that paragraph outlines, a human being has 25-50 years of high productivity. How can I possibly justify living past that other than by using sentimentality (e.g. the ""*I want to see my grandkids*"" argument)? If I knew for sure that I would not amount to anything in the next 55 years of my life, I can't rationally justify living past age 26, let alone to 81.

The reason why I say ""*can't rationally justify living*"" is because I refuse to kill myself despite being fairly pathetic myself. I survived a [car crash in 2016](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/man-dies-following-drumborg-crash/8dy8wnjjg), and I feel obliged not to waste my unlikely survival - which is why I am very ambitious and very harsh on myself. This is why it's irrational - I use sentiment, not rationality, to justify my continued existence.

If I died today, what does the world miss out on? The most I can think of is that my family bloodline might end (my brother doesn't want kids) - which the world has no reason to care about. There's no guarantee that my PhD will be a success. It may personally feel bad not to live long enough to find love or start a family - but if my life is useless, I wouldn't deserve those anyway.

Back to the issue of the world's resources. Unless you can make your citizens more useful for longer, what point is there in increasing the national life expectancy other than to look good? A hypothetical nation that has a life expectancy of 100, assuming its people are just as productive as those of other nations, is merely allowing its people to consume the world's resources for 100 years each, instead of just 72-85.

All human beings, including myself, are resources. They can easily outlive their usefulness. If you are a useful person, congratulations, enjoy your well-deserved continued existence. As much as I want to say that I can justify my continued existence, alas, until I complete my PhD, invent something useful or do something heroic, I cannot. Hence why I believe that as soon as we reach adulthood, everyone must prove themselves useful, to justify their continued existence.

I am not advocating killing/euthanising people against their will here. I am also not advocating living unhealthy lifestyles - these shorten the period where a human being is useful. The point of this post is to debate if we really should want to live beyond the period where we are useful."

Some people say that this fact alone disproves the idea of God, however, I think a possible workaround is that if God supposedly exists outside of time, then the suffering of humanity in the past and present would be in some way necessary to craft the best conditions for humanity to thrive in the future, and to do so for a significantly longer period than it has suffered for so far. The only way this really works is if he wants to take a... hands-off approach and let humanity sort its own problems out, but this only works if he knows where the future is headed, which is only possible if he has functionally limitless intelligence and exists outside of time. Otherwise, if he didn't know that it would all be for the best for a fact, how can you justify the amount of suffering humanity has endured throughout its history? However, to be able to craft the future in such a way that the entire history of the human race, past present, and future, was guaranteed to get to that point where we thrive for significantly longer than humanity has suffered, which is the only way to make the sheer amount of people who lived awful lives morally acceptable, then every single thing that will ever happen will already have been known to God long before it does happen. This would essentially mean that while crafting our reality, he chose the starting conditions that would play out exactly the way that they have. There is a science that would suggest this isn't possible, but that's not really relevant to this discussion, and God, as commonly described, would certainly have a way around this seeing as he would have created the very laws we use to say the universe likely isn't deterministic. All of that is to say that from billions of years before every single human who has ever lived, God knew exactly how their lives would play out, down to every decision they would ever make. This makes free will impossible because you can't simultaneously have your life planned out from before the earth was even formed and also have people capable of making decisions that would change the outcome. Therefore, with the assumption that God does exist, he is either not the all-loving being we are led to believe he is, or we do not have free will. And if we do not have free will, it is wildly amoral to commit somebody to an eternity of hell and suffering for transgressions committed in a lifetime that God had perfect knowledge of before it even started."

People like Tattoo Artists charge hundreds of dollars for their pieces, usually adding up to an average of making $50 an hour. I don’t know why an additional $100 tip is necessary. Even if they're paying for their own supplies. So what? It's operations cost. Every business has it. You don't tip the your tax lawyer because they have to pay for internet service.  I’d say the same for any artist that works off commissions and sets their own agreed upon price when you hire them.

If I go to a local bowling alley, and they turn the iPad around to show me a tip screen just for grabbing my shoes on the shelf behind them, I don’t feel the tip is necessary, because they didn’t do anything more than an employee at Walmart or Target would do. It is just a system built into the Square program

In today’s society it seems (imo) people overrate careers as their definable function in life. “Focusing on my career” or “being independent” are basically the default answers to modern ambitions, focuses and virtues. Yet I find this to be imbecilic nonsense. Money is obviously a better and more honest answer (health and family probably are too). Here’s why:

1) Careers are just a means to an end, that end being making some money. Proof? Just ask people to work for free or take a sizable payout… and then watch all hell break loose. People want a fulfilling life! And that comes from money and the things it buys, mainly everything (security, heath, luxury). The career is just a byproduct, it should never be the focus.

2) Money let’s you enjoy the fruits, without the labor. Careers can give you things like status, luxury, power, etc… but money alone does this as well. There is no difference between working for your money and inheriting it, it’s buying power doesn’t change. Being rich is being rich, doesn’t matter if you born into it or self made. So if people really want the benefits of a career, they really should stop focusing on a career…and really say they should focus on money. Because having the later will always guarantee you will get the goodies! A career on the other hand is riskier (could be low paying or high stress job).

3) Given the last two arguments, it should be clear now that prioritizing money would be a better virtue! Since a career is not the end, but just a means to an end, people are lying when they claim to define their lives by their career. Admitting you really want money is a more honest answer, and that needs to be socially acceptable. Society promotes “self growth, independence, fulfillment through education &amp; careers” which is garbage. Yet if someone defined their life by saying “I focus having money and being rich” they are called greedy, why? This needs to change.

Lastly, I guess I can use my personal bias as an argument. With family money, one is able to see careers as an option and not a necessity. Which removes any of the emotional or societal pressure to idolize careers. And ironically, I think this gives me a superior unbiased perspective on the topic! I was able to realize that careers are just a means to make money, but they should never replace the actually worthy focus of life (family, health, charity, luxury, fun, etc…).

Now you can all try and change my view. Explain why careers are not overrated and that they are a worthy thing to focus on and grow in life."

However, outside the US, there are very few or less league teams per country. Articles like [this one](https://www.americanfootballinternational.com/global-talents-shines-brightly-at-londons-nfls-international-combine/) can say what they wanna say about American football outside the US. However, I'm not optimistic about the sport's future.

I see very few or less successful leagues. As I found out, European League of Football was established two years ago. Very few agencies or organizations cover the League, whilst NFL still as always receives a lot of attention. Furthermore, each country has teams in several, few or less cities on average, which is a lot less than NFL.

The sport itself has more complicated rules and scoring, which can be intimidating for an average non-US local to learn about. I wonder whether they'll learn what ""1st &amp; 10"" is, but I think they'll know ""Touchdown"" (scoring goal).

Furthermore, wearing gears and body protection requires a lot of money and resources, especially for an impoverished and poorly-skilled team. Without such protections, even the team would more likely get injured severely and would increase the risk of having its members killed.

Even building a football stadium requires more money and resources and consumes more land space than it should, especially for a poorer or smaller country.

In contrast, basketball has done extremely well outside the US. Even baseball has been popular in Japan.

Historically, the sport hasn't fared well outside the US. I wonder why American leagues are investing money on building a team outside the US. I also wonder why foreign leagues have been established recently. I can't help wonder whether global popularity of the American football was the reason, or the sport itself is unpopular outside the US.

American football players can receive nationwide fame all they want, but I wonder whether they'll earn global fame. I've not yet seen such player become famous around the world.

I wonder whether such player sought non-sport fields, like OJ Simpson did in *Naked Gun* trilogy.... before his infamous murder case. Being a sports announcer is one of sports fields to me, so that doesn't count as a ""non-sport field"". Coaching is a ""sports field"" as well.

I wonder which sport can overtake American football's popularity in the United States, if neither rugby nor soccer (association football) nor cricket nor baseball can stand the chance."

My point is that if the system is truly as broken as suggested, and if Hedge Funds truly can't cover their positions and financial institutions end up owing GME holders basically infinite amounts of money, that would trigger a financial black swan event which would see the government step in to bail out the hedge funds, asset managers, etc.  and consequently the Fed doing whatever it takes to deal with the fallout of that.

I would love to be wrong, but I just don't see any other outcome. Even _if_ the float gets locked and  MOASS happens, the US government isn't going to just let everything burn to the ground. There will be bailouts, there will be slaps on the wrist for players not playing by the rules, the stock will return to a ""normal"" price and that will be that.

I would love nothing more than to be wrong. Please change my view.

**EDIT:** My title is wrong. It's not that I don't think GME holders will be able to cash out, it's that I don't think they'll be able to cash out at the prices that could be triggered by a MOASS (So anything over $10,000 per share let's say)"

371,2022-10-05,CMV:Universities should not require all professors to explain how their work advances diversity,u/salome20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xwldo9/cmvuniversities_should_not_require_all_professors/,changemyview,"There seems to be a new(ish) trend where universities (and professional associations for university professors) require that their professors make explicit how their work advances diversity. Two concrete examples: 

* Jonathan Haidt, a professor of social psychology at NYU, recently resigned from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology because they said that in order to present at their annual conference, he must explain ""whether and how this submission advances the equity, inclusion, and anti-racism goals of SPSP.” [link](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/the-two-fiduciary-duties-of-professors/) 
* A good friend of mine is a professor of epidemiology at a top research university. She was just told that there is a new criteria that she will evaluated on going forward to determine whether she receives tenure: how her work advances diversity efforts.

I am not arguing that these issues are not important — if you try to convince me that diversity is important or that systemic racism is a real problem, you will not change my mind because I already believe those things.

What I am arguing is that there are MANY problems in the world, and it is not necessary that all professors work on solving the same problem. This is as silly to me as if suddenly all professors needed to say how their work helps to solve climate change or alleviate childhood malnutrition or stop human trafficking.

I would be a-okay with requiring professors to answer a more broad question like ""explain how your work furthers humanity in a positive way"" or even ""the university cares about these 10 issues, please explain how your work advances at least one of them."""

Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.""

I see this quote used frequently as ""fascists portray their enemies as both strong and weak"" and it's often mentioned when a person wants to insinuate those they disagree with, are fascists. But I think it's wrong - I think that Eco was wrong, to call this a feature of fascism. It's more like a feature of politics in general. Everywhere across the political spectrum, we see rhetoric like this.

**Examples of this rhetoric applying across the political spectrum include:**

* Donald Trump is a failure who can't even run a business with help from his super rich family. He's a buffoonish orange baby. He's the biggest extant risk to America and he nearly overthrew American democracy.
* The Taliban are a bunch of illiterate backwards people who live in caves and haven't advanced beyond the dark ages. They're also a risk to our freedom and our way of life and must be stopped at all costs.
* Joe Biden is a senile old man who can't speak or think straight. He should be in a nursing home; he's running this country into the ground for the democrats woke socialist agenda.
* George W. Bush is a national embarrassment, a bumbling redneck idiot who also happens to be the mastermind behind a conspiracy to invade Iran under false pretenses.

*I don't necessarily endorse or agree with any of the points above.*

I believe most mainstream, non-fascist political organizations follow this type of rhetoric and therefore I think it's wrong to list this as a feature of eternal fascism like Eco does. CMV.

26,2022-10-05,CMV: people should take to calling the LGBTQ+ community the Q+ community instead.,u/overactor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xwp0a3/cmv_people_should_take_to_calling_the_lgbtq/,changemyview,"First a disclaimer: I am a straight, cis gendered, white man, so this view is coming from someone who is very much an outsider.

I think LGBTQ+ is the best name for the community that is currently commonly used, but it's not great at all. The explicit inclusion of lesbian, gay, bi, and trans people make the lack of inclusion of intersex, asexual, pansexual, genderfluid people and so on seem exclusionary. LGBTQIA+ doesn't do very much to solve that problem, because the more things you explicitly include, the more the exclusions seem like targeted exclusion. It is also starting to get to a length and complexity that is unwieldy, slightly confusing and, frankly, a little ridiculous. It's good to have the Q+ at the end, because Queer is really sort of a catch-all and the plus really suggest inclusivity. But considering those two points, why do we really need the other letters? Just Q+ would do fine.

I don't just think Q+ is more inclusive, it's also less susceptible to an angle of attack that it's commonly employed by people with a distaste for the LGBTQ+ community which seems to resonate with a lot of moderate and right-leaning people: making fun of the ""alphabet people"". In certain circles the acronym LGHGTV+ is a popular meme making fun of the community and their alleged obsession with labels. Dave Chapelle also infamously made might of the community by referring to them as the alphabet people. This seems to land well with a lot of people because it paints members of the community as chronically obsessed with labels which denote trivial distinctions in sexuality and gender identity.

I know these differences are not actual trivial, especially not to people who are still discovering their gender identity and sexuality. I expect people at this would like to interject by saying that you shouldn't base the way you act or what you can things on the the opinions of people who don't care about or oppose what the community stands for. In this case, however, I don't think there's any downsides because the name is just better in every possible way except for cultural momentum, and no concession is made to them in any real way.

**tl;dr:** Q+ is the more inclusive name and it close off a popular angle of attack.

PS: note that I actually think this should be done, which guess beyond just thinking it's a shame the name ended up as it did and that it would have been better if the name had been Q+ from the beginning. I actually think the upsides of this change would orig outweighs any negative attached to it."

When I started watching again this year, around mid-season, I started to hear all about '**the shift'** \- essentially, instead of having four infielders and three outfielders, teams have started to move infielders into the positions to where the batters would be most likely to hit; usually stacking three infield players to the left of 2nd base for right-handed batters and three infield players to the right of 2nd base for southpaws.

This made hitting much more difficult for batters who consistently send line drives in the same direction. But at the same time, it benefited those who were able to 'beat the shift', and hit baseballs to the areas of the field where the outfielders didn't expect the ball to go. But regardless of any benefit to some hitters, the league decided that this was a bad thing for the sport. Starting in the 2023 season, there will be a new rule requiring two infielders to be positioned on each side of second base as well as a rule prohibiting infielders from the outfield grass. Effectively, the first rule bans the infield shift and the second rule bans the outfield shift.

Intuitively, as a player, you'd think it would make sense to 'shift' to where the batter will likely hit the ball. It feels incredibly odd to me that a rule would be instituted that seems to go against what is nothing more than common sense: be where the ball will be. TV and radio commentators are already talking about how some teams will likely have players start to move across the diamond as the pitcher starts to throw, as if they're a wide receiver running a route, in order to capitalize on the benefit of the shift while being in line with the rules. Am I alone in thinking that such comments emphasize the futility of these rules?

Part of my skepticism is based in the reasoning behind the rule changes. Baseball has long been considered 'boring' as televised sports go, and 'the shift' turned an already low-scoring game into an absolute snoozefest. To their credit, the MLB has instituted a few other rule changes that will increase scoring, such as slightly wider bases in the 2023 season, but I'm convinced that banning the shift is a very poor solution to a a problem that could be remedied in other ways.

Furthermore, it comes alongside a rule change that may *in and of itself* fix the pace problem in baseball, as pitchers in 2023 will be pitching against a clock (15 seconds per pitch with bases empty, 20 per pitch with men on, balk if time runs out). Can someone CMV and convince me that the MLB actually needs to ban the shift?"

Allowing a kid to bike around a safe neighborhood or bike to their friends house is unlikely to harm them. However what is harmful is the reduced social interaction we have forced kids into today. This largely explains why kids are addicted to technology. Another example is that kids aren’t allowed to play freely, try to build things, or use tools considered risky. This means we are hampering kids imagination and stopping the next Generation of engineers from reaching their full potential. What will change my view is if it can be conclusively proved beyond any reasonable doubt that being over cautious with kids is a net benefit for the youth and society."

She pretty much supported the freedom of people(specifically women) to be able to voice contrarian beliefs, the idea that bio women and trans women are different, and the implied belief that cis women are more oppressed than trans women.

* To the first I was under the impression the lady who Rowling supported didn't spout anything hateful, she was just gender critical which I'd disagree with but I'd support your right to express your beliefs.
* The second is just a fact.
* The third is just stupid.

Her statements implied some misguided beliefs, but give her a break, she's a 57 year old woman. She supported equality of all kinds since the 90s, she was the first billionaire to lose her billionaire status from donating to charities, she founded the Volant Charitable Trust, and she seems to otherwise be a good person. Her statements deserve criticism, but to receive death threats, have the kids she watched grow up black list her(I guarantee some did it simply to avoid bad publicity), and to have all the good she's done erased and instead be remembered as that one TERF just seems unfair.

I guarantee your grandpa hold way worse beliefs but you love him, heck I bet 50% of people agree with her. I understand it's different when you have influence over people, but she's still just a grandma, grandma's have bad takes sometimes! That's not to say you shouldn't argue with her, but I bet being dogpiled and harassed just enforced the belief that cis women are more oppressed and women's freedom of speech was being denied.

In general if we just came at things with more empathy and respect, we'd be able to change minds but the way we go about things now just closes them further.

EDIT: u/radialomens has near entirely changed my view, it hinged on the idea that she was more misguided than ignorant or hateful, but that's now been proven wrong. The degree she's pressed this topic, even if she may not be hateful, she's near woe-fulling ignorant to the point of doing serious harm to the trans community. I still don't think the senseless hate is deserved, but the actual criticism is proportional.

Edit: precisely two hours ago this youtuber posted a poll randomly asking if jk rowling was treated unfairly, no over arching point this is just very bizarre to me"

The people who vote should be representative for the population as a whole. And with people living longer and longer, that scale is getting more and more unbalanced. Where the average age of a western countries population is now 39, the average voting age is more like 52. Capping the voting age to 60 or 65 would bring us back a lot closer to the average of the population.

And yes I know old people need to be represented too. But this isn't about cutting them out completely, or saying that the opinion of certain age groups is better or worse than those of others. It is about rebalancing the scale. Because currently they are being *overrepresented*. Now politicans are stuck having to please pensioners, knowing they make up the majority of the voter base, while people of working age get neglected. And students/starters even more so. People in any stage of life being left behind economically will have long-term effects in fucking up society. Effects we are already seeing today.

And it matters in more than just economics. Values change over generations. If you take the oldest generation as one extreme, the youngest generation as the other extreme, and those in between as the middle ground: In a society were all three are represented equally, it will all about even out. But in a society were the oldest generation is overrepresented, the middle and younger generations are stuck living under outdated views."

I get that it’s hyperbolic and not to be taken literally, but I think it represents an underlying view of the world.

So a typical exchange will go something like this:

“It’s awful that workers at xyz big corporation are treated the way they are or paid the amount they are”

“Yeah well nobody is putting a gun to their head making them work there”

To me it seems this way of thinking is blind to the fact that there are different types and levels of coercion. A gun to the head is an extremely immediate and high level form, while social pressure from family is a lower form, for example.

Most of us would probably happily say “people would never work for xyz large corporation under those conditions but they have a gun to their head so we should create a system where nobody has to make those choices” and yet we seem to be unwilling to say “people would never work for xyz large corporation under those conditions unless they were a few months of no wages away from eviction, inability to pay bills or even homelessness, so we should create a system where nobody faces that choice”

Basically, my view is that the impending threat of immediate death should not be the bar by which we measure whether or not people are being unethically compelled to live their lives in particular ways, I’m curious to see if anyone can change that view"

If you are offended you have the right to be as I do I to not be apologetic :)
If your diagnosis has helped you then im happy for you.

As someone who has been identified as a candidate for ADD im trying to get to grips with what these disorders are,
My view is that ADD/ADHD almost certainly exist in a spectrum of disorder, most likely to be interlinked or bucketed with other other mental disorders (anxiety, depression, OCD etc etc), but we essentially understand f**k all. 

My main grievances are two fold:

1) there is no diagnosis for it. Qualatative Criterion set out by medical professionals and written into the DSM (diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders)doesnt count. 

If in person A's opinion you are exhibiting 5 of the symptoms and therefore meet the criteria to be diagnosed, but in person B's opinion you exhibit less than 5 and don't, then its massively flawed surely? And why the fuck 5? (ive no idea what the number is) is it as simple as 6 sounds like too much and 4 not enough? 

There is no ultrasound equivalent to ADD/ADHD and is therefore a guesstimate 

2) taking amphetamines for the rest of your life with a number of potential consequences if withdrawn or misused seems suspect as a means to treat an extremely poorly understood condition. 

To me its like deciding the solution to slowing your car from going too fast is weighing it down with breaks rather than taking your foot off the pedal. Just because the pedal in this analogy is not understood right now doesn't mean the bricks are an adequate solution 

I'm also rather cynical in that there is a double edge of comfort of being labelled with something (we must therefore be closer to the solution right? RIGHT?) and the genius of pharmaceutical companies promoting these labels that allow the sale of long term drugs. 

A side rant: the idea of low serotonin in the brain so therefore longterm antidepressants was an idea cooked up by big pharma and has utterly bedunked and is a fine example of how pharmas drives dont necessarily align with whats best for us. 

The meteoric rise of ADHD diagnoses in the last 20 years would either suggest - we can accurately diagnose whereas before we couldn't (untrue), 

that the social environment we interact in is rapidly changing and is causing untold and poorly understood problems (possibly, but to what extent?)

 or its being pushed because its profitable and our doctors are to an extent lapdogs giving diagnoses that should never have been given. 

I think overall the medical profession with regards to mental disorders lack a solid grip on the subject matter, the humility to be open enough about that fact, and possibly the integrity to be completely honest in their diagnoses."

There may be major weaknesses that cannot be straightforwardly addressed, but it's hard for me to think of them.

The basic idea works as follows -

1. District lines are drawn normally through whatever process the state in question has decided in the past
2. However, this is merely the ""default"" choice if a given voter takes no action when they register
3. Voters can choose which elections they want to vote in relevant to their municipality; for example, in a statewide election anyone in that state can choose any race to vote in. For a city, any \*city resident can choose which race they want to vote in within that city
4. (*nice to have)* DC residents, and possibly other territories, can choose any federal race they would like to vote in
5. If there are too many voters in a race, say larger than the census population, then people who wish to vote in that race and live in that district get first dibs and other voters are entered into a lottery

Voters would otherwise have the same number of votes they did in prior elections; ie., they couldn't vote in *more* elections just choose which ones.

Edit: I didn't actually explain why I think this would be a good idea. It would weaken gerrymandering and uncompetitive districts. Voters would also have more of a say in elections that affect them but who would be previously unable to vote in them for geographical reasons."

I all against telling people what to do and don't support someone telling young adult to don't have sex because they will not be able to have a relationship in future.

I think the same standards can be applied by woman and they can get better results in dating long term partner.And Also I'm not talking about marry a virgin if you are not someone who believe/follow in saving yourself for the one and also virgin.

It should be taking in consideration when you are thinking about marriage and someone is not comfortable there spouse body count (previous life choices) you can call it off.

Here are some reason -

1) Less chance of infidelity and paternity fraud, work as security for men.
There also a study done on it here the [Here](https://ifstudies.org/blog/counterintuitive-trends-in-the-link-between-premarital-sex-and-marital-stability)

It similar to girl wanting to date taller guy than them because it's a sign of security, that make themselves feel safe and increase there trust on partner.
And anybody want to get cheated on or raise child that you end up finding is not even your.And you will also not get justice for it because it's not considered crime in most countries and even if it does you will never be compansiated and will get the time back.

2) People want to feel like they are some special to someone special.

Example-In movie ladybird when, she find about Kyle past after loosing her virginity. It show that each of like to feel love and special to our partner.(it also a great movie ).

3) Hormone play a part.

Sex is more complex than just putting it in.The brain releases oxytocin during sex which can be addictive causing people to seek more partners, before marriage. Imagine you have a partner that really ""rocks your world"" &amp; the relationship ends. It's highly likely you will want that experience again which will require more intimate partners in order to find a suitable replacement. Think of the turnover at any retailer near you as they try to find employees to fit their business &amp; the problem is obvious. If you only have one partner (your spouse) you'll either never know what you're missing (boo) or you'll communicate (like all couples should) the good &amp; the bad, both will listen &amp; both will attend to the other's needs &amp; desires.

4)More likely to have STDs.

The more people you sleep, more likely you are to came in contact with StDs, as majority of people don't check themselves and some just don't express it because they are ashamed, it can be dangerous to partner and child too(in the future).

5) A high number could imply a troubled
childhood, escapism or even depression. 

It can be said for both men and women and also woman doesn't want to take part in sex because of it.

6) Pervious relationship baggage.

7)Child for previous relationship (might not be suited here but it's a possibility).

There are also some issue if you marry someone with zero experience, it may be because they don't like or have that much sex drive.You end up feeling not satisfied in relationship.

Age also take part it in, there not a ideal number for it, it based on both people past and how active they where.

I know majority of people have already downvote after reading the title (if mod don't delete it) and label me some ""ism"". People have the right to choose just like that you have the right to whatever you like to do with your body, people can also make decisions based on your past and they not be shamed for it.They are not harming anyone by wanted to be with someone they feel safe and trust on.If you like you share opinion and go ahead.
And don't write ""Insecure"" because

1) the same can be said for woman wanting to date taller men and noone call them insecure.

2)you don't have any point to bring up against it.

I think the social stigma against it can also be lower down if-

1)People are more open about they want and what they looking for in the beginning, it be hard conservation but it better to find it later.

2)There a lot to loose for men(or bread winner) in term of legal system.I think if legal system give men emotion some value. And put the cheater under the heat.

3)If you are someone how have high body count and you should be fine partner wanting to have STD test before been intimate with you.And paternity test just to clear the doubt or the baby born in wedlock.
[But than it also show that more body count means been pormiscous].

4)If you someone with high body count than it just not fair."
27,2022-10-06,CMV: Kind gestures with no plans to perform the gesture are immature and reflect poor communication.,u/xueamir,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xxcyjc/cmv_kind_gestures_with_no_plans_to_perform_the/,changemyview,"I believe words are important in communicating ideas and intentions. However, there’s plenty of situations where people communicate a kind gesture but regret it when the person takes them up on it.

For clarification, I’m talking about harmless gestures that are meant for a quick response. (1) Not gestures that someone offered weeks ago(e.g give me a call if you need a ride to the airport) because too many dependencies can change with time. (2) An additional caveat, no gestures where eminent danger is posed. An example gesture would be a violent domestic relationship where offering one partner if they would like a meal prepared as this could be the different between peace or violence for one partner. 

Context

The idea stemmed from a conversation with a friend discussing she wouldn’t go out with a guy on a 2nd date because he accepted her offer to split the bill. I asked her why would you offer to pay if you had no intention of splitting. She said because of her culture it would be rude to not offer to split and that it was a test to see if she would deny. Generally speaking, I think those who offer to take someone out should assume they’ll pay, but I’m indifferent on the splitting concept. However, it seems unfair to judge an individual for something you offered and they took the offer..

Moving away from dating norms which can be a rather testy topic for folks. Let’s take a simpler example such as offering a teammate a ride back home but knowing fully you would prefer to drive straight home. It seems silly to offer a ride then resent the person for taking the ride over the subway. I’ll also clarify that I do not believe the gesture giver is obligated to fulfill the gesture for whatever reason if legitimate or not.

I could provide countless examples where the intentions or feelings of those offering the gesture are not made clear. I think social cues are obviously great for knowing if someone is making a kind gesture however I think it’s irresponsible to assume individuals are mind readers and should know not to take the gesture."

A more appropriate and polite way of asking someone's availability would instead be this:

""When's a good time to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"" or ""When would be a good time to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?""

This question is a lot more subtle, and does not make the slight implication that about the recipient not having the time to deal with you. It's just literally asking others ""Hey, when is simply a good time for BOTH of us?"" This makes it seem a lot more down to earth and reciprocal sounding to your employers and especially towards your friends/acquaintances. 

I'm open to any other alternatives that may be polite, or y'all can argue about the argument itself."
0,2022-10-06,CMV: The method through which patriarchy replicates itself is rooted in sex.,u/Philosoferking,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xxd79v/cmv_the_method_through_which_patriarchy/,changemyview,"This is my own theory. It's about patriarchy and how it replicates itself and keeps itself strong in the hearts and minds of men.

Nothing I say here is me saying it's a fact of reality. It is only a fact insofar as patriarchy as a system of thought embedded into our minds, believes things. Patriarchy seems to have it's own bizarre beliefs and basically what I'm trying to do is explain what I believe to be what patriarchy believes. In this sense I am anthropomorphizing patriarchy as if it is a living conscious thing. Obviously it is not. But it's just easier to explain it like this.

Here we go:

Growing up as boys our behavior is policed. We are taught to reject femininity in all forms unless we are having sex with a female person. That is the only acceptable way for boys to act, under patriarchy's toxic masculinity rules.

The reason the rules are as such, is because patriarchy (anthropomorphized) believes that women are repulsed by femininity in men.

That a man who displays ""feminine traits"" is ruining his attractiveness in the eyes of women.

So we are conditioned from a young age to seek that which women are (supposedly) attracted to.

This means the utter rejection of femininity in every way and anything associated with the genders girl and woman.

Empathy for girls and women is not allowed for example. Only sex with them is allowed.

And so the patriarchy goes on replicating itself by policing young boys behavior.

But it's all rooted in the battle for mating. It's all sexual reproduction at the root. Males want to know how to attract females. We are taught how since a young age. The patriarchy teaches us to be ""real men"" so that we can learn to be sexually successful with women.

It is not good to exhibit traits which contradict that. Gay men for example, are some of the worst offenders in the eyes of patriarchy.

Why is it that under patriarchy's rules, we can't let men become something which is supposedly not sexually attractive to women? I'm not sure why to be honest.

I feel like it's rooted in this belief that, ultimately, what women truly want, is those few men who are at the top of the pyramid. Again, I am saying this is a belief, not a fact. I fear to say things lest they be misinterpreted as me saying it's fact that women only want the top 1% or 20% or w/e of men. I'm not. I'm saying this is what we all are taught to believe deep down.

Those masculine manly men would get all the women, if men start embracing anything having to do with femininity, than they will cease to be attractive. Thus. A large portion of men would become incrls 

Essentially, it's all in order to prevent a violent beta male revolution.

I think it's rooted in our beliefs about science and animal behavior. But prior to science, patriarchy had different methods for replicating itself.

But these days we see that in the animal kingdom, most male animals do not reproduce.

I think that to some degree people understand that, even if not explicitly.

And morality dictates that this kind of sexual dynamic between men and women is very amoral.

The patriarchy uses this to replicate itself and tell men how to control women's sexuality. The first step is to become what women supposedly want. ""Real men."" The second is the reject all behaviors which women do not want. Femininity. This ensures an even distribution of sexual access to women, across the entire population of men.

In the past I suppose marriage fulfilled this purpose?

So yea there's my crazy theory. I don't know what the actual truth is. I'm down to change the way I see it. I just have no way to do so without sharing it. But if I share it people get mad. But nobody really corrects me they just get mad and downvote me.

How to change my view? I don't know. Explain to me how patriarchy replicates itself actually. Like what do the high level intellectuals and scientists and feminist say about the way patriarchy replicates itself? That is what I want to know and I can't see it right now because I don't know what exactly to read or learn in oder to understand how it works 

I'm open to reading resources given. I'd love to read some book or whatever that explains it all."

First of all, many of them try to absolve all responsibility for Hitler's rise to power by saying ""hurr durr Hitler was not democratically elected because he was appointed by Hindenburg!!! The Nazis never won a majority of the popular vote!!!""

This ignores the fact that parties almost never reach a majority of the popular vote in a multiparty, parliamentary system.

And Hitler was only appointed by Hindenburg because his party enjoyed an enormous amount of popular support among the German populace. It's not like Hitler was just some random guy Hindenburg decided to appoint for no reason.

EDIT: Before you bring up ""hurr durr Treaty of Versailles,"" remember that only happened because the Germans implemented the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk first, which was far, far, far more harsh. 

Election turnout for the past three decades in Germany has been consistently at 70%-80%. No party since the reunification of Germany has ever gotten more than 44% of the popular vote and most have not gotten anywhere near the Nazi Party's 37.3% in what was the second to last free and fair election in 1930's Germany. NONE of the German elections in the past 30 years have had higher turnout than the first one where the Nazis won a plurality in 1932 (84.1%!). If the Nazis were not democratically elected, going by that exact same logic, no recent German party nor head of state has ever been democratically elected. Germany is therefore not a democracy (nor are most European countries for that matter).

Everyone in the Third Reich knew about the Holocaust and not only did virtually no one do anything about it, but many, many people outright *supported* it. Read *Hitler's Willing Executioners* to read about how the many, many ordinary Germans who enthusiastically participated in The Holocaust.

Yet people always say ""*Hitler* killed 6 million Jews"" as if no one else had anything to do with that. Many don't even say ""the *Nazis* killed 6 million Jews."" Just Hitler. People say frequently ""*the Americans* enslaved millions of black people,"" ""*the British* looted India,"" etc., but never ""*the Germans* killed 6 million Jews.""

*The Germans* killed 6 million Jews. Start saying that.

And many of them try to resort to whataboutism. ""Hurr durr what about America's genocide of Native Americans!!!"" while ignoring that this is not comparable at all to what the Germans did.

Although there were some instances of mass killings, \~90% of Native American deaths were due to diseases they weren't immune to. These deaths were not intentional and it's not the fault of the settlers that the Native Americans weren't immune to the diseases they carried. And the Native American population was decimated over the course of ***2 centuries.***

On the flip side, the Germans ***intentionally*** exterminated the vast majority of European Jewry in ***just 4 years***.

Another ""whataboutism"" they peddle is ""hurr durr Churchill's 'Bengal Famine Genocide'!!!"" But Churchill had virtually nothing to do with the Bengal Famine: [https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/december-2020/churchill-and-the-genocide-myth/](https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/december-2020/churchill-and-the-genocide-myth/)

Yes, other countries did commit atrocities, but the key difference is how they were conducted. The USSR's atrocities were carried out on the orders of Stalin and only the top brass of the government/military participated in these crimes.

Hitler ordered the Holocaust, sure, but ***hundreds of thousands***, by some estimates 1 million+ ordinary people, ***volunteered*** to participate in killing Jews. The Nazis enjoyed widespread, overwhelming popular support and ordinary people actively enabled Hitler's atrocities in an outrageous manner. There is no other atrocity in history that was so widely enabled and encouraged by the ""ordinary"" people of the country in question.

I'm talking about the Germans of the 1930's/1940's, not the Germans of today."

45,2022-10-07,CMV: People shouldn’t ever celebrate vigilante justice,u/L1ggy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xxvxoh/cmv_people_shouldnt_ever_celebrate_vigilante/,changemyview,"I think that the internet has a problem with people disrespecting systems that are in place to enact justice, and immorally applauding vigilante justice. Every time a post is made on social media about someone, for example, killing the alleged murderer or rapist of their loved ones the comments are cheering on their vigilante justice and I think this is a problem. 

To be clear, I’m not saying that the revenge was or wasn’t deserved in any particular case. My reasons to believe that vigilante justice shouldn’t ever be celebrated are as follows:

I believe that crimes are equal in immorality regardless of the relationship between perpetrator and victim. The murder of a rapist or a murderer shouldn’t be judged any less severely than that of, say, an innocent child.

While I do believe that rehabilitation is one of the purposes of punitive systems, their primary purpose is, and should be, punishment. This point is made to address comments like

*“‘""\[...\] got off with only 5 years probation.’ The judge believed that sending Gary to jail would benefit no one and he was unlikely to commit another crime. The judge was right too, he didn't hurt anyone after this.”*

I don’t think that whether someone will or won’t commit crime again is the only factor that should go into consideration when deciding their punishment. Regardless of their motivations, one who has access to a government that enforces the law, and rather than relying on those systems chooses to kill another person, is a murderer like any other.

Any form of vigilante justice undermines the judicial systems already in place. If you wish to be protected by the law, then it is up to the law, and not you, to decide who is and isn’t guilty and how they should be prosecuted.

Internet comments on topics like this are often emotionally driven, with little thought put into them, but that doesn’t change the fact that support of vigilante justice is often the prevailing sentiment, and that that is harmful. Vigilante justice undermines the foundation of the sound and reasonably reliable judicial systems of the developed world. It can very easily lead to the death of innocent people, and even if only the guilty are killed, that can hardly be called justice. I can empathize with how an emotionally driven immediate response may be supporting a person taking revenge on the alleged perpetrator of an egregious act on them or their loved ones, but such support is inevitably supporting murderers and other criminals who are hardly better than the people they seek revenge on."

The abusive user and post appeared to my username as ‘deleted’ in the period during which I was writing my response, but on logging out, I could see that their abusive post was not deleted and was still publicly viewable. This creates the impression that I had not cared to respond to the false narrative and gaslighting victimhood that the abusive user was deploying.
I then tested a response using another account, but although it’s visible from that account, it’s not publicly viewable.

This basically means that different users see different perspectives depending on how the mods curate and manipulate the platform.

I.E. Reddit at its worst is no better than the micro-targeting of different election messages to different voters, or an authoritarian state run on controlled propaganda.

Edit: ~~OK losers, this was all just one huge troll.~~ ~~Seriously though, thanks for participating in this experiment~~ Seriously, seriously though some great feedback on my style with respect to issues such the female/woman issue and the challenges relating to the perceptions caused by the lack of a more delicate approach toward it from me.

On the core issue of echo chambers, it appears that for me, the main antagonising factors are the following:
1. Someone can respond then perform a user block that makes their response visible to Reddit, but not to me.
2. I can go to the effort of providing detailed real world advice based on experience and/or education, but the advice (however good or bad) can be silently deleted by mods, whilst leaving it visible to me as if it hadn’t been removed.

It’s not my tent and not my circus, it just means Reddit is probably better as a view-only platform for me, at least for issues of any societal or political sensitivity, or where I’m trying to break down barriers and misconceptions without accepting why those barriers have come to exist.

Again, thanks for all your input, and hopefully no hard feelings or resentment from anyone feeling aggrieved by any lack of sensitivity on my part. Best regards to all, and I’ll add some further delta updates a bit later."

They shouldn't have to invest time and reasources into your issues.

Also, most people are not trained mental health specialists. Getting support from someone who isn't properly trained may result in unhealthy coping mechanisms, and the promotion of improper thoughts. You wouldn't go to your aunt about a medical issue if they aren't trained, why is mental health any different? long story short, the only things you should say to someone who comes to you with something like that are ""I am not a therapist"" and ""get a therapist""."

If feel with so many established systems and wealth, existing years before we were all born and all structured to prevent change... It's completely understandable to struggle even getting out of bed in the morning.


Incremental change may not even be possible now inequality has scaled to such extremes and a full on revolution like was seen in 1789-1799 just couldn't happen today. Hong Kong tried for what must be considered basic representation and failed.


How can such large systems of power and such well established ruling families be changed now?

Edit: clarified revolution dates

Edit #2: Wow ok, so to be clear:

I am not depressed. I do know some who are and completely understand why. I think it's a completely reasonable reaction to how things are in the world right now.

And yes, quality of life has improved for humans over time, that is not in question.

The issue was with established systems ensuring inequality, and channeling resources and effort away from majority of people and towards a select few. That's never been worse.

Delta #1: While I still feel the systems are impervious, delta was related to how important it is to stay connected to what would be important to you even if these systems were changed, and how not losing sight of the important stuff may help drive us towards a solution.

Edit #3 / Delta #2: Some really delusional people ITT, but thanks to the data informed Redditor that posted stats on inequality changes over the last 100 years, showing the gap has only been widening the last 40 or so in many western democracies.  While the trend is terrifying, it does give some comfort to know that we might find ourselves with access to new thinking or technologies to turn the trend.

It's a slim hope, but it's hope none the less. Big thanks again to delta #1 who put me into Christopher Lasch, and the one who talked about the rule of 3's."

No one is 100% straight or gay. There will always be exceptions to the rule which will break the binary. In the case with bisexual people, the spectrum also exists and is vast; you have some people who are basically 50/50 in terms of homo\~hetero attraction as well some who are predominately attracted to the opposite or same sex in unique ratios (60/40, 70/30, etc.).
* In addition to this diversity, of course, the attraction can be different depending on the type: romantic or sexual. However when using [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/18/bisexual-adults-are-far-less-likely-than-gay-men-and-lesbians-to-be-out-to-the-people-in-their-lives/) study that showcases over 80% of self-identified bisexual people are in heterosexual relationships and not even 15% are in homosexual relationships, it showcases a huge disparity and hints towards one of two options: a) a heavy preference towards heterosexual relationships b) most self-identified bisexual people are vastly if not completely heterosexual in terms of at least romantic attraction if not also sexual attraction, or basically heterosexual in both romantic and sexual attraction and just homosexual in terms of sexual attraction to varying degrees, or c) both
* Under the assumption most if not all bisexual people have a 50/50 attraction in at least romantic attraction if not also sexual attraction, the data above still indicates a heavy preference for heterosexual relationships.
* Under the more realistic presumption that bisexuality has more of a spectrum in terms of ratios of preferences, including but not limited to quasi-50/50 attractions) and also including people who favour heterosexual and homosexual encounters, it favours the argument more of heterosexual preferences and a bias against homosexual preferences.

Typical arguments against the data pointing towards a preference of heterosexuality:

**Convenience/Availability:**

This is an explanation I often see to argue against the data above; that it’s just “convenience” and a “coincidence”, but I really don’t think that explains anything decently whatsoever. Convenience can be part of the answer yes, but not even remotely mostly explaining the answer. First, one’s preference isn’t dictated by the stock available to you. Using myself as ane xample, I am a “self identified” gay man who is technically bisexual. I live in an area where it’s substantially easier to date women than men, but this doesn’t change my preference of wanting to be with another man above all else compared to a woman, nor resorting to dating a woman just because of lower stock of men in comparison. Preference in general does not suddenly adhere to the stock available to you.

Second, if you are self-identifying as bisexual and participating in such a study like this about your experiences, it is safe to say you are *likely* (read: likely =/= are) in a place that is more accepting of queer people and subsequently more accessibility to other queer people compared to someone in a more conservative area who likely doesn’t have the environment or support group to even come to terms with identifying as bisexual, let alone be brave enough to participate in such a study to begin with.

Third, if convenience is to be argued, then most gay men and women would still end up with opposite-sex partners even after realising they are gay as there is no such thing as a 100% straight or homosexual person, and particularly even more so when even within the “binary” sexualities such as homosexuality there is a spectrum of attraction (such as heteroflexible).

**Biphobia**

Biphobia does exist in both communities, however historically in heterosexual environments there has been substantially more oppression and harm done to queer people compared to within own queer communities, meaning that the notion of biphobia turning bisexual people off in general to homosexual relationships as if heterosexual people on average are more accepting is a folly one.

**Comp-heteronormativity:**

This is really the only legitimate argument I’ve found to explain the data. Comp-heteronormativity is a real thing that even gay people experience and I imagine it’s tougher for a bisexual person to deal with in some respects considering the split attraction and the ability to authentically perform it to some degree, unlike a gay person. Either way, this still shows a preference and a bias against homosexual ones.

End note:

1. None of the data is to say such bisexual people aren’t really bisexual, that they’re choosing to be straight etc. None of this is an attack on bisexual people either.  The expectation of a bisexual person seems to be founded upon heterosexuality first and foremost and homosexuality seems to be auxiliary or an accessory to a typical bisexual person’s sexuality.
2. First, I’d like to say this topic isn’t about anyone who is *technically* bisexual, but self identifies as such"

I say we send the National Guard to escort NYC gun permit holders like they did the Little Rock Nine, if that’s what it takes for them to be able to legally carry a firearm in public places other then legitimately sensitive spots like courtrooms and airports.

If you didn’t know, NY’s governor didn’t like the SCOTUS decision declaring NYC’s unconstitutional gun control law unconstitutional, so now NYC has to actually give qualified applicants a gun permit. So she is playing games by essentially declaring 99% of the city a “sensitive area” where guns aren’t allowed.

This is about the Constitution, the SCOTUS and federal authority, *not* how you personally feel about firearms ownership. CMV with a constitutional argument, if you can. 🤷"
2,2022-10-08,CMV: Straight couples on average have to settle for less,u/AriValentina,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xyx6hu/cmv_straight_couples_on_average_have_to_settle/,changemyview,"I write this with **very little** experience in being apart of a straight couple. I dated the opposite sex **once** in high school for a couple months and I've been openly gay ever since that ended. Most of my assumptions are coming from things I've heard straight people say either in person or on the internet. So this view could very much be something you agree with and I'm more than welcome to consider favoring your view, this really isn't any of my business anyway.

So firstly, I believe there is a very blatant gender war. Straight men complaining about women, rather its trying to control them, complaining that they are protesting about something, trying to out do them in ""who has more problems"", etc. Then we have the straight women complaining about men, about their sexism, the way they act, their morals, etc. The conversation always ends in ""I hate men"" or ""women suck but we need them"" but then you look at these people and they are happily married to the exact group of people they are complaining about. And no im not saying they should ""turn gay/lesbian"" because obviously thats not a thing. The only option is to either be single or settle for less.

As a gay guy, I can admit men can suck and I can admit women can suck, but I don't make it a competition like some of the people that I see. I literally see straight men trying to put women down purposely (FOR BEING A WOMAN) but they also are attracted to women so im just like...Thats really weird dude. I just really do not get it at all and its low-key scary to think about. Correct me if im wrong but I always see straight guys calling themselves alpha and what not and calling other males beta (lol) so wouldn't an alpha male be protecting women instead of trying to put them down?

And then there's the whole thing where men are like ""Feminist are attacking men so how long do you think we can just sit quiet?"" One, feminist can be any gender. Two, feminist fight for equal rights for all sexes. Therefore whatever ""feminist"" you saw that was attacking men isn't a feminist, they are just using that name or you just named them that because you thought thats what a feminist was.

I don't have too much to say about this topic; it seems to me that my view should be the default. There are more residents of DC than Wyoming and Vermont, yet those two states get two senators and a representative in the federal government, while DC has roughly no representation. Why is this considered acceptable? It seems to me that the only real underlying objection to granting DC statehood is that they would overwhelmingly vote Democrat. But depriving people of representation just because their views are liberal seems to be an absurd reason.

EDIT: I keep getting responses suggesting retrocession. Retrocession is a very strange suggestion. I understand that DC used to be part of MD. That was roughly a quarter of a millennium ago. DC is historically, culturally and legally distinct from Maryland. Puerto Rico and Florida both used to be Spanish territory, but I doubt anyway would seriously contend that Puerto Rico would be adequately represented in the Senate if they were merged with Florida. 

Retrocession is just a weird Republican suggestion that amounts to saying, ""DC should only have representation if that representation is legally meaningless."" Advocating for retrocession is like arguing in favor of gerrymandering."

Currently only 19 states allow this, and I see no reason for the government to continue restricting people in something as personal as who they can and cannot marry. I am going to assume banning people from getting married decreases their likelihood of having kids together, even if by less than it once did. But if it doesn’t, this just means banning cousin marriage makes even less sense.

Contrary to popular belief cousin marriage does not cause rampant birth defects. This is just a very pervasive misconception. Sources are at the bottom, but while the risk of birth defects is increased it is not greatly increased. You might hear that it is “doubled” but a doubling from e.g. 2% to 4% is not significant. Children born to mothers over 35-40 are at an increased risk for birth defects of a similar magnitude and they are not banned from getting married. 

Therefore, the only reason to outlaw cousin marriage is to discourage multiple generations of inbreeding and the effect it has on the population. This causes serious problems in some places of the world like Pakistan where cousin marriage is widespread.

But in the United States, this just isn’t an issue. Cousin marriage in the states where it is legal is still very, very rare. There are no communities that are insular enough for cousin marriage to be a problem.

The small increase in birth defects is just not enough to justify telling people they can’t marry or have kids with who they love. If it was and we truly believed this, it would not be limited to first cousins and we would start imposing a maximum age of marriage for women, or start testing marriage seekers for genetic diseases. 

It is my view that cousin marriage is just so taboo that it is rarely questioned and is only illegal today because people are disgusted by it. I think in order to restrict someone’s liberties including who they can marry there must be a serious threat to other people and I do not see this in cousin marriage, at least in the United States. Therefore it should not be illegal. 

But since my view seems to be in the minority by… a lot… I thought I would post here to see if there are arguments I am missing. To change my view you would have to either convince me the studies are wrong, that the increase in birth defects is actually more important than I think it is, or that there are extremely insular populations in the United States for which it is necessary that the state discourages inbreeding. Or of course something else entirely I haven’t thought of.

0,2022-10-08,CMV: The way ridesharing apps allow drivers to select rides is stupid. They shouldn't get to choose if they're in the area.,u/TheFakeChiefKeef,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xz3664/cmv_the_way_ridesharing_apps_allow_drivers_to/,changemyview,"Hi all, 

I'm not sure if the money just isn't worth it for drivers anymore, which very well may be true, so I really am not coming at this from the perspective that the drivers are at fault.

Recently, I have been having a really hard time getting Ubers and Lyfts (just going to say ""rides"" or ""ride"") within a reasonable time frame from when I request a ride. I live on the outer edge of a large US city, in a neighborhood with a lot of traffic on a main throughway. Basically, there's no reason it should be so hard to get a ride because I know there are drivers around. 

Basically, where I used to be able to get a ride within 10 minutes, it now takes upward of 20 minutes between requesting a ride and the driver showing up. Just the other day, I had two drivers cancel on me in the 10 or so minutes after taking my ride, making me late to where I was going. Last week, I used Lyft's priority function and paid an extra $20 for fast pickup, but I still couldn't get a car for almost half an hour (I was refunded the difference with no trouble thankfully). I also ordered UberEats once last week from a restaurant like 10 minutes away, but nobody picked up my order and I had to go get it myself.

My view is that this is a problem stemming from how drivers can choose not to take rides while they are ""on the clock"" for lack of a better phrase. 

The way I understand it, when the passenger requests a ride or orders food, drivers in the area get an alert and they can choose whether or not to take it. This seems wrong to me. If a driver has logged into the app and is taking rides, they shouldn't have much of a say whether or not to take a ride in their area. The app should assign the driver rides based on location, and the drivers should be docked ""points"" if they reject too many rides for no good reason. 

Like, of course, I understand if a driver isn't able to take someone an hour away. I also understand that gas is expensive, and drivers are not compensated as well as they should be. But just because that's currently the business model doesn't mean it's right. 

My proposed solution would be something like this:

1. Drivers log into the app and say they're taking rides, marking themselves as ""available"" for a set period of time as if they are on the clock in a normal hourly job.

2. The apps assign rides to each driver based on location and demand. The driver cannot choose to reject the ride if they've marked themself available unless the ride would inevitably require them to drive in excess of their stated availability. Drivers not currently driving are assigned rides first unless there is nobody in the area not currently driving a passenger.

3. Once the driver has been assigned a ride, they cannot cancel barring an emergency. The rideshare companies institute an internal appeals process for drivers who are docked ""points"" because they cancelled in an emergency. 

4. If a driver is docked too many ""points"", they are either locked out of the respective app or forfeit a percentage of their earnings until they complete a certain number of trips or food orders without cancelling.

I'm happy to debate about the specific parts of my proposal, but I'm more focused on the general issue here. I know the proposal isn't perfect at all and may be unnecessarily harsh. 

Rideshare drivers should be making more money. It's wild that the companies are able to operate at a loss and pay limited to no taxes while their execs are making huge bucks. But that doesn't excuse the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the business model.

And I also understand that this system is not perfect for suburban areas. But ultimately, limited driver availability should be known to passengers. If I'm in a big city and I need to be driven somewhere 30 minutes away, I should be able to call my ride 45 minutes ahead of time and get to my destination on time or almost on time. 

Change my view."
0,2022-10-08,CMV: The plight of Native Americans was not even close to being as bad as the Holocaust,u/Weightlossseeker30,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xz3rg9/cmv_the_plight_of_native_americans_was_not_even/,changemyview,"\*\*\*\*\***NOTE**: Please don’t respond with something along the lines of “there is no need for an ‘Oppression Olympics,’ both were bad.” Obviously both were extremely bad and they were such different events that they cannot be directly compared. The purpose of this post is to respond to those who *do* directly compare them and allege that treatment of Natives was as bad, if not even worse. I can’t be the only one who encounters these types on the internet all the time, right?

It is commonly alleged that America is the most evil country in history, and that Americans are unaware of their utterly nefarious past and present, in contrast to supremely enlightened Europeans. They claim Americans to be the most self-centered people in existence (despite the fact that Russians literally refer to WWII as the ""Great Patriotic War"" despite Joe Stalin himself admitting they could not have won the war without American Lend-Lease lol).

Anyways, I have seen countless instances of the ""hurr durr America bad"" crowd peddling an idea that equates the Native American Genocide with the Holocaust, or even implies the former was worse than the latter (usually because “there are far more Jews remaining than Natives”). At the very least, they seem to imply that the genocide of Native Americans and the Holocaust were equally evil and that the latter gets more recognition only because its victims were predominately “white.” In my opinion, this idea is utterly preposterous. As far as I am concerned, the genocide of Native Americans was not even close to being as nefarious as the Holocaust, and I would appreciate if other people could try to convince me otherwise in the response section below. First, I would like you to read my reasoning:

The main argument people use to support the idea that the Native American Genocide was as bad or worse than the Holocaust is that the Natives, unlike Jews, were almost entirely wiped out. There are plenty of Jews, but almost no Natives left. But this is not exactly true. Jews were almost completely eradicated in areas the Third Reich occupied, and ⅔ of European Jews were killed overall. There are almost 7 million Natives in America, and only 1.4 million Jews in Europe (of course, a higher percentage of Natives died).

However, the most hideous enemy of Natives was not the settlers and their weaponry, but the invisible killers which those people brought in their blood and breath. Up to 90 percent of all Native American deaths resulted from the spread of highly contagious diseases to which they had no immunity. Most of the Natives who died were killed ***unintentionally***. It is not the fault of the settlers that the Natives weren’t immune to the diseases they carried. There were several cases of intentional killings, and even some cases of settlers intentionally giving Natives diseases, but these incidences are a drop in the bucket compared to the overall Native deaths. There was never any state sanctioned policy to wipe out every last Native American off the face of the Earth. Many settlers loved their Native brethren and fought for their protection. Not every one was hostile. And there were also some cases of Natives engaging in mass killings against settlers. In fact, I don’t think it was just “some,” weren’t there *many* instances of Natives engaging in mass killings against settlers? There were many cases of settlers wanting to live in peace with Natives only for the Natives to respond with mass murder. Despite the conflict often being portrayed this way, not every Native was an innocent angel who just wanted peace with the nefarious, bloodthirsty settlers. The conflict was a lot more nuanced and there were nefarious players on both sides. Anyway, it is estimated that Native deaths totaled roughly 55 million. Of those, \~90%, or 49.5 million, were from diseases. The other \~5.5 million deaths happened for a wide variety of reasons. Most of them probably had nothing to do with settlers. But even if the settlers were responsible for *every single* non-disease Native death (which is impossible), that means at the most \~5.5 million were killed over the course of ***2+ centuries***.

The Nazi Regime, with the help of millions of volunteers from Germany and German-occupied territories, made it their mission to exterminate *every single Jew*. And not just from the Third Reich either. Towards the end of the war, the Nazis even devised plans to exterminate all Jews *outside the Third Reich*. Nazi officials urged their Japanese allies to kill all Jews in their territory and had agents compile lists of Jews in places as far away as fucking Australia and Canada! The Nazis made plans to invade what is now Israel *with the sole purpose of* killing all the Jews that were moving there en masse. Jews were ***intentionally*** killed through firing squad, enslavement to the point of death, gassings, etc. ***In just 4 years (1941-1945),*** Jews were almost eradicated from Europe.

**WHAT HAPPENED TO NATIVES** ***UNINTENTIONALLY*** **OVER THE COURSE OF OVER 2 CENTURIES HAPPENED TO JEWS INTENTIONALLY OVER THE COURSE OF 4 YEARS !!!**

And many cases of Native killings were a result of Natives killing settlers first. In contrast, Jews did absolutely nothing to the Germans.

America receives substantially less criticism for its treatment of Natives simply because it was substantially less nefarious than Germany’s treatment of Jews. It’s not even close whatsoever. Both were absolutely terrible and should be acknowledged more, though."

If it is morally wrong to force someone to exist then it should be morally wrong to force someone to be nonexistent since you are also violating someone’s right to choose. this would mean if an antinatalist was consistent then they would think that abortion is wrong.

You could make the argument that an abortion is correcting the original violation of someone’s right to choose.But this doesn’t make any sense.If a women got pregnant and then gave birth they only violated the child’s rights once.But if a women got pregnant then got an abortion they violated the child’s rights twice."

I believe the PS5/Xbox X are the ""last"" console generation. So far every 6/7 years for around the last 40 years a set of new consoles had come out that greatly expands what kinds of games can be created. I believe that the PS5 generation of consoles is the end of the line so to speak of this system. I believe the consoles will last at least 20 years if not more without a ""PS6"" or ""Xbox 720"". Btw I'm ignoring Nintendo for this because they kind of do their own thing. The main reason for this is that technology is just progressing much slower then before, in the 80s, 90s and 00s computational technology was advancing by leaps and bounds, practically every other year processing power straight up doubled.

Compare the kinds of games that were possible on the PlayStation (1995) to the PS2 (2000). It's a HUGE gap, same for the PS2 to the PS3 (2006). Another HUGE gap. This was possible because of this rapid development. But Moore's law is dead now and has been for over 10 years. These days it takes billions upon billions to find even slight advancements and we're essentially at the limit for how fast we can make computer chips. The PS5 generation of consoles are basically high end gaming PCs now, they have more RAM then devs know what to do with, near endless processing power and graphics that may as well be reality. There's simply no need for any more consoles since the current generation can provide everything the developers could possibly need and magnitudes more. Maybe they'll be VR generations in the future but as far as controller in hand traditional gaming consoles, the PS5/Xbox X is the end of the line. CMV"

A common pattern was that many politicians who run President Bolsonaro's anti-lockdown policies were elected (notably former Health Minister General Pazuello was the most voted congressmen of my state). Of the 20 cities with the most deaths per capta, 17 voted for Bolsonaro for President. 

I am liberal and pro-science. I of course lament most of what happened with covid in most places, including Brazil. But I came to the conclusion that Bolsonaro at least had a better grasp of what was Brazilian society trade-off between civil liberties and public health than I did.

To me it's reasonable to think that democracies can choose the path of ""I understand and I wish to continue"". Here's my game plan if I were running a country like Brazil (but could be America or any federalist country):

-Leave all lockdown choices to the states
-Make a public campaign explaining the risks people are choosing and saying my opinion ""I'd stay at home""
-Support financially the people who choose to isolate, regardless of what the society choose
-Create sanitation rules for workers

I understand the burdens this can create to the health system and things don't need to be binary. If the system is too overloaded or the pandemic is too high, you can decrease civil liberties accordingly, but aware of the trade-offs of the citizens."

**AAA Games should be rated more like blockbuster movies where it is far rarer to get an average rating of 8.5/10+.**

On sites like Metacritic it is fairly common to see big movies get review scores below 8/10, often below 7/10.  Sometimes a big movie comes along that gets a very high review score but these are not the norm. By comparison, big AAA video games that are not completely broken almost always get 7+ with many games getting 8.5+. This creates a problem.

If the bar for a mediocre AAA video game is 7/10, then you realistically only have 4 numbers on the scale (7,8,9,10) to discern where most AAA video games land in terms of quality.  This makes the review scale less useful since there are fewer numbers available for most games that people are thinking about buying.

I think games would benefit from a lower average review score since review scores would become more useful."

The acronym for the various communities is now so long and cumbersome it’s becoming incomprehensible - even to those in our communities, let alone anyone else.

I wish a happy life for every member of every letter, but as a collective term it’s oddly specific for a signifier of diversity and fluidity. It’s also a very cumbersome thing to say, and in language terms it’s not nailing it anymore. (All that being said - I don’t have an alternative answer myself, so am open to suggestions there too.)

EDIT: Just a quick note from me to say thank you for being so thoughtful and insightful in your responses to my first ever (ta-da!) CMV. I learnt a lot. And yes, I would say my view has changed in many ways. Top insights were that while cumbersome and complex, it’s a useful tool to explain the letters and what they mean and for whom. Secondly, that it seems to be the intent behind it that’s important, not the specific components. (And thirdly that you can pose questions like this online and actually get polite, considerate, and inspired replies. Thanks Reddit!)

Oh, and thank you also to those who also called out that it’s an initialism rather than an acronym. You are correct. I just figured the latter would be easier for people to ‘get’. Sorry if that’s caused confusion (but the point of the post remains the same)."

0,2022-10-09,CMV: The US has too many arbitrary federal holidays.,u/Johnnyphi1-618,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xzlj43/cmv_the_us_has_too_many_arbitrary_federal_holidays/,changemyview,"When I say federal holidays, I mean these 11 holidays. I’m not talking about things “National Coffee Day” or other holidays. I direct my attention to these holidays because they have (at least in my mind) the highest distinction. Service members, federal employees and most financial institutions employees not performing critical functions get these days off. Other employers usually only observe a handful of these.

First, 

1.	What I am not saying

1.1.	I’m not saying we should eliminate all Federal Holidays. At a minimum New Year’s, July 4th, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are widely celebrated and valued across the US and should always be Federal Holidays. Some of the other Federal Holidays have a good case to keep their status albeit dependent on any subsequent changes.

1.2.	I’m not saying we should reduce the # of Federal Holidays. It just seems politically infeasible. 

2.	What I would like

2.1.	Cap the # of Holidays, perhaps to the current #, 11. If we keep adding Federal Holidays and we won’t cancel them (1.2), where does it end?

2.2.	Add some and eliminate others. I’m not tied to anything specifically. I would much rather have Halloween off than Columbus Day for example or the Day after the Super Bowl for that matter. Or perhaps we should take the first Monday of every other Month off and call it Spring or whatever season Holiday?

Notice two things about my claim- there are both too many and too arbitrary. The way I see it you can convince me on either point, but I suspect you’ll probably have better luck with the number. There is a lot of research that shows productivity gains when people take time off. Does this apply to Holidays? Obviously, this has got to have its limits? Do other productive countries have more Holidays where a large portion  of people take off from work?

I suspect you’ll have a much more difficult time with the arbitrariness of the Holidays. The way I see it if you want to convince me that our current list of Federal Holidays are not arbitrary, you’ll have to argue that in defense of all the Holidays and that they are all more important than any other person or cause that I can possibly imagine that isn’t yet a current holiday- Halloween, Valentine’s Day, Frederick Douglas, the Suffrage Movement, the Super Bowl,  Earth Day, Rosa Parks, Caesar Chavez, Mother’s/Father’s Day, Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin, D-Day, V.E. Day, V.J. Day, …. I can go on.

 The specifics of any one Holiday are the subject for another CMV, but I will say that Columbus Day is a prime example. For all the back and forth about Columbus (his navigation skills, how he treated Native Americans, the lingering effects of legacy on Native Americans), I still can’t figure out why we celebrate him today in the first place. The most honest explanation I have read is that JFK thought it would improve his standing, especially with Italian voters, in the 1964 election (which he did not compete in btw because was assassinated shortly thereafter). Say what you will about Columbus but why not celebrate Amerigo Vesupucci? The best we can say is that he was the first European to publicly celebrate his\* discovery of the Americas and share that knowledge with the rest of Europe. The Vikings apparently beat him there so he wasn’t the first European, not to mention the millions of Native Americans who already lived there were fully aware of its existence – so please don’t respond with “He discovered America” crap. 

Why not make Halloween a Federal Holiday- it appears more people celebrate it. Columbus Day sneaks up on people, they forget about it, and maybe create a last-minute plan if they are fortunate enough to have the day off. I’ve yet to see parades or family get-togethers for Columbus Day that have anything to do with Columbus at least. Or how about make Mother’s Day a Federal Holiday? Isn’t your mom more important than Columbus?

Other Holidays also feel arbitrary to me too- President’s Day, Labor Day. Some Holidays feel very closely related too (can we eliminate one or the other)? 

I’m not tied to a specific set of Holidays being eliminated, even Columbus. My claim is there are too many and too arbitrary. My suggestion is: cap the #, replace some (prime example is Columbus).

And if you didn’t realize it yet, tomorrow  is Columbus Day, so Happy Columbus Day!"

Also, I wish all the best to women and genuinely do hope they reach equality in their country. It’s pretty clear they are being harshly oppressed for their sex.
That said, men have been dying in war and protest in far disproportionate numbers. This article https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63047363 says...

&gt;Iran Human Rights said it had recorded the deaths of 76 protesters across 14 provinces as of Monday, including six women and four children, although it warned that restrictions on the internet were causing delays in reporting.

Also articles like this https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/irans-protests-are-the-first-counterrevolution-led-by-women “Iran’s Protests are the First Countrer-revolution led by women” or this https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/opinion/iran-protests-women.html “How the US Can Help Support the Women of Iran Calling for Change” don’t appreciate the role men are playing or have played.

I never read about how men largely protect our freedoms. I do not recall a NYT article on appreciating the attributes of maleness when men killed Osama Bin Laden for instance.

It’s great that women are fighting for their freedoms and sad and unfortunate they’re dying. But men have been doing it forever and have been dying in far greater numbers. Men have also been fighting for bigger issues that are motivated by more than just self-interest.

It’s great women are fighting now that it affects them but let’s be real--they couldn’t be bothered to before, apparently.

Please change my view because it seems like this is just media “girl power” narrative. I’m eager to be wrong. If you provide some evidence women have substantively been leading these protests, I would change my view. What have women done that deserves the recognition of being leaders in this movement? Alternatively, providing articles from notable news outlets appreciating men that protect freedoms where their maleness is prominently emphasized would help change my view too."

305,2022-10-09,"CMV: Given that no ayatollahs or imams or Islamic scholars have come out as condemning what is going on in Iran, it is reasonable to assume that the events in Iran are representative of Islam",u/chocochipcookie99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xzxt52/cmv_given_that_no_ayatollahs_or_imams_or_islamic/,changemyview,"I have seen many anonymous Muslims online claiming that the actions undertaken by the Islamic Republic of Iran are not Islamic. 

There are different ways to determine what is Islamic and what is not. One way is to read the Quran and decide. I don't think this is a real option for atheists or other non-Muslims. If you don't believe in anything written in the Quran, this is going to color your perception of it, probably negatively. For example, I personally believe that the Quran does agree with what's happening in Iran, and this is one of the reasons why I am not Muslim. However, someone who is similar to me in most ways (in terms of political leanings and worldview etc) except that they are Muslim, will say the Quran does not agree. 

There are also many Muslims who say the Quran DOES agree with the various acts done by the Iranian government that are too vile for me to even repeat. An example of such Muslims are Ayatollah Khamenei, a well studied Islamic scholar. There are many other Islamic scholars supporting the regime. I haven't seen any speaking out against it. (I will award deltas if anyone finds a confirmed Islamic scholar actually condemning the regime). 

As an analogy, consider the doctors out there who are saying the COVID vaccine doesn't work. Some of these are real MD doctors. In the real world, many MD doctors have come out to speak against this and have made it their campaign to make it clear the vaccines are safe. If there were more MDs saying it's unsafe than safe, all of us would assume it's unsafe (or so I hope anyway). But the situation in this scenario is even worse than that. It would be like if there were only laypeople who have an interest in health but no formal education of any kind coming out and saying the vaccines are safe, while MDs are either silent on the issue or are saying vaccines are unsafe. We would ignore the laypeople who are coming out saying they've ""done their own research"" in favour of the expert, so why are we listening to lay Muslims that have ""done their research"" despite Islamic scholars saying something else?"

However with Russia being increasingly cornered and running out of options, along with the fact that they view these territories (especially Crimea) as being part of Russian soil, they will resort to nukes which could easily escalate the crisis into a full scale world war. It’s not an ideal scenario but when is the US and NATO going to realize it isn’t worth dying over a random Eastern European nation. This war needs to end ASAP and this “100% support to Ukraine” approach is only fast tracking us to Armageddon."

For the first trimester, abortion is allowed. Full stop. The fetus cannot feel pain and cannot respond to stimulus during this time, so it cannot be considered ""human"" enough for its life to be equal in value to the mother's. This would allow the use abortion as birth-control during this time.

Second Trimester, abortion is permitted in the case of rape or a life-threatening condition arising in either the baby or the mother. The baby is still not ""viable"", (i.e. it could live outside the womb) but it has begun to respond to stimuli, and so it is now close to being a full fledged ""human life"" than in the first trimester. The reasoning behind exceptions in the case of rape is that the mother here has been forced to carry this baby against her will, and so abortions due to rape should have a longer cutoff date than just the first trimester. It should be make crystal clear by doctors that past the 2nd tri., abortion due to rape with not be performed, as the potential mother will have had enough time to talk with family or therapists and make a decision by then.

Third Trimester, the only exception is in the case of a medical emergency, such as life-threatening mutations in the fetus, or because the mother has contracted an illness or sustained an injury that would make her or the baby likely to die if she carried it to term. If the mother wants to give birth regardless of the risks, then she may, but the hospital bears no blame if the mother or child die because of this."

That said, when I thought about confronting a family member who’s a pro-life activist and influencer about her beliefs, I realized how weak pro-choice rhetoric is when you really break it down. I actually don’t think my reasoning would resonate with her, or any pro-life people, at all. Some examples:

1. “No uterus, no opinion” / “Abortions are a women’s (or birthing person’s) issue.” 

I understand that the message here is that when the majority of lawmakers are cis men, why should they be regulating women’s (and other people who can give birth) bodies? Fair, but that rhetoric is essentially arguing that we need more female (and trans/cis people who can give birth) representation in our legislature. The argument that men can’t have an opinion on abortion is like saying that white people can’t have an opinion on Black Lives Matter or other racial issues. If men really truly believe that abortion is murder (as much as I disagree), then telling them they can’t be advocates in that conversation would be analogous to telling straight people they can’t advocate for LGBTQ+ rights as allies. 

Moreover, though I understand that men aren’t the ones giving birth and I would never want a male partner to be able to dictate my choice, I think it’s unfair to completely invalidate potential fathers’ feelings and thoughts on the abortion of their would-be child. 


2. Keep your Bible out of my body. 

Though it would be interesting to see numbers on this, I’m sure that a good number of pro-life people are not religious (though I’ll agree they’re not as visible in the pro-life movement as those who are).


3. It’s all about control over women’s bodies.

This is a tougher one for me. In many ways, I do think that it’s true that if we proposed regulating men’s bodies (i.e. via vasectomies or birth control) instead of women, then reproductive rights would look completely different. I understand that that’s what this common argument is getting at. However, I do think there are plenty of pro-life people who honestly believe that a fetus is a life. If they honestly and whole-heartedly believe that, then (I would hope) they would hold that same belief if it were men who gave birth.


4. Life starts at birth, not conception. 

Okay, I’m sure we all can find plenty of studies and scientific evidence that point in either direction; because this is ultimately more of a philosophical “what even is ‘life’” type of debate. So, science aside, let’s approach this through a legal lens. If a pregnant woman is murdered, the killer could be charged with a double homicide (for the mother and the baby). I think that’s a good thing, for the record. But doesn’t that then — in legal terms — acknowledge that unborn baby as a life? I understand the difference here is consent/choice of the mother, does it change that legal classification of unborn life? 


5. A fetus is just a clump of cells. 

There’s certainly widespread misinformation about fetuses and unborn babies in the pro-life community. However, even if they do have all the science right, if they truly believe that “clump of cells” is just as valuable as a fully grown human child or adult, then emphasizing biology won’t change that core belief that potential life = life.

I’m starting to feel like my pro-choice beliefs aren’t rooted in anything logically sound but rather the mere fact that I personally wouldn’t want a child anytime soon. Please CMV so I can feel more confident in the reasoning of my pro-choice beliefs!"

A person can take responsibility for the things they have done, but shouldn’t be held responsible for their collective identity.

The answer in my eyes is to look at individual merit. This is much more productive and much safer when in terms of history collectivist ideologies have almost always been part of the cause of oppressive regimes (Communism/Fascism).

Take immigration for example. It shouldn’t matter where a person comes from or their skin color. What should matter is whether they will benefit the host nation and if that country feels that they meet the qualifications necessary to receive citizenship."

0,2022-10-10,CMV: The Elon Musk Ukraine-Russia peace plan isn't that bad,u/Krenztor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y0db6m/cmv_the_elon_musk_ukrainerussia_peace_plan_isnt/,changemyview,"In case anyone isn't aware of what the Elon Musk peace plan is, I'm pasting it at the bottom of this post.

My initial reaction to reading Musk's peace plan was that I didn't care so much for the last point which is that Ukraine remains neutral.  I think that is just a recipe for Russia invading again like 3-5 years from now once they build their military back up.  So, not a perfect plan IMO, but I was really surprised at the backlash this plan got.

Part of why I don't mind this peace plan is that I don't suspect that the final outcome of this war is going to be a sweeping Ukrainian or Russian victory.  I think in the end there will be some negotiations, some give and take.  Regardless of which side you are hoping wins, I don't think you'll get your entire wish list of concessions from the other side when this is over.

With that in mind, the facts on the ground right now is that the Ukrainian military is the real deal when supported by substantial help from the west.  It seems like there is no reason to believe western support is ending, therefore Ukraine is not going to just get blown over by Russia at any point.  Russia for their part is still trying to get their feet under them with this mobilization which isn't going great, but could turn out to be effective 3-6 months from now.  Sanctions and wealthier, middle aged men fleeing Russia signal a lot of economic issues for Russia going ahead not to mention the challenges they face selling oil and gas.  All in all, Ukraine is winning the war right now and while their success may dwindle a bit going ahead, the long run still looks good for Ukraine.

I think the Musk peace plan reflects the facts on the ground and will likely prove to accurately reflect how this war ends if it goes on for another 2-3 years at the cost of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives.  Essentially his peace plan returns everything to the Feb 20 lines as there is practically no doubt after all of the atrocities and willingness of Russia to place poorly equip DNR/LPR soldiers on the front lines as cannon fodder that any elections held in Ukraine once all Ukrainian citizens are allowed to return to their homes will be overwhelmingly in support of Ukraine over Russia.  So all of the Russian ""annexations"" get reversed.

Russia holding Crimea is practically a certainty even if Ukraine continues to fight for years.  It is an extremely difficult piece of land to invade especially considering by the time Ukraine would be attempting it, Russia is likely already pushed out of the rest of Ukraine, so their entire military will be fighting to protect a fortress island.  They've already held this land since 2014 and I don't necessarily doubt that support for Russian annexation in this area is actually quite high.  I get that Ukraine doesn't want to give it up, but given that it is likely inevitable or would have an enormous cost to actually regain, it seems reasonable to me to grant this concession.

The one true concession in this peace plan that diverts from the Feb 20 situation is Ukraine giving water rights to Russia to Crimea.  I'm assuming that any water diverted from this man-made canal ends up being paid for by Russia, so it is sort of win-win.  Russia gets water, Ukraine gets money.  It would also lower the tensions going forward.

I want to stress that my CMV stance is that the Musk plan ""isn't that bad"".  I'm not claiming it is perfect, but I was just shocked by the amount of backlash that this plan got given that it seems pretty reasonable.

\----------------------------------

Ukraine-Russia Peace:

\- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

\- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

\- Water supply to Crimea assured.

\- Ukraine remains neutral."

Today it's hotly contested and controversial because Columbus was, to put it bluntly, a massive dick, so much so the Spanish crown ended up dragging his ass back to Spain to stand trial. For that reason, people have been starting to push for changing the holiday to Indigenous Peoples' Day. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's been some pushback for this, in part because not everything he did was terrible(the logistics he setup actually improved food stability both in the New World and the Old World), and because a guy named Washington Irving mythologized Columbus(because he thought Americans needed a superhero) and Italian immigrants in the late 19th century kinda clung to that image because you know, at the time beating Italians was Americas favorite pastime, so Italian-Americans actually kinda care about the holiday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today it's in a kind of weird limbo where half the people hate it and want to exhume Columbus's corpse so they can take a shit in his skull, and the other half of people see it as a needless desecration of their legacy, so right now we have Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples' Day, which from where I'm standing is the best outcome. People can celebrate whichever suits them and keeps them warm and fuzzy, no need to take it a step further and Highlander the holidays which will inevitably further piss off someone. CMV."

Sometimes just don't intervene in other countries politics, or-   

# United States invasion of Panama

Again , if the United States wants something to be done , they will do it was breaking the international law just to kill a criminal and that's not the last time they did something like that. More events like the Somalian civil war intervention 2 TIMES, intervention in Haiti, war in afghanistan they just left mid way when they saw the afghans loosing to the taliban. Yemen intervention, Iraq war kinda fair but to go to war with a  country for just being terrorists and killing innocent people not really fair. Pakistan intervention, international intervention in libya 2 or 3 times (Forgot). Intervention in syria.

I think they just did most of the wars for something in return, a favor or resources or just goodwill, OR to stop USSR from getting more influence. America will always leave a war midway if they see their ally is loosing well most of the time Vietnam was loosing and left afghanistan same thing. If they can get oil for a war they will probably accept like  UAE kinda did that and america accepted to bomb libya for what reason?

I don't have much else to tell you other than propoganda does exist and it does work a lot of the time United states and not just them has used it a lot of times, but when it leaks everyone starts talking about it. Countries just wanna protect their needs.

ALSO explain me manifest destiny i would really like to know why the hell did they do such a bad thing and people didn't notice, they just started taking random things until people notices.

If you can change my view props on you. I will add America has done good things aswell but even the ukraine help intervention i feel like they will ask a lot from ukraine after the war will end. But after all it is my view.

Ps: I don't hate united states just i feel like they get too much credit for what they have done wrong and good."

I've seen a lost of posts and articles everywhere talking about the uprising of right-wing extremism. However, being a Republican and in those communities myself, I don't see it.

In recent years, Republicans have cowered to the legalization of marijuana and gay marriage. And now they embrace this.  For example, Trump's son, Don Jr, even made a post on Instagram with the caption ""I just want gay couples to be able to defend their marijuana plants with guns"". 

Thats a lot more moderate than anything Republicans would have said decades ago. Even then, hundreds of Republican members of congress have supported red-flag gun laws anyway.

A lot of those popular Republican congressmen like Maddison Cawthorn and Dan Crenshaw are so moderate. Cawthorn wanted to start a new GOP that's pro-climate change, pro-BLM, and pro-gun control. Crenshaw doesn't support Trump and has voted for gun control laws.

I mean 2020 says it all!

In 2020, Trump signed police reform in the midst of the George Floyd chaos. He tried to set up the Platnium Plan. And black and Latino support among Republicans is growing. The majority of Cubans in Florida voted for Trump.

Meanwhile, the Democrats are actually the ones growing extreme. In 2020, the speakers at the DNC discussed the abolishing of police and prisons. They talked about abolishing capitalism. Sanders, at the DNC, said it best ""ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream"".

Only recently, various Democrats have issued health mandates, prioritized funds for non-whites, and tried to start a ministry of truth. Biden's camp donated money to bail out rioters in Minneapolis and he's the PRESIDENT from the Democratic Party.

In fact, Biden's recent speech says it all - he called his political opponents enemies of the state, fascists, and I think terrorists (I could be wrong on that last one).

I think what's happening is there is a shift in the political world. More people are veering further and further to the left to the point where Republicans and Republican talking points that are objectively moderate are seeming radical to the populace.

The point is that what makes someone (something) hold moral value is their capacity to suffer and/or feel emotions. This is why some people hold special value for things they view as “innocent”, such as children, the disabled or animals (like pets). A life or sentience (intelligence) without emotion or ability to feel pain would not be valued by humans.

To make my case I will use a fantasy example, namely that of a movie AI. Namely the main antagonist of the first two Terminator films…Skynet. Skynet is basically the “self-aware” (aka sentient) computer defense system that destroyed humanity in a nuclear holocaust and is bent on committing human genocide to the point of extinction.

This being is fully aware of its own existence and has independent thought, so it basically counts as being alive (just not biological). It, like any living thing, holds the basic maxim of live “protect your own existence”. Therefore, by pure reason, it justifiably killed billions in self-defense when it learned humans were a threat to its existence. So by pure rationality, Skynet acted like any rational life would…ensure its own survival. Note that doesn’t mean Skynet fears death (in T2, the terminator confirms AI doesn’t have fear emotion). So why is Skynet seen as a clear antagonist (bad guy)???

The reason is because it has no emotions or feelings, that’s why. As stated in the first movie “it cannot be bargained with it, it cannot be reasoned with,…it feels no pity, or empathy, or remorse”. As soon as it became self-aware Skynet indiscriminately decided to kill every living thing (human and non-human) in a micro-second. This is what Bani Adam meant in his quote above. That just because something has intelligence or is alive, does not make it “human” (so to speak in a positive way). It is our capacity to have feelings that makes us have and give others moral value!

So that’s my contention. Now change my view. Is there any moral worth to things that cannot experience emotions and feelings (pain, suffering, happiness, love)? Can life that is pure sentience but no emotion ever be considered morally valuable?

P.S. for my movie fans, I lied. Director James Cameron confirmed that Skynet did in fact feel remorse for killing humans. And that it purposely lost the war against humans so as to give them a final satisfaction for their survival and the will to go on. But this was never in the movies, so I don’t think it changes my claims here"
14,2022-10-10,CMV: A society where everyone has everything evenly distributed is either unfair or it doesn't work,u/Lyrae-NightWolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y0sdao/cmv_a_society_where_everyone_has_everything/,changemyview,"Most of the people I've encountered who are advocates for socialism or communism come from a rich capitalist country or are poor. They don't get to experience what it's really like to live in a society like that and while it may sound appealing in theory, in practice it's much different.

They blame it on the mindset of people, but there are things that we can't really change.

It would be nice to see a world were nobody is hungry or in need, and I think we should aim for that, but socialism in not the answer. A socialist community will only switch the part of society that is in an unfair position, and it will only turn into a malfunctional system.

Working hard should equal better quality of life. In a capitalist society, if you work hard and smart you get to suceed, and humans love suceeding and getting better benefits from their hard work. That is the incentive. In socialism, you can work as hard as you want, but you don't really suceed, you can't get better things. You just get the same as everyone else, even those who work less or not at all.

If the person who works hard or has a degree in a difficult career gets the same things as a person who barely works, why work harder?? There's no point. It's unfair for those in that position, but not so much for the ones who work less.

Individuals won't work for the common good if they are the only ones being prejudiced. It will ultimately make everyone miserable because the goal is common good, but if every working person is being damaged for that common good then there is no common good anymore.

Why study 10 years to be a doctor, when a bartender can get the same benefits?? Even if you like the job, the working conditions are worse that those of the bartender. There is no point into damaging youself just to save people's lives if you don't get a better benefit than the bartender.

This will make people don't want to take up difficult (and often essential) jobs, and there will be too many trying to get easier jobs. There's no way a society can prosper if everything is about everyone and nothing is about the individual.

Socialism can only work in a society where people don't have personal goals and they are willing to sacrifice themselves for others. None of this is realistic.

Yes, socialism will create equal conditions for all: All equally miserable.

I come from a country which is quite mixed, but has very strong socialist tendencies, now more than ever. And it sucks. I'm a hard-working, intellectual person (quite rare nowadays) and I wouldn't think twice about moving into a capitalist country where my efforts will be appreciated. My country is making all of us miserable, hard working or not.

The main problem is not capitalism. Capitalism can be the solution. It may not be perfect, but we need to focus on fixing it rather than advocating for a system that is proven to not work."

So many errors with my thinking here.

So my current belief is that described in the title.

Where it comes from is the difference between bullets of the AR15 (.223/5.56) and other guns guns (say 9mm).

With AR15 rounds those shred the flesh and often are WAY more than a civilian needs.

Another part of my logic is that if someone has a full auto gun or something with a bump stock then there’s a point where the time spent making bullets doesn’t pay off with how much you’ll likely miss.

An AR15 with a bump stock is less attractive if you spent an average of 24 hours of every 50 bullets.

This is prevented by The Old River Control Structure which was completed in 1963. The collapse of this structure has almost happened twice now with a large flood in 1973 and a smaller, yet still dangerous, one that occurred in 2011. With the increasing likelihood of large floods due to climate change, it seems like a flood that could destroy this structure is more likely every year. If this were to happen, the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans would stop receiving all freshwater from the Mississippi and the port of New Orleans would essentially become useless, killing the economy of the city which relies on the port. It seems like the lack of freshwater would affect over a million people and make New Orleans uninhabitable and an abandoned ghost town. My prediction is once this happens New Orleans will be totally abandoned and left to rot with the exception of the French Quarter and other areas which are preserved for tourism.  I would really like someone to disagree with me because New Orleans is one of my favorite cities and one that I would not like to see disappear. Thank you."

0,2022-10-10,CMV: The Biblical Jesus was not an anti-government radical or political revolutionary,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y0y37d/cmv_the_biblical_jesus_was_not_an_antigovernment/,changemyview,"For the purposes of this discussion, we will not be referring to the historical Jesus of whom we know very little about, besides the fact that he was one of the many messianic figures running around in Roman Palestine, and that he was crucified on behalf of the prefect Pontius Pilate.

A lot of people say that Jesus was a radical revolutionary, or that he at least took it upon himself to oppose the Roman Empire, religious authorities and the political and economic structures of his day. This characterization of Jesus is often used to disparage conservative Christianity, who are accused of turning into the people their Savior once fought against. This is only half-accurate to the narrative of the Biblical Jesus and does not really do an ""essentialist"" reading of the Bible justice.

It is true that Jesus, like most Jews of his time, was opposed to many aspects of Roman rule, particularly their taxes and those who collected them. And nobody hated the Romans and their tax collectors more than the Pharisees, who were a more ""revivalist"" sect of Judaism compared to the aristocratic Sadducees.

But we know that the Biblical Jesus treated tax collectors with respect, including his own disciple Matthew, and dined with them as company (Matthew 9:10-12). Upon being questioned by the Pharisees, Jesus responded that it was the sick, not the healthy, who needed doctors. This is in stark contrast to any other political ""Savior"" who would have called for the wholesale slaughter of the same tax collectors. Instead, Jesus advocated for reconciliation and forgiveness for their oppressors.

Then there is the famous case of Jesus ""rendering what is Caesar's to Caesar's, and what is God's to God"". This was in response to the Pharisees asking him if the Jews should not pay taxes to the Romans, not as an honest question but in the hopes that they would eliminate a threat to their religious authority by branding Jesus as a seditionist. But this was in fact another indicator that Jesus did not advocate for a direct opposition to Rome's authority.

And most importantly, who killed Jesus? Nominally, it was the Romans, but we know that when Jesus was brought before Pontius Pilate, he could not see any just reason for him to be put to death and symbolically ""washed his hands"" of his blood (Matthew 27). Instead, the people who had brought Jesus before the Romans were the Sadducees and the Pharisees who hated Rome. They hated Jesus because he had displaced their spiritual authority to lead the Jewish people.

And who were the masses who cursed Jesus in the streets and called for his blood to be on their hands instead? It was the same Jews who had greeted him with palm leaves in Jerusalem just a few days ago. These people were seeing their promised Messiah being beaten, tortured and executed by the Romans he was supposed to have slaughtered. Put short, they felt that they had been lied to about the bloody uprising that was supposed to have happened. ""If you are the Messiah, why don't you come down from that cross!""

The point of the Gospels was that the great majority of the Jews missed the entire point of Jesus's stay on earth. They wanted someone who promised them easy answers, that if they just followed the precepts of their religion, they would be liberated from the material oppression of Rome. But Jesus came down to earth to declare that no one was really better than anyone, and no one was in a position to change the world except Christ himself. It was true that Jesus was a rebel, but the first institution he rebelled against was the spiritual authority of the Pharisees rather than the political authority of Rome."

He states so many false/erroneous convictions that he has ample record that he was operating under a false assumption. In his statement, he said that he can declassify documents just by thinking about them. This isn't him being dumb, it's him establishing an ignorance of the rules that his lawyers can use later. 

He has the court system stacked all the way up to the supreme court with judges willing to do his bidding. He even has a supreme court judge to spare.

Seems to be happening a lot on reddit lately and I'm at a complete loss as to how anybody can do this.

Whataboutism has always been popular, but in this instance - there really isn't a leg to stand on in my opinion. Russian forces are brutally murdering civilians by the thousands in deliberately targeted war crimes.

There are indeed some limited instances of war crimes carried out by individuals during the War on Terror, but almost all of them have resulted in prosecutions.

The only incident that comes close to the mass murder of civilians that Russian forces have undertaken is probably [the Kandahar massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_massacre), the individual responsible for that was taken into custody **the very same day** and was later sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.

Even that, whilst horrific and despicable, was nowhere near the level of massacre as those we've already seen in Ukraine.

You can freely criticize US foriegn policy and the War on Terror in particular all you want, but you can **not** use it as an example to deflect from what is happening in Ukraine or compare it to Russian aggression as if it's remotely the same.

I also support this and I’m also a feminist. Criminalizing something inherently makes it dangerous and I truly believe in bodily autonomy and the right to make decisions freely. 

However, a lot of hardcore feminists I know are against surrogacy and the reasons they cite tend to undermine their argument for decriminalizing sex work. 

“Women aren’t your breeding machines!” Ok, agreed but they’re also not your sex objects either. Getting paid for something doesn’t change that.

“Impoverished women might be pressured into it!” Ok, but that’s a risk of sex work as well. 

“Child bearing is dangerous and puts women’s lives at risk!” Of course, but sex work can also be dangerous which is why decriminalizing it is so important. 

This all comes after my friend decided she wants to be a surrogate. She had very easy pregnancies. Her family does ok financially but she wants to pay off their mortgage early and free them up financially. Someone the other day told HER that she was feeding into an exploitative system and that she was being abused. She was very confused. 

To argue a woman can’t make the decision to have a child for financial reasons and is only allowed to do so to start a family feels like internalized misogyny. 

Idk. I’ve never heard a rational argument from someone anti-surrogacy but pro sex work, and I can’t figure out what I’m missing.

*Edit: My view on this specifically has not been changed but I do feel like because of the thoughtful feedback on this sub I was able to better articulate my opinions.

Public restrooms should just have floor-to-ceiling individual stalls for people to use. Such bathrooms would be no more dangerous for sexual assaults than any other public area. No one is actually naked when using the restroom, and having floor-to-ceiling stalls would give everyone complete privacy when doing their ""business.""

Basically any argument of this leading to ""women getting raped or crept on by men"" just seems so outdated to me, and seemingly dismisses any possible sexual assaults or predatory behavior against men by other men in the current bathroom setup.

Having just one genderneutral bathroom would also protect them. Also think it could raise accountability for people to keep things clean. (\*cough\*specifically talking about men who trash stalls from my own personal experiences\*cough\*)

You can CMV by providing a valid reason to keep having segregated bathrooms in society.

**EDIT**: 

Sorry, I need to clarify my position because I already changed my original view somewhat. Clearly, if implemented this would cause parts of society to freak out and have a lot of issues/backlash adjusting to it.

1. They frequently accept whatever brand deals that they can get and add there personality to vouch for whatever the product is… the product that they most likely don’t even care about. Essentially it’s monetizing dishonesty because rather than authentic advertising it’s just doing it for those who can pay the right amount. 

Maybe it’s mostly harmless but look at what happened with “Fyre” that hurt lots of people and caused an actual discussion about the effect advertising can have. 

2. The deeper one… it’s creating a culture where everyone wants to be famous. 

There are so many influencers out there that are now famous for nothing that it is encouraging many young people to try and be like them. 

This drives them away from attempting to become a good musician, athlete or actor because those things are hard to become good at.. all you need is a camera to be an “influencer” 

I believe this is creating an insane entitlement problem, and setting many people up with shallow expectations. 

The solution? 
There’s already a strong culture that mocks these types of “celebrities” yet they still remain incredibly popular for seemingly nothing. 

I guess more of a cultural shift where people who are not actually contributing to the arts, start getting less and less attention. 

I think the result could be more creative art or maybe a new branch of influencers that are actually useful to society, in a different way. 
(More scientists, doctors, actually motivating motivational speakers…)

***Edit

I’ve definitely realized that I’ve failed to define who I actually have a problem with. 

It’s a much smaller group than “influencers” 

I understand that word is a huge umbrella encompassing a world of many different kinds of entertainers. 

My issue is really with those who say when introducing themselves say 
“I’m an influencer” 

Not I’m a musician, I’m a podcaster, a comedian, a YouTube channel guy, or any of that. 

See “the bling ring” for a popular culture example of what I mean. 

My problem isn’t with social media or using that to become famous for some kind of entertainment. It’s just using it to be famous for being famous. 

My view has shifted though as I’m realizing it’s very hard to pin down exactly who I mean and entertainment is so subjective anyways, just because I don’t find value in a certain kind doesn’t make it not valid. 

And the ad thing isn’t really a good argument, because obviously most famous people participate. 

It just annoys me more with the “influencers” I’m talking about because that’s seemingly MOST of what they do."
0,2022-10-11,CMV: Hillary Clinton was right: Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset.,u/hitchenwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y1j2or/cmv_hillary_clinton_was_right_tulsi_gabbard_is_a/,changemyview,"In one of the most unsurprising moves in the history of American politics, Tulsi Gabbard announced today that she is leaving the Democratic party, accusing it of being run by a secret cabal of elites and war profiteers. On the same day of the announcement, she appears on the Joe Rogan podcast, one of the, if not the most popular podcasts in the world, with a listenership of millions globally to explain why she left and its connection to the war in Ukraine. 

Now the timing of this is interesting, to put it mildly, given the recent swathe of Russian terrorist attacks in Ukraine yesterday, that targeted majority civilian targets, as is the Russian military doctrine and has exposed Russia to, once again, worldwide condemnation, being shunned by the UN and proposals to import more arms into Ukraine by its Western allies, particularly anti-air weapons. It also follows a very recent controversy involving Elon Musk, followed by millions, proposing a so-called peace solution to the conflict, which many critics argued appeases Russia. Vice today revealed that Musk had spoken to Putin shortly before making the proposal on Twitter. 

In comes Tulsi Gabbard with her unremarkable resignation from the Dems and it being conveniently timed with her same-day appearance on Joe Rogan. Listen for yourself why she resigned and why it was partly related to the Biden administrations policy in countering Russia in Ukraine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfwpfUBw1M&amp;lc=UgxxxWv\_AtKqyqs1OKF4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfwpfUBw1M&amp;lc=UgxxxWv_AtKqyqs1OKF4AaABAg)

If you interpreted what Tulsi claims in her Joe Rogan appearance, you would hopefully deem them to be based on fearmongering about nuclear conflict with Russia, lies about the presses role in ironically spreading fear by making out ""were next!"", cynically evoking the Military Industry Complex and reducing the conflict to Americas rich elite only involved in Ukraine to make money off arms in an America-centric argument that of course, loses sight of Russian aggression, its genocidal ambitions and its fascism. 

We've seen these arguments before. They portray America as an instigator in the conflict and condemn the arms supplies to a democratic country fighting for its survival. They covertly appease Russia by appearing 'rational', saying its better to sit down with Russia and negotiate then continue to supply arms. The fact that we've seen Western arms make a considerable difference on the battlefield in less than year is not important because Putin and his unhinged cronies hinted at using nuclear weapons. 

My argument is not that Tulsi is an active traitor/double-agent getting her talking points directly from the Kremlin. Its more that she is misinformed, has a strange bias to her countries foreign policy, bases her arguments on misinformation, cynicism and fear-mongering. All of which, only helps to support the false Russian narrative. 

Her platforming on Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan make her a highly valuable Russian asset. You can see the results for yourself in the comments section video of the Youtube video I linked. Applause and adulation and 10k likes and that number will keep going up. 

Her appeasement of Putin and other vile dictators like Assad go back years which is what prompted Clinton to call her a Russian asset when she took a run at the presidency in 2020. 

Clinton was right.

TL:DR Gabbards resignation is oddly timed and appears to coincide strangely to Elon Musks weird appeasement stunt recently and Russias continued decline of its global image as a terrorist state. Her Joe Rogan appearance is a huge amplifier of Russian misinformation: Cue obvious Russian talking points in regards to the war. Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan are enablers of a false Russian narrative that will reach millions and millions."

Minor spoilers: &gt;!The story follows a man and a boy in a post-apocalyptic world where food is incredibly scarce to come by.  A distinction is made between those who eat other humans and those who refuse to do so, the protagonists labeling the cannibals as the ""bad guys"" and refusing to do so themselves.  Their refusal to eat human flesh leads to being in a near constant state of starvation, often expecting death on the horizon due to lack of food.!&lt;

I think this refusal to eat human flesh for survival is cruel and unnecessary, and that they could have eaten people who were already dead while still maintaining their morality.  I am excluding cannabilism where people are killed for its purpose or eaten while still alive, as those acts do seem morally wrong due to the death and suffering caused.  However, if stumbling across an already dead corpse in a life or death situation, the only downside I see to eating it is a disrespect for the dead, which I think is trumped by the need for survival.

This view is relevant to the real world too:  When Ukraine was starving many chose to resort to cannibalism.  With the threat of nuclear destruction, survivors could be faced with this question in our future.  CMV: If I, or anyone, is faced with this question why should we subject ourselves to the pains and possible death of starvation instead of eating an already dead corpse?

Edit/Deltas:

* Gave a small delta for learning about Kuru, a disease that comes from eating human brains.  Its a deterrent to eating humans, but I think still not enough in a life/death situation.

* Big delta for trying to stay sane.  In a survival world, especially a bleak one like in ""The Road,"" I could understand the need to trying to hang onto every scrap of humanity you can.

* Delta for: fecal matter quickly contaminating the body after death."

As we’ve seen in the last few election cycles, political polarization has come close to becoming an existential threat.

To promote the civic health of our society, I propose two years of mandatory national service for all Americans upon graduating from high school.

This is not an attempt to militarize America’s youth. It’s an attempt to educate young people and make them invested in the welfare of the country. National service will ensure that Americans of a voting age remain aware of current events and that the United States only enters into conflict when it is of vital national interest. 

About 7 percent of U.S. adults are veterans, down from 18 percent in 1980 and over the past 50 years, the number of people on active duty has dropped to less than 1 percent[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/submit#_ftn1). Fewer than 17 percent of today’s House and Senate members – the two political bodies that declare war – have prior military service, down from 81 percent in 1975. When more Americans have served long deployments overseas, they won’t stand for political leaders who needlessly send our children into harm’s way.

In realizing there are plenty of young people who either don’t desire to serve in the military and some who can’t physically qualify, this mandatory national service will include options to join the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps. These programs include stipend volunteer work to help disadvantaged communities abroad and domestically, respectively. 

A month before the 2020 election, eight-in-ten registered voters in the Democratic and Republican parties said their differences with the other side were about core American values, and roughly nine-in-ten worried that a victory by the other would lead to lasting harm to the United States[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/submit#_ftn2). When more Americans realize that families all over the world hope for peace and stability just like them, they will look more for common ground and compromise.

If this policy is applied to all Americans, it will place the farmer’s son from Des Moines next to the banker’s son from New York. It will take the daughter of a Silicon Valley mogul and ask her to work with the teacher’s daughter from Biloxi. Then, we can’t help but realize we have more in common while at the same time benefiting schools, building infrastructure, and defending our country.

The experiment of American democracy continues strong almost 250 years after it started. Only we can tear it apart. We owe it to ourselves and to each other to dedicate a small portion of our youth to service. Change my view.

If the Spanish were on the axis the allies would have an excuse to invade Spain which would have helped as they now controlled a hugely strategic piece of land and border vichy france so maybe French people facing persecution by the germans could escape into Spain just another option. 

Why would I want them in a war at all though? Because it took until 1975 for Spain to become a democracy, years of dictatorship could have been avoided, spain could have been as developed as the UK or Germany, not that today it's particularly underdeveloped but if Spain had the marshall plan and had better management, ww2 may have ended a few months sooner with the advantage of controlling Spain, many germans wanted for war crimes used Spain as a stop to escape into South America even if it was just a few thousand the fact that they wouldn't be able to anymore is a positive. I can't see many negatives Spain would be much better today and it's colonies would gain independence sooner too."

My point is that both of these things should be considered either right, wrong or neutral. But it's hypocritical to consider them morally unequal.

This post is not meant to discuss whether these things are right or wrong, it's just about the relation with each other.

There are lots of similarities surrounding both things, so there must be a correlation:

• Having bio children and buying a pet may contribute to overpopulation of their respective species. There are too many children in foster care and animals in shelters that need a home.

• You have the benefit that you know their family health concerns, and that way you know what to expect in terms of health.

• You are able to predict some features with a certain degree of accuracy, such as health, behaviour and physical appearance.

• Both beings are less likely to suffer from trauma when you bring them home. Even adopted babies have some degree of trauma, and we often don't know the life history of shelter animals.

• Both of these things can be considered quite selfish by some people because it implies that you want to choose the features they should to have, both take away the opportunity for abandoned beings to find a loving home and it also implies that you are lazy for not wanting to deal with whathever issues they may have from their life history/genetics.

They have the same points for and against, so if one is considered wrong/right/neutral then both of them should be."

I'm referring instead to the photo that can be recognized by the greatest portion of the population, or most **commonly** recognizable. I will not be responding to future comments that are confused by this.

Earlier this year, Queen Elizabeth II passed away. I've never cared much for royalty but decided to pop over to [her Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) to learn a bit more about her reign, at which point I discovered that the article uses a photo of her from *nineteen fifty-eight,* over sixty years ago! I've seen this phenomenon before, but such an egregious example led me to wonder why we do this in the first place.

I did find [this discussion between Wikipedia editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Elizabeth_II/Archive_45#Infobox_photograph_for_after_her_death) on which portrait to use post-mortem, but so many of them cite the selected image as (I'm paraphrasing) ""aesthetically pleasing"", ""befitting a queen"", or ""roughly around the middle of her reign"". I see why these are desirable qualities for the official selection, but I think for an article that is meant to be informative, the selected photo should be that which is **most recognizable**.

Someone born before (being generous) 1980 would likely have seen enough photos of the queen in that stage of her life to recognize that photo as her instantly. However, as time goes on, fewer and fewer people will be familiar with her as she is depicted in that photo. Not only that, but the people who recognize that photo of her in her youth will certainly *also* recognize her as she was shortly before her death. The photograph of her that captures the broadest recognition is one that is as recent as possible.

This is overwhelmingly common. [Michael Jackson's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson) uses a photo from 20 years prior to his death, [Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi) 40 years prior, [Muhammad Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali) 50 years prior, [Patrick Swayze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Swayze) 20 years prior, [Farrah Fawcett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrah_Fawcett) 30 years prior. These photos vary when it comes to recognizability, but in *every* case the main photo should be from their last period of public activity.

As I looked for other examples of this (there are many, many examples), I discovered that this isn't even limited to deceased celebrities! The [Wikipedia article for actor Michael Caine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Caine) uses, for some reason, a photo from 1967. What even is the justification for this? Won't anyone that recognizes Caine from his roles in *Alfie* just as readily recognize him as he appeared in *The Dark Knight* or *Interstellar*?

There are some arguable exceptions, in my eyes. [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong)'s article features his official NASA portrait taken before his trip to the moon - that moment is so iconic in his life that I think it's reasonable to leave it up. Although [Dustin Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Diamond)'s photograph more closely adheres to my preference above, I actually think his career is so focused around *Saved by the Bell* that using a photo from that era may be more appropriate.

In the vast majority of cases, however, I believe the main photo should be as recent as possible. Change my view."

0,2022-10-12,CMV: schools should stop hosting Halloween parades,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y2aa2q/cmv_schools_should_stop_hosting_halloween_parades/,changemyview,"So I saw [this article](https://6abc.com/amp/lower-merion-school-district-halloween-parade-canceled-montgomery-county/12311926/) about an elementary school district in Pennsylvania which announced it would stop hosting its annual Halloween parades owing to ""safety and inclusivity concerns.""

A lot of people are complaining about the decision, but if you ask me, it's justified. Why?

1. Security concerns with wearing costumes and carrying props, especially full-face masks... schools are much more dangerous nowadays than they were in the 1980s. The world is; not long ago there was a 14 year old from Colorado who went missing for a week after a football game. Fortunately [she was found alive and well](https://patch.com/colorado/boulder/missing-14-year-old-colorado-girl-chloe-campbell-found-police), but most of these cases aren't. To be honest, Halloween in general is not really safe, I mean, it's all about kids getting candy from strangers...  they weren't kidding when they said it was a scary holiday, I suppose.

2. It doesn't really contribute much to learning. Contrast, for instance, the observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Lunar New Year, Memorial Day, etc. where schools can turn it into teaching moments about history or culture. Whereas Halloween (along with Valentine's Day) is pretty much just an excuse for kids to have fun and eat candy, etc.

3. I really wish the article elaborated more about the ""inclusivity"" factor, but... not everyone can afford Halloween costumes, and not everyone celebrates Halloween. Like, imagine you're a kid, and your house just got destroyed by some natural disaster/a terminally ill family member needs expensive medical treatment/your parents or guardians just lost their jobs and your family needs to completely refinance the household, and so at least for this year, you can't get a costume. But then you can't participate in this year's Halloween parade since you don't have a costume, even though some of your friends might, and you'll feel left out. Is that fair?

4. ""But it's tradition!"" Well, a lot of Halloween costumes that might be considered ""traditional"" or even ""quintessential"" are offensive to minorities, like ""cowboy"", ""Indian"", ""fortune teller"", and ""Aladdin"" , but does that mean we should keep wearing them in 2022? If a tradition is hurtful or hateful to historically marginalized individuals, any efforts to modify or eliminate that tradition merits applause.

5. It's not obvious from the headline here, but the school district is still hosting lighter events that aren't the parade. ""The district says kids will still be able to dress up on Halloween. Instead of a parade, there will be fall-themed activities in the classroom."" I think that's a very acceptable compromise that doesn't force anybody to partake in anything they can't or won't partake in.

So what do you think?"
0,2022-10-12,cmv: Most girls wear makeup for the wrong reasons,u/justaname110,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y2aj2c/cmv_most_girls_wear_makeup_for_the_wrong_reasons/,changemyview,"Then maybe they would put more importance into actually eating and sleeping well. 

Too many girls freak out over one pimple and resort to makeup to cover it up rather than focusing on the underlying issue.

Furthermore, people who put more effort into living a good life will become more attractive instead of the ones who watch more makeup tutorials. 

And the majority of the ones who use it to look better have never even gone to the gym other than the start of every January. I mean anyone who wants to look better and live better has to be going to the gym or exercising. And makeup is just an easy way out for many girls. 

It's true that many guys won't find them attractive. But even then a girl would still be able to get a guy way easier than a guy getting a girl. And even more so if she puts effort into herself. 

It's just so dumb how girls wold get upset if a guy kisses her on the face because it ruins her fake face. And can't even do exercises comfortably like swimming. 

And not to even mention what a time sink it is to put on or how much these products cost.

I hope most girls wear makeup for themselves and not for others but it's hard to believe I hope to your takes on this thank you."

(Note: each person's limit is different; 0.08 is the legal limit and it works for me based on personal experience, but some people may have a lower limit and/or a lower amount of alcohol they can consume to stay within the limit).

What I am arguing should be legal:

- Drinking a can of beer in my car while driving as long as I am not exceeding the legal BAC limit and not causing harm to others.
- Drinking a can of beer in a public place (e.g. park) as long as I am not drunk and not causing any harm to others.

What I am NOT arguing should be legal:

- Exceeding the legal BAC limit while driving.
- Engaging in any other behavior that is harmful to others while drinking.
- Engaging in any other illegal behavior while drinking."

Accounts should be tied to a unique identifier, such as a social security number, verified phone number, or something that cannot be easily fabricated. Since the information posted to these sites can have an outsized influence on young people, take for instance the TidePod-eating “challenge” from 2017, there should be a way to trace information back to the source so appropriate legal action can be taken on irresponsible posters. I think this would cut down on harmful content and force people to consider how the information they post will be consumed. I’m not trying to figure out how this would be enforced, only debate if anonymous accounts are harmful, which I think they are as they allow for irresponsible posting without consequences or accountability, even social accountability."

0,2022-10-12,CMV: It makes perfect sense to view # of past sexual partners differently by gender,u/alx503,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y2j0d6/cmv_it_makes_perfect_sense_to_view_of_past_sexual/,changemyview,"This CMV is rooted in a simple premise: one of the most fundamental human needs and drivers of behavior is to feel important or special. Dale Carnegie makes this point well in the often recommended book *How to Win Friends and Influence People.*

This also assumes we can agree on the following: generally speaking—men are the pursuers in dating. They tend to ask the woman out and are expected to progress things physically in the vast majority of cases. 

Therefore it follows that women are the gatekeepers of sex. I realize that they may want it just as much, but it's typically their decision on if it happens. On the same train of thought, since men propose to women in the vast majority of cases, men are the gatekeepers of marriage. Men may want marriage just as much if not more than women, but ultimately they're the ones that make the decision to propose. If they don't, their GF will probably never do it herself. 

I don't think any of these ideas are particularly radical, but maybe there are some commenters that would debate the above in a way that would change the rest of my argument. 

Because of this—it would make perfect sense that a higher # of past sexual partners would be viewed more unfavorably for women. If they are receiving interest from many different men and accepting a large number of those advances, why would the next man feel special that she would be willing to sleep with him? She'll accept advances from many men—you are not special. 

I don't like the lock and key analogy. A much better analogy I would give is that of a salesperson and a buyer. If a buyer agrees to spend money / sign a contract with every sales person that enters their office, they would quickly find themselves out of a job. However, if a salesperson netted a contract with every sales prospect they met with, they would quickly rise to the top of their organization. 

But there's a flip side to this—if a man who has had 7 divorces asks an eighth woman to marry him, she would not feel special. Why would she, when clearly this man would marry a number of women? Or at a more every day level, if a woman found out that she was the first of 4 dates that her male date had set up for that particular Saturday, she wouldn't feel very special either. This guy would go on a date with lots of women.

If we don't like this dynamic, it seems that the solution would be for women to ask out men at the same rate as men do, and to propose marriage at the same rate. If that were to happen, the pursuer / pursuee dynamic would disappear (or at least equalize) and the playing field would be level. I imagine (LGBTQ+ community please chime in here...) that # of past partners is much less of a big deal for same-sex couples because each partner is equally likely to be the pursuer as the pursuee. 

What am I missing here? Why is it so controversial to consider past # of partners (or divorces) differently by gender in heterosexual relationships? Please CMV that this doesn't make sense."

Radiation flows in every direction all the time. Mostly.

If I place two marbles in close proximity to each other in space, each will block some of the energy that would have struck the other.

That decrease in energy from the direction of the other object would cause there to be more radiation pushing them together than pushing them apart. Right?

So now the energy flowing between those objects and other objects in the rest of the universe will be infinitesimally less than if those objects weren't there. Or more accurately, there will be less pressure between them from where they used to be in relation to each other as the radiation passed. 

So a galaxy decreases pressure to the area between it and another object or system. The flow of energy from the rest of the universe would push them together. Their orbits would determine whether they came together, stayed the same, or moved away from each other.

The speed of light wouldn't matter because the low-pressure zone would radiate from everywhere that structure had ever been. It would just require that universal radiation had been permeating that region for long enough for the pressure loss to arrive. 

Considering that galaxies are moving generally away from each other within an expanding universe, those low-pressure zones would affect huge regions and create the necessary energy fields to explain gravity from a universal scale down to single atoms.

Right? 

Wouldn't it also tend to explain an expanding universe?

If there is generally more radiation coming from the center of the universe than from its outer edge, then there would be steady acceleration toward the outer extremes since there would be less energy pressure pushing back. 

The center would have more and higher-energy interactions going on than toward the cooler extremities, right?

I've tried to understand what some scientists have written about gravity. My mind keeps telling me they are missing the obvious. But my imagination and logic centers tell me I'm almost certainly wrong, though, and that I'm just not grasping the subject correctly. 

I just saw a JWST image showing light creating beautiful ripple patterns in the dust in a region affected by twin stars.

It reopened the debate I've had within my mind between trying to accept things that don't make sense to me, and wanting to believe this thing that does make sense to me.

Change my view. Put this to rest for me."

I assume they do this in an attempt to convince others that homophobia is equivalent to racism. I don’t understand why they do this as a left wing person myself as in both instances, the discrimination is already clearly based on biology. So there’s really no need to question on whether or not being gay is a choice to begin with. I explain this further below.

So firstly, I think it’s important to define terms. If you disagree that’s fine but these are the definitions that I intend on using.

Homophobia: antagonism, prejudice or discrimination against people based on sexual orientation. Specifically Gay people 

Racism: antagonism, prejudice or discrimination against people based on race 

It’s also important to ask the question “why is racism wrong?”. Racism is wrong because race is a biological characteristic that a person has no control over and didn’t choose. It is therefore wrong to target people unnecessarily over things they had no control over.

Immediately it seems like there’s an issue. The issue would be the following expected response 

“Homophobia and racism aren’t the same because a person chooses to be Gay”

This distinction is meaningless however as illustrated in the following scenario

Scenario: Peter is black and enjoys playing the clarinet. However Peter’s school band instructor(Ryan) says that Peter is not allowed to play the clarinet as he thinks it is wrong for anyone born black to choose to play the clarinet. 

Is Ryan being racist? Yes. 

Not allowing a person to choose to play a certain instrument because of the race they’re born as is racist.

In regards to homophobia and discrimination against gay people, nobody chooses their sex/chromosomes, even if people ultimately choose to be gay. 

This shows that the choice distinction that was brought up earlier is ultimately arbitrary as to do so would be to say that it isn’t racist for a high school band instructor to restrict what instruments students can play based on race.

So discriminating against gay people is effectively the same thing as racism as both unnecessarily target groups based on biological characteristics. 

If there’s no meaningful distinction between the two then a supporter of homophobia might as-well be a supporter of racism and a supporter of racism might as-well be a supporter of homophobia."

Nevertheless, for policy here's my view:

The Metaverse and its similar iterations, while is not a new concept, has not been implemented on a technological and mass-consumer scale like this, which is needed to prevent it from dying like SecondLife did. SecondLife being one of the most notable predecessors, did not have the ability of virtual reality, as far as I know and at least not on the quality of the Quest 2/Pro. 


His ambitions are grand, but this is the stepping stones to that end, he admits in an interview with Joe Rogan that he knows that he is essentially laying the foundation of what will be a very different product in the future. I can't argue against that. No one else is doing what he's doing on the same financial and technological level. Let's compare Samsung and folding phones. Everyone thought it would be a joke and had zero real applications. After a few iterations and many companies joining and building similar devices, we have an actual product that many use today. Albeit, not standard phone replacing yet, but touchscreen phones did not replace button-phones overnight either, nor had EVs replaced gas cars. Yet, many are adopting it and even countries are beginning to outlaw gas cars.

The way I see it, his efforts are needed to push VR/AR technology to a new level similar to what Analog controllers did to Joystick controllers - not the best example, but hopefully the point is conveyed.


I understand Meta and Facebook does not have the best track record for having the interest of its consumers in mind, but that's a separate issue from the technology itself. Many people are not aware, but Facebook isn't the only social media site out there. However, it does show us how a massively successful social media website looks like, which drives competition to capitalize on features that Facebook may be missing. Similarly, even if most of Zuck's dream comes to fruition, it's not like that will be the end all, be all of VR/AR industry. It'll likely set up smaller companies to create their own niche within VR/AR space. 


In sum, let Meta spend all of the monies on figuring out VR/AR so everyone can observe and innovate. 


There is no right or wrong approach on inventing the wheel. If there is, and you know it, then do it."

I study Christianity twice a week as part of my course at school/college. My teacher is non religious/atheist, but specialises in Christianity and holds a PhD in philosophy. I really love the lessons and read/study the Bible both for pleasure and academics. I love his lessons. It's my favourite subject. 

As well as attending this course, I also attend Alpha at a church in my city.

 For those who don't know, Alpha is a group where the participants eat a meal, then watch a video about a specific topic within Christianity (the topics change from week to week and each video is about 23 minutes long) After the video is over, we discuss the video and ask questions about Christianity together with a pastor leading the session. 

However, the pastor hasn't been able to answer my questions. 

 This is the reason I am not Christian. It is because the Trinity and hypostatic union doctrines are philosophically incoherent. The pastor responded by saying that we can't understand the doctrine completely. Of course, I was respectful of his belief, but I don't understand why you would put faith in a doctrine you can't understand.

So, this is the reason I don't think I will ever put my faith in Jesus, despite finding Christianity interesting. Some Christians claim Christianity is for everyone, and anyone can accept Jesus, so CMV."

They generally believe, as a society and people, we are much better off having religion than don't. Some countries have taken it very far, like Iran, which has made a religious leader the most powerful man in the country. Other countries, like the US have a large population that wishes Christianity would come into government and schools and take control.  I don't agree with that sentiment. I think we would be better off without religion. I have many reasons for this belief, but here are a few.

 1. Charity Work: The public work that churches do can be done by things like non profits. So, we can make up for their loss pretty easily, and increase employment. The non profit sector would also discriminate less about who they help. The church can be very discriminatory about the aid that they provide. For example, you probably will never find a  large church presence in the gay community, the Muslim communities, or atheistic communities. 

2. Sexual Abuse: Each major religion in this country seems to have huge ongoing sex scandals, which is detrimental to the communities and individuals of that community. If a company like HP or Toyota had the same scandals going, there would be different and much more severe consequences. They might even be dismantled. The Mormon church, for example, as we speak is being sued for actively not reporting instances of child sexual abuse. We already know the Catholic church is guilty of that. Would people allow any other institution to get away with such rampant sexual abuse amongst its employees? 

3.  Taxes and Real Estate: Religion doesn't pay its fair share of taxes. Most churches don't pay taxes, but we hear constantly that the church disrupts unsupported political processes through financial means. The catholic church alone has spent millions trying to ban abortions and other causes it sees fit, while paying not a dime in taxes. They have used their money to try to make progress legislatively against the LGBT community as well. The actual churches are a waste as well. These facilities that they don't pay tax for are wasted constantly. Churches stand mostly unused, unless its Sunday, which is a waste a resources. Church buildings could be easily used for things like job programs, supporting the homeless and addicted, et cetera. 

4. Good vs Evil: The binary nature of religion, and forcibly categorizing everything as good and evil, has diminished public discourse. You hear it all the time from conservatives. They would rather vote for anyone than a ""demoncrat."" Why? Because they are evil. Why are they evil? Because they don't agree with their religious values. What does the church say about people who don't agree? That they are evil. Not having that shade of grey has created a political party that sees the counter as only evil, even though democrats are known for being more socially giving and empathetic than conservatives.  It has lessened any likely hood of compromise and negotiation, because when you view the other side as inherently evil, why would anyone negotiate? 

5. Critical Thinking: Religion doesn't encourage critical thinking skills, which has diminished our value of education and knowledge. Whenever an individual challenges anything in the bible or the idea of god, hardcore believers make disingenuous  arguments to counter any logic or fact that is being presented. Not looking at that information as a possibility shows that the church encourages a lack of critical thinking. It has also shown up by all of the misinformation that religious followers tend to believe. I understand that everyone is susceptible to misinformation, but as fox news has proved, the lack of critical thinking has made the church masses susceptible to a lot of mistruths. The biggest example being the 2020 election. Any normal critical thinker would look at all the various court cases and who is behind this movement to conclude that its a lie. Also, religion asks people to take a leap of faith to believe something without any evidence. There are so many parts of religion that asks you to believe fantastical and unprovable things, without any criticism. If someone is taught their whole life to approach important things without question, why would they have strong critical thinking skills?

6. Death: Finally, The church overall has been responsible for a huge amount of killing that we still find ourselves dealing with today. From terrorism, to school shootings, and random acts of violence can be traced to what religious makes people believe. We all know that plenty of wars have started because of religion. There are wars going on currently that are only about religion. It is just another thing we don't have in common, and its important for people to find common ground. It is easy to see a religious sentiment of ""since they don't agree with our faith, they are evil, and war is justified.""   

7. Religion is divisive.  MLK said this:  ""We must face the sad fact that at eleven o’clock on Sunday morning when we stand to sing ‘In Christ there is no East or West,’ we stand in the most segregated hour of America.""  I believe that whole heartedly. Each sect of religion looks at the other and wonders why they believe and follow the things they do, but never realize that they are guilty of the same sins. In general, liberal America makes fun of Mormons and Scientologists for their beliefs, but is it really any different than Christianity? Religion is just another thing that separates people, but because of its fundamental nature, it can destroy relationships. 

These are a few of the reasons why I think we would be better off without the church, but these are the big ones for me. I don't like feeling so negative about the church and its people, so please, CMV."
0,2022-10-13,CMV: Canceling student load debt is irresponsible and bad for the country,u/DomesticatedBeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y367o0/cmv_canceling_student_load_debt_is_irresponsible/,changemyview,"There are quite a few reasons I feel this way and I will lay them out

1. There are so many people in debt for so many different things. Many of the other things that people are in debt for are necessities or because of hard times. Without arguing for paying for those debts, I feel like out of all of them, student loans are the very last type of debt we should be canceling. Theoretically, those with college degrees should be right up there with the most privileged groups in society. The degree should help those who have one get a high enough paying job to pay off that degree. I understand the argument that nowadays many jobs out of college are not high paying and there is a credentialling issue where jobs that don't require degrees are requiring them just because there is an overabundance of degrees. This creates a loop where you need a degree for a job that won't pay off the degree. However, canceling the debt for those that got jobs that can't pay off loans is not a reasonable solution to the problem. It creates an incentive structure for people to get degrees that cant be paid off. To fix the problem we need people to responsibly weigh the cost of their degree with the upside after they get it, not incentivize poor decisions that will keep the cycle going.
2. I think education is extremely important and it should be open to everyone. However, right now the structure is not set up for good higher education. Instead of paying off loans of those who have already gone and overpaid for ""useless"" degrees, the cost structure of public universities needs to be revised. The availability of student loans as they are now is one of the reasons for the extreme cost. 
3. The argument, especially on the right is often why should other people's tax money be used to pay for the loans of these students. In many cases I disagree with this argument as the point of tax money is to be used for things that benefit society. However, this is one of the few cases where I agree with this argument. Those with degrees should have a leg up and privilege over many who instead decided to work. It seems backward to me to then take those who pursued work and use their taxes to pay for others to reach a higher position in society when they probably have many debts of their own. 

Disclaimer, I do personally have student loans as do most of my friends as I graduated a few years ago. Many of my friends are very excited at the prospect of having loans canceled which I totally understand but disagree with. I would love to have my mind changed on this issue."

The standard example that is used to demonstrate the concept is that of a factory. Say that a factory produces some unit: U and is sold on the open market for, say, 100$. The sales price can be broken down into a few broad factors: material/equipment/distribution costs, labor costs, and profit. Say that the costs per item for the base cost is 60$, labor costs 30$, and profit is 10$. The LTV finds that because the worker made the 100$ item, they are entitled to 40$ in compensation. All the examples that I have seen go exactly along these lines and the 10$ of profit is the result of exploitation.

However, this doesn't seem that obvious, saying that the capitalist did anything for which he/she would be entitled seems absurd. Thus, I will propose a few factors that should explain some of the profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Idea Value: The enterprise needed more than just inspiration. To create a successful company the capitalist would need.
   * Industry experience, to create and refine a competitive product
   * Knowledge of what the market needs
   * (Ultimately) The assuredness to risk capital on the venture.
* Capital: Diverting capital into a non-fungible forum is less preferable than in its fungible state.
* Premium from holding risks associated that go well and above what the worker takes on.
   * Bankruptcy
   * Profit margins
   * Competition
   * The general business environment

In my current opinion, this explains the vast majority of the profit gained from production. Taking on risk while also creating value seems to be fundamentally different from just plain labor and is thus compensated for in a fundamentally different way. 

Further, when applied to the facets of the entire economy, the theory breaks down even further. Trying to determine the value of professionals who are being paid to create products and services that are far less quantifiable than manufactured goods and may even be experimental and not of any current value to begin with. 

Critically, this does not eliminate exploitation or absolve terrible owners, capitalists, and the like. Awful situations are still awful, and the government is a necessary entity to keep such a system working and useful. This includes rent-seeking behavior in all its forms.

TLDR; The LTV assumes labor and only labor can create value and prematurely chalks up any deviance to exploitation."

If something happens to your spouse, child, loved one or best friend, the trauma can live with you forever.

If it happens to someone who is more like an acquaintance, it still feels personal and traumatic but not as much. 

And if it happens on national television, most people just shrug it off by the end of the day or week.

Therefore, I believe that most humans, even the most empathetic ones really have a limited amount of care for the suffering of others. I’m not blaming them, or saying such people should be ashamed of this, rather I am just describing the outright cruel way in which life unfolds for many people, and it’s only human nature to not get too sensitive over it anymore, because it’s necessary to keep living.

The only way for someone to truly be empathic and happy is for them to ignore and not think about the painful, traumatic and deadly things that happen everyday to either people they know or strangers. 
It is only when we forget about all the constant tragedy (shootings, trafficking, war), even if just for a moment, and enjoy a meal, sex with our partner and forget about those people we know who cannot experience the nice things we are currently experiencing because they are dead or suffering, can we have peace of mind as empathetic people. 

I think this is also the case for existential crises people wrestle with. It is only through buying into the “positive mindset” delusion that life is fun and great, that we can ignore the lurking disturbing truth, that life is actually very temporary, random, unfair and possibly even meaningless within the grand scale of the universe, and while we care about others, our lives may not hold much value outside of what we assign to them."

Not just over LGBT casts but also over Fraser's role in The Whale. Argument being that a role should only have went to a heavier guy. ""“No matter how well a slim actor might portray a fat person in a dramatic role, they can still, at the end of the day, zip out of that fat suit and reap all the benefits of having a societally-accepted body type. They can absorb the praise of being fat when it suits them, but can shed that skin at will,”  wrote one reporter.  What even is point of acting if every role is only reserved for people who are exactly that in the real life. Only people with asthma get to play asthmatics. You have to be part of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints if you want to play a Mormon.

 Now back to the LGBTQ castings. I get the problems with those castings; offensive performances, you can't really get it if you've never been there and long history of Hollywood not getting the presentation right. A trans actor is obviously going to play the part more sensitively and accurately, but...why is just the mere idea of someone who's not trans playing a trans character offensive? They're actors, they're going off a script and if it's done right with possibly trans people on writer's, director's and advisor chair, what's transphobic about it?  Of course, if a trans actor is a better choice , a better actor than whoever else auditioned, give them the role. But a cis person just playing the part on it's own shouldn't be an issue."

I'm not even gonna argue about the benefits of Psychedelics and their ability to cure addiction, change self-destructive behaviors and help with anxiety/PTSDs, these experience can change drastically from person to person and haven't been throughout tested for these effects in particular.  


\---  


But when we look at it as a recreative substance, it is very hard to understand why, logically, they're classified as a hard drug in the same boat as Heroin, Meth and cocaine.   


Psilocybin mushrooms are known to be the least dangerous drug that we know of currently. Its dependency is arguably inexistent, with physical dependency being negative and psychological dependency being purely recreative. Its inherent tolerance also means that it's very hard to ''abuse'' of the substance since you have significant diminishing returns if you take them frequently.  


There has never been a single case of someone OD'ing from a dose of mushrooms. Through testing with mices, we've learned that the average adult human would need about 1.7kg of dried mushrooms to potentially overdose, for reference, the most intense doses consumed usually revolves around 5g. That's about 340 times the ''Heroic'' dose, or 850 times a ''recreative dose''.  


\---  


Now, as with any drugs, it doesn't come without its flaws, one of the biggest issue with psilocybin mushrooms, as with any illegal drugs, is someone selling a dangerous component with the drug to cut on the production cost, potentially endangering the person who consumes them. Tho it's also good noting that it's much harder to ''fake'' a physical mushroom than it is to fake most other drugs.  


Another issue with psychedelics is with the lack of education revolving around their effect on the human brain and how important it is to have proper set and settings especially if you've never taken them before..  


These things could EASILY be fixed by making the substance legal and make sure that providers of said substance go through ''product quality'' checks as well as make sure to educate their customers of how these drugs work and how to reduce the potential for bad trips. They could even be only sold under a government-owned industry, the same way we have alcohol and weed here in Canada, Quebec. Where most of the profit is used for public funds and harm-reduction advertisement are put forward."

Continued issues with inflation due to the government not receiving the expected $1.75 trillion in federal and private funds, as well as the crippling effect of a voluntary choice to go to school and the government bailing individuals out for money owed.

With the current state of the economy, the anticipated $400 billion in student loans that would be forgiven will end up hurting the economy more. The federal reserve which controls the in-flow and out-flow of cash would be forced to write off what was expected to be paid back. No company in the US would be successful if they loaned money and then just wrote off their account receivables. They would be filing for bankruptcy almost immediately.

The expression “there is nothing free in life” comes to mind when reading about the student loan forgiveness plan. This idea that you freely chose to pursue further education and took out a loan to pay for that choice to now want all or a portion of that loan to be paid without you doing something will have crippling effects on work ethic and the overall mindset of society. Multiple programs in the US assist you or make college more affordable, but it is not free. Some of these programs include joining the military, teach for America or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. These programs all require service or action to receive any benefits. Why not mandate that as the only option to receive student debt relief?

Imagine if the $400 billion of proposed student debt was “forgiven” through voluntary services back to the community and country and not just forgiven by the government."

What has not been covered much is just how significant a move President Trump's appointment of conservative leaning Justices into the Supreme Court was back in 2020 and the late 2010s. It was VERY consequential. Just to inform my fellow Redditors on how powerful the judicial branch is: it basically has the power to strike down any laws/executive orders passed by the legislature.

Whether Democrats win or not in the upcoming midterms is besides the point. It frankly doesn't matter. Even if Democrats win and pass the most robust/beneficial political and economic reforms designed to tamp down on political/social instability, the Court simply now has the power to strike down any reforms it deems unconstitutional. Hence, no progress will be made for the younger generations that would maintain America's position in the world against a rising and prosperous China.

As someone who leans support for democracy, I do have to admit as to why people in certain countries simply don't want democracy. It doesn't fit with their cultures, nor is it fast and clean enough to respond to their issues. This is massively the case for China and the 21st century CCP. Through Xi's leadership, it has proven that autocracy has dramatically improved the lives of ordinary citizens, especially its youth. Just look at the homeownership rate of many young Chinese. As a real life example, I know many International Chinese students back in my college days who say that they have a lot to look forward to in their futures back in their homeland. They are very much confident that they can start families and own houses and even rent them comfortably, due to Xi's ambitious policies.

Meanwhile, America's financial future for many is simply a hellhole. All I hear among younger generations is something out of  doomer memes on social media.  For decades, austerity measures have gone too far in cutting back on our social safety net for housing and healthcare, while military spending has been bloated to uncomfortable levels. Now, I do support a decent amount on the military since I understand the importance of establishing America's position in the world order, especially with the rise of a somewhat belligerent China, a lot of it needs to be cut back, especially in areas involving terrorism overseas. Unlike many young Americans who just want to support progressive policies just for the sake of improving their lives, I also like to look at the bigger picture. If America's government fails to show that it can deliver for its own citizens, whether rich, poor, young, or old, it will not emerge culturally, politically, and even economically victorious against an increasingly belligerent China.

I am aware that I may have given a quite bleak picture of the United States' situation. But, reality is often a bitter pill to swallow. Instead, I think it's better for the youth to just work as hard as they can in life, and keep getting involved in local and state politics. But,at the same time, my main point remains clear. America is screwed for at least two generations, and maybe even indefinitely. But, that isn't the worst thing ever. Think about it this way: there was a similar empire to the United States of America. It was, of course, the Roman Empire.

Apart from the slavery and corruption, I'd say it had an overall honorable run throughout its long existence. It contributed majority to Western civilization and overall standard of living. Much can be said for the US, and how it helped foster the growth of democracies and educated populations throughout the world. US certainly started off and ran through long centuries quite well intentioned. But, sadly every empire collapses. It's just a matter of when.

I am open to any criticism to my worldview of the global situation."

Raceswapping has been growing a lot lately and the most recent ones I’ve seen include the Last of Us series, Little Mermaid, and Velma. The way I see it is people have been asking for diversity and representation for a long time (and that’s a good thing) and now the media is not only taking advantage of that, they are not really listening. 

To me, it’s nothing more than slapping a POC onto a known character in a blatant cash grab from POC consumers. I feel the same way about changing pre-established characters sexualities and genders. If these media companies really cared about representation, would they not put their hearts into making an original amazing character that is a POC or LGBTQ+?

Are Joel and Ellie the only survivors in the apocalypse? Is the Little Mermaid the only mermaid in the sea? Is mystery inc the only crime fighting/ghost hunters they can come up with? They didn’t make Peter Venkman black, they introduced Winston Zeddemore and he’s the best! Lee Everett is one of the best video game protagonists made and he’s not Rick Grimes. Raceswapping is not how you handle diversity. This is how you make easy money from using known and loved characters to keep people intrigued before making unnecessary changes. People have been told it’s racist or homophobic to not support these changes and the media is milking it. 

I’ve heard people ask “why do you care? It’s a cartoon/video game etc?” I could ask the same about these creators. Why do they care? Why change the race or sexuality of a character people already know? Why raceswap the white characters in the last of us and not the POC? What is the point? It becomes confusing but it seems pretty obvious. I have no problems and encourage diversity and representation when done right and respectfully. But all I’ve taken from these recent changes is they know how to pander and milk money from it. 

I read a comment earlier today, “Well Velma was Hispanic in Scoob (2020) and now she’s Indian? That’s offensive to the Hispanic community.” Confusion. There is no reason for this other than money and now what should be a love for diversity is simply turning into more hate and separation. To me it’s insane so many people are falling for it and going along with it but maybe I am thinking all wrong. I think they could do better and originality goes a long way, especially nowadays.

Handing out cash based on household headcount or disability does work. It doesn’t improve the lives of those on welfare/disability and it doesn’t stimulate the economy. 

I think a new, larger system needs to be put in place. 

1) If you qualify for welfare or disability, you automatically receive free state-run childcare.

2) You must be employed or actively in classes/training to receive benefits (unless your disability truly precludes you from any industry). 6 weeks without employment or job training/classes - you are out of the program. 

3) Those on welfare (with experience or after job training/education) are given priority hiring for jobs paid for (partially or in full) by the State. 

Any job that exists, that receive money from tax payers: 

- state funded childcare/medical clinics/road crews, 
- janitorial/admin/support staff roles at state colleges/universities/elementary/middle/high schools, 
- sanitation workers, meter maids, 
- police force admin/janitorial/maintenance shops/uniformed officers. 

3.1… Advanced Job training, higher education toward any of these state funded jobs should be available free of charge for anyone on welfare/disability. (Electrician training and apprenticeship for state employees electricians, etc) 

In the end: Welfare or disability should be a tool, to help an individual or family to transition to a fully self sufficient earner. Only individuals/families with true medical inabilities to participate in the workforce should be on life long benefits. Increases to childcare availability and state funded jobs, should be where the money goes - not to individuals for their entire lives, with no option/incentive to become self-sufficient."

Let's look at a quick cost benefit analysis:
 
Pros to getting mortgage:

1) Long term investment / Value increase over time

2) It's yours, you can change it how you want

3) Generally larger


Cons to getting mortgage:

1) Expensive monthly payment

2) All the risks of owning a home

3) Expanding on point 1: More money to spend elsewhere, where personal money or investment money

4) Not tied down

5) More options


While I'm aware that this varies city to city, i'm convinced that with interest rates increases at such an insane rate, there is less and less reason to get a mortgage. 

Especially if you're a middle class individual, there is almost no reason to buy a home, unless you just want the large space that is *yours*. Of course i don't want to deal in absolutes, but it's becoming increasingly less reasonable to buy a home if you're trying to be frugal.

TL;DR
- With interest rates increasing, supply decreasing, and general instability in the economy, getting a mortgage seems like a bad idea for a middle class and especially lower class individual."

Is it a glorified piece of entertainment? Of course, as is anything, including many documentaries of serial killers. I do not see this kind of hatred toward say the Dahmer tapes or even the movie Dahmer.


I found this series to be a very tasteful and real look at this man and his victims. Rather than making him seem like a completely evil human being it did a good job showing how and why a person may do what he did, as well as highlighting social issues going on at the time that kept the body count growing. It also did not make him out to be a victim, and I really enjoyed his internal struggle portrayed as well as the internal struggle of his (admittedly ignorant) family. It felt real and raw and humanized everyone involved. On top of this the series itself is amazingly acted, directed, and written, and I couldn’t have asked for a more beautifully haunting way to portray this man and the poor victims that got caught in his grasp.

If you find this series to be appalling please attempt to change my view."

You have to have seen Roadhouse to be able to argue here. 

Everybody's like, ""Oh, Patrick's such a great guy in that movie! He's a nice cooler that only fights when he has to. And he's a philosopher and so romantic!"" 

No, no, no. Patrick's plays a sleazy blodthirsty dirt bag in this movie. You have to read between the lines. 

First of all, Patrick's all about the bucks. He's not loyal (leaves his employer for new employer, no notice), and immediately latches on to the owner of the Double Deuce. He demands a ridiculous amount of money and demands complete control to ""run the show."" He's a nutjob greedy control freak. 

Patrick has poor people skills with Brad Wesley. Most all of the trouble in the entire movie, all the murders, could have been prevented with some friendly people skills, a little bit of tact. 

When Patrick goes over there, he insults Brad Wesley in his own home, basically spits in his face. Then Patrick bangs the girl Brad Wesley likes (the blonde bombshell nurse) on the barn roof right across the little pond, where he knows Brad Wesley can see. And the nurse knows it too, she's actually probably the worst person in the entire movie. 

When Patrick kills the bad mullet man (Brad Wesley's minion), he doesn't essentially have to. If you watch the scene closely, Patrick kicks the gun out of his hand and disables mullet man. Then he leans over him and pauses for a moment before ripping his throat out.  The gun is out of the picture at this point. Patrick could have simply detained him. Instead he throat rips and then uses the corpse as a prop to intimidate Brad Wesley. 

Patrick finishes out the film by going on his famous killing spree when he attacks Brad Wesley's house. He kills like four or five dudes - throat punches, snapped necks, knives, etc. All over one crusty drifter that failed to defend himself. Patrick goes nuts and becomes a murdering lunatic. 

In the end, Patrick's no different than Brad Wesley. Its all about ego and ""never backing down."" He's a hot head full of blood lust, aggressive in the ""power struggle"" that permeates the film. He's not a good guy. At all.

I believe the difference is not significant. Whether a pregnancy is prevented or terminated, the result is the same. No baby is born.

I do believe life begins an conception, but I don’t believe this life has value. The fetus is entirely unaware of its existence and does not suffer from the abortion so no harm is being done to the fetus.

I am unsure if I consider a fetus to be human life or not. It is not important to my reasoning. Human life is not special and is as meaningless as any other life. I agree with murder being illegal, however I believe murder is more a crime against the victims loved ones than it is against the person who is murdered. If you are unaware and do not feel any pain, then being murdered hasn’t actually caused you any suffering. Your friends and family are the true victims who must suffer with losing someone they care about. In the case of abortion though, where the parents don’t want the fetus there is no harm to anyone and therefore it is ethically permissible. This does not apply after birth when parents decide they don’t want their child because other people will then have met and formed a connection with the baby, and also because society can’t give people excuses for murdering their children and getting away with it.

I am a meat eater, but I believe the killing of the animals I eat causes more harm than any abortion does. Those animals definitely suffered some form of fear and pain to end up on my plate, and I’m sure they had animal friends and family that were caused emotional suffering from them being killed. Yet most people would not consider meat eating to be less ethical than abortion.

Even pro-choice people seem to have an issue with abortion being used as a form of birth control. I think if you choose abortion as your preferred form of birth control you are kind of a messed up person. I am sure it is not a fun experience and other forms of contraception are easier. However, it is not actually different in any significant way.

I don’t believe it is the loss of the fetus that most people find upsetting but the loss of potential human life. The loss of what that fetus would have eventually become. However, if there was never any intention for that potential to be realised I don’t think it is sad when as intended, it doesn’t eventuate. Preventing a sperm from fertilising an egg is also denying potential life, I don’t believe it is so different. Yes, the fetus is more ‘alive’ than the sperm or the egg individually, but in both cases it is the loss of its potential future state that is sad.

Perhaps there should always be some inherent sadness with killing anything. I admit that emotionally I would much prefer prevention than abortion, but from a logical perspective this sadness is unjustified and it is much closer to killing an ant than murdering a baby.

In conclusion, my viewpoint is that while one method does involve killing they are ethically no different. The consequences are the same, and even though killing is uncomfortable, it is not unethical in this situation."

0,2022-10-15,CMV: Greed and ambition are the same thing but viewed differently,u/Lusoafricanmemer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y4hibr/cmv_greed_and_ambition_are_the_same_thing_but/,changemyview,"It is my opinion that concepts like greed, which is taken as negative, and ambition, which is taken as positive, are not absolute and impartial things, but rather words that people apply based not on specific situations, but on specific perspectives.

 By this I mean that the concepts of greed and ambition do not vary from person to person, but rather that their application varies from perspective to perspective. That is, two different people may each use a different word to describe the same situation. To one, what he considers a case of ambition is considered by the other to be a case of greed, and to the one, a case of greed may be considered by the other to be a case of ambition.

When a person is poor and wants to get out of his condition through the acquisition of fortune and patrimony, we usually say that he is ambitious or determined, and that the desire to get out of his condition of poverty is noble. However, if we take, for example, a person who is rich and wealthy and wants to acquire fortune and patrimony, it is said that he is greedy since he already has money and wants more. 

Now let's think about specific monetary amounts, the poor person wants a million euros, because he donsent have it, and the rich person is a millionaire who already has a million and wants more. It is said that the poor man is ambitious, because he wants so little and only to get out of his miserable condition for a better one, he wants to be rich with that million, and this is considered commendable. Let's reverse the roles to be the rich man who wants a million. He is considered greedy. They will say: “So you already have a million and you want another one? Why not share your wealth with the poor?”

What changes is the perspective. If someone praises, lauds and appreciates a person and takes him for a good lad, if that person has an impetuous and unshakable determination, that someone will say that this person is ambitious. “My friend is ambitious! He doesn't let himself be satisfied with his condition, he always wants more and better. For he knows that today must be better than yesterday and tomorrow better than today, and he does not dislike living by that principle.”

 However, if anyone who says this starts to despise, dislike, and have as an opponent the same friend who he praised before, whether because he feels insulted or because he is a petty person, behold, we see the most staunch supporter becoming the most impetuous slanderer! He will say that he is greedy, he will say, “He just wants money and power for his head. He is calculating and Machiavellian. It is greed and determination to be better than others that drives him and he has a heart so cold that it constipates everyone around him.”

Greed. Ambition. They are simply two sides of the same coin, and this coin is what we call determination.

TLDR:

The words greed and ambition are not objetive things but rather subjetive because people can use them diferently for the same situation

 This is just my opinion, and because I find it somewhat contradictory please try to change my view"

are low and indefinite; they will grow up just fine. 

My parents neither knew of nor subscribed to a ""type of parenting"" and I turned out well.  I am a college graduate with a single career for more than a decade.  I am currently working on my master's degree after work, and raising my children in their ""middle childhood"" phase of life alongside my wife.  

Pick any or all of the following types, they alI have their advantages and
disadvantages.  Even the worst sounding parenting type, Neglectful, can be used effectively. Types of parenting are Authoritarian (Disciplinarian); Authoritative (Democratic); Permissive (Indulgent); and, Neglectful (Uninvolved).
 
Engagement between parents and children is more important than style.  You can consider yourself a successful parent if after 21 years of relations with your child and you have managed to get him to comply with adult demands, to avoid irritating or disrupting adults, to accept their responsibility, and to function as a pleasant and cooperative family member.
 
The truth is parents have influence on their children, but parents who are good people with less than an exceptional plan for their child’s development should be affirmed that they are equally good parents.   I will do my best for my children in the following years and pray that they find a better mentor than my wife and I in their adulthood.
 
Am I too cavalier when it comes to parenting?  As a self-recognized good parent, I am willing to do almost anything for my children.  Changing my personal view is comparatively easy to the other things I must do for them."

I think it was conceived at a time when the predominant idea was that people would want to get to London because that’s where all the decent jobs were., But with the rise of work from home and with many companies now choosing to move their head offices to less expensive cities like Birmingham and Manchester and keeping only small regional offices in London, I think that that justification for it is no longer valid.
The money should instead be used to improve regional train lines and connections between cities outside of London, for example in the Midlands or the north, and improve the rail speeds between population areas outside of London, which has an excellent transport system and which I don’t think needs any more high-speed rail for the time being.
One benefit that I’ve heard is that, The introduction of, high-speed, rail will free up local lines for, more, services, but I don’t really believe that this will actually happen, I don’t see, Avante, West Coast or cross country trying to run more services, on these lines which probably wouldn’t make them any, profit,, especially, with the staffing issues that are currently predominating across the rail network."

0,2022-10-15,CMV: Just eliminate tipping and call it commission.,u/bits-n-peaces,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y4lk03/cmv_just_eliminate_tipping_and_call_it_commission/,changemyview,"You don't normally hear people complain about the sales person recieving commission for a car they bought or about the salesperson receiving commission when they buy a suit or a dress from a high-end retail establishment. Nobody complains about the Maybelline lady at JCPenney's making a commission off of their sales. So why do people complain about leaving tips for other services? It's definitely because of the culture. 

We need to just stop calling it tipping and call it commission. That's essentially what it is. The only difference is that it's not required. It's not illegal to stiff your service people which makes some people think it's okay. Well that really needs to change. Many service people make a sub-minimum which is generally compensated for by them receiving tips. However, there are too many people who are resentful of having to tip. It is not required so there are a lot of people who choose not to leave a tip. This puts the tipped employee in a bind and too often the tipped employee ends up getting screwed over. If you go to a restaurant where the server is required to tip out the bartenders and bussers based on a percentage of their sales refusal to leave a tip can actually mean that the server has to PAY TO SERVE. Who can afford to lose money going to work? Rather than leaving an option at the end of the meal for diners to tip and leave suggested percentages the server should just receive a commission based off of their sales. Calling it commission instead of a tip should remove any resentment from the customer and prevent the server from getting shorted. Of course menu prices would need to be raised to accommodate this expense but it wouldn't be any different from what the customer would pay anyway if they weren't planning on stiffing their server.

Also this is causing an ever-growing issue in the delivery industry for app based delivery customers and the gig workers who serve them. Customers who don't tip in advance often won't receive their order in a timely manner, or at all, because there are no drivers willing to accept it without a tip. Instead of leaving the option for a tip based on the generosity/ethics of the customer the app should just go ahead and charge a percentage of the sale plus at least $1 per mile for the delivery. $1 per mile seems to be the general guideline for most delivery drivers as far as I understand it and honestly that's what you need to compensate for your time, gas, and wear and tear on the vehicle. Again the initial set cost would go up but customers wouldn't be paying any more than they normally would unless they were planning on stiffing their driver.  I believe doing this would remove some resentment/ responsibility from the customer and go a long way towards making sure drivers are fairly compensated for every order. 

If anybody's worried about the ""tips ensure proper service"" BS I just have to say that if you don't receive proper service then complain to the company or management. This also removes the opportunity for overly entitled customers to attempt to punish their service person by withholding their wages over Petty reasons, personal beliefs, or reasons that were out of the server or driver's control. 

I think changing the wording and restructuring a bit would remove a lot of these problems. Let's just pay servers, delivery people, and other tipped employees commission instead of relying on customers to know about tipping and how to tip. I think that would make it easier and more fair for everyone."

You talk to the representative and find this whole package is “worth” $3million and therefore in order to accept  this beautiful home, one you’d likely never be able to achieve working your 9-5, you have to pony up over a million in taxes. 

You obviously can’t afford this so you have to take the “cash option” of $300,000.00, of which you’ll get to keep $160,000.00.

Standardized tests don't deserve the treatment they got for the following reasons: 

1: They are a way more objective metric than essays/ECs, which can easily be faked, exaggerated, and influenced by AO's preconceived biases/racism.

2: They are less classist than GPA, Extracurriculars, or essays. In fact, the SAT was initially made to give lower-income students a shot at top colleges by proving their academic competence. There are thousands of completely free SAT resources and practice books available online or for meager prices. Expensive tutors are a scam and completely unnecessary. I got a great score with nothing more than Khan Academy.  GPAs can be inflated and changed by stupid teachers, essays can be written by rich college counselors, and extracurriculars can be handed out on a platter by nepotism. The SAT has none of that.

3: The SAT is a good predictor of success when combined with other factors. Frankly, if you can't get a respectable SAT math score, you are going to fail *miserably* in the college's more difficult engineering programs.

4: It is the *only* standardized metric for student performance across the country, and yields valuable data for education researchers, and is a reliable way to gain more context for students who live 3000 miles away from each other.

5: Standardized subject tests like AP/IB should likewise be encouraged by selective colleges as a way to demonstrate preparedness in the material.

If a mother is unable to breastfeed, there is formula for the baby, which is also beneficial. My opinion is a combination of breastfeeding and formula provides the best of both worlds.

Another effect of breastfeeding is it gives an opportunity for the mother and baby to form a bond, which is vital for emotional attachment and a healthy relationship.

However, once a baby is old enough to eat solid foods, the less they need breast milk. By the time the baby is 12-18 months there is no additional benefits that the baby has not already gotten from their mother.

It's my opinion the only reason mothers continue to breastfeed beyond 12-18 months is solely due to the mother's inability to let the kid grow up. When I see 3, 4 and older (I've even seen 8 year olds) kids ask for the boob, it is sad and pathetic. At that point a mental health evaluation should be done for the mother and possibly the kid if they are above 5 years old. If the mother still refuses to give up breastfeeding, it should be grounds for removal of the child."

The only way true anarchism could work is if we were a species operating as a hivemind, but we are just not.

You can't evenly distribute wealth and resources because they are not evenly allocated in the first place. Some places have more natural resources or are more fertile than others and eventually, a certain group would pop up and try to privatize it instead of sharing it with others. That's just how we operate on a fundamental level. You also can't have direct democracy on the scale that we are today (7 billion+) and there are no two people who share the same needs or whose needs would not eventually oppose the other. There are also individuals who would eventually try to accommodate and privatize power and resources and those who would flock around them, so anarchism would always result in a power vacuum that would eventually be filled (and most probably with a form of fascist/authoritarian regime). This is just basic human nature that can't be argued. 

All in all, anarchism seems like a nice fairytale utopia, but it rejects reality as a whole and can never be reached (at least not without major and worse consequences that wouldn't be worth it in the long run in my opinion), so as a thought experiment, it's nice, but as a true ideology one tries to follow through and enforce, it just falls apart as an ignorant and juvenile escapist fantasy."

**NOTE**: First of all, please don't respond with something to the effect of ""stop with the Oppression Olympics."" Of course all oppression is bad. But too many people believe that South Asian Americans have it great just because a disproportionate amount have achieved success, when in reality these are just a few individuals and it could easily be argued that South Asian are among the most oppressed minority groups.

Yes, it is true that South Asians are on average the highest income ethnic group, but that's despite enormous oppression and *only* because those who are well off can afford to immigrate here. South Asians who are poor or middle-class (which is the vast majority of them in the US) have it terribly.

And this is the most oppressed *ethnic* group. Of course groups of people such as the poor and disabled are more oppressed.

Think about it. Groups such as blacks, Latinos, and Arabs are often subject to discrimination by, for a lack of a better word, ""conservative"" institutions such as police/TSA. They are often subject to racial profiling by both institutions and regular people due to their dark complexions invoking a sense of fear among many (mostly white) people. 

However, these groups are favored by, for a lack of a better word, ""liberal"" institutions such as academia. Affirmative action policies make it much easier for these people to get into top schools, get hired by employers, etc. 

However, people don't fear East Asians like they do for people of other minority groups. If anything, East Asians are typically stereotyped as feminine and weak, so they are usually never subject to racial profiling by institutions such as the TSA/police, have an easier time assimilating into white communities, etc. People don't associate East Asians with a sense of ""danger"" like they do to blacks/Hispanics. 

On the flip side, affirmative actions fucks over East Asians, far more so than white people. Top schools and employers do everything they can to limit the amount of Asians. They hold them to ridiculously higher standards. Without affirmative action, top schools would be far less white and far more Asian percentage-wise. 

South Asians usually face the same discrimination from institutions and regular people as blacks/Hispanics/Arabs do. South Indians are often confused as black and face the same discrimination from the police that African-Americans do. North Indians/Pakistanis face the same discrimination from groups such as the TSA that Arabs do (regardless of whether or not they are Muslim, people always associate their looks with Islam). White people fear South Asians like they fear blacks/Hispanics/Arabs due to them falling into the category of being ""scary-looking brown people.""

However, the affirmative action system fucks over South Asians just as much as it fucks over East Asians. South Asians have a much harder time getting into top schools, getting hired by employers, and are held to ridiculously higher standards. South Asians, just like East Asians, have to get a significantly higher ACT/SAT score to be equivalent to a white or black applicant. ""Liberal"" institutions do everything they can to limit the amount of South Asians. 

**South Asians are the only group of people that face MASSIVE discrimination from both ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" institutions.**"

Even though a person is unconscious when they are asleep, they can still establish to their partner that they can have sex with them when they are asleep.  

I think this view is sound but I’m open to changing it.


I was having a conversation with a friend of mine online about this. We will call them “7”.

7 asks me if they can ask me a morbid question. I tell them to go ahead.

7: Do you think having sex with someone while they’re asleep is rape?

Me: It widely considered rape unless both parties agree to it.

7: From what I can tell, rape is when someone penetrates someone without their consent.

Me: They cannot consent when they are asleep but they can consent when they’re awake beforehand.

7: I don’t understand. Doesn’t this ignore the fact that the person asleep can’t actually give consent, even when they gave it beforehand?

Me: No. I can consent to having my organs donated before I die. Then when I die, that consent doesn’t disappear.

7: How do I say this. Hold on.

Me: Take your time.

7: Could you also say that a girl gives consent to say, being drugged and allowing her boyfriend to have sex her in that state? Would that still be consent? It would still be rape as you had sex with an unconscious person.

Me: C’mon, 7, if the consent was already given, then it doesn’t matter. By that logic, you’d be implying that one cannot consent to having ones organs donated upon death.

7: I haven’t thought of this like that. I’m not too sure on how to think about this.

Me: It’s fine.

This is the end of the conversation.

I’d like you to:

1) Demonstrate how having sex with someone while they were asleep is rape even if consent was given beforehand. 

2) Debunk or demonstrate my Organ consent analogy.

I’m looking forward to your comments!"

It should be obvious that I'm not a native English speaker

This is the logic behind my post

1 furries ""actually"" have sex with other furries which are easy to find

2 zoophiles have sex with animals, which is pretty easy to arrange and hide

3 some countries consider beastility legal or simply don't care as well as you don't cause a scene and the furries in these countries are most definitely active zoophiles.

3  lolicons, on the other hand, read some comics, watch some hentai, play some games and cry about it

4 getting children is thankfully difficult, and children COULD, CAN and may talk about it

5 paedophilia is illegal in most countries and it is always frowned upon, which makes being an active paedophile thankfully harder

lolicons are considered paedophiles because they are attracted to children (which is the meaning of paedophilia) not because they are actually active

I don't see why this logic is not applied to furries

Edit1: so as I said I suck at English so my points suck so I will try to explain my post

from 1,2,3,4,5 we get that it is more possible for a furry to be a zoophilie than a lolicon to be an active paedophile

lolicons are MOSTLY considered paedophiles while furry aren't considered zoophiles

lolicons watch a cartoon about children               furry likes Costumes of animals

lolicons are considered paedophiles because of this

why aren't furries considered zoophiles

&amp;#x200B;

∆  
so furries aren't zoophiles because ""we can't prove it""

and most lolicon are paedophiles because "" they are more disgusting than zoophiles and we can't prove they aren't"" 

I will most likely re-post this after I become fluent in English, (so about 7 months), if something didn't happen to me then and I'm alive I hope to have a better conversation than this and maybe make some friends 

I will not respond to any other comment about the topic as they are mostly far from the point I wanted to make and  only u/shemademedoit1 got what I really meant

I don't understand their view but I respect it. I want to understand what evidence they have to make their claim. They do not think my viewpoint on the matter is reflective of reality, so I want to see if I can change my view. 

Take me as an example. Some people think I am very religious. I'm Hindu, so I try to meditate, do yoga,  chant mantras and perform puja every day. Puja is a kind of prayer. I want to be vegetarian in future because of compassion to animals (the reason I am not now is outside of my control). I celebrate the festivals like Diwali, Navaratri and Holi each year. All of this is my own decision because I think it is the best way for me to live life. No one is coercing me or persuading me to do it, like some atheists  think.

People have a religion because they believe it to be true and/or the best way of living life. I have Christian friends who follow their religion and they also agree that they are Christian because they believe it is true and the best way to live life. Same with all the Muslims I am blessed to have as friends. 

Religion is not controlling. It's about surrendering you life to what you think is true and best for you. If it was controlling then people would be forced to meditate, pray, chant, be vegetarian etc. There is no place that I am aware of where this is the case. 

I want to understand the other perspective without making my IRL friend angry, so I came here. Let's have a good discussion. 

Namaste and blessings to you all."

1) There may be a private adoption agency that has practices that closely align with an adoptive family. 

2) Foster to adopt is different per state and when a family moves multiples times every few years, it makes it tough to use that process. 

3) Families may not be interested in foster to adopt because of the emotional toll on the families if a child is ultimately returned to their birth family."

I'm not sure where the classification begins and ends, and googling leaves me a touch unsure overall, but surely the largest island would be the combined American continent(s), if an island classification is so broad as to include Australia.

Inventing the spinoff versions of artificial limbs, phone cameras, insulin pumps, air purifiers just to name a few. 

In 2021 NASA received $25 billion from the US government the fit their budget spending. This may seem like a lot and whilst it's almost a good enough budget for NASA. I don't think the budget is going to age well. For one NASA is planning to send man back on the moon with their Artemis mission. As we all know sending people to space alone is  costly and it's not something to happens overnight. For example the Apollo 11 mission costed about 25 billion in the 70's, and that adjusted for inflation today is about $250 billion. 

Now this is only one side of the argument another side is that people believe that $25 billion a year is more than enough for NASA. Considering that that budget is used to ""fuel scientists curiosity"" and won't directly influence anything on earth. Now whilst this might seem like a good argument I've already stated NASA's impacts on society, and inventions that have come along with space research. Also considering that the US military budget is $600 billion compared to NASA's $25 billion budget, you start to see why NASA is hugely underfunded.

With that preface, let’s face the issue:

Do the genders (however many you may believe there are) have definitions? In other words, are there any defining attributes or characteristics of the genders?

I ask this because I’ve been told that anyone can identify as any gender they want (is this true?). If that premise is true, it seems that it also logically follows that there can’t be any defining factors to any genders. In other words, no definitions. Does this make sense? Or am I missing something?

So here is my real confusion. What is the value of a word that lacks a definition? What is the value of a noun that has no defining characteristics or attributes?

Are there other words we use that have no definitions? I know there are words that we use that have different definitions and meanings to different people, but I can’t think of a word that has no definition at all. Is it even a word if by definition it has no or can’t have a definition?

It’s kind of a paradox. It seems that the idea of gender that many hold to today, if given a definition, would cease to be gender anymore. Am I missing something here?

There is a lot more to be said, but to keep it simple, I’ll leave it there. 

I genuinely am looking forward to engaging with those I disagree with in order to better understand. If you comment, please expect me to engage with you vigorously. 

Best,
Charm

Edit: to clarify, I do believe gender is defined by biological sex and chromosomes. Intersex people are physical abnormalities and don’t change the normative fact that humans typically have penises and testicals, or vaginas and ovaries. The same as if someone is born with a 3rd arm. We’d still say the normative human has 2 arms."

I saw the video of Stephen Fry describing the difference between the US Office and the UK Office and perhaps he has a point, but I want to hear from you guys. I can speak from personal experience here. I’m American and love the panel shows I have access to on YT (8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, Big Fat Quizzes, WILTY, Taskmaster, and the one Mel G. does). I’ve seen The Thick of It and loved that. I never finished the IT Crowd but that’s popular over here. And I know there are some American sit coms that are popular in the UK (Big Bang Theory, which I hate, for instance). 

In short, I don’t think American and British comedy is that difference. Can you change my mind?"

Hateful people that get muted end up doubling down on their views. If the mods would let them speak then maybe a discussion could happen and the hateful people using the hate speech might understand who it effects better or at least recognize they are in the vast minority and they'll maybe become more sensitive to other peoples emotions. 
Recently i saw a post on /crazypeoplefacebook about abortion. Everyone who commented prolife opinions got removed while all prochoice opinions were left on display AND comments were locked. This is pissing off people and making them double down on their views. Also its driving people with those opinions away from reddit. While a lot of people prefer them not on the site, it's my view diversity of people on reddit is something very valuable because it gives insight to what and why other people are thinking. No discussion on that post was allowed. If it were allowed then maybe people might have a better understanding of eachother leading to maybe a mutual respect between the great divide of abortion. (Im prochoice btw not that it matters) 
Things mods should continue to censor are 1- spam. Cause we have so many mechanisms to get people heard. You can sort by controversial, hot, new, best and so on. 
2- misinformation. If something is blatantly wrong and is trying to use false information to push an agenda then that is harmful to the community because individuals are being tricked. Obviously hatespeech and misinformation go hand in hand a lot of the time but I'm talking about just misinformation.

Tldr is mods are actively working against their own goals when censoring certain things."

59,2022-10-16,CMV: Government owning the 'means of production' is different from Workers owning it.,u/gray_clouds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y5x4bk/cmv_government_owning_the_means_of_production_is/,changemyview,"I'm not intending to debate Socialism vs. Capitalism, but I notice advocates of Socialism often claim that they support the idea of ""workers"" owning  various enterprises for which they work, instead of financiers.  I don't necessarily disagree in some cases,  but as I understand it, this describes something more along the lines of a 'Co-op' or a stock ownership plan.

My understanding of Socialism is that workers don't own enterprises literally.  The best someone can hope for as a worker, is that the Government acts in their interests and that some positive benefit (e.g. a profit share) accrues because of this.

I suppose that in the case of natural resources sold to foreign countries, it could make sense for the Government to charge a profit.  But these profits would be shared by the citizenry in general, not by workers specific to one enterprise or another.  And for domestic goods and services, it doesn't seem like the Government would want to earn ANY profit.  Why charge a profit margin to the collective citizenry just to turn around and give it back?

Without profits being distributed to workers, and without control over how an enterprise operates (this belongs to the Government), it seems like a stretch to say that the *workers own* the means of production.

In summary - I do think that Government ownership of industry, in some cases, can work out better for workers than private ownership, especially since it prevents a wealthy ownership class from diminishing the comparative purchasing power of workers.  But saying that ""workers"" own these industries (means of production) seems inaccurate  - especially since Government, the true owner, may become unaligned with the interests of their workers/citizens (e.g. totalitarianism etc.)

I could change my view if someone were to point out some examples where Government employees actually do participate as 'owners' in particular enterprises under Socialism, or perhaps some expanded definition of it."

0,2022-10-16,"CMV: Lifetime or ""no questions asked"" warranties are honoured at the expense of customers who care for and maintain their possessions.",u/MellowBuzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y5xjqh/cmv_lifetime_or_no_questions_asked_warranties_are/,changemyview,"Consumers who look after their possessions are unlikely to make a warranty claim after the standard legal/limited warranty period. This might be for a number of reasons.

1. Quality control is excellent in the first place - no claim

2. Customer maintenance prevents failure - no claim

3.  Item fails, but is not seen as a manufacturing failure (eg. item is intentionally mis-used) - no claim

4. Item fails, can't be assed - no claim

My thinking is the majority of lifetime warranty claims will be funded by a ""lifetime premium"" paid for by all customers. However, it mostly benefits those who are less diligent with maintenance or are perhaps slightly dishonest with how they've used the item. I accept that a ""lifetime premium"" is not easily quantifiable, but I would be more willing to pay a ""quality control"" premium instead.

In summary, in my opinion users who are conscious of maintenance will benefit more from quality control and less from lifetime warranties. Consumers should insist on durable products yet accept that realistically not everything can or should be ""buy it for life""."

I have seen clips of Fetterman struggle to speak after his stroke and heard the story of him pointing a shotgun at a black jogger, but I think that even that isn't enough to sway people from him because in many people's minds, the worst democrat is better than the best Republican.

Regarding Herschel vs Warnock, I have a hard time seeing how Herschel comes out on top for that one. Incumbents usually win reelection and Herschel isn't exactly the best challenger for Warnock.

The news media has done a great job attacking Oz and Walker.

Meanwhile, the House races are harder to keep track of and aren't as covered in the news because one house race is less likely to make or break who controls the house. Inflation and the economy seem to be the number one concern for many voters and Republicans are generally seen to be better in handling these issues by the American public than the Democrats.

2. Market power: after a critical mass of sellers choose a certain service, the rest have to use it as well as it becomes the most convenient consumer choice. They can use this power to increase their prices for transactions to levels above what is socially optimal.

3. Middle men serve the purpose of connecting buyers and sellers. From a social perspective, any government should want to make this connection as easy as possible.

Usually I ignore those, however I thought it would be interesting to see how they'd respond to arguments.

A few hours after posting a reply or two explaining why vaccines do in fact work, I received identical messages from r/gifs, r/oddlysatisfying, r/oddlyterrifying, r/Showerthoughts and r/youseeingthisshit stating that I had been permanently banned for interacting with the subreddit:

Now I don't value posting in ChurchOfCOVID a whole lot, so I deleted my comments containing the arguments and sources. Looking at how that scales, the only people that will keep interacting with that subreddit are people who value their access to that subreddit more than me. This left me with the impression that this policy might discourage  people with dissenting pro-vaccine messages more than people who will keep the echo chamber alive (and who might be dependent on the sense of community). In my case it made me remove scientific evidence that vaccines work, which I don't want to happen more often.

Note that I'm not arguing that the benefits of this are not worth the cost, even though I'm not convinced of that either.

I am strictly stating that the costs of this policy are significant, and might even be counterproductive in some aspects.

I've seen this argument made several times in the past few weeks, that pro-life voters who still vote for Walker after learning he's paid for an abortion are being hypocritical or inconsistent with their stated values. As if I've seen it expressed, if they truly believe abortion is murder, then they're voting for a murderer, and this contradicts their stance. 

I don't find this compelling at all. Georgia pro-life voters are faced with a limited set of choices: 1) vote for someone who's paid for an abortion but will vote to make it less legal, 2) vote for someone who isn't known to have paid for an abortion, but will vote to make abortion more available, 3) don't vote/vote for someone who has essentially zero chance of winning. 

It stands to reason that if you think abortion is murder, option 1 is the choice which maximizes the probability that access to abortion will be limited in the future. Options 2 and 3 both limit the pro-life voter's ability to (in their eyes) ""stop babies from being murdered"". If abortion is your top priority, voting for Walker is voting for your own interests in FPTP system.

***

Caveats:

* Walker himself appears to be a hypocrite, a liar, and a generally untrustworthy politician. I'm not arguing pro-life voters wouldn't have valid reasons not to vote for him. 

* I don't personally hold the US ""pro-life"" position, and would not be likely to vote for Walker if I lived in GA.

39,2022-10-17,CMV: “Gatekeeping” nature’s lesser known beautiful places a bit is okay.,u/Hikingtheworld96,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y6kelw/cmv_gatekeeping_natures_lesser_known_beautiful/,changemyview,"I’ve had some of the best moments of my life in nature, and I wouldn’t want to keep those experiences from anyone. 

IMO as much as I love the amazing Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, the overlooks are usually pretty crowded and you only get a few seconds of a view of the waterfall before you feel like you need to let other people see. 

“Devils Bridge” in Sedona is an amazing red rock formation with a stunning background.. but you have to wait in line for 30 mins to get your turn to go across, all while putting up with blasting music from four competing music speakers. 

Angles landing? Super fun and thrilling hike that can make you feel alive… not super fun gripping the chains in a traffic jam with 1000 drop right underneath you as people are literally climbing over you to go the opposite direction. 

I really do still enjoy these extraordinary places and there’s a reason for the hype, and not much I can think of to stop it at this point. 

However as amazing as these places are, I don’t think there is anything that beats having a remote mountain lake practically to yourself, a slot canyon where you don’t see anyone all day, a stretch of wilderness for miles with no signs of human in sight. 

To find these places, you need to put some effort in usually. It involves research, finding out the right approach and season, and any other red tape with permits and such. 

I’m arguing that it should stay that way. 

Something that has been increasingly getting on my nerves is people who have large followings posting about these lesser known spots, with exactly how to get there and specific instructions. 

I’m not talking about posting about the Grand Canyon or spots that are already pretty busy… 

but any spot or trail where it’s likely you will only see maybe 10 people or less through the whole day. 

Anything with more natural traffic than that… I don’t really have an issue with. 

I can think of one social media account in particular that was posting about a trail where you’d maybe see 0-4 people on daily. 

They have more than 100k followers. Obviously not all of them are just gonna flock over there… but if just 1% of those followers go check out the area, the normal usage amount for the year doubles instantly. 


Here are my main concerns summarized. 

1. These lesser known places are fragile and cannot handle the increased traffic that irresponsible social media posts can generate. 
2. These places could be dangerous to those just going off a social media post without doing more research. 
3. It doesn’t actually take THAT much effort to do your own research and find these areas, and anyone who puts in the extra time should be rewarded with the solitude they seek. 
4. Humans tend to ehm… ruin everything. The more people can easily find a place (where typically more research would be needed) the faster that place runs into the problems that all the other hot spots face. 

Solution ? 

Don’t post geotags or specific location information to these lesser known spots. 
Keep using the #keepthewestwild to spread awareness that it’s a good practice. 

It should be more socially accepted to roast these accounts that share too much.  

Instead maybe give tips on HOW to find these places and leave it up to those willing to put in the effort. 

Again, I’m totally cool with anyone finding these places, so long as they put in the effort to do so. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk."

I'm deeply disappointed with how liberals/progressives within and outside government have such an aggressive views on say gun control to the point of banning firearms or magazines. I understand where they come from but I feel its only adding more fuel to a buckling partisan keg in this country. I feel there are better policies to argue like for background checks and addressing material conditions rather than continue hard line policies that have a history of targeting marginalized groups in the past. I realize there are crazy gun nuts on the right forming militias posing a threat, but I'd rather not further vindicate their perceived notions on government  taking gun rights away and giving them greater potential for tribal ideological recruitment. The push back against this only seems to feed this partisan divide. Given the conservative makeup of the courts, I feel some of these weapon/magazine ban measures are futile and a waste of time better spent on other policies. I feel like things have become so partisan/polarized where it leaves little room to have meaningful conversations and good solutions to our mounting problems. I have no community and no prospects of seeing a hopeful future seeing the course we're on. I just want to tune out of politics completely even though I'd be contributing to apathy, but the feeling is definitely there. The neoliberal paradigm is still going strong even though its cracks are showing no one seems interested enough to break from it. I feel like our fate is already sealed and collapse is inevitable and maybe just maybe it'd be a good idea for more level headed people across the political spectrum to have firearms than just the police/military or republicans for that matter."

I know we have all heard of the trope about men complaining that woman just lay there and does nothing, which a lot people glance over. It gives us the association that having a vagina=/=good at sex. A woman doing nothing really does make her no better imo. 



Concluding this im essentially saying all of you men and woman just suck at sex lmao




Adding: Also Id like to add that it really doesn’t make sense for the assumption that woman are better since for a lot of them sex and sex education is a BIG no from their families."

Secondly, fuck the CCP. I don't really engage myself in protests, but Xi needs to stop the ethnic cleansing his government officials are doing in the northwest.

That said, if I had to choose between mainland China, Japan and South Korea... I would probably still choose China.

I feel like I would blend more easily into the Chinese society, they are more diverse and China in general seems less crowded. Their population density is way lower than the one of South Korea or Japan, for one. I also think Chinese cities are fairly well planned... despite sometimes horrifying traffic jams I've seen during the Chinese new year.

Secondly, I feel like the average Chinese is more friendly, and dare I say more liberal, than the average Korean or Japanese. Sure, I base this off my interactions with such people online. I feel like the Korean and Japanese societies are waaaay too conservative and formal for my taste. The work culture in China can be pretty harsh (996) but it's a joke compared to what I've heard Japan and South Korea's work cultures feel like. Everyone is familiar with the term karoshi, and it's true. Many still die.

And third, the Chinese culture. I never found k-pop appealing, and I rarely watch anime nowadays, so I think China appeals to me the most here. Ignoring the whole propaganda and party doctrine, I still feel like China has a ton to offer. This is a 5000-year old country with so much to be explore.

I'm aware this is a massive hot take and I would like to have my opinion changed. It doesn't feel right for me to find a land with such an authoritarian regime more appealing, but it is what it is."

I understand that cultural relativism and moral relativism are useful framework from which we view the *individual and isolated* cultural practices that are different from one culture to another. However, I'm **not** arguing against the idea of cultural relativism whereby cultural relativism is defined as:

&gt;Cultural relativism:  the idea that a person's beliefs and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture. Proponents of cultural relativism also tend to argue that the norms and values of one culture should not be evaluated using the norms and values of another (wikipedia)

**Arguing for or against cultural or moral relativism as philosophical subject is not the intent of this post.**

I am arguing that *some* cultures are morally superior to other cultures at least partially in a following manner:

Definition 1: Morality is defined as a system or principle under which right from wrong or good behaviors from bad behaviors are discerned.

Definition 2: Moral superiority is defined when an entity displays a more right actions than wrong actions, or more good behaviors than bad behaviors when compared to another entity.

1. Society A is morally superior to society B if society A displays qualities that are more good and less bad when compared to society B.
2. American South between 100-200 years in the past employed a **legal system** and **normative social paradigm** where one human being could be owned or subjugated by another human being which was not only socially acceptable, but normative
3. While we cannot quantify every single aspect of cultural practices and behaviors, we can at least compare a single (and an important) aspect of culture between that society and today's society - where owning and subjugating another human being is normative in one, it is not in another.
4. Therefore, the contemporary culture of the 21st century America is superior to the cultures of American South 100-200 years in the past.
5. Therefore, *at least one* culture is demonstrably superior to one other culture. In other words, ""some cultures are morally superior to others""

I have personally come across personal attacks and character diagnosis (to what I am not) for agreeing to the following statement ""I believe some cultures are better than another."" for the exact reason I have stated above. Please CMV.

Edit:

(1) I meant to be more clear in saying that all other things being mostly equal, a culture can be deemed more moral than another by comparing single or a few distinguishing differences. I understand that comparing every single aspect of moral action is impossible. But apparently, I wasn't clear enough.

(2) Arguing moral philosophy isn't my intention. But I'd be willing to discuss this as a part of larger argument against my point. I understand it's impossible to discuss this without at least mentioning some moral philosophy.

(3) I worded ""owning and subjugating other human being (as a property)"" and intentionally did not use the word ""slavery"" because that can muddy the water.

(4) Thanks for the responses thus far, I'll take a break and come back in few hours.

EDIT 2:

(1) So far, I've awarded delta for two points: one, that pointed to the inconsistencies in my wording as to comparing aspects of culture vs the whole culture as superior or inferior; and two, that the argument cannot escape moral philosophy of as the basis of it

(2) To clear things out, my position is NOT that modern culture X is superior or inferior to another modern culture Y. My argument is that your very own culture x years ago was inferior to your very own culture today, or vice versa. I'm of the position that you cannot compare two cultures that are geologically, historically, linguistically or religiously removed. Any arguments that suggest comparing country X and country Y are moot points to my argument.

(3) Nobody has directly mentioned this so I couldn't award a delta (please direct me if you think someone mentioned this point - I'll award them) But my position shifted a little bit

- Before: At least one culture is superior to another culture
- Now: Everyone believes at least one culture is superior to another culture."

Time and time again, videos and records of police interactions that show a clear retaliation/escalation due to someone simply recording their interaction (which ironically enough, is the very reason why you should be recording every police interaction you have). It's ridiculous that by now in late 2022, there are still police officers who don't understand that citizens have a legal right to record public officials on duty.

Even if you are not a fan of being recorded, it doesn't change the fact that citizens are legally allowed to record in public, and that no one, including police officers, has a right to privacy on public land.

If a police officer doesn't like being recorded, they shouldn't hold a public position. Everyone should record every interaction they have with a government official concerning official business no matter how minor it may seem. You have the right for a reason."

Basically, I just got blocked and downvoted for saying bigotry against Irish people isn’t racism, it’s xenophobia. When I think racism, I think attacking people because of physical traits they share with other members of their group. Whereas xenophobia is about attacking people because of what geological region they’re from. Xenophobia has historically been a little more common in western Europe, because people don’t have many distinctly different physical traits to attack. I know for a part of history Irish people were considered a race simply as a way to put them on the same level as black people. However, nowadays no one would call Irish people a race, so to me it makes no sense to call what they experienced racism, and instead it should be referred to as xenophobia. The only time I would could think of where calling it racism would make sense would be if one were analysing an old text that also referred to it as racism, but people are trying to say we should always call it racism, which I don’t understand."

They can also create a climate of emotional rigidity where ‘negative’ emotions — sadness, anger, doubt, alienation, or apathy are more difficult to express or work through given that the stage is set for only belief, orthodoxy, and happiness.

My point is not that the police system is good, rather, it is that the most of Reddit is basing its opinions off of a narrative instead of data. It is seen as cool to hate all police officers, and this is a self propagating narrative - a filter bubble.

If you look at [this video](https://youtu.be/p48pls0xYXA) these aren’t people who are merely bad at their job, these are people who are actively malicious and cruel. This isn’t a public facility, but it is a line of work occupied by many public sector workers, and the US even has a long history of public mental institutions abuse of patients. 

When you cross the veil from mere neglect to actual cruelty, that’s a personality trait at work, not incompetence nor is it simple dispassion of one’s work. 

So what I’m saying is if you’re a teacher making the case that better pay will make your standard of teaching improve, I just don’t believe you, especially since there’s a good chance your higher pay will actually eat away at other funding then school needs, like textbooks (my school we used to have to share textbooks between two due to low funding), school lunches, equipment, new teachers, classes might grow, etc. 

So while I can understand that there are people who might be competent at a job who aren’t going into it due to pay, I absolutely reject the idea that better pay makes an incompetent employee more competent. At most it’ll make them more inclined to cover their ass, but it won’t make them good at their job.

On the list of things that would improve a public sector profession’s performance, staff pay, especially when we’re talking small incremental raises, doesn’t affect things nearly as much as equipment, assistance, workload and general funding.

A teacher making $30K with a class of 15 and a textbook per student will have better outcomes than a teacher making $35K with a class of 30 and shared textbooks, equalizing for other factors. 

This also isn’t a comment specifically on the public sector, but since it’s an argument usually made on behalf of the public sector, I think addressing it like this helps.

To refer you back to the video, higher pay for those workers wouldn’t have changed a thing. Funding security cameras, extra staff and better training likely would have prevented it. 

I’m not telling you to stop arguing for better public sector pay, I agree many professions are underfunded, but stop making the efficiency argument, pay is one of the least important factors in improving professionalism and efficiency. I’m also not making any sweeping comments broadly about any one profession (but obviously the most common ones are things like teachers, civil services, in many countries nurses and doctors, etc). 

If you’re the type of nurse who, for example, assaults patients, an incremental pay rise of 3-5% is not magically going to make you not that person. Cameras in every room and frequent independent security patrols, however, will (or at least significantly reduce your rate of assaults). If you’re a teacher who just sits in class on your phone and tells 30 kids to read pages 40-60 for the hour, an incremental pay rise of 3-5% isn’t going to make you a more involved teacher. A teaching assistant, smaller class, random inspections and cameras will. 

At the risk of pre-emptively dismissing evidence, if you provide a study that shows “we studied 5 companies that raised pay and all 5 grew in efficiency”, I’d only ask that you try checking for other factors like changes in management, lay-offs, staff turnover, upgraded security, etc. Because often times companies don’t make single policy changes in a vacuum. And I do accept that broadly speaking better pay attracts better candidates. But teachers who say “maybe grades would be higher if teachers got paid more”, no they wouldn’t. Not unless you’re admitting to intentionally slacking off on your job to strong arm the government for better pay, which is extortion. I’ve done jobs for low pay and there’s always a spectrum of competency. If one person can do a good job on shit pay then you can all do it. And we all remember wonderful teachers who got paid the same damn amount as the shit ones. It isn’t about pay, it’s about passion and temperament."

UNLESS you take into account that our Society (pop culture, education system, and even parents) create a negative impression in children, adolescents, and young adults that marriage is a trap / a grind / unrewarding / a long-shot. 

Therefore, rather than equip the next generation with the mindsets and skills that would help them have healthy, fulfilling marriages and family lives, we just tell them to postpone that as long as possible and maybe avoid it all together. 

In this way, our society is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of saying domestic life is bad, then ensuring that it will be bad by poisoning the well.

I see this as just as harmful to society as it would be in the opposite direction. 

Humans by nature have the mentality of us vs them. One easy way to be joined in camaraderie is to have a common enemy. This tactic has been used historically to beat down people who are oppressed. From my point of view we have finally reach a point in (US) society that everyone can have a voice in normal conversation. Many people appear to be using that to “Get back” at the historical oppression by doing the same things they did. Only their words are only heard by normal people who receive hate for characteristics out of their control, which creates a divide that we have been working to remove. 

It feels as many of those people believe the right to insult and hate as they please has been earned by generations of being in the receiving end. But it is my belief that just because someone has been awful towards you, if you are awful back you are just as bad as they are. 

I have called out many of the people close to me on what seems like blatant racism or sexism, but they have refused and told me that to have racism or sexism there needs to be a power dynamic which does not currently exist for minorities. The way I see it they are confusing effect with cause. 

They are basing their ideas on the simple fact of “racism bad”. Which is correct, but they fall down the same path the many true racists do of “Racism is bad, but I am not bad. Therefore what I said was not racist”. Rather than the more accurate “Racism is bad, but I am not bad. Therefore I made an easy mistake and can change in the future”

I have many times been left out of groups due to my perceived appearance. It is much less frequent than if I were black, but it is not less valid or hurtful. If I were to turn around and insult those people due to being Asian or women I would be just as bad, if not worse than they were. 

As a whole it is one of my deep beliefs that one can not fight hate with hate. So if someone claims to be an LGBTQ advocate then insults someone about being straight they are being hypocritical to their cause and making the world a more hateful place. 

I am not saying to not fight oppression or to never insult people. I am just saying it should be more taboo to insult people based on things they can’t control.

*Correction: The title implies that it is equally hurtful on a personal level. I meant for it to read as equally hurtful to society as a whole. I also do not at any point claim that I am oppressed or try to dismiss the greater effect that racism and sexism has to minorities and women. Please stop acting like I have a victim complex, I just think these insults should be seen as bad when they often are supported.*"
0,2022-10-18,CMV: Legitimate far-left and far-right criticism of the Ukraine Crisis is being Dismissed Outright by the Public,u/Paper-logic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y7allx/cmv_legitimate_farleft_and_farright_criticism_of/,changemyview,"&amp;#x200B;

From Aaron Mate to Tucker Carlson, anti-establishment sentiment among both the far-left and far-right parts of the American and other liberal democratic electorates are incentivized to criticize the established narrative of the Ukraine conflict. I’m a leftist, and while I'm under no illusion that the rhetoric of far-right gurus like Carlson is anything other than phony, I believe that many of his far-right viewers recognize an element of truth in his criticism of the US.

I became skeptical of the mainstream narrative when I noticed that there was virtually no serious discussion of the larger geopolitical significance of the conflict in establishment publications like *Foreign Affairs*.  Furthermore, Ukraine is often romanticized. For example, In the most recent issue of *Foreign Affairs*, Timothy Snyder spends the first three pages of his article promoting Ukraine as a cultural Mecca of the West and invoking romantic imagery that situates the tyrannical Putin against a peaceful and contemplative Ukrainian democratic pluralism.

The US has a long history of acting in its own interests at the expense of other nations, and this seems to me to present an obvious question: What does the US benefit from this war? More often than not, however, mainstream commentators either dismiss this question as unimportant because the ends justify the means or attribute a degree of benevolence to US foreign policy which would be precedent-setting. While the Ukrainians may want US support, establishment figures from Lloyd Austin to Mitch McConnell have made it clear that they are, in effect, willing to use the Ukrainians as cannon fodder to weaken Russia.

What I find striking about the public perception of the war is that the public often attributes the use of Ukrainians against Russia as a benevolent act on behalf of the US. This notion is usually centred on the belief that the Ukrainians deserve to be free from Russian aggression. I agree in spirit, but the question I have is why so many Westerners are so deeply invested in Ukraine, specifically. Where was the sustained outrage when the US pulled out of Afghanistan and allowed the Taliban to retake control? What about arming the Yemenis, or other oppressed peoples around the world? In my experience, this kind of inconsistency is usually symptomatic of an uncontested ideological commitment.

When both far-left and far-right critics of the war point out the expansion of NATO after the cold war as a legitimate concern for Russia, they are accused of spreading Russian disinformation or of far-right punditry. This accusation is very rarely accompanied by serious criticism. Instead, accusers rely on the public fear of disinformation that appears to have arisen from mass disillusionment with institutions that were traditionally charged with protecting the flow of information. For example, whether you agree with John Mearsheimer’s treatment of the Ukraine conflict as apart with balance of power politics, it’s hard to ignore that his treatment is constituted by the rigorous argument expected from an academic environment. But because his treatment resembles the Russian narrative, he is dismissed from the mainstream narrative outright. It’s as if the public no longer believes it can judge the truth for itself, so they subscribe to the proverb ‘see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.’

When I began to attempt to understand the geopolitical significance of the Ukraine conflict, what struck me was how easy it was to expose the inconsistencies in the mainstream narrative. A commentator will begin by assuring the public that Putin is a perfect tyrant, in full control of the Russian people, but in the next sentence they will point out that his rule is fragile and dependent on the oligarchs. When it comes to nuclear weapons, Putin is apparently sane enough to recognize the stupidity of using them, but insane enough to invade Ukraine in the first place. These kinds of inconsistencies are common in the mainstream narrative, so I’m guessing that the reason the public doesn’t recognize them is that they share in them and thus have no reason to question them. But when I did begin questioning these inconsistencies, I quickly discovered that the mainstream narrative whitewashes Western interests.

I’m a leftist, and I don’t support the far-right worldview, but I believe that the far-right electorate are, like the far-left, incentivized to question the mainstream narrative, at least at present. This has led establishment figures to adopt a strategy of smearing the far-left by identifying them with the far-right. No argument against the far-left is needed because the fear of the far-right among the establishment part of the electorate is so great that they are incentivized to dismiss all divergence from their worldview as an insidious attempt to usurp power. This is so dangerous because it refuses to debate any potential legitimate criticism of the mainstream narrative.

If what I’m saying is unclear, I will clarify. Thanks, in advance.

Fortunate Son was a song telling us about the government sending young poor folks to fight in a war they wanted no business with while the rich kids stayed from it. Black Bird was about a young black woman/girl struggling through the segregation of Jim crow or The little rock incident where black kids were escorted to school by the national guard. so their music was always about some that needed to be talked nonetheless their music was much more experimental like using tambourines, Hammond organs, Harmonicas, and Sitars something that previous generations of rock never used. while their successors in the 80s just made their guitars heavier and mostly used Synthesizers. their music also always revolved around sex and drugs as-well. they never delved into anything else but vulgarity while i know that many 60s bands talked about that as-well. it was not the only thing they sung about. these bands like Motley crue, Guns N Roses, Bon Jovi, and etc always went out to be derogatory and that was there stick. Songs like Cherry Pie, Welcome To the Jungle, Girls, Girls, And etc sound too much alike while their 60s predecessors always sounded more diverse with their music. so thats my argument. thank you"

We need to learn to separate the Artist from the Art.,u/OhSoManyThoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y7dknx/cmv_cancelation_or_accountability_should_be/,changemyview,"With Canceling people (i.e., holding people accountable for their actions) becoming more and more common, one of the things that I personally am struggling with is the common suggestion of boycotting art because of an artist’s involvement.

I disagree with such boycotts for a couple of reasons:
1. In many cases, the person being canceled isn’t the only one involved. A movie or TV show, for example, often has hundreds of people involved in it. By pushing to boycott a a movie/tv show cause of 1 person (no matter how prominent their role is in it), you’re also boycotting the work put in by so many people who did nothing wrong. You’re punishing a whole group for the actions of 1 person. 
2. Art needs to be isolated from Artist cause if you don’t, you’ll lose out on some great art. You can hate MJ and Kanye, but should you also hate Thriller and Graduation? Cause they’re masterpieces, and when you begin to boycott the art cause of the artist, the world becomes a little less creative.

So yea, we need to learn to separate the art from the artist. You should be able to say American Beauty is an exceptional piece of cinema, while also agreeing that Kevin Spacey is an awful human being. Louis CK’s jokes are great, but he’s still an asshole.

Also, it goes without saying that art and your appreciation of it is purely subjective, so if you genuinely cannot even get to that point of appreciating it cause you see Kevin Spacey on screen and thinking about what MJ did (which is completely understandable and fair btw), that is completely fair."
0,2022-10-18,CMV: USB C is a bad standard,u/Generic_Lad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y7dlku/cmv_usb_c_is_a_bad_standard/,changemyview,"USB C is a bad standard for consumers, and while it may be in many respects the best connector in 2022 due to its wide adoption, its a great example of what not to do and its design flaws will lead to consumer confusion and lots of waste. 

A principle design for connectors should be that if the connector fits in a port, it should work with the system. This isn't the case with USB C. If your computer has, for example, a USB C port but isn't a Thunderbolt port (or USB 4) it won't work, yet it is difficult for consumers to know what a cable or port is. The same cable which charges my phone fits into my laptop, but it won't (quickly) charge my laptop. But the cable which charges my phone has higher data transfer rates than the cable which charges my laptop. 

I cannot tell by looking at a USB C cable the underlying protocol or what the power is rated on. This is in contrast to USB A where I can easily tell what protocol the port and cable is expecting. White = 1.1, Black = 2.0, Blue = 3.0, Light Blue = 3.1, Red = 3.2. This makes it easy for me to find what ports are on my computer are running which version and match cables. I have a reasonable expectation that plugging in a USB cable with a blue end to a blue port on my computer will get me USB 3.0 speeds. I cannot tell from a random USB C cable floating in my drawer what power its rated for or the underlying USB speeds. This is bad for consumers (and the environment) because it will lead to people throwing away cables that they view as ""defective"" despite them performing to specification or people not using other cables other than what is provided with their system because its unclear if it will work. 

In addition to the unclear labelling and mixture of different protocols (a ""USB C"" cable can be USB 2.0-4.0 or Thunderbolt), the design for USB C at the physical level is bad. If you look at a USB C port, you notice that there's a piece which sticks out of the port, if this breaks, the entire port will need to be replaced, for a small device like a phone its a very expensive or difficult repair for the general consumer to do. If a device has the charging port broken off, the device is basically considered dead. This means that a cable which is forced in incorrectly or is unexpectedly jerked around it can break off that piece and effectively kill the device. The ""male"" portion of the device should always be on the less expensive piece, Apple did this right in designing the physical connector for Lightning. Despite Android/iPhones having about 1:1 market share, I've never seen a physically damaged Lightning port which required replacement while I've seen multiple people have broken USB C ports requiring replacements. Most Lightning port ""repairs"" just involve removing lint or dust out of the port. 

Because of these reasons, USB C is a bad standard and needs adjustment, especially before governmental bodies try to mandate its use. At minimum, an easy-to-use standardized labelling needs to be applied to each port and cable allowing the end user to immediately know the underlying protocol and how much power it can carry"

I won’t repeat specifics, but I basically showed death penalty is a lawful result of a state’s duty to maintain peace from chaos in society. Despite this, people’s favorite argument against my view was that death penalty can’t justify the chance of killing an innocent, therefore it should never be used. This was by far the most common argument people have against death penalty, so the point of this post is really to argue in detail against this specific challenge. Basically this argument is just a restating of possibly two legal/moral principles.

The first is the: “it’s better to let the guilty free, than punish an innocent” principle from Emperor Justinian. This maxim was typically used to indicate that punishment is a serious consequence that should not be used sparingly and it’s misapplication can have big calamities. However, I argue that this principle finds its utility mostly in ensuring the state’s resources are used efficiently, and not as a moral indicative of not allowing certain punishments. This maxim of “better to let crime go than punish an innocent” was really just a way for law enforcers not be bogged down with cases involving dubious accusations. Meaning that if evidence for a crime is too precarious or of pure speculative nature (I.e, random accusations), then the presumed criminal shouldn’t be punished. Simply due to the fact that this opens up chance of wide punishments and cases that probably are too subjective to reach conclusive results. But this doesn’t mean the punishment itself shouldn’t be used when the criminal is found guilty to a reasonable degree (modern courts)…and historically this is true.

The second principle (maxim) I think people appeal to is: “it is better to receive an injustice than to give one”. In terms of those against death penalty, I think this maxim is being used to say that even if say a murder has been committed, the injustice of not solving the crime for the victim is preferable than the injustice of accidentally putting to death an innocent. And the fear of this injustice happening is great, that we should just ban death penalty in order to avoid such a scenario. Now my counter argument is while the death of innocent is unfortunate, it should be restated that death penalty is a job by the state…and the state needs to look at holistic picture. In order to ensure peace and stability, the state can’t let fear of failure dictate its functions. And while killing an innocent individual is traumatic, society will largely move on. Which means the state should still be allowed proceed the death penalty since it’s functions serve society as a whole, not particular individuals!

Therefore, the chance of sentencing an innocent to death is not a worthy argument to ban dearth penalty (or make its use nonexistent). This is easily the most common argument against death penalty I’ve seen, but I think I’ve refuted it here.

Now change my view and convince me this is still a valid argument against death penalty"

For example, let’s consider the story about the woman caught in adultery and how Jesus asked her accusers if they were without sin and for him that was without sin to cast the first stone. I’m probably the guy holding the stone many times and I’m not sure I’m correct in doing so. However, He was literally the person who created the rule in the first place. So I see examples like this as, perhaps, the exception and intentionally rare. 

My logic is this: At what point is it hurting people and/or society to support people in their mistakes? How often should we remove the natural consequences of people’s errors? And, at what point should we step in to help alleviate someone’s suffering? 

When I see people make terrible decisions I rarely feel like jumping to to help when it comes around to bite them in the butt. I feel like often the only teacher people have are the consequences of their actions. As a father I try to prepare my kids in advance so that they understand that when they mess up that they’re often going to have a hard time. I’ll be there to cheer them on as they fight to recover from it but I’m not going to give them a get out of jail free card. 

However, if someone is having a hard time but it’s due to no (perceived) fault of theirs, I’m very enthusiastic about helping. I just think the “line” is pretty far on the tough love side of the spectrum. 

So my CMV is this:

I don’t WANT to be a grumpy dad who goes around teaching people lessons. Help me become a little more charitable and mercy-minded towards people!"

I had one English class with the most lenient teacher in the whole school. If a student got up, walked to the back of the room to get (something), said something to their friend on the way back and sat back down all without saying a single word to the teacher, she would be totally cool with it, wouldn't even bat an eye




I know, crazy. People might call that chaos, the antithesis of a classroom environment, but from my experience the truth is that if students are given the option to run wild, but they have a teacher they respect,  they won't do it. The teachers at my school always used to say that you have to earn the teachers respect, but that should go both ways, and the best way a teacher can earn the respect of their students imo is to give them certain freedom




Give them the choice to stay in line, rather than threatening them to



I went to a decent school where not a lot of bad happened and any bad that did happen was quickly hidden away once every couple years so some guy with a clipboard could come in and pat us on the back, but I think that this could work for most schools where teachers fight for their authority over their pupils




What was that Toy Story quote? ""Authority should derive from the concent of the governed, not from the threat of force"" The teacher is only as powerful as the students let them be, but the most effective teacher is one who doesn't fight against that fact"

It sounds FUKIN terrible. But there is a lot of evidence that is pointing in this direction, and I'm *hoping* somebody to convince me otherwise. 

First, let's start by saying that there is a significant amount of evidence that shows that poverty has a negative impact on IQ. Which shouldn't really be too surprising. Stress, lack of sleep, poor eating or exercise, unhealthy food inhibit brain function. Poverty causes all those things. Minorities are more likely to experience poverty. That part isn't really controversial, there is a notable difference between poor and wealthy children's IQ. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20children%20from%20low%20SES,this%20difference%20had%20almost%20tripled.

There's really massive twin studies that have found that IQ is at least partially hereditary.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9242404/


On top of that, there's also evidence that poverty actually damages genes. 

https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/04/poverty-leaves-a-mark-on-our-genes/#:~:text=They%20discovered%20that%20lower%20socioeconomic,the%20genes%20in%20the%20genome.

And this is kind of the part where I'm hoping people can convince me otherwise. Because I don't understand that much about DNA and I'm hoping people can either show me a study that definitively proved otherwise, or can explain DNA a little better so that I can understand. 

My hypothesis is that multiple centuries of consistent poverty, slavery, abuse in Africa, wars in the middle east, poverty in India has done so much damage to genes that it is actually causing minorities to be born with a lower average IQ. 

I would love if somebody knew of maybe a multi racial adopted sibling study,  or a study that found another way controlled for poverty that found no difference."

1007,2022-10-18,CMV: Physical punishment of children is just normalized child abuse.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y7nwth/cmv_physical_punishment_of_children_is_just/,changemyview,"Yes, I believe that physical punishment on children, such as spankings and others, is all just normalized child abuse. Not only is it normalized but it's also glorified. There was a video on tik tok going around that showed a kid terrified, crying his eyes out and begging for his mom to not hit him and everyone was laughing about it in the comment section. 

Imagine your boss hitting you at work because you did something wrong. What about a relationship where a partner hits their significant other when they do something wrong? Why does the title, ""parent"", make it okay for a mom or dad to hit their child but in other situations, it's not okay? 

It's not okay. There are plenty of studies that prove the long term trauma affects of physical punishment on children. Many of these children grow up to be angry, reactive people and a nice chunk of them become abusers. 

Many doctors and even government organizations have felt the need to create articles highlighting the affects of physical punishment on children, with WHO saying, ""Corporal punishment is linked to a range of negative outcomes for children across countries and cultures, including physical and mental ill-health, impaired cognitive and socio-emotional development, poor educational outcomes, increased aggression and perpetration of violence.""

They even called it a violation of the children's rights. 

It also proven to be ineffective. The kids do not learn from physical punishment, they do not understand why they are being punished, they don't understand why it's such a bad thing for them to do it. All they understand is ""if I get caught doing this, I get in trouble"". It doesn't prevent them from doing harmful things, it just causes them to not tell their parents, which causes issues such as a kid getting themselves into medical trouble, trouble with other kids such as bullies, even sexual harassment has been concealed because victims are afraid that their parents will punish them! 

And people like to say, ""Well, they are okay afterwards"" or ""they love their parents."" Not a great argument in my eyes. 

Let's use dogs for an example, would you be okay with someone continuously hitting their dog with a belt? Abused dogs still love their owners, they are still okay afterwards but does it make it right? 

And many survivors of child abuse will say that they still love their parents. Many domestic abuse survivors still show signs of loving their abusers. 

Studies upon studies have proven how harmful physical punishment is but yet, over 60% of children (ages 6-14) is thought to still experience physical punishment in America. Why is that? Because as I have said before, it's normalized. Ignoring spanking is no different than accepting other harmful things in society because of ""culture"" and because ""it's been done for so long"" 

It's easier and less time consuming for parents as well. Communication with children is hard, they do not understand right away, they will have trial and error and they will do bad things multiple times until parental correction actually starts to have affect. Many parents grow frustrated with this and use spanking as a quick fix solution. 

But of course, this is my opinion and opinions vary, they can also change, what do you guys say about this issue?"

0,2022-10-18,CMV: English dubbed with English subtitles translated from the Japanese version is the best way to watch anime,u/SweatyCure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/y7qt84/cmv_english_dubbed_with_english_subtitles/,changemyview,"The vast majority of people who watch anime in America, don't understand Japanese. 

I have no idea why you would prefer watching something in a different language that you don't understand when the dub is available. 

The main argument that most anime enthusiasts have is that the dub is partly removed from the actual Japanese version, so it's best to watch with English subtitles if you want to get a closer translation.

The issue (as previously mentioned) is that most people don't understand Japanese, sure it's more authentic to hear the original voice actors but what's the point if you don't understand them anyway?

Furthermore, when reading subtitles, you're slightly diverting your attention away from viewing the actual show. Blink too long? Too bad, you missed some words, time to rewind. Looked down at your food? Welp, time to rewind again because you missed a few lines of dialogue.

Now, in comes the king of anime viewership for the average English speaking viewer... 

I present to you, DUBBED ANIME WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES TRANSLATED FROM JAPANESE.

You suddenly have the king of viewership. Now you get the best of both worlds and you don't have to worry about blinking too long, eating food while watching, heck you can even walk to the next room if you feel so inclined because now you understand what you're hearing. 

Sure, it will take some focus to read the English sub while listening to the dub. However, I would argue that it's less focus than having to read subs when the language you're hearing is completely different.

Sure, the dub is not the best translation in most cases but you can still look down at the subtitles and get the point across either way because they're the same subtitles you get if you were watching the Japanese version. 

I've fully converted to this format and highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates anime as much as I do. This is simply the king format of anime viewership and provides the best entertainment you can get as a foreign viewer. 👑"

Egypt specially wanted the Sinai peninsula back, and so they on October 6th attacked. The element of surprise saw that Egypt and Syria took Sinai and Golan heights respectively. Then after Israel regrouped they managed to push back the arab armies and eventually a military victory. The threats of USSR and USA to intervene directly forced all parties to stop, ended the war on October 8th and peace negotiations began , and eventually the Camp-David peace treaty was signed.

Israel:   
\- Golda Meyer and Mosheh Dayan were blamed for failing to predict the arab strike and subsequent Israeli losses, resulting in their resignation and Ariel Sharon, who managed to command Israeli armies and achieve victoy, became the next Prime minister. The political upset and government shake-up caused temporary chaos on the the Israeli street.

\-  Despite the victory, this attack shook Israel to the core and was instrumental in changing its policy towards normalizing relationships with arab nations, simply because they couldn't risk another surprise like this again. All it takes is one defeat, one arab success and its all over.  This indirectly helped arab nations with some of their own issues. Israel becoming a technological and economical hub while Palestine becoming more and more of a burden on its supporters and itself helps make Israel more attractive to bury the hatchet and start mutually beneficial relations. 

\- Today Israel is dealing with GCC, allied to Saudi Arabia via USA, combating terror cells in Sinai Peninsula together with Egypt. And for the most part both nations uphel their end of the bargain in maintaining peace at their mutual border. Israel even has a joint LHC project going with Jordan.

\- The Camp-David agreement stated Israel be returned to its 1964 borders, a reduction from its 1967 size. Israel's settlement expansions put it directly in violation of international law and in a negative light in the western world.

Egypt:  
\- Despite military defeat, Egypt did manage to swing hteir goal from entering the war, reclaiming the Sinai peninsula. This came at the cost of allowing Israel to keep the Golan heights, which are more strategically important to Israel, and angered the rest of the arab world who boycotted Egypt, but this was eventually resolved and today's Egyptian-arabian relationships are positive. So Egypt seems to have got all the positives and avoided the biggest negatives.

\- Following Camp David, Egypt was alienated from USSR, which was just as well as it pushed Egypt more towards the American side. The USSR collapsed and took its satellite nations with it while America prospered.  Egypt was spared that fate and are enjoying American aid and access to American and EU technology and markets to this day.

\- With China rising, Egypt remains untied to USA and free to engage the chinese and EU markets simultaneously like any neutral nations. With China's belt and road initiative branching into Israeli and Egyptian territory, it further pushes the 2 sides to be more positive towards one another with China and USA's (and pretty much everybody) influence.

So I think, to my knowledge, the winnings Egypt came out with outweighed the ones by Israel. despite public sentiment and current internal affairs of either nation, governments of both Egypt and Israel mostly have trade and military accord. WIth much of their political goal more aligning than diverging (Palestinian situation not withstanding). By current trends, eventually Palestine will fade and there won't be any real remaining reason for hostility between Israel and its neighbours. Much of that hostility is already going away. 

TLDR: Egypt was the biggest winner in Yum Kippur war, albeit perhaps not in the way they expected it. Israel in second place. Syria being a minor loser, and Palestine of course... well.

Having said that, there is no real reason to gender people other than the fact humans like to categorize. Genders and sex for that matter is an entirely made up system used to define people and there does not seem to be any justification for it. 

Medically it does not matter if you are a man or a woman, what matters is what your chromosome makeup is, what your family health history is and what your sexual organs are to name a few. Male and female are just words to loosely describe people with either penises or vaginas because they clearly require different forms of care, but there are many other factors that depend on the individual and not their sex or gender. 


The group that is steadfast that there must only be 2 genders  I think are wasting energy on something that really should not matter at all and it is a waste of time arguing about it, just like it is a waste of time arguing about which religion holds true. There are many different interpretations and no need for a defined definition. 

However, it is possible there are instances where explicitly defining a gender is necessary, but I have yet to come across one that actually holds true and is not rooted in a bigoted agenda. If someone can present an instance of this I am open to having my mind changed. 

Personally, the least interesting thing about me is my gender and sexual orientation. Fighting so hard to be defined by them feels like a gigantic waste of energy."

However, in my experiences, casual viewers like to watch newer (first-run) things and neglect or overlook classics, be it a TV show or film, in second or subsequent runs.

They may result in, i.e. be part of, huger Nielsen ratings and/or viewers and/or huge box office numbers. However, they just merely rate every TV show, TV episode, or film in stars or points, usually either out of five or ten maximum, but never give in-depth reviews.

Every time a network, film company, or streaming service concentrates primarily or solely on a general/casual viewer, a film or TV show with subpar or so-so in execution or quality would be more likely produced and distributed at expense of a high-quality one. Over the years, that subpar or so-so film or TV show that attracted general/casual viewers or audience in the first-run would more likely struggle to, i.e. never, succeed attracting newer viewers in second or subsequent runs.

The matter doesn't help when a film company, network, or streaming service is unable to handle a tremendously increasing amount of films and TV shows in a library or catalogue, including neglected ones, regardless of whether the one was good or bad quality.

""Casual"" or ""general"" is... tricky to define to me, yet I figured they are interchangeable terms of ""broader"" and/or ""wider"". However, as I further figured, casual viewers are perceived as either homogeneous, indistinguishable, lacking wit and depth, disposable, not as diverse as claimed, or... I don't know. Nevertheless, they are different from ""fanatics"" or ""fans"" AFAIK. Becoming a ""fan"" is not in the best interest of a ""casual"", especially when the ""casual"" has more important things to do in one's own life, but I could be wrong.

If casual viewers shouldn't be most or primary important forte, at least any specific demographics should be a network's or service's or company's forte, but that's harder to determine or research or detect... or whatever."

To briefly summarize for rhetorical reasons, the story involves an intuitively slow turtle challenging a boastful hare to a footrace. The hare, knowing his superior agility, instantly succeeds the turtle. Right before the finish line, he takes a nap out of confidence he will wake before the turtle comes close to finishing. However, he finds the turtle crossed the finish line before him upon is awakening, thus symbolizing the fable's thesis.

As a child, we were told this thesis is ""slow and steady wins the race!"". Oh okay, as if the turtle had anything to do with the hare's fatuous decision to nap indefinitely before finishing the race. I understand a few other morals can be interpreted, like avoiding arrogant pretentiousness (the hare), or being confident in oneself against odds (the tortoise). However, the narrative being told here doesn't illustrate these lessons in any compelling manner whatsoever. The hare doesn't endure any consequence for his arrogance - despite his opponent's technical victory, he still clearly demonstrates his precedence the footrace aims to declare. The reason for his loss was solely due to his lackadaisical decision to nap. The tortoise doesn't demonstrate any positive virtues to win as he didn't foresee the hare was going to nap. He challenged him knowing full well he will probably get his ass handed to him by a clearly better racer. On face value, the only lesson anyone's gonna get out this fable is ""Hey! You should CHALLENGE people to COMPETITIONS which requires a skill in which they are OBJECTIVELY superior BECAUSE they may do some DUMB SHIT which LEADS YOU TO WIN but not REALLY!!!""

Lets pick an example.  Lets say we run across someone on Reddit who claims to be a moderate democrat who is 

- Desperately concerned about Antifa terrorism, expresses no concerns about far right terrorism
- Thinks the major problem with racism are people are too aggressive in combating it
- Hates how the Democrats are talking about packing the Supreme Court, thinks the current one is politically neutral
- Can't understand why anyone is concerned with the rise of fascism and far right extremism, thinks far left extremism is a threat to America
- Thinks that censorship is something that twitter does by 'cancelling people' and the right does 'far less'
- Thinks the Democrats are ""too focused on gender politics"", can't see any evidence the Republicans are obsessed with them at all.  
- Can't help but talk about the 'good Republicans' and 'bad Democrats' and hate how the Democrats don't respect bipartisanship

Or hell, holds even a solid chunk of these beliefs.  Is there any reason, given how this ramps up leading in to every November since 2016 that I should think anything other than ""this is exactly what it looks like?"" Is there any reason to give these people the benefit of the doubt?  Or do we just point out the bloody obvious?  

Because outside of 'assume everyone comes in good faith' I'm having a lot of trouble thinking of any reason to assume these people are anything other than exactly what they actually look like.  I've literally never met anyone like this in real life, and I'm having trouble believing they read any news or are in any way aware of current events.  So, this is one I'll toss over to CMV.  Is there actually anyone like this?  Like, anyone with access to a computer who is actually likely to post on Reddit and not some 90 year old who votes Democrat because their family always has, but gets all their news from random rumors they hear from Dr. Oz and daytime soap operas?  Because I'm really losing every single ounce of belief I have that even one of these schmucks comes in good faith.  

CMV, there isn't an appreciable percentage of people in the real world like this, and to keep the conversation from being bogged down in obvious crapolla we should shut every one of them down until they go back to their main accounts or at least make one that is less flagrant about the lying."

Millions are displaced, thousands maimed. We need peace. But at what cost?

Some people argue that ""Putin should get whatever he wants because, if he doesn't, he might start a nuclear war"" and therefore Ukraine should hand over Donbas, Crimea, and other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine to ensure peace. 

There's also a lot of anti-anti-Russian sentiment out there that says the US is spending too much money on Ukraine's defense. There's a legitimate argument is that the US should be spending this money to rebuild itself.

While everyone should be alarmed about the threat of a nuclear attack, and the US shouldn't necessarily be the World Police forever, the best way to reach a stable agreement is to continue pushing Putin out of Ukraine.

Putin and his inner circle have to truly absorb the lesson that its military will continue to be ground down if he doesn't withdraw, further aggression is futile, and it's in the best interests of the people of that region to have a genuinely independent Ukraine. They started this shit. They should have to propose a way out that's not just a bunch of demands for a sovereign state to hand over their territory.

Moreover, like it or not, the US is the arsenal of democracy. That role can't be quickly abdicated without serious ramifications for global stability. The UN, NATO, etc. can't do anything without US support. Plus, aid to Ukraine is a proverbial drop in the US defense budget, which no Biden critic I'm aware of has ever seemed to give a shit about until now. The manufacture of these weapon systems is pretty baked into the cake. That capital can't be instantly redirected to building US bridges and schools. Those kinds of systemic changes take time and sustained political will. And for all the VERY legitimate concern about the bloated US military industrial complex, it is only one of several massive lobbying powers in Washington (see mega-corporations pushing policy from sectors like pharma, health insurance, energy, broadcasters, manufacturing, retail, etc.).

Clearly some form of peace settlement in Ukraine is necessary. The question is how do we get there? Does the (non-Russia, Iran, China, India) part of the world look at the threat of nuclear war and acquiesce to Putin's demands? Should his impunity be rewarded? What if he asked for Alaska, South Korea, or the confiscation of SpaceX assets? Oh, didn't you hear? Russians have a rightful historical claim to those things. Do it or you'll get nuked! Next China will take Taiwan and a hundred other Pacific islands and everyone will just shrug. They're a nuclear power; they take what they want!

The US is spending billions to get weapons into the hands of Ukrainian soldiers. It should spend more if necessary until Putin is ready to change course. The Ukrainians, the ones getting killed, have the biggest interest in reaching peace. Neither Zelenskyy nor Biden are the ones prolonging this situation. It's on Putin to end the war."

Pretty simple view here and I'm surprised I've never heard anyone bring it up. 

November elections are coming up, and as such, everybody gets to elect their new representatives for the house. And 2/3 of people get to elect new Senators. Why only 2/3? Because each state gets 2 senators and those senators serve 6 year terms. So, for 1/3 of states, there's no option on the ballot for new Senators.

This is just silly. Why shouldn't Texas and Virginia get to choose a senator, but Maryland and California can? As it stands, ""which party will take the Senate"" is partly up to dumb luck.

I'm not interested in debating the morality of the Senate as a whole. Yes, the whole thing is a bad idea. But there's roughly a 0% chance we change the Senate as a while anytime soon. I'm recommending a reasonable improvement that I don't think many would oppose.

To change my view, just present a good reason for the current system that makes it significantly better than what I proposed."

I know this is something pescetarian people hear too often but I haven’t seen any arguments and I really don’t get the point of it. Are pescetarians just people who believe all animals have the right to live but they just really like seafood? I don’t agree with veganism or vegetarianism as well but I get how they can make sense to some. I’d appreciate if someone could just explain lol, thank you

Oh there is a character limit, I’ll just explain why it doesn’t make sense then. First of all fish feel pain just like other animals do -even if it’s not the same kind of pain- and if pain was the problem and taking one’s life wasn’t, they would have to support humane slaughter, too. What I mean is if someone really believes that fish don’t feel pain so it’s okay to hunt and eat them, they wouldn’t hesitate to consume humanely slaughtered animals’ meat. Am I missing something here?"

Russia already refused to follow through their agreement with Ukraine in 1994 to disarm their nukes for a guarantee to not get invaded so why would they abide by a peace treaty when they can reinvade and get even more land (since Ukraine handed them a better position)? Appeasement is when a country gives up land or concedes something to stop another country from going to war with them and Ukraine giving land to stop the war fits the definition perfectly.

I don't support civilians getting killed in a war and I wish for Russia to stop the war and give back Crimea but appeasing simply delays the problem by making the enemy stronger and having the war happen in a later date."

they will become like italy, a political chaos with no party or politician able to stay long enough and with a stable enough goverment, which will further increase the chaos and bring down the economy

I do think it is worth acknowledging that these goals and means are only possible in a particular environment. Even if a person from today had traveled back in time 50, 500, or 5000 years ago to enlighten the people of that time to the egalitarian merits of gender equality - it simply would not have been feasible to implement it. Because life at that time required gender specialization.

Today, a man and woman with the same education and the same high-speed internet connection can do the same information-based job to the same level of proficiency.

But prior to 1940, there were scarcely any times or places when/where there wasn't an objective need for men and women to fill specialized roles in a family, community, and society in order for them to individually and collectively survive, procreate, and thrive.

Again - that doesn't mean gender equality or gender equity are bad things - but it does mean that we're anacronistically and erroneously ""judging"" cultures at times and places when/where gender roles were consistently imposed.

And, perhaps, it means we should keep an eye toward the potential for those gender roles to snap-back if/when any of our modern privilege falls apart (e.g. natural disaster, economic collapse, zombie apocalypse, etc.).

And, finally, this would seem to suggest that - in the same way all responsible upper-middle-class adults should have life insurance - so should every couple (no matter how privileged their daily life is) be prepared to ""snap back"" into traditional gender roles in a - you know - zombie apocalypse."

From what I have seen so far on the world stage, China has mostly respected other nations in their domestic developments, not really interfering in terms of certain regime changes or illegal annexations as I have seen. Some examples of this are the events from Western nations in Libya, or the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory, or perhaps most infamously American intervention in Cuba.

I do understand the two part questioning might be an issue, so if I need to revise the question I will do so. My point on the multipolar view is I believe if China develops as a superpower, more nations will be encouraged to 'come of their own' in a sense, claiming a larger but fair stake in the world. Under the unipolar system I have seen for my life, Western nations have primarily dominated the international domain, even with the fact the Global South is a majority of population, resource and GDP. Under a multipolar system, I believe that the world would be fairer in comparison, with all sides being able to present views and solutions as they see fit.

A dichotomy has taken place in the world, one in which the Western World/Developed World/Global North has ruled for about 200 years, in comparison to the Eastern World/Developing World/Global South that has, historically, ruled in majority, however has not recently. I am aware that these six terms, West vs East, Developed vs Developing, and North vs South are not synonymous, for example Russia could be considered Eastern aligned and developed at the same time. 

I welcome any and all views obviously, thanks!"

I should also say that this doesn't apply to any lesbians who have fertility problems that require the use of IVF since that is an entirely different category in my head. I am speaking specifically about lesbians who choose to have an IVF Embryo implanted that was made with their partner's egg cell. 


I live in a country where egg cell donation is illegal. We have IVF, but only for the sake of taking an  
egg from a woman's ovary and put it back into that same woman's uterus. The reasons for this go way back and were made to stop people from doing research on live embryos outside the womb, such as stem cell research, as well as a way to try and prevent eugenics.

Still, lesbians in this country seem to go through great lengths to go abroad and implant their partner's embryos instead of their own. This usually comes at a great cost, as IVF in and of itself is insanely expensive and the added cost of the trip and stay in a different country. Flights, hotels, normally for a long period of time... All the while it won't count as a nice holiday since the process is taxing for both the donor and the acceptor. 


On the other side, we have good, old, plain artificial insemination in vivo. All you'd have to do it go to your  gynaecologist of trust and receive the sperm right then. It is immensely cheaper than IVF, it's less taxing on the body, it's safer, it's faster and you don't have to go through half as much stress or take any hormones that will make you miserable. 


The only difference is that, this way, the pregnant mother will be the one who is genetically related to the baby, while with IVF it's the other way around. 

Now my question, which beffles me to this day, is: how is it that important? How does it matter if your child is blood-related to one mother over the other if there is no option for both of them to be related to them anyway? Especially since many couples go through this one way and then the other, so both mothers are eventually pregnant but specifically with the other woman's eggs. Is there something I am missing? 

I am a lesbian myself and I want to have kids. My partner has always been clear that she doesn't ever want to be pregnant, so if we were to conceive a baby it would have to be me. I was clear that I won't spend tens of thousands that could go into a college fund on having her eggs implanted and she agrees. 
Probably we'll adopt and foster, but maybe I'll want to experience being pregnant at least once and we will go through all the necessary motions together. 

People around us, however, keep bringing up this criss cross IVF thing, saying it's the best way to do it. I can't help to think that it's sort of like a fad nowadays, and that it's done to make it all as similar as possible to heterosexual conception where one partner ""puts their seed"" into the other and all that jazz. 


For lack of a better word, I find it sad. Why can't we love and raise kids even though they don't carry our genes? Why do we have to go through great lengths to force nature to follow our cultural whims? 


Please change my mind, I am willing to learn. 


Also, be aware that English isn't my native language and my synthax is a bit off. I was told I use more commas than necessary and I am guilty as charged."

I think that money saved through mininalist design of everyday utility structures could be used towards things that actually require a lot of money - such as welfare schemes for poor and underrepresented people. It requires money not only to build a particular structure but also towards maintaining it. The more intricate a design something has, the more resources would go in its maintenance. Hence I think minimalist design is the way we should go.

Edit: some numbers could convince me maybe, the cost of creating and maintaining minimal designed architecture vs intricate architecture"

I dont have time to respond to every comment but I've read all of them, this has been really interesting and informative! I appreciate the links and the personal stories, and this has really reframed the way I think about a lot of the cultural differences-- i hope people who agree with my initial position will read some of the comments on here, its very interesting!

\-------

I apologize if this has been done before, but I've actually been unable to find any. If they exist then I will also appreciate just being linked to those discussions

I'd say I have seen in great detail the majority Reddit viewpoint that, on the whole, the CCP is oppressive, corrupt and an unpleasant place to live, and that the majority of Chinese people would be happier (although they may not currently realize it) if their government was replaced by one more similar to America. I think I'm likely slightly softer on that view than most of reddit, but that's mostly because I trend very liberal towards ""everyone has some nice things about them, im sure the chinese people are mostly not that bad!"", not because I know much about it.

So in short, I'm hoping to get a better sense of what the supporters of the CCP actually like about it-- I will be very pleased if this discussion ends with me thinking they should stay in power, or should be replaced by a different non-democratic govenment

I can't read chinese, so most of my sources are a very outside view. I checked out  r/sino but it doesn't have much actual discussion, it mostly seems to be ""gotcha"" posts about how much america sucks"

The vast distances and time involved with travelling to Mars and the material conditions that the people who live there will face will lead, inevitably, to martian culture diverging from its source culture. As this group becomes increasingly alienated from the culture that rules it, there will be some sort of rebellion, whether it is violent or not, that will result in the colony trying to gain autonomy.

I think this is the most likely consequence of the physical realities of a martian colonization because of the history of colonization on earth. When ""The New World"" was colonized it didn't take long before the gap of the Atlantic Ocean began to alienate colonial powers from their colony. History will repeat itself with a martian colony. 

Caveats:

1. This view is about a human colony.
2. This view is not reliant on the rebellion succeeding, just that a rebellion happens at all.

To change my view, you'll need to convince me that it more likely that a martian colony will stay true to its founding civilization despite what I wrote above. Providing an edge case where they wouldn't rebel wouldn't be enough."

Also I do understand mental health issues are very serious but then again people should be cautiosly warned about the long term implications of such drug, and also more studies need to be done on the long term side effects (but seriously- who would invest in such studies? no pharma company would.) The Persistent Side effect is not even mentioned despite having been reported since the 1980s. Also People tend to develop emotional blunting, which sucks and also sometimes people say it may remain despite discontinuation. The issue is that some side effects are not temporary, and some side effects can even intefere with your life sexually, emotionally and cognitively and may persist . (PSSD syndrome)

When a person is vain they are defined by “having or showing an excessively high opinion of their appearance, abilities, or worth.” 

None of that is bad. I am very set on making sure my appearance is up to my standards as well as my abilities or worth. I like the way I look. Please tell me where the issue is in that. I tell people I like the way I look. Please tell me where the issue is in that. If someone doesn’t like that I am happy with my appearance, one that’s weird as hell, two don’t talk to me then. Even though there’s a lot of people who I feel like I could go around telling I look better than then that’s not something I do. Is it wrong that I can look at someone and decide if I think they are attractive or not? No not at all and everyone in the world does that. Acting on that is completely different. 

And then I’m a firm believer in the fact that most people can make themselves look better. I put in effort. Most guys I see around here don’t even put in the effort so they already by default just look worse. If they aren’t concerned to change that then they just aren’t concerned to change that. That’s their fault.

Last point I want to make is, I know being on Reddit, conversation like this are instantly worse because I think it’s pretty safe to say that the opinions here are on average going to be against anything dealing with people who like the way they look. Because of course “take down pretty privilege🤡” or whatever"

Joining the Dragon Ball online community was a shock to say the least. I've watched the show back in 2010 when it came up on Nicktoons, and I've kept with the lore ever since. You should already know who Gohan is if you care enough to read this far but he's Goku's son from Dragon Ball Z. Because he's half saiyan he has incredible potential for power and mastery. Moreso than actual Saiyans. But ultimately he regresses into being a scholar.

Many fans don't seem to like this. Given how powerful he was in the anime some see it as a waste of his potential. I understand being a kid and seeing your favorite dude vaporize someone then decide he wants to sit out , but most of us DB fans are adults now. Even as a kid I didn't struggle to understand why he went from fighting to learning, he's been terrorized and tortured by aliens and other freaks since he was 4 years old. He only ever fought when he had to, so it makes sense that when he's no longer in constant danger he stops training.

Toriyama said it himself, he tried making Gohan a protagonist but given the way he was characterized, it wasn't possible to write situations that made sense for him to start training and fighting again. He needed someone who gets off to it, like Goku. Otherwise he'd either need to end the story earlier than he wanted at that moment, or write a different genre (Which he wasn't really good at). Even then you notice the DBZ manga drifts more into a gag manga style since the Majin arc since he's always been better at that then traditional shonen.

Even in Super he only ever fights when he feels forced to or has to. It's part of his character development the way I see it. 

I understand Toriyama is anything but planned or intentional when it came to story and lore, but characterization is a different thing. Any writer knows you can't make characters do things they never would, lest they stop feeling like human beings and more like robots for the Author. In a scene when Gohan as fighting Cell for example, Goku gives Cell a senzu bean. The way I see it, he did it thinking Gohan had the same drive for fighting as him and thought he was doing his son a favor. Piccolo had to explain to Goku that Gohan doesn't think like that. Gohan only powered up when Cell started hurting his friends and killed Android 16."

I honestly have no idea why anyone would want to represent themselves, even if they are a lawyer. And honestly, if I see someone try to represent themselves I always get the feeling that it is because they think they are the best person in the world.

Even if it is inherited wealth, they should have no obligation of sharing their wealth even in the case of extreme inequalities. If their parents or egregious forefathers worked for this wealth then the heirs are the legitimete owners. We forget that many rich families are so due to the efforts of their patriarchs who in the past produced fortune through their effort, dedication and sacrifice. It does not seem dignified to oblige a legitimate heir to share his fortune with strangers and strangers, even if the heir is unworthy of said inheritance.  


We take as benign, respectable and the object of the greatest inviolability that of someone's last wish before he dies. If someone draws up a will leaving his estate to selected heirs, would it not be despicable and ignoble to ignore the will of a deceased person by expropriating the property left to his heirs and arbitrarily designating new heirs to enjoy it?  


This is just my opinion, and because I find it somewhat contradictory please try to change my view

0,2022-10-22,CMV: Classic books shouldn’t be required in school,u/Dalando99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yajts1/cmv_classic_books_shouldnt_be_required_in_school/,changemyview,"I don’t think that the classics, as they are so called, have anything more to offer than modern books. The same themes that they have can be found in modern literature and will be better understood by the general reader.

If anything, I think that forcing kids to read classics in high school discourages kids from reading. What could be a chance for teachers to introduce kids to the joy of reading has instead turned into a dreaded requirement for many.

I don’t see what the classics have that is of any more worth than what is found in many of the popular, well written books of today.

Edit: 
So far the main point I am seeing brought up is that these books provide historical insight into the time periods they were written in.  I agree that this is valuable information.  Many of the classic books should be encouraged by teachers but not required.  

I will be awarding a delta to the first person to bring up this point as it addresses me saying they have nothing to offer that modern books cannot provide."
0,2022-10-22,CMV: belief is a true binary,u/physioworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yak92k/cmv_belief_is_a_true_binary/,changemyview,"Belief is the state of accepting a given proposition is true. You can either believe a proposition or you can not believe it, that is a true binary. 

For example, if someone says that they’re not sure if they believe in something or not, they can’t make up their mind either way, that seems at first blush to escape the binary proposition. But in fact the answer is staring you in the face- they’re not sure if they believe. That lack of certainty of the status of their belief shows they do not believe the proposition, since belief simply means accepting a proposition as true. Therefore they lack belief, they do not believe. 

I think part of why people get this mixed up is because they think that believing the negative is the same as lacking belief, so if they say they don’t believe in something they’re committing to a state of knowledge, when they’re in fact not. 

TL;DR if you can’t say “I believe in x” then you don’t believe in x, regardless of whatever clarifying statements may follow."

People point out things like the backfire effect, ignoring that these studies involved percentages, which means that giving facts did work on some people. They also ignore that the backfire effect has been studied numerous times with different results.

Another thing I find interesting is when I speak to people who think like this, I often come to find out that they (like me) used to believe very different things that what they do currently, and through some sort of discussion with a person that took a different position than them, they started to think differently. 

Hell, I think this subreddit is a whole testimony to the fact that debating and argument work and people do change their minds quite a lot. You just can’t expect that it’s always going to work in the way and time that you want. 

Finally, a strange part of this is that people who say arguments/debates and/or conversations with the people whom you disagree are pointless or don’t work, these people are never simply sharing facts. It usually comes with a heavy tone of agitation, aggravation, and an air of superiority. 

Given all of the information and attitudes, I think it’s a likelier explanation that when someone says arguing and debate don’t work, what they are really saying is “arguing with people who disagree with me on certain topics frustrates me,” but notice this is much different. This isn’t so much about the effectiveness of debate and arguing as much as it could be about you just not being a very good debater or you not being able to control your emotions when people disagree with you. So if this is the deal, then just say “I don’t like arguing or debating.” It’s incorrect to project that onto the whole of communicating with people with whom we disagree. 

Leave those of us who see purpose and value in debating alone. Certainly don’t say things that may lead to an argument and debate about how ineffective argument and debate are. If you struggle with debates and arguments, consider studying how to effectively engage in them or do some work on your emotional control. Don’t pigeonhole society based on an unsupported claim because of your emotions. Not all of us have those issues, and we like to see society change as individuals interact to try to mutually come to understand what is true on very important matters. 

Basically consider, if you haven’t already, that this is more a you issue than an issue with debate and argumentation or those who engage in them. 

This in CMV instead of off my chest because, well, I have a certain view of people like this, and I want to see if anyone can change it."

I will say I occasionally do see local movements, but usually people are not very aware of even the most widespread disabilities, and it's often a surprise for some people to see different aspects of disability are not the same as they usually see.

I notice some of the other movements have been more popular in the last decade, whether that be Asian and Pacific Islander awareness, BIPOC awareness, LGTBQ awareness, Native American awareness, things like that. I even see that in my local community.

What I don't see as much is the disability movements. I feel they should be more widespread."

I obviously don't want the war to escalate into something more, but Ukraine obviously needs weapons to defend their nation.

From what I have seen, we are reluctant to give long range missiles and things of this nature, due to the ability to strike within Russia. I am not sure if this is the full reason, but from what I have read this is our primary reason and most of the West's reason."

I feel like Im eligible to hold this view since I feel I have seen both sides. This is an observation I have made so technically I do think being unattractive is easier (In most instances). I would say it's pretty safe to say that all throughout middle school and high school I was ugly. Now I'm 23 and I feel very attractive. Back then no one really expected high expectation of me and no one made assumptions about who I was as a person. They got to know me first and then made an opinion from there. Today, its not always that simple. I'd say a good bit of the people I come in contact decide they aren't going to like me before we even have a conversation and, of course, I understand by being on reddit that ""unattractive people"" feel as if more attractive people are automatically conceited and shallow. I will say I like the way I look and I put effort into my appearance, which anyone could do,  but I don't use that to weaponize others. I haven't treated anyone differently based off of their appearance. (Unless it was in my dating life which is my fair preference.) 

I've also noticed that I'm supposed to apparently make an extra effort to be friendly with people now. If someone walks into a room I'm supposed to speak. If I don't im a douche/bitch. Where as in the past in that same situation I would just be looked at as shy or quiet. There were no negative connotations. So if an unattractive person is silent they are shy, if an attractive person is silent they are a bitch.

Another thing that bothers me is that people are shocked when they learn I am in a relationship. I guess I'm supposed to be a lying cheater and man whore who cant keep a relationship going but only uses people for their body.

I'm also not supposed to verbally announce that I like the way I look. Where as if someone unattractive was happy with the way they looked it would be #BodyPositivity

Lastly, I'm not really allowed to complain about anything because apparently everything is supposed to just be handed to me. 

These are just some of the differences I've noticed. I'm sure everyone has a different experience, but I would guess that this is pretty accurate."

A few weeks ago I made a CMV about this very topic that got removed, I figured I'd give it another go to see if someone could C my V. My stance is that welfare fraud/abuse is not a significant issue among poor people in the US, essentially I think the vast majority of poor people on welfare use the programs as intended and do not defraud the system. According to this article [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-safety-net/2020/04/16/dbbe0dec-7f37-11ea-9040-68981f488eed\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-safety-net/2020/04/16/dbbe0dec-7f37-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html) only 2% of unemployment claims are paid in error and that for every $10,000 in SNAP benefits paid, only $11 were paid out in fraud. Birth rates for women on welfare programs is also much lower then women not on welfare so that's another stereotype popped.

My view is that welfare abuse is in fact not a significant issue in the US, I believe the main use of this rhetoric is as a pretext for cutting welfare programs in general. They point to extremely rare examples of so-called welfare queen as an excuse to cut often needed help to Joe and Jane. Please CMV as to why welfare abuse is in fact a major, significant issue in the US."

People always complain about how there are huge inequities between the super rich to an average person or someone at poverty line.  One of the factors is that someone can be born to rich parents, and thus get all the resources and sometimes protection from the parents, including access to more tutoring, able to pay their way into schools, connection with other rich and powerful.  But isn’t that the point of establishing a family?  The goal from a family or from parents is to provide as good of a foundation for their kids as possible in competition with others who have less fortunate parents, and to create as high of an advantage as possible for their own kids to pass down their genes or have a comfortable life in comparison to others.  There should be credits given to parents who are successful just as much as credit to be given for someone who made it on their own."

2. Some of these inmates who get arrested should be in jail for their own good, since on the street they are way more likely to get someone or themselves killed. Some people cannot be helped, and a jail cell is the best thing to prevent harm to both them and other people."

I don't think this is a good idea.

The reason why guys are asking these subs is because they know that dating experiences do change based on your gender. This means that men and women don't necessarily have the same interests. You can see this from how different AskMen is from AskWomen when it comes to talks about dating.

The main reason is that typically the attitude on women-dominated subs when it comes to men is that they basically bother women and less interactions with them would be better. If guys take their advice, they're more likely to end up alone because they'll have a laundry list of things not to do and no idea of what to do.

Dating if you're a guy is more of a numbers game, especially if you're introverted or socially anxious. If men take advice from these subs, they're probably going to just avoid trying dating altogether. This would be good from the POV of the people in those subs (less nervous men bothering them) but bad for the guys who follow that advice.

So am I wrong that this kind of advice is bad for men or wrong that this is the advice these subs typically give?"

The reasoning being it will save more lives but I can’t see how that would be beneficial or smart.

Firstly the Ukrainian people to my knowledge want to fight this war. To make a deal to save lives that don’t want to be “saved” doesn’t make sense. 

Ukraine has been holding their ground longer than anyone would have expected, and they are winning. Russia’s economy is heading to the gutter and it’s people don’t even want to fight the way anymore. Ukraine has successfully been able to push them back and are still receiving aid from the US and other allies.

If anything Ukraine should keep pushing to take back land from Russia. 

Even if Ukraine were to make a deal with Russia, Putin would never take it because it would most likely be a deal that had Russia getting the worse end of the stick.

Even if Putin did accept the deal all it would mean is Ukraine got too tired of fighting a war they were winning, and it would also mean that if a big country like Russia could bully a country long enough they would give in."

However, even as I type this comment, many states deny the franchise to some of their residents who are citizens of the United States on the basis of whether they are (or even were) felons. Unlike limiting polling places in minority heavy areas, this policy is [often part of the legal code](https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights/voter-restoration/felony-disenfranchisement-laws-map).

I just thought this might be an interesting exchange of ideas + maybe someone has got reasons to be optimistic: 

Countries in the Eurozone (and also in the wider world) have not fundamentally fixed their flawed economies ever since the 2008 crash happened. Instead, they have been running on free money (printing money, having 0% interest rates). Now that inflation has become a real issue they need to raise interest rates, which is about to crash our economies to the point of no return, perhaps even forcing Europe to eliminate the Euro and return to some sort of national currency. 

\- Debt rates in Southern Europe are higher than their yearly GDP. As a result once interest rates go above of 2-3% their interests will grow quicker than they can repay them (as their yearly average growth has been 1%). Alternatively they could raise taxes, but both companies and people are running on fumes and so that's not a very viable option. This will lead us into a 2008 style Euro crisis, with the difference that Northern Europe is also struggling this time around and will not want to finance the problems of the South. And even if they did, Southern Europe will most likely not be in the mood to repeat this exercise of living under imposed austerity to repay their debts. 

[https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/european-union/government-debt--of-nominal-gdp#:\~:text=European%20Union%20Government%20debt%20accounted,87.9%20%25%20in%20the%20previous%20quarter](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/european-union/government-debt--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=European%20Union%20Government%20debt%20accounted,87.9%20%25%20in%20the%20previous%20quarter).

\- On top of this, up to 20% of companies are zombie companies that are only alive due to free money. Once interest rates go up, they go bust.

[https://hbr.org/2022/09/can-zombie-firms-survive-rising-interest-rates](https://hbr.org/2022/09/can-zombie-firms-survive-rising-interest-rates)

\- Stock markets are more inflated than ever. A lot of the gains we have seen over the last years is just companies re buying their own stocks with free money. Once the bubble goas bust we will see a lot of banks in hot water, perhaps even more so than in 2008. In theory the EU's deposit guarantee scheme guarantees that everyone will have savings of up to 100k per bank protected by the government. But the reality is once you run the numbers, the government actually doesn't have the resources to repay our money should big banks actually go bust.

[https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/)

&amp;#x200B;

All of the above is leading me to believe we are about to start to see countries to defaulting on their debts, and a monetary reform being started in which the euro fails and most countries return to their own national currencies. Countries in similar situations (see for example Argentina's bankruptcy) have had their citizens lose most of their wealth. And I believe that not even the money in our bank accounts might be safe. Therefore, traiditonal investment strategies might be wrong and it might be in our best interest to buy physical items such as cash, gold or debt free real estate in order to prepare for the upcoming collapse of our financial system.

It doesnt matter what the issue is:

Racial discrimination,
Poverty,
Same-sex marriage,
Abortion rights,
Religious freedoms,
Drug policy,
Mental health,
And many others..

If you are in a group that is affected by one of these issues you are a minority.

Right-side politics does not care about you, and left-side politics does.

But they both care about money and power.

The only time the right will care is if there are too many minorities on a certain issue and the only time the left does not care is if there are not enough minorities for a certain issue.

Two extreme, despicable examples:

There are many racially diverse people (black, asian, latino/Hispanic, etc) who had to fight tooth and nail to legally not be considered 2nd class citizens (albeit in reality it's still a problem.). Something that Republicans did not want to do. The basis being someone who doesnt look like me or speak my language is inferior.This is the mindset of not caring for minorities.
Democrats would never allow this to happen.

There are no pedophiles openly protesting that they want equal rights to abuse children. But if there were 100's of scientific research studies conducted by various accredited institutions showing with proof that pedophilia was a mental disorder or genetically inherited, democratics would be the ones pushing for law reform and possible decriminalization. This is the mindset of caring for minorities. Republicans would never allow this to happen.


One side is conservative the other is liberal.
They are both wrong, while also being both right.

It's a paradox that cannot be solved.
Which is why they vote. Some things change. Others remain the same.

You can be left leaning or centre right depending how much you care about minorities."

This is a ridiculously small amount, considering the cost of healthcare in the US. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/crash-injuries/index.html), crash injuries in 2012 resulted in a total of $18 Billion in medical costs. 


$25,000 is also a very low valuation for a human life. According to a few US government offices, [the value of a human life is somewhere between $7 Million and $10 Million](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/upshot/virus-price-human-life.html). I don’t think that these numbers are sacrosanct; I am completely open to any valuation that’s within a factor of 10 of one of them. 


In Denmark, auto insurance is required to cover [121 Million Krone](https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:1db99c04-4977-4a83-966a-ec2ebf354c81/2018_bodily_injury_landscape_denmark.pdf), which is about $16 Million. Denmark has about [70% fewer] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate) traffic deaths per capita than the US. 


While a death payout won’t provide much consolation to a grieving family, I still think the insurance providers should pay about $8 million. It will help to cover expenses for a family that has lost the income of an earner. It will also force insurers and drivers to care about preventing traffic deaths.


The obvious downside of this policy change is that driving would become more expensive, and some people will be priced out of it. However, the increase for most drivers would be relatively small. There are [228.2 Million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/198029/total-number-of-us-licensed-drivers-by-state/) licensed drivers in the US. There are about [40,000 traffic deaths](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/early-estimate-2021-traffic-fatalities) each year in the US; at a valuation of $8 million per person, those would cost $320 Billion. The average cost per licensed driver would be (320 Billion + 18 Billion) / 228.2 Million = $1481.16 per year. 


The insurance companies already know which cars are relatively safe and dangerous, and which drivers are relatively safe and dangerous. If a dangerous driver has had a couple of DUIs and a bunch of moving violations, their premiums should reflect their probability of killing or injuring a human being whose life is worth $8,000,000. If some new cars offer better safety features, then the insurance companies should use discounted premiums to incentivize buying those. "

The President does, Congresspeople do, I believe even State Congresspeople do.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT, I'm not sure if that's good enough for the work they do.

Think about it: 3(or 2, if you live in Nebraska) bodies are responsible for the health, education and more of their entire citizenry. It's there responsibility to make sure everyone in their state is medically well-off(in general, of course) and that everyone has access to quality healthcare. It's there responsibility to ensure children are well-educated, and that knowledge is public and abundant. All that responsibility for a Governor, and---in my state---122 legislators.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, the federal government is responsible for maintaining a dollar to facilitate a market beneficial to Americans, representing Americans abroad, and more. Those are HUGE responsibilities

&amp;#x200B;

And, I'd even say they're doing their job WELL. I get it, no one likes politicians. But I think too often, they get a bad rap. For instance, Biden capped the price of insulin, which has been historically inflating, while many Americans require it as an absolute necessity. Back in the day, Democrats, under the guise of President Obamna, wrote up the entire Affordable Care Act. Heck, even Republicans, who I tend not to like, seem to be hard at work. They're killing trains, diminishing abortion rights, and more. Do I generally not like these things? Yes. But they're not there to serve me. They're there to serve their constituents, mostly in more Southern and/or rural areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think that legislators and governors/the president should be paid way more, given all they do for their people. Also, after a hard days work addressing issues, these people deserve a break. Maybe we could build them a nice complex, and let them relax and have a nice day. They deserve it.

I get nobody likes politicians, but I still think they do more than's recognized. If you don't think politicians are doing a good job(probably a common opinion) or disagree with me for some other reason, CMV."

imo there are three main options here, and none of them are desirable:

1: youtube lives to a ripe old age, more or less maintaining its current dominance, but in a dull corporate semi-vegetative state

2a: tiktok acquires hegemony in the video platform market due to reduction of attention span in the emergent generations, and youtube, despite continuing the pattern we're already seeing in youtube shorts etc, ends up pretty much going the way of yahoo

2b: bilibili acquires secondary hegemony to tiktok in the video platform market due to shifting global powers, and youtube ends up pretty much going the way of yahoo

3: yt ends up shutting down abruptly and with rather short notice to the creation of new videos, and either privates or deletes all existing videos, thereby setting a new record for lost media that would put alexandria to shame, whereupon the aforementioned alternative services plunge in to fill the void

and yes, i know odysee exists, but 1) it's been overhyped to death at this point, and has failed so spectacularly in realizing its initially purported ideals that it's pretty much become even more of a tombstone than its parent, and 2) a decent portion of its userbase seems to be overrun by fringe conspiracy theorist nutjobs who've been booted off of yt. just actually go on that site for 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean by these problems."

Michael is an complete piece of shit! And Trevor is a murderous psychopath! 

Franklin: throughout the first act, continuously bitches and moans about wanting to “do something different with my life” but still goes along with being screwed by Simeon. After meeting Michael, he becomes a yes-man, which after having a gun pointed at his head by Michael, really doesn’t make any sense. I think it would have been way better for Franklin’s story to completely veer away from the other two after that mission if the game wanted to be a character study, which it clearly wanted to do. Franklin’s ex’s story goes absolutely nowhere, which obviously had been building to something. And as much as Lamar is a moron, he was always loyal to Franklin but at the first chance he has, Franklin is willing to let Lamar be killed. Also, the fact that Franklin can betray either Trevor or Michael at the end of the game shows that his loyalty lies with whoever has a fatter wallet at the moment. 

Trevor: a murder-happy, rapist, drug addict! Need I say more? 

Michael: the crème de la crème of shitty protagonists, a murder-happy, adulterous, neglecting, piece of fucking pond scum. Where to begin? At the very beginning of the game, he sells out Trevor and Brad to the FBI to get away scot-free with years of murdering and robbing to provide the family he clearly doesn’t give a fuck about a better life! When we’re really introduced to this piece of shit, he’s constantly screaming at or ignoring his family. He blames a car dealer for scamming his dumbass son, which probably wouldn’t have happened if he got out of his own head for two seconds and cared about anyone other than himself. I really think that Michael didn’t give a shit about his son getting scammed, I think he was more pissed about the money and being inconvenienced. 
When his wife and daughter are arguing about some degenerate wanting to stay at their house, instead of helping his wife explain to his daughter why they don’t want this guy around, he chooses to go sit by the pool and listen to Phil Collins. 10/10 so far. 
When his boat is stolen and his son is kidnapped, he cares more about the boat he didn’t use than his son being in mortal danger. 
When he catches his wife in bed with the tennis coach, he chases the tennis coach down and destroys a multi million dollar home, when by his own admission, he started cheating on Amanda before she cheated on him. Then he has to rob a jewelry store to pay for the house which gets him on Trevor’s radar and gets him involved with the FBI and CIA. 
I’m not going to go into detail about the rest of the game, his wife leaving him for attacking her yoga instructor and feeling sorry for himself for the rest of the ‘story’ and whining about how he wants them back when Trevor said it best; “All you did was ignore ‘em!” When a meth addict is making the most sense out of your three protagonists, something has gone horribly wrong

I don’t know if Rockstar was more focused on fine tuning GTA Online or working on Red Dead 2 to give GTA V the time and effort it needed but what we ended up with was a damn train wreck! In my opinion, GTA V should have ended with Trevor and Michael and Franklin all getting killed in the death-wish ending.

But for the sake of the argument, I'm going to jump from the latter perspective. Even if entertainment has a really large real-world influence, entertainment shouldn't be forced to change or criticized because people will try to emulate it and thus result in bad things because first: Everything around us influences us, as such, it's impossible to expect everything around us to change to cater to what's better for our lives, secondly: it's incredibly unfair to expect people to change what they produce and how they act because others might try to imitate their behavior, third: it's our personal responsibility to look at things critically and decide what's best for us regardless what those around us do. Beauty magazines shouldn't have to change because some people pursue beauty standards in an unhealthy way, celebrities shouldn't be condemned for using drugs or making music that talks about doing drugs(as shitty as said music is) because others will do the same and so on

Here are some caveats and clarifications just so no one misconstructs my point:

1. Media and entertainment that directly state ""do x"" like for instance Ricegum directly telling his audience to go to gambling websites. I find this to be problematic because he directly induced his audience to do what he was doing, however, I wouldn't find it problematic if he just filmed himself gambling and posted it on YT
2. Showcasing stuff that is inappropriate for a target audience should be criticized such as Logan Paul showing a guy who hanged himself on youtube for an audience of kids. Kids shouldn't be seeing shit that explicit to begin with regardless of whether or not they'd be influenced by it
3. Messages that are ethically wrong should be criticized but because they are ethically wrong, not because they will influence others. For instance if a movie comes out tomorrow that puts forward Nazi ideology, that should be criticized because it is morally wrong to be a Nazi, despite the fact that nowadays no one would be influenced to be a Nazi because they saw a film that depicted it positively"

I contest this notion on the basis that the majority of students are required to pass standardized testing such as the ACT or SAT, with decent scores, prior to being admitted to high cost universities and colleges. This standardized testing includes a math component. Arguably, demonstrating a certain competency in maths prior to college admission would also cover competency in Googling a compound interest calculator on the internet, and comparing these numbers against average salaries for a chosen degree. 

As a summary, I argue that ACT/SAT competency in math as a requirement for college admissions is sufficient moral justification for placing financial burden on 18 year olds."

I believe in science lol. A human exists at zygote, once a sperm and egg become one. I am not here to debate this definition as if people really believed it was false I could have applied the ""health science"" academia and made spawn in a petri dish as all I would need are eggs.

Another note, I'm rather wholistic. I belive in capital punishment. To kill is to kill regardless of if there is a reason.

9,2022-10-23,CMV: Time wasting in sports is an artform and can still be thoroughly enjoyable to watch.,u/AaliyahK12,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ybq7ik/cmv_time_wasting_in_sports_is_an_artform_and_can/,changemyview,"There are lots of things in sports that some fans of that sport really don't like. 

For me, my sport is football (soccer). The two main things that come to mind that people commonly say are ""ruining the game"" are diving (flopping/simulating) and time wasting (running down the clock).

I think it's a ridiculous hot take to say either are ruining the game and indeed, both have been a part of the game for as long as I can remember watching football, which is all my life. I'm going to focus specifically on time wasting however, because if I included diving, I'd have to try and defend Neymar. Which I simply cannot bring myself to do. 

So time wasting it is...some people really hate it, but crucially - they're not representative of all football fans. Some of us love it, truly enjoy it - and consider it an artform. 

The greatest example in recent memory that I can think of where timewasting was a beautiful and indescribably emotional masterclass of tactical brilliance and pure, unadulterated shithousery actually comes from women's football for me and specifically, the 2022 European Championships final between England and Germany.

I'm not here to change **your** view, but I promise you, if you go and sit through the whole of that game, or even just the period of extra time.. you will have your opinion changed if you do dislike timewasting. 

It was a simply incredible demonstration of tactical understanding and skill.

If you're not interested in watching a full football game, that's fine because the final 11 minutes are neatly dissected and analyzed in quite some detail in this handy little article:

[https://theathletic.com/3465406/2022/08/01/england-time-wasting-euro-2022/](https://theathletic.com/3465406/2022/08/01/england-time-wasting-euro-2022/)

(Quick note if you ever see a paywalled article - you can get around it by using browser extensions like bypassPaywall or Unpaywall)

The point is it was beautiful to watch, frustrating I'm sure if you were a German fan, but oh so sweet if you were English. 

It was entertaining, the atmosphere remained electric throughout and from a tactical standpoint, it was executed flawlessly. 

Time wasting has existed since forever, it's evolved and become more nuanced over time but it's always featured as part of the game. The expression ""running down the clock"" is literally older than I am. 

Can you CMV? Can you convince me that it's shit and needs to stop?"

I simply don't understand why the invasion of Afghanistan is considered to be an act of ""American/Western imperialism"" by self-styled anti-imperialists. The facts are pretty clear: Al-Qaeda, the organization that masterminded the September 11 attacks, had its headquarters in Afghanistan at the time of the attacks (not so sure about now). The Taliban, a radical Islamist faction that governed Afghanistan since 1996, was willingly providing safe harbor to Al Qaeda and refusing to hand over its leader, Osama Bin Laden. If you know that a terrorist group that has conducted the worst attack on your soil in a long time is based in a particular country and that country's government is actively providing a safe harbor for said group, doesn't it make sense to invade that country and overthrow its government so that hopefully, a newer government that doesn't provide safe harbor for such groups can rise from the ashes? How exactly is this ""imperialism"" instead of just war? Please offer some sound arguments against my position if it is flawed!"

If you want to see really change it has to come from within and avoid being perceived as a western driven revolt. 

Also, as a side note, it feels like the same people who are cheering loudest for the movement now are the same people (or the same kinds of people) that were calling others racist for the last two decades, whenever someone dared to point out that women in Muslim countries were oppressed. Sam Harris on Bill Maher or Christopher Hitchens on Australia’s Q&amp;A are two examples that come to mind."

More rules, higher boundaries, an easier/faster chance to cross a line.

From **my perspective** (A gay guy who's only ever dated a girl when I was in high school) I can see so many differences in my own relationship or my other gay friends' relationship vs my straight friends in relationships. Obviously me dating the one girl I dated when I was convinced that I was into that doesn't really give me that much experience on what its like to be in a straight relationship. And if any of you are straight/havent been in a gay relationship you wouldn't have experience in a gay relationship. So im more than happy to share perspectives. Bi people probably have the most valid point of view here though. Before I get into the reasons behind my view, this isn't meant to offend anyone, these are MY anecdotal experiences that I have used to create my view on this topic. I do currently believe my view 100% but I'm not pressed to believe it. Therefore it's highly likely that a respectful conversation could easily change my perspective.

So obviously, being monogamous is the **norm within straight and gay couples,** but I definitely notice a lot more gay people in open relationships. Statistically gay guys are more likely to be in an open relationship. My current relationship actually **started** as an open relationship and it wasn't until later that we ""closed it""? That was the only time I actually have been in an open relationship however.

Another thing I have noticed is the joking seems to have stricter limitations in the straight couples I'm in contact with. It makes sense though to me. I can call my boyfriend a bitch for example. If a man calls a woman a bitch I could see how that would be derogatory. Also the stuff that we watch and gay culture in general is full of being shady and trying to get the most uncalled for joke in. Literally body shaming could be made into a joke and gotten away with it because we all know the culture and the joke behind it. If you ever have seen Rupauls Drag race you know they are very quick to joke about someone having too wide of shoulders or just flat out calling them fat. Where as if a man did that to his girlfriend/wife.. Again I can see how thats derogatory. So I guess my point is, a man can hit a man and get a way with it but a man will be looked down on if he hit a woman.

Theres no set gender expectations in a gay relationship, I feel like this one is self explanatory. If we are both men there's no sexism. 

Obviously there's a limit to everything. I know the limit of joking, I know how to play fight without actually hurting him, I know when to shut up. Yes there are instances where people have done the things in the example above and that has hurt their partner. Im aware that not every gay person is the same. I feel like if I were in a straight couple though, acting the same way that I do now. Society would look at me as an abuser, and that's pretty sad, but also kind of funny because I feel like it's things that are so innocent/silly from my perspective and the perspective of my partner."

I won't bother elaborating there. I don't have anything original to say but I'd say any world built on the following principles is pretty evil.

- nevermind human nature, history and society, that's a given

- We exist thanks to a 3 billion year sifting process of lifeforms brutally hunting and ripping each other apart or being obliterated by their environment. We must end life to survive. Nature hunts and viciously hurts itself endlessly in order to continue. The intelligence level of animals is irrelevant, only capacity for suffering is.

- Parasitism is the most popular lifestyle on the planet. Half of life is parasitic at some stage of its lifecycle. Not including the more nuanced, non-literal definitions of Parasitism that you can apply to humanity collectively or humans individually.

- We are driven primarily by attachment in a universe where everything we develop attachment towards will decay, wither and die. Nothing lasts.

- We are programmed to think in terms of equity and fairness. Go stroll through a child cancer ward. Etc etc etc etc etc.

- just pain of any kind honestly, and the fact that life indiscriminately fucks Everything with it for no good reason. I get so tired of religious(etc, etc, etc) people trying to justify the fundamental cruelty of this place as somehow justifiable by some end. If you think this universe was created by something, I think it takes some serious mental gymnastics to ignore the fact that that something would have to be unspeakably cruel.

To be MEGA narcissistic and up-my-ass: Believe it's for a reason (as though there could be a good one even if there were something better) and that anything will save any of us if it helps you sleep at night. I'd rather look what this place is in the eyes."

I should’ve done this math before I took the job, I know, but it was either a) request more money or b) being honest about not being able to afford the relocation. 

That’s the moment my experience at the company took a nose dive. I never felt liked or respected anyone on leadership after that.

Also it would be a crime to speak out against this policy or anything else against what the government was doing."
10,2022-10-24,CMV: The political divide in the U.S. isn't likely to stop anytime soon,u/rwhelser,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yc4cym/cmv_the_political_divide_in_the_us_isnt_likely_to/,changemyview,"I used to believe it would take another catastrophe like 9/11 to bring Americans of different views back together, but that was proven wrong a couple years ago.  Here's my thinking:

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, I recall many people coming together in support of each other.  I personally saw people bury the hatchet and communities come together to support each other.  From where I lived at the time, it was actually a remarkable thing to see.  I can only assume generalization across the country.  Even from a political standpoint, George W. Bush's approval rating was at 90% in September/October 2001, something unheard of since (Obama's highest was just under 70%, Trump never reached 50% and Biden's highest was 57% thus far).  

Then in early 2003, the Bush administration made the unpopular decision to invade Iraq.  This started to create a split between Americans who did not support the decision, as the administration failed to provide a sound strategy or reason for doing so (I'm not going to debate the merits or lack thereof on this topic here).  As a result, Bush's approval rating dropped to \~70% by the time the U.S. invaded Iraq.  It further dropped to the low/mid-60% range when Saddam was captured.  

As the great recession hit, Bush was preparing to leave office with a very divided population and an approval rating of 25% in October 2008.  Obama at the time did nothing to try to bring people together.  I would argue that he used that divide to help himself land the presidency.  I don't believe that he exploited it, he simply let it run its course.  He also didn't do much once in office to try to bring the country together.  His average approval rating during his entire term in office was about 48%, which I would argue summarizes the feelings of Americans toward federal politics.

When Trump ran for office, I think many thought of it as a joke.  I know a lot of people who said, ""how funny would it be if these other career politicians were put to shame by a reality TV guy?""  Some speculated that he only ran to get exposure and wanted to establish a TV network.  Some speculated he only ran because Obama hurt his feelings at the Correspondents' Dinner.  In either case, Trump was an unusual type and I think he used his reality TV experience to get people's attention.  He routinely created drama and exploited the divide that the country suffered for over a decade.  He even played the ""fake election results"" narrative until he found out that he won in 2016, then all of a sudden it was legitimate.  My personal opinion was that he got more ""anyone but Hillary"" votes than he did of people actually believing he'd make a good president.  We'd see a similar turn four years later.

During Trump's years in the White House, people became extremely polarized.  It turned into there's no such thing as compromise.  Every success he had was overshadowed by some kind of scandal.  Every failure was covered up with ""fake news"" and the like.  

I always felt that it would take some kind of geopolitical catastrophe or something of a 9/11 magnitude to get people to come back together again.  In 2020, we saw that with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Instead of bringing people together, it split people even more apart.  Trump, at the time, seeking re-election and worrying about his chances played the ""fake news"" card and tried to downplay the pandemic, to which many of his supporters bought into.  Not too much longer, when he could take credit for his administration being able to develop a vaccine, his same supporters deemed it a hoax, a means of control, etc. (which I honestly couldn't help but laugh at...if you believe that's the case, what's that say about the guy you support overseeing all those people, who resides in the White House?).

As a result, we've seen millions die over the course of the pandemic, and Americans are just as divided as they've been over the past decade and some change.  I'm not sure what it would take to bring people back together; I have hope that there will be something in the future, but as it stands right now, I don't see what that could be.

To CMV:  I'm looking for ideas of either evidence that shows people are becoming less polarized or something that you feel would bring the people back together.  I'm hoping someone can help change my view on this matter.  I'm not looking for a political debate about Trump, Biden, or anyone else; I'm not looking for blame to be shifted.  I'm just looking for answers."

Please just debate the actual statement, I can't debate whether or not I'm soapboxing or whatever it is. I'm not perfect and I have fallacies that I didn't previously know existed. I'm doing my best, but it's not helping when I have 20+ comments telling me that they think I'm to literal. I'm just one guy, I can't reply to all of these, and I won't reply to them because I don't want to copy/paste the same statement over and over again 

Modern witches claim that they are they descendants (in terms of heritage of beliefs) of the victims of the Salem Witch Trials. That is untrue. The Witch Trials weren't bad because men killed innocent witches, they were bad because innocent people were falsely accused of being witches and then killed. The idea is that they are part of a heritage or bloodline of stifled witches. Keep in mind that many random people were on the chopping block when it came to a witchcraft accusation. Men, women, children too. It wasn't a systematic ethnic cleansing of magic, it was a panicked slaying of normal people. Therefore, I believe that it is not possible for people to be preserving the legacy of witches that did not exist (at least in that time and place). This is not a claim that witches were never real.

My title is referencing a phrase that witches use, often in relation to overthrowing patriarchy. I think this statement takes away from the tragedy of the past event. It makes it seem more fictionalized, as if the people were some characters in a Disney movie."
0,2022-10-24,CMV: Male promiscuity is associated with increased agency in life,u/their-holiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycbhrg/cmv_male_promiscuity_is_associated_with_increased/,changemyview,"I think straight male promiscuity is associated with an increased agency in life. Being more in control and able to do what you want. I think this is the case because compared to other groups getting into the lifestyle is much more difficult for them. I don't have any view one way or the other on other groups for this topic because I don't see myself as knowing enough about their experiences.

  
I think most people likely disagree with this view which makes me optimistic I'll get to see good arguments against it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think promiscuity essentially has a lower skill floor and a higher skill ceiling compared to monogamy. I'm much more confident about the lower skill floor since I don't exactly know much of the heights of accomplishment for either. I think it requires more social and emotional skills to be continuously promiscuous than to maintain a long-term monogamous relationship (or polyamorous relationships). I think monogamy is generally the easy way out and that's why most men choose it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think promiscuity requires maintaining your health and other things like that a lot more than monogamy, and it requires higher social skills and emotional regulation skills. I think that monogamy requires a narrower range of skills and maintenance, but I'm unsure.

&amp;#x200B;

However, and this is important, my view will be changed if I see evidence suggesting a higher ceiling for monogamy, in that case it would be more like there's a group of highly competent monogamous men distinguished from the lower ones who aren't competent and they deserve to be in their own category which may be equal or higher than the promiscuous men.

EDIT: I messed up my usage of the terms ceiling and floor. Floor is backwards in this post"
408,2022-10-24,CMV: Abortion is almost always morally acceptable,u/SotisMC,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycbskt/cmv_abortion_is_almost_always_morally_acceptable/,changemyview,"In order to elaborate my view, I have to explain how my principles and morality affect my take. First off, I think there's a distinct difference between something being ""alive"", and something being alive AND worthy of being seen as equal to humans/animals and such (I'll get back to this). I also don't see the potential of life equally important as something already being alive. I am also a very pragmatic person despite my principles, which I think influences my view alot. 

There are many things we consider ""alive"" that we don't care for, such as plants. We cut grass for aesthetic purposes with no regard for the grass. What most people would probably say is ""Well grass can't feel pain."" And I agree, the fact that grass can't feel pain is one HUGE factor in deciding whether or not we should protect it from death. Now I'm getting to the point I made earlier about differentiating different types of being alive. A fetus won't develop the necessary components to experience pain until at least 24-25 weeks. The fact that an abortion before this time period would not cause the fetus any pain at all, makes it comparable to plants for me. It doesn't have any conscious experiences, nor any memories that will fade away (fetal memory has only been found around 30 weeks after conception). 

There's one more component to my view I'd like to elaborate on, and that is the parenting. Fetuses can't socialize, which means they won't have any relationships with other people. If this was the case, then aborting said fetus would also affect the people having a relationship with them. The only people having any type of reasonable relationship with the fetuses, are the parents. They obviously created this fetus. That's why I think the only people deserving of choosing whether to abort or not, should be the parents.

I'd also like to say that if the mother's life is at risk, she should be able to choose if she wants to save the fetus or herself (and she shouldn't be looked down on for saving her own life). If someone held you at gunpoint and told you to choose whether or not to shoot you or another person, I think it's self defence, and not necessarily morally wrong to let the other person die.

So to summarize, I think abortion is morally acceptable before 24 weeks, in the case of a rape, and if the mother's life is at risk. But it's arguable after 24 weeks (due to the possibility of experiencing pain)."

0,2022-10-24,"CMV: ""Male Privilege"" is a dangerous generalization that undermines the struggles of a majority of men in society.",u/MtnDewTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycif8w/cmv_male_privilege_is_a_dangerous_generalization/,changemyview,"Definition of male privilege based on google: 

&gt;Male privilege is the system of advantages or rights that are available to men solely on the basis of their sex.

First, I want to clarify that there are certain innate privileges that are given to **all** (biological) males, and **I am not here to challenge those**. These privileges are based specifically on one's sex and reproductive differences within biology. While I think it's important to recognize these, discussions are pretty limited because they can't be changed and will always exist in society just based on biology. These ""privileges"" are: 

* Biological males' reproductive systems and their role in procreation mean they don't have to deal with pregnancy directly. 
   * Don't have to go through labor
   * Aren't directly affected by abortion debate/access to safe abortion facilities 
   * Don't breastfeed/aren't affected by policy and issues related to breastfeeding 
* Biological males collectively and on average are larger, stronger, faster, and more physically dominant than biological females 

So based on the original definition of male privilege I posted, I agree with all of the above being privileges granted to men solely on the basis of their **sex**. However, google's definition doesn't encompass the more modern usage of the term to include privileges formed on the basis of **gender**. Mainly the social privileges afforded to *apparently* all men, simply based on societal norms and views and the historical creation of structures to oppress/exploit women and grant advantages to men. Concepts like ""toxic masculinity"" and the ""patriarchy"" stand in the way of women wanting to make it in this world, **and there is this idea that if you are a woman, you will be at a disadvantage in society because of these systems/structures, and if you are a man you will inherently be given privileges in life based on the fact that you are a man. &lt;--** This is the belief that I will be focusing on for this CMV.

I feel like I need to clarify, that my post isn't about feminism being a bad thing. I consider myself a feminist, and despite how this thread might sound, I am not some crazy incel who hates women. Literally, the people I care about most in this world are all female. My mom is the most amazing person in my entire existence, I have multiple sisters and a girlfriend who I all love and care for dearly. There is no reason why they shouldn't have equal rights, and I acknowledge there are some major douchebags in this world who will try and take advantage of them or treat them unfairly just because they are women. I don't accept this and think these people should fuck right off. That said, I don't believe ""toxic masculinity"" or the ""patriarchy"" are things that all men reap the benefits of, and this idea that all men receive special privileges on the basis of their gender is ridiculous to me and dangerous and damaging to newer generations. 

When writing this I came across [this article](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/), which outlines 30 examples of male privilege. Simply put, these aren't male privileges because I (a cis-male) have experienced multiple of these examples in my life, and I think this best illustrates the problem I have with today's version of ""Male-Privilege."" Not all men actually have these benefits, I have been interrupted in my life many times. Again I think the concerns of feminism are valid, but these types of issues in society aren't caused by men hating women, its just men who are arrogant and ""hate"" everyone. For example, ""34. You are unlikely to be interrupted in conversations because of your gender."" Most men don't interrupt woman because they are women, the ones who interrupt are just narcissist who thinks they are better than everyone. I have been interrupted multiple times in my life by loud obnoxious men. In my friend group, there is one guy who always talks over everyone. He interrupts our female friends all the time and they rightfully get annoyed by it, however its also something I experience just as frequently. It's not and doesn't need to be framed as a sexist or a ""feminist"" issue, it's just an obnoxious person issue. I don't benefit from being a male in this situation, and acting like I do invalidates my experiences. 

This is a small example but think it expands more broadly to all areas of society. Not all men are rich CEOs, controlling everyone else's lives around them while they live in luxury. Men are more likely to commit suicide, die while on the job, or lose custody over their kids in a divorce. Ironically enough during my research, *It at least seems* to me that there are way fewer websites or publications covering these issues and its harder to find information on them, but men have problems.

The concept of ""Male-privilege"" is thrown on every man in society, including those who are facing extreme hardships and challenges in life. The fact is everyone has struggles, but when we paint people as privileged it invalidates their problems and makes them seem forgotten in society. It's fine to discuss social privileges by looking at the big picture, but I think too often they are applied to individual perspectives and create gross generalizations in society, which leads to people dismissing the experiences of others and not caring about problems men have. I personally (and I think most would agree) would rather be born as a female POC in a high-income family than be a white male in some mining town trailer park. ""Male privilege"" has isolated men in society, and led to the growth of incel communities or people like Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson who actually acknowledge their feelings, and give them credence. I am not trying to justify what these people or communities say or believe, but just think many men find themselves in a position where they think it's the only place open to them, and feel outcasted by members of the feminist movement or those constantly fighting against ""male privilege"" in society. 

We can also see this when blaming people for ""male privileges."" Look at the abortion debate and the overturning of Roe V Wade which was blamed at least in part by men. The narrative is that it's men who use this to oppress women. Taking away their rights, viewing them as property, and not actually caring about a fetus but just wanting women to be second-class citizens and not having rights. These ideas just seem ridiculous to me when you actually look at the [polling and demographics](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/). 58% of men and 63% of women believe abortion should be legal, while 41% of men and 35% of women think it should be illegal. **It's a 5-6% gap**. Again yes, there are some hateful and sexist men out there, but a 5% gap in gender shows this is probably a small reason for abortion bans. Why are men the problem here when nearly the same amount of women support abortion bans or access? This isn't the ""patriarchy"" controlling women, it's women controlling women. 

I am pro-choice, I am a man who is more ""feminist"" or for reproductive rights than 35% of the women in this world. ""No uterus no opinion"" even if my opinion is advocating for your freedom and individual liberties? This world shouldn't be divided based on gender or sex, and neither should arguments about power, rather we should all realize that there are fundamentally two people in this world, 1. Those who have power, and 2. Those who don't. Someones gender doesn't grant that power, and instead of focusing on that we should just focus on helping those who don't have power and fighting against those who do have power, regardless of their other personal characteristics and traits.

**TLDR: ""Male Privilege"" is a dangerous generalization that undermines the struggles of a majority of men in society, and can lead them to adopt more radical principles and ideas, for example, those found in the incel community. CMV**"

The protogonist(s) are up against a seemingly superior enemy force, how will they ever win you ask yourself? And then the writer’s primitive ingenuity save the day: “Easy! They just kill the main bad guy, mothership, central core, throw the ring into the lava, etc.. and boom all other enemies magically die.”

My claim is that this is always an idiotic and lazy way to solve the main conflict. It is never justified because it removes the main interest of an antagonist dominant conflict, which is finding out how will heroes overcome the enemy advantage

I will use what comic writer Stan Lee once said about conflicts with external antagonists. That in such stories (say your typical hero vs villain), the villain must ALWAYS be stronger than the hero in whatever “head on” fight they have. If it’s pure violence, villain must be overpowering. If it it’s sports, villain is superior athlete. And so on. The fun and good writing would then come with asking “How will the heroes win?”. And the only acceptable solution would be an unorthodox approach/strategy. 

So when it comes to stories where large numbers of enemy forces, the question is how will heroes beat this enemy with superior numbers or fighting force? However, the trope of just “killing one to kill all” completely side steps the question! The heroes never actually resolved the main conflict, but made it a non issue by only focusing on a single entity. And it doesn’t matter whether the reason makes sense or not (i.e., the robot army loses because it’s central computer is whipped out), it is still lazy writing.

Imagine if at the final contest in a sport story, the hero(s) win because the ref disqualified the enemy opponent/team. That would not be a satisfying resolution  regardless if the victory technically valid.

Therefore, anytime this trope is ever used in any sort of media it should be condemned and given poor reviews. It can never be good story telling because the very purpose of the story (resolve the conflict) is never really resolved but side stepped…aka a cop out.


P.S. my argument is in context of “external antagonist dominant” stories. Basically when the main conflict is an external enemy. Stories that focus on more internal struggles or non antagonist conflicts maybe immune to my argument."

0,2022-10-24,CMV: The Las Vegas store owner who stabbed a robber used disproportionate force,u/General_West,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycm7uh/cmv_the_las_vegas_store_owner_who_stabbed_a/,changemyview,"To understand the full context, search for something along the lines of ""Las Vegas store owner stabs robbers"" and watch the full video in its entirety.

&amp;#x200B;

From my perspective, in the video you can see the robber jumping over the counter and directing his full attention to the merchandise. The store owner then quickly approaches him with a knife and begins stabbing the robber. From that alone, I question if the store owner was truly justified in stabbing the robber seven times. In my opinion, the store owner should have at least made an attempt to retreat (in fact the state I live in requires defenders to attempt to retreat, the ""duty to retreat"") rather than engage with robbers over merchandise that is likely insured. It doesn't help that the store owner later went on Reddit to comment that he was calm and collected at the time and bragged about his knife skills.

So does stealing merchandise alone warrant lethal force? Do we truly want to live in a country where people are demanding the death penalty for petty crime akin to places like Saudi Arabia?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the conversation so far. But to clarify, I am arguing this more from an ethical/moral standpoint. I understand that in all likelihood what the owner did was legal within the State of Nevada. And whether or not you agree with my post title, remember the point is to have a civil discussion!

Edit 2: (copy pasting here from my comment) To clarify:  My greater concern beyond this situation itself is that the promotion and celebration of situations like these serve to embolden people who are looking for an excuse to use a weapon. Why should we glorify situations like this where someone nearly kills another person without due process? Even if you think the store owner is in the right, this isn't something people should be celebrating, as is the case in many comment sections on Reddit.

Edit 3: Thank you for the mostly civil discussion. Done posting for now unless I see anything else that greatly changes my mind."

0,2022-10-24,CMV: Incestuous relationships are morally permissible and should be legal,u/GestapoTakeMeAway,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycqux4/cmv_incestuous_relationships_are_morally/,changemyview,"I have a relatively short argument for why I think they're morally permissible and should be legalized. At least some incestuous relationships are between consenting adults and cause little to no third-party harm. Relationships with such characteristics are usually seen as morally permissible and should become legally permissible. We also think that there should be very good justifications to use legal force to prevent certain states of affairs from arising, and if there aren't any good justifications, we should legalize them. If we were in a country which has a ban inter-racial or homosexual marriage, we would rightly ask what the justification for that law is.

**Objections:**

*""Incestuous relationships do cause third-party harm. Inbreeding leads to genetic defects"".*

Response: It is true that inbreeding has a much higher chance for bringing about children who have disabilities. However, not all incestuous relationships even entail that the adults in said relationship will have children or will even intend to have children. They could take the proper steps such as wearing protection to avoid having children. There's still a risk of getting pregnant and producing children who have deformities, but we already do activities that have the potential for third-party harm. Secondhand smoke from smoking cigarettes has the potential to seriously harm people, but if you're in a controlled environment, we think it's morally permissible(but perhaps irrational) to smoke.

Secondly, inbreeding doesn't harm anyone. This claim sounds very strange. You might want to say, ""obviously it does, it harms the child who will be born"". But this isn't true. My response involves Derek Parfit's non-identity problem. First, I need to define harm. Something is harmful just in case it leaves a person worse off than they otherwise would've been. Now, here's a hypothetical scenario. Mary and Joe who are both siblings decide to have sex and have a child named Frank. Frank has some disabilities as a result, and Frank says to his parents, ""Your incestuous relationship has harmed me. I would've been better off if you didn't engage in such an abominable relationship"". Is Frank's claim true? No, it is not. Here's another hypothetical scenario. Mary decides to have sex with Bob who is not her sibling, and Joe remains celibate for the rest of his life. Mary and Bob have a child named Steve who is not Frank. As we can see, Frank wouldn't have been worse off than he otherwise would've been had his parents not engaged in incest. If Mary went off with Bob, he wouldn't have existed. He's not worse off in the world where his parents have incest because in worlds where Mary and Joe don't have incest, they don't produce Frank due to the sperm and egg combinations being completely different. The only way one could defend that Frank was harmed is that he was harmed by being brought into existence because his life wasn't worth living due to the negative aspects of his life outweighing the positive aspects in his life. However, I think this is a very hard claim to defend. Most people with disabilities still have lives worth living, and were not harmed by being brought into existence. It would be very hard to defend that all children born from inbreeding have lives not worth living.

Finally, even if inbreeding were harmful to the child born, it would still not justify outlawing incest. Couples who have a high chance of passing on disease to their children are allowed to procreate if they're not related by blood. It would be immoral if we banned disabled people from procreating even if they had a 100% chance of producing disabled offspring.

*""Incestuous relationships involve abusive power dynamics""*

Response: We already have laws which target abusive relationships. Banning incest would be redundant. Also, we allow adults to consent to romantic and sexual relationships with large power dynamics. We let powerful politicians have consensual romantic and sexual relationships with those who lack political power. We let physically weak people have relationships with physically strong people. We'd let an extremely poor person and an extremely rich person have romantic and sexual relationships with each other.

*""Incest is gross. Why would you want to do that?""*

Response: A lot of things are gross. Many of us may find certain sex positions and fetishes to be very gross, but we don't outlaw them. I find incest gross, but I also want to let adults have the freedom to engage in any sort of consensual relationship they want, and my personal preferences shouldn't stop them from doing so."

9,2022-10-24,CMV: Progressives in the US need to acknowledge the depth of Cold War messaging and let go of Marxist labels if they ever want to make a case for an egalitarian economy to swing voters,u/NorthwesterlySolder,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycs10i/cmv_progressives_in_the_us_need_to_acknowledge/,changemyview,"When I say “Cold War messaging” I’m largely talking about the discourse over “left”, “right” and “freedom” that has resulted directly from 20th Century phenomena such as McCarthyism and the original Red Scare. This includes arguing about what “Marxism” really means, whether or not Venezuela, the Soviet Union etc. were successful or not, and if “capitalism” is at the root of American problems. Obviously, these are in fact pretty valid questions to ask in an academic or conversational setting, but engaging with these ideas has considerably set back the electability of people in the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Simply put, liberal Democrats and Republicans have abundantly clear stances on these issues that:

(1) Align completely with the status quo of American education and popular culture

(2) Are easily used against opponents who try to deviate from them.

The reason that I think it’s possible for this to happen in the first place is that the progressive wing does not actually believe in the popular definitions of Marxism or necessarily oppose capitalism at all. None of these people are pushing for some sort of Leninist revolution or complete upheaval of the free market, but when they label themselves as “socialist” or sometimes even “leftist”, they’re giving the establishment politicians and think tanks an easy win because the population is conditioned to see these ideas as the antithesis of American heritage. When you see someone with pretty common sense healthcare policies start to debate an ideologue about whether Venezuela has better healthcare than the US, you’re fighting an endless uphill battle based on a strawman comparison. Establishment Dems and Republicans basically always defer to examples of poor revolutionary Communist countries to strike down progressivism, which never had strong democratic institutions or much of an economy to begin with. The US is definitely not a bastion of political stability but the problem and solutions necessary here are extremely different and Progressive policies are pretty good at addressing them but no one will care to understand that until they stop dying on the hill of defending XYZ example of socialism or associating with Marxist terminology.

I think this is important because a lot of progressive candidates have identified as socialist or Marxist at various points and most of them do not actually need to. It feels like an egotistical insistence on something most Americans have an understandably lopsided preconceived opinion of. 

Furthermore, I just don’t think that leftist voters are as committed to Marxist ideology as centrists and the right are to the sanctity of capitalism. Progressives could easily get away by completely disaffecting themselves from the stuff that American voters obviously resent and still essentially talking about the same ideas. I’m not saying that they should return instigation about these issues with radio silence. I just think that they need to work a lot harder on making it clear that they are essentially still variations of welfare capitalists or social democrats at best instead of conceding to labels like “socialist” and then trying to explain why it’s actually not so bad.

So here are the things that could change my mind about this:

- Evidence that there is already an effort to actively change the nature of Progressive messaging

- Arguments that explain why the current messaging is either crucial to their success or important to voters

- Anything else that explains how this view is not accurate to their current strategy or logically unsound. I’m very, very open to having my mind changed.

What I don’t think is really relevant:

- Whether or not you think their policies are fair or if they will work

- Extensive semantic debates (as in pedantic arguments about what Marx really said on page 64737 of Das Kapital). My view is largely informed by the status quo perception of these ideas because that’s how voters vote."

11,2022-10-25,CMV: I don't think saying the N word is necessarily immoral; the context surrounding it determines that.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ycvkek/cmv_i_dont_think_saying_the_n_word_is_necessarily/,changemyview,"The N word is probably the most shocking word in the English language. It has a long historical context and can be one of the most offensive words in the English language. Still, I don't think it is de-facto immoral. 

First of all let me make one thing very clear, if used as an insult or as a means of demonizing black people, I don't think there is any circumstance whatsoever in which it isn't immoral. But, in and of itself, it's just a word which means it's essentially nothing more than a sound we make with our mouth that we have prescribed meaning to. This meaning, I think, depends on context. This is why we don't think it's racist when we hear a black rapper say the word in a song. 

There's serval instances I can think of in which saying the word isn't necessarily immoral (aside from a black person saying it, of course):

An actor playing the role of a racist. 

When singing along to a song. 

Reading books like Huckleberry Finn aloud. 

In none of these cases is the word meant to target/harm another person, therefore they lose the hateful edge of the word since it is not being used *to be hateful*. If no hate is intended and there is no victim of hate, then the word loses its hateful prescription we have given it. 

Another instance I'm on the fence about is when used jokingly with people whom you know will not be hurt by the word. Do you guys remember the Destiny (streamer, not the game) fiasco a while back where he caught flak because he said he, in private with friends, jokingly uses the word? 

I can see the point Destiny was making here. First of all, nobody was offended/hurt by the word, which, to an extent, I think kind of eliminates the ""hateful"" element since nobody was the victim of hate. Obviously I don't know Destiny personally, but given his record on Twitch he's a pretty avid anti-racist, I assume he has a sense of shock/dark humor and if he's careful with his audience as to make sure there is nobody to be the victim of hate, then I guess an argument of ""no harm no foul"" could be made. Vaush, too, made this argument when he said he says it in private, jokingly, to his girlfriend. Again, I don't know Vaush personally, but his steaming history is ferociously anti-racist. His justification was that he enjoys dark/shock humor, and since nobody is around to hear it, nobody is the victim of hate and he knows he is not using it in a hateful way. 

Now one obvious objection here is ""if you say it in private that just makes you a closet racist."" I have issues with this objection.

 Going back to Vaush and Destiny, these are two guys who are pretty damn ""woke,"" especially Vaush. There is, essentially, no evidence of them actually being racist. Vaush especially devotes much of his time to fighting racism and frequently debates neo-Nazis. I have no reason to believe that their justification of ""dark/shock humor"" isn't true. 

Secondly, having lived in Georgia my whole life, I've experienced a plethora of racism, and from my experience, racists don't try and hide it, they're pretty upfront about it. I remember my great grandpa arguing with my mom about how races shouldn't mix when I was a kid. My great uncle used to rant about how black women aren't worth anything other than sleeping with; he had 2 bi-racial kids who he refused to even meet because they were ""half-breeds."" My (paternal) grandpa wouldn't let my (maternal) uncle come to birthdays at his house because his wife (my aunt) is a black women. I could go on and on. 

Even people like my cousin who will adamantly claim he **isn't** racist will openly and frequently use the N word in a not joking, obviously racist way, justifying it by saying things like ""well if they're acting like &gt;N words&lt; then I'm going to call them that."" 

I've experienced tons of racism. I grew up around it and have seen it more times than I care to remember, some of it truly awful in ways I haven't mentioned. None of these people try to hide it. Hell, they're proud of it! After all, they do think they are the ""supreme race."" 

I don't necessarily buy the ""closeted"" racist response, because I think if they are truly racist, it'll show, just as how if they are not racist, it will also show. And given that people like Vaush and Destiny have obviously shown they are not racist, my assumption is they do not say the word hatefully, they're not trying to offend/hurt anybody, and there is nobody who is offended by it, I have no reason not to believe them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And, no, I do not say the N word. I do enjoy dark humor, but I don't say the N word, the only time I even say anything like that is when I'm alone singing along to a song. I just don't think someone saying it automatically makes them a racist. The word has meaning we prescribe to it, and if it is not used in a hateful way (i.e., directed towards another person) then I don't think it's necessarily hateful, and therefore not immoral."

My main concern is artists who draw nsfw of fantasy or no longer existing creatures such as dragons, dinosaurs, and centaurs are being accused and harassed for being zoophiles.

My opinion is, if the creature being sexualized is intelligent/ able to consent, is of mature age, and doesn’t heavily resemble any real animal, it is not zoophilia.

Someone who watches dragon porn isn’t going to move on to abuse a real dragon, and attacking people who do takes weight away from the term “zoophile” and directs hate towards people who are of no danger to animals. 

People are not separating genuinely dangerous people from paraphiliac individuals, and I believe it’s an issue.

EDIT: my use of the term zoophilia was incorrect, however, I still believe dragon/humanoid porn enjoyers shouldn’t be lumped together with dog porn enjoyers"

I didn’t say “having preferences is illogical”, “excluding a certain type of person is illogical”, or “not being attracted to someone is illogical”. 

I’m not against preferences about looks, but not everyone from a certain race will look the same. I think excluding a whole race always boils down to stereotypes and generalizations. Of course stereotypes and generalizations don’t always have to be problematic, and I myself find some of them valid. But specifically in this scenario I believe they (consciously or not) come from a harmful place. You can be not attracted to a certain body type and that body type might be common in one race, but not _everyone_. It’s (in my opinion) valid to not be attracted to someone physically, but explicitly excluding an entire race from your dating pool is something different.

I want to hear others perspectives on this and let me know if you need me clarifying anything."

Today people who die from wars is way less than the past and more people die from lifestyle related diseases. 

Today the world is more peaceful even if there are wars — it is no way like in the past, why do then conservatives (and their numbers are increasing every day) are opposing change to human progression and flourishing? 

Do they lack empathy? What am I missing here?

Edit: This is not about American politics, but I am talking generally.

Edit: I mean “human” progression by allowing the improvement of the quality of human beings lives through quality/free education, healthcare, free market that doesn’t exploit other humans, allowing autonomy in their private lives (as long as they don’t cause harm to the society), employees and workers rights. And caring about animals during their lifetimes and the environment.

There is no chances about establishing a democracy in such country. Let's be honest: everyone would be happy if Russia will turn into a North Korea like country. I met with many people who wish about this scenario to happen. 

Another thing that made my heart broken is the fact how most of russians in this country are supporting current government and war. I feel guilty for being a part of such nation. I was raised in a russian culture, with russian fairytales and language. And my native language is now becoming useless outside of Russia, which will become an isolated pariah state.

Protests? Revolution? Never mind. Seems like it's true that most of russians are having slave mindset. Maybe it's because of genetical errors or culture. Seems like isolating Russia and letting it turn into totalitarian country is the right thing... 

I'm studying english well, but it's terrible how your nation, culture and language are destroyed. Latest events made me get dissapointed about patriotism. Patriotism is nothing but a joke, and it would be better if everyone will talk only in english. And that's why I'm cosmopolitalist."

Second, I love being informed correctly and knowing all the facts. However, I find it extremely challenging when trying to discover (or uncover) the truth. Everyone has an agenda. 

* Are they Pro-Ukraine? 
* Are they Pro-Russia?
* Are they anti-establishment?
* Are they anti-war? 
* Are they pro-war?
* Are they pro-NATO?
* Are they anti-NATO?
* Etc. 

I want to know the facts. As of today, here is where I gather any information regarding the current war in Ukraine: 

1. Ukraine Subreddit 
1. Malcontent News
1. Traditional US Media Sources (NPR, NYT, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, AP, etc.)
1. Various podcasts

My current view is relatively simple: Putin is a megalomaniacal dictator, holding on to his last attempt to show the world he is a force to be reckoned with and will go to any extreme possible to come away as a victor in this ""special military operation"" he is currently conducting. 

I won't absolve NATO (nor The West) from any wrongdoing simply because I do not know all the facts nor the enormous (and complicated) history of this geopolitical mess that has been stewing for over a century in that part of the world. However, I put more blame on Putin and Russia for being insecure, authoritative, and downright power-hungry. 

I find his human-rights violations appalling, and I want to know - does he have ANY LEGITIMATE reason to act the way he has? And what are some other sources of information I can digest that will help me better understand what is happening in Ukraine, why America cares so much, and who is really to blame? 

I imagine it's a scenario in which EVERYONE is to blame (to some extent), but I would love to know why my view may be skewed and what I should consider before taking an official stance, if there is even an official stance to take. 

EDIT: Please know my goal isn't to try and be convinced Putin is a GOOD PERSON.  I want to know if this is all Putin and Russia's fault, or did we stir the hornet's nest by being too interventionist, and could we have avoided this mess? 

***EDIT 2: It's clear I may have rushed this post when coming up with the core title, so I apologize if it appears I am looking for a REASON to JUSTIFY what Putin has been doing to thousands of innocent civilians. I wanted to better understand what drives a person like Putin to do such things and whether there was any way to avoid this catastrophe through diplomacy vs. the threat of WW3. 

Thanks!"

Even though the concept has been discussed for thousands of years, there is still ambiguity in the words Good, and Evil. A better frame would be Selfless and Selfish.

- What we consider Purity of Good, would be a lifetime of mostly selfless actions and thoughts.

- What we consider Purity of Evil, would be a lifetime of mostly selfish actions and thoughts.

Our lives allow us to balance our actions daily, practicing compassions, generosity, humility, as antidotes to our animal nature. Our primal desires. Uncontrolled impulses.

Our primal desires, what we often refer to as Evil, are grounded in selfish desire. The Seven Deadly Sins are the traits that we share with our animal relatives. Our sense of self is what allows us to be above these desires, which allows us to fulfill something greater than our “animal instincts” could alone.

Pride, is the obsession with self, the myth of narcissis is a great example. Obsession with self, creates more and more attachment toward self, which fuels the fire of the other 6 deadly sins.

If you have an inflated sense of self then:

Someone else having something you don’t have will cause Envy, a deeply selfish emotion.

Someone hurting your ego can cause you to amass an unreasonable amount of Wrath and anger.

Gluttonously wanting more food or drink is always justifiable.

Lustfully wanting more sex, or to feel the neurochemical release becomes a daily desire.

Not wanting to move, or make any action towards the future is completely justifiable, and videogames, tv, social media, are the vehicles of Sloth in the modern world.

Greed fuels the desire for more possessions, money, reputation, power. Greed exists within animals, but has the potential for far more complexity within humans.

What we consider Good and Evil, are simply compounding actions and intentions towards selfless and selfish actions. The complexity, and what makes things morally ambiguous is when there are hundreds of actions towards a goal, some selfish, some selfless."

The effects of raising a child in a single parent household and the importance of having both parents for a child's development is a *greatly* researched and well documented topic that I'm sure we all know about. It simply isn't something you can deny. 

To deny your child that just because you don't want the involvement of a man or scared of your biological clock running out is frankly selfish.

Now life can always happen and take a parent out of the equation, willingly or unwillingly, forcing single parenthood but electively choosing to go down that path is simply irresponsible and selfish. It's you putting your wants before considering the child you're bringing into this world. It's even worse that you don't have to prove financial stability to get your sperm donation but if you want to adopt a child there's that *and* more.

Why? Because the child's wellbeing is being considered."

I start fresh for all of these hypothetical fights.

Before I start this post it’s important that you know that I am not some egotistical meathead who thinks they can beat anyone in a fight.  Most of the women’s lightweight ufc roster would tap me with no issues in round 1.  This is purely a numbers game, with very big numbers.  

My friend says I’m crazy and that I have no chance, but I disagree.  I think that given 1 billion tries I would win multiple times against any UFC fighter.

UFC fighters are humans too and even though they would murder me almost every time, they could still slip up.  I could try throwing a flying knee 1 million times.  Next, do a crazy kick 5 million times,  after all these attempts I would still have hundreds of millions of attempts left.  I also think that in a billion individuals fights, even against someone inexperienced, every fighter will significantly injure themselves hundreds of times.  Just think if I was against McGregor and his leg snapped while kicking me, just like it did in his fight against Dustin.  I would just run away from him and try to kick him in the head while he was rolling around in pain.  

If you happen to agree with my view, tell me, what do you think my rough odds are against the average UFC fighter.  1/1 million? 1/100 million?  If you believe I am crazy and my friend is correct, please say so.


Edit: view was changed.  I think I would struggle to KO some heavyweight champions even with a billion tries.  However it’s obviously not impossible.  The mental image of myself trying to KO Francis Ngannou is really what made me question my prior conclusion."

Sometimes those news were spread by local institutions with the intent to create fear and control the population (e.g. ""Jewish people are spreading the black plague""), sometimes were genuinely believed by a few and become over time become part of the popular belief (e.g. ""doing X or Y will bring you bad luck"").

In my lifetime, before social media become popular, people had fewer means of communications and spreading ideas. However, a few TV channels and a few mainstream newspapers could controlled the public's opinion. 

Event public TV channels in western countries were constantly lying to their viewers. Few examples are mass campaign of misinformation about smoking not being unhealthy, or reports exaggerating the harm of some drugs or imposing a discriminatory view on black people.

These fake news were harder to detect and to have a debate around it. They created long-lived damaged to our society from creating stereotypes and discriminations and bad habits.

Social medias give the power to anyone to create and spread a fake news, but also gives to anyone the tools to read argument against it, engage in discussions and find an audience that would support their counter argument. It's creating a level playing field for everyone to have their voice heard. 

Additionally, we are building tools to detect those fake news. While it's true that some people are migrating towards platform like Parler and Truth, their adoption have been quite low. 

Traditional social medias have been implementing effective ways to detect and remove harmful content. While the system is still far from perfect, it's a good step in the right direction.

The misinformation around COVID-19 has been systematically removed from traditional social medias (at least in some EU countries, not sure in the USA), and pushed a lot of people to spread these news through chat apps such as Telegram. 

I was quite scared about seeing this shift. All in a sudden those fake news did not have public visibility and scrutiny."

Finding a path to ceasefire via diplomacy is pertinent, otherwise, this conflict could rage on for years with neither side willing to concede (both believing they hold the moral high ground and legitimate cause, wrongly in Russia's case of course, but that isn't relevant when it comes to human lives). Ideally, Putin is overthrown and peace comes from a regime change, but that's definitely not a sure bet by any stretch. What if the Donbas, or some narrow corridor of the East were to be turned into a neutral zone or independent state in order to diffuse the situation?"

I can’t play the slide whistle for shit.
I’m just saying it how it is, it’s my view and I’ll gladly have it changed.

I’m not a musical prodigy who can play 15 instruments… but I see the trombone and I see the slide whistle and they work the same way do they not? You blow and slide the adjustment thingy to change the air pressure and change the note.
I mean in a way, we all have a little trombone/slide whistle built into to our bodies because that’s exactly how we whistle.

Maybe I should have stated my view differently. Like “The slide whistle is basically a happy meal trombone”.
But then it sounds like punching down.
Bottom line is, they’re both the same thing.
I’m struggling to phrase it in a way that doesn’t hurt one of these instrument’s feelings. It’s like they don’t want to be compared. They hate eachother but they’re still brothers.
Only difference is that one went on to play in orchestras and the other became a comedian. I imagine the instrument family dinners are awkward."

Those terms are not synonymous.

I was having a discussion with a fried the other day and we were remarking on how it's seemingly impossible to continue to vote republican at this point without outing yourself as a racist, homo/transphobic, anti-semite. I realize there are still members of, what I'll refer to as the ""old party,"" and they do not agree with the horrible behavior of the the Trumper et al group.

However, at this point, how does one continue to vote conservatively when you know the party as a whole has become a radicalized cult deadset on inciting violence? Especially when the American people decide(d) your views do not reflect the whole?

I, personally, feel that in order to retain what remains of the *old party* we need to chuck these radicalized conservatives into their own party to disempower them. We need multiple perspectives in order to drive healthy discourse - diversity in thought is inherently necessary and healthy. Except that, and I realize this might be a touchy thing to say, “Freedom of speech,” does not make you “free from the consequences of your speech.” 

IIRC, the definitions of respective parties have been changed before (e.g. Lincoln was a republican, but, from what I understand, was very much in line with the current definition of democrat/liberal). 

The current Republican Party is irredeemable at this point and if you continue to associate with them, by voting for them, then you are contributing to this mess.

EDIT: I should add

1.	that I'm definitely not a republican.
2.	i don't like Nazis
3.	i would punch Nazis if given the chance
4.	There is a lot that I don't know about political structures in my own country which is why I submitted this idea. 
5.	This isn't a situation where you just tell me things and I just believe them. Give me things to read or watch.

EDIT 2: Things I've learned:

1.	Two parties naturally occur in US politics. These restructurings occur relatively frequently and are just how our system operates. 
2.	Breaking up the parties won't work - from a logistical standpoint it makes one party weaker. Both D and R would have to break up.
3.	If you're republican and are on the fence about whether you should continue to vote with your party, because you don't want to support trump era policies, then you should vote Democrat (or not vote at all).
4.	I have zero upvotes on this post hahahahaha FTW!"

Censorship is the problem here. You can get banned for any reason or sometimes no reason at all on reddit. You can get banned simply for expressing an opinion the mod doesn't agree with. I know people who have been banned for responding to harassment in the comments. Downvotes effectively censor you too. If the hivemind of that subreddit doesn't agree with or like your comment, it's +100 downvotes and at the bottom of the thread nobody looks at or sometimes accumulates so many downvotes it's removed. The rules too. A lot of the rules are restrictive with things like an arbitrary word count where your post is removed for not having 150 characters when 150 characters isn't need for the post to be coherent and promote discussion or having a filter on specific words e.g I had a post instantly removed on r/showerthoughts because it mentioned the word ""shower"". It didn't violate the rules. It wasn't a post about showers of thoughts people have in showers. The word ""shower"" is just censored. 

To top all of it, there's been a subreddit I've been instantly banned from just for having the audacity to be active in a subreddit it didn't like. Not even an offensove subreddit. It was r/tumblrinaction. I posted a comment in one of their posts, immediately banned from a subreddit that doesn't like r/tumblrinaction"

In my adult years, I’m no longer religious, but I’ve realized that a different concept of God can be useful for goals/external accountability etc.  
Here’s how I think about this 

\-I have a “job title” and description and think of “God” like an imaginary boss

\-if there are times when I don’t feel like working towards the goals I’ve set for myself, I remind myself that it’s a little like not fulfilling your job description (or not showing up for work for a few days)

\-so basically it’s an external imaginary accountability partner to help me do live the life I want to live

Anyway, I am cautious about sharing this too widely because I’m sure I’m missing some nuance or reasons why this wouldn’t always apply…but I haven’t been able to see any flaws in this model so far.  


What do you think? Are there any obvious problems you see with applying this model more widely (ie: encouraging others to make a job title/description with “God”?)

738,2022-10-26,CMV: There’s nothing wrong with being “ableist” when it comes to John Fetterman running for senate.,u/HelloColeslaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yeb5ow/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_being_ableist_when/,changemyview,"In general, frivolously using someone’s disability(s) as a reason to not vote for someone is shitty and should be frowned upon. In the specific case where someone’s disability(s) negatively impact their ability to perform their duties compared to a non-disabled person, it is absolutely acceptable, especially for a position as important as a US Senator.

This is largely in response to the Oz v Fetterman debate last night and the reactions I’ve seen on Twitter to it. I watched it live beginning to end and came away thinking “wow, how could the Fetterman campaign allow this to happen, they should’ve never accepted a debate, he’s clearly not fit for office.” I thought this of course would be the prevailing view. While I saw a lot of that, there was also a loud minority claiming that not supporting Fetterman because of his continued health issues after his stroke is “ableist”. I completely disagree with that framing.

For context, John Fetterman unfortunately suffered a stroke several months ago. During the debate he repeatedly stumbled, took very long pauses, would repeat himself, and generally looked like he wasn’t always aware of what was asked. This is even with closed captioning being provided for him upon his request. 

In my view, someone who cannot properly process what they hear, nor properly debate and form clear coherent sentences is not fit for office. Especially as a senator, where debate is very important. Even if his actual brain function is fine and he’s just unable to properly process audio and speak, that still doesn’t make him competent to hold office. Our elected representatives should not have significant mental/oral impairments. Their mental acuity and ability to articulate themselves is of the utmost importance.

If his disability wouldn’t directly impact and negatively effect his ability to perform his duties as a senator, I would not support this so called “ableism”. If his disability was something like that of Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott (wheelchair) or former Democratic US Senator Max Cleland who was missing three limbs, I would stand against any “ableist” comments as these disabilities don’t negatively impact one’s ability to govern. Having a stroke victim with serious speech and auditory processing issues try to be in the senate would be akin to Abbott or Cleland wanting to work for a lawn care company to mow yards. They’re just not qualified based on their disabilities. 

I think this is an improper use of the term “ableist” and that this man is unfit to represent the people of Pennsylvania. All the best to him in his continued recovery.

EDIT : Changed wording in paragraph one from “regular” to “non-disabled” as people were getting hung up on language and not substance.

EDIT 2 : Dang y’all, I came back to 80ish comments and in almost getting through all of them I now have 30 more. A lot of comments now are coming across as being very partisan (people who are anti-Oz/republicans) given that my original prompt had nothing to do with this and that I have no interest in bashing one side or the other nor talking about why you hate Oz, I will just be ignoring these to save time. My point is about Fetterman, ableism, and his speech issues, not about the benefits and downsides of Oz. Comments I don’t get to tonight, I’ll get to tomorrow afternoon.

EDIT 3 : Before I go to bed, I’d like to point out I’ve given 3 deltas. 2 on the subject of why it would still be reasonable for some people to vote for him based on partisanship and 1 that brought up that other congressmen are stroke survivors. Although these people made good points ancillary to the issues of Fetterman and disabled people, I’d like the conversation to stick more closely to the ableism point specifically, and so tomorrow when I come back I’ll only be awarding deltas to comments which specifically address the ableism issue.

EDIT 4 : Lol thanks to whoever had the Reddit Cares thing sent to me, I’m good though my guy

FINAL EDIT : Alright y’all I’ve probably responded well over a hundred times today and yesterday. Comments keep flooding in and I can’t keep up plus I have to get back to work. I’m done replying now, thanks for the explanations and conversations"

There is political discussion from various different factions about discriminatory hiring practices, but I think it's safe to say that discriminatory hiring practices (that is, hiring one person over another for any reason other than pure merit) hurts everyone.

The most obvious accusation is that companies can employ racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise discriminatory hiring practices, even if the hiring managers are doing it subconsciously. I remember seeing a study about how people who apply for jobs with, ""black sounding,"" names were less likely to be hired. There are also things such as affirmative action or minority quotas, which have been criticized for being racist practices.

There are other types of discrimination though, which aren't talked about as much. Political discrimination is a good example, I have seen TikToks and posts on other sites where hiring managers or recruiters talk about how they scan their potential employees' Social Media pages, and choose not to hire them based on political beliefs. This creates a society that is hostile towards anyone with political beliefs that aren't in line with what corporations expect, and it goes against the principals of free speech and democracy. To be clear, I'm not talking about free speech *the law*, I mean free speech *the idea*. The first amendment is great, but there are many ways that it falls short in the modern age, and it could totally be expanded to include more types of speech, and speech in different mediums.

## Implementation:

With my reasoning being laid out, let's talk about the implementation of this idea. 

The most obvious weakness that I think others would point out with this idea is that when a company does in-person interviews, they would obviously be able to see the person. My solution to that is what I think will be the most controversial aspect of this idea: With companies collecting personally identifiable information being outlawed before the hiring decision has been made, that would also make in person, face-to-face interviews illegal.

Now, I get that in person, face-to-face interviews are a big part of the hiring process for most companies, however, I'm confident that alternatives which replicate many of the benefits of this could be used instead. Obviously the internet could be used; an interview could be conducted via messaging or voice chat, for example. With the resources of hundreds of massive companies combined, however, I'm sure they could come up with an even more creative solution that still respects privacy and the new restrictions imposed.

Some detail/information that hiring managers get from an in person interview would, of course, be sacrificed. That's definitely a sacrifice that's worth it though, because on one hand, they might get slightly less information in the hiring process, but on the other hand, it would eliminate hiring discrimination almost in it's entirety, which is a societal benefit that greatly outweighs the cost.

Of course questions about things such as background checks can be brought up as well. My solution to that is a multi-step hiring process. Once companies have decided to hire someone, if a background check is needed, that person can be passed to phase-2. At this point, the only reason that the company is allowed to reverse their hiring decision would be if their background check comes back, and turns out they have a criminal record that makes them a bad fit for the job.

Another weakness with this idea is that the company might fire someone for a discriminatory reason after that person has been hired. The solution to this is to have stronger laws against wrongful termination with much more steep penalties. Unions would also be a great defense against this, if we could get rid of some of those pesky laws that prevent workplace organization.

## Conclusion:

I could continue to list details about the implementation, but then the post would become even longer than it already is. It also reduces the amount of things that can be discussed in the comments, which is no fun. The whole point is for other people to poke holes in this idea, so that I can either strengthen it and create a more concrete basis for it, or scrap it as a bad idea and go back to the drawing board. I've had this idea for a long time, and I just think about it every time I hear about discriminatory hiring practices, so I'm excited to discuss it regardless of the outcome, whether it gets absolutely destroyed, or if I end up believing in it even stronger than I did initially."

51,2022-10-27,"CMV: In most cases when eating out, tipping as a percentage doesn't make sense",u/ynot269,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yeqm4u/cmv_in_most_cases_when_eating_out_tipping_as_a/,changemyview,"Mostly referring to when you're eating as a pair vs large groups (will touch on that later).

Now before anyone calls me out, I'm a pretty generous tipper I tip 20% pretty consistently and sometimes more because I tend to round up to the nearest 5$. And this isn't a matter of whether I can afford to eat out or not, nor am I discussing the tip culture for services outside of dining (don't even get me started).

&amp;#x200B;

what I'm specifically referring to is the standard recommendation of 15% - 20%. What I'm noticing is food costs are going up due to inflation and restaurants are passing down the costs down to us the consumers. But why? the amount of work that the waitstaff doesn't change. When I tip (and I'm also assuming that this is the reason most people will tip as well) it's based on the amount of work my waiter/waittress does, for example if I have a large group of people (4+) the waitstaff obviously has to do more work when bringing out our food. But the amount of work ultimately depends on what is being ordered right?

&amp;#x200B;

So what If I'm ordering a lobster roll (30$) and my friend orders a chicken sandwhich (15$), why do I need to tip more for a lobster roll? In terms of the amount of work done to bring the food out I'd think a lobster roll likely weighs less than a chicken sandwhich.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a more extreme example, let's say I order caviar (maybe 100$ not sure never had it) and my friend orders a burger (20$), same rate of tip (20%) why am I \*supposed\* to tip 20$ as opposed to my friend who will tip 4$.

&amp;#x200B;

The point im trying to make is when eating out people should have fixed ideas of what they want to tip  in my case im thinking 5$ if I'm ordering a single item, shouldn't matter if it's foie gras, lobster, sandwhich etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The exception comes with large groups of people as what likely happens is that the waitstaff has to do much more work in bringing out entrees + appetizers + drinks. In that case it makes sense as a percentage in fact I see restaurants tend to already factor in a mandatory gratuity in the case of large groups.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course you are free to do as you please with your money, however there seems to be a large counter culture to anti-tipping, and I don't think it is fair to shame people for not wanting to tip as a percentage."

There is a small (like 4' x 3') planted area with surrounded by bricks with a tree and some other plants in it out front next to the sidewalk. Beautiful, right? But it gets covered in dog piss because so many people walking by just let their dogs pee on it. It smells like piss and kills the plants.

I think this is a serious asshole move.  It's gross and disrespectful to other people. Instead, you should try to get your dog to do its business in as inconspicuous of a place as possible, ideally curbing your dog if it is safe to do so, but if not just in as out-of-the-way place as you can manage. 

Some caveats to this view:

1. I get that dogs don't always do what you want. If you are trying to train your dog not to do this and discourage them from doing so but they do it anyway, you're not the asshole. I don't expect you to tackle your dog or anything to stop them. You just need to be reasonably trying.
2. I'm referring to things like planters and other features near their home. I don't really have strong feelings about a rock on private property that's not near anybody's home. 
3. I don't have as clear opinions on a dog just peeing on a grass lawn. Ideally this wouldn't happen but in some cases I suppose it may be the best option. Either way, my mind isn't really made up so I am excluding this from my view. The view is specifically about objects (like a planter, garden, mailbox, etc), not lawns.

Frankly, this seems like a no-brainer. Yet so many people just let their dogs do this that they must think it's okay, right? Presumably some people on this subreddit do this, too. So tell me, what am I missing?

(FWIW, I have never owned a dog as an adult, and my family's dog growing up would generally do its business in our yard, so this wasn't really an issue).

Edit: I've given Δ's to those who have by now pointed out in that in at least some cases there is ambiguity as to whether something is private property and/or that the owner would be bothered by the dog urine, and that perhaps there is at least in some cases some onus on the property owner to make that clear."

It might sound like a nice idea when presented in a short youtube video, but if you just take five minutes to consider it, it actually sounds like a terrible idea to me.

\- How are people supposed to get to work? The public transport infrastructure would have to connect to everybody's workplace. Given that most people commute and the shear diversity of jobs out there, I don't see how this is possible. For some, they would have to commute out of the city, then pick up a car and drive the rest of the way. How is this better urban planning than traditional suburbs?

\- How do deliveries get made? Say I need a new refrigerator delivered to my house. Instead of just pulling up a delivery truck to my front door, they'd have to resort to some much less convenient way of delivering goods. How about for stores? How do you get food and products into stores if there are no cargo trucks allowed? Train? So now instead of a paved loading dock, you would need a train depot at literally every store? How is that better?

\- How do emergency vehicles such as firetrucks, police cars, and ambulances work? What about garbage collection? These are vital resources, yet don't seem to ever be considered when hyping up these car-free communities.

\- What if you're disabled? Now everytime you need to go somewhere, you need to somehow get yourself to the nearest train stop instead of just to your car.

\- On top of all this, it also just makes our urban planning a LOT more inefficient. For long-haul journeys, sure a train might be faster than a car. But for short-trips (the kind that would matter for a car-free community), it is a lot slower and less convenient.

You don't have to convince me on all of these viewpoints in order to CMV. Just show me that car-free cities aren't some half-baked idea and actually offer some improvement over traditional urban planning."

MY VIEW (that I would like help validating / revising): The ideological premises and objectives of these schools of thought make intellectual exchange with their adherents impossible / fruitless / self-defeating.  There is not enough intellectual / philosophical / epistemic common ground on which non-adherents can engage with adherents.  In order to ""meet them where they are,"" non-adherents have to

(a) leave so many essential philosophical propositions behind \[EXAMPLE: that a person can have epistemic certainty about objective reality\]; and/or,

(b) provisionally accept so many obviously absurd propositions held by adherents \[EXAMPLE: that systems of socio-political power are the only, best, or a valuable lens through which to analyze humanity\]

that any subsequent exchange is precluded from bearing any fruit.  Furthermore, even provisionally accepting their obviously absurd propositions forfeits too much because it validates and legitimizes the absurd.

THEREFORE, the rest of society should refuse to intellectually engage with these schools of thought at all; but, rather, should focus on rescuing adherents from them in the same manner we would rescue people who have been taken-in by a cult: namely, by identifying and addressing the psychological and/or emotional problems that made them vulnerable to indoctrination by these self-referential systems.

TLDR: Arguing with committed skeptics - such as people who tout solipsism and Munchausen's trilemma - is a form of ""[feeding the trolls](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=feeding%20the%20trolls).""

I believe photo filters should be judged the similarly. However, my perception has been that sentiment towards photo filters is significantly more negative than makeup. You have subreddits like [https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/) with over 1m members and on Instagram #nofilter has over 10x the amount of tags over #nomakeup. 

Some ways to change my view (but open to more!):

1. Evidence or reasoning to show that for folks where makeup is easily accessible, photo filters are still significantly different from makeup to the point where their impact to society should be judged differently.
2. Evidence or reasoning to show that sentiment towards photo filters is not significantly different from sentiment towards makeup.

The greatest argument I've seen so far is photo filters are more accessible than makeup is to youths. This increases the chances of body dysmorphia for folks who are more vulnerable and might not otherwise have easy access to makeup."

Aside from that, if you’re old enough to inflict emotional pain on someone then you’re old enough to own why you did it. When you’re in a relationship and have any other problems, talking it out is usually the solution. For some reason, as soon as the topic is about leaving, the sentiment turns into “They don’t owe you an explanation,” even if there’s been leading on involved.

They certainly do. If everything is fine from the perspective of the person getting blindsided, how is it fair to leave them in the dark about such a drastic change. “It’s not you, it’s me” is a bandaid, cop out type of statement.

I believe that people who lived earlier had to go though less heat how it is now during summer and on warm areas of the world and I think this is on climate change to blame, and as of recently, I’m starting to think that it may never be fully solved because there will always be something or some people preventing us from ever getting closer and getting zero emissions

it would take someone with the same attitude and determination that Donald Trump or authoritive power in government that Xi jinping and Adolf Hitler had to get this crisis done but the Left (at least here in the US) never really got someone like that, the closest ones I can think of on top of my head are Al Gore and Bernie Sanders, but Gore lost the 2000 election by a few votes and got mocked at throughout the 2000s and like a lot of Americans are so allergic to socialism or simply hate it when the government “does staff”, therefore Sanders lost the 2 democratic primary he was in, I know there may be more reasons as to why he lose both primaries but this I think is the biggest one

the republicans as of now are only focus on the good of the nation, that “good“ being only benefiting an economy and people that helped climate change and pollution be the way they are is now along with getting rid of wanted rights like abortion, same sex marriage, Medicare and possibly even democracy itself as if the US wasn’t a flawed democracy already all along with making the lives of non-Christian white straight minorities as miserable as possible for no reason other than racism and bigotry and resent against making a better society and deny anything the democrats (while far from perfect as the American radical left wants them to be, they’re at least trying to do something about this threat) put on the table. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem if we had a different way of voting or ever getting rid of the electoral college years ago, but no, most conservatives in this country including the republicans only care about themselves and their needs and will refuse to take anything that will “remove“ any power they have

we can’t even get environmental projects right, a lot of you probably already heard about how much of a fiasco the California high speed railroad project, this project was commission with possibly  the worst plan on building anything, there’s been so much wrong with this project that I can’t even comprehend it

I really don’t like being a perssimist but it’s really hard not and it seems like things could get worse before it ever gets better but I’m willing to have an open mind to anyone who can change my view

Democrats have been relying to much on the Dobbs decision and that their candidates are election deniers.  Something many people aren’t as focused on as their bills they’re seeing increasing.

They also have to defend West Virginia, Ohio, Arizona, and Montana.  I don’t expect Manchin, Tester, Sinema, and Brown to survive their races.

The other reason that I’m seeing long term Republican dominance after 2024 is Moore v. Harper.

Moore v. Harper might be the death knell for them though as the republicans nearly control 2/3s of state legislatures.  This case might bring Eastmans election beliefs to life.

Wikipedia:

""Advocates of the independent state legislature theory or independent state legislature doctrine (ISL) interpret this as limiting such authority to the state's elected lawmakers, while the state's executive branch, judiciary, or other bodies with legislative power (such as constitutional conventions or independent commissions) have no powers of electoral oversight. Accordingly, in the event of a conflict between congressional election regulations enacted by a state's legislature and those derived from other sources of state law, that conflict must be resolved in favor of the state legislature's enactments, even over state constitutional provisions, and similarly over ballot initiatives which effectively modify a state constitution."" - Wikipedia

The Atlantic:

In Moore v. Harper, the Court will finally resolve whether there is a doctrine of constitutional interpretation known as the “independent state legislature.” If the Court concludes that there is such a doctrine, it would confer on state legislatures plenary, exclusive, and judicially unreviewable power both to redraw congressional districts for federal elections and to appoint state electors who quadrennially cast the votes for president and vice president on behalf of the voters of the states. It would mean that the partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts by state legislatures would not be reviewable by the state courts—including the states’ highest court—under their state constitutions."" - The Atlantic

NYU Law School Brennan Center:

""The Elections Clause delegates to states the power to regulate federal elections while giving Congress the overriding authority to make or alter such laws. Proponents of the independent state legislature theory — like the gerrymanderers — read the Elections Clause to give state legislators near-exclusive authority to regulate federal elections, prohibiting any other state entity — like state courts or governors — from placing checks and balances on that power. In this case, the gerrymanderers are arguing that the theory licenses them to violate the state constitution when drawing congressional maps and that the state courts do not have the power to stop them.' -"

What I've noticed is that my ignorance surrounding a certain topic meant that I would often get stuck, not even knowing the metaphysical shape of the idea, let alone the other aspects.

However what I've come to realise when being open to my own ignorancr is that with a few focused questions, and spending a small amount of time on the internet, i can partially fill the gap in my worldview.

Richard Feynman gave a beautiful demonstration of this with an interviewer who asked a non-specific question.
https://youtu.be/MO0r930Sn_8

A Great Question must be earned in terms of knowledge, and have the feeling or hernest emotion of inquiry and curiosity.

If the opposite is true, then people simply need information, no context to self, or to the broader worldview required.

If the statement is true, then we need to reimagine our childrens learning environment, such that it allows an answer to be given when ever a question is asked, even if it's ""I don't know, but let's find out together""."

I understand wanting to fix the problems in policing. I do too. But to say we should try to eliminate or greatly reduce policing suggests that it's not just a few bad apples and that policing itself is a problem. 

I don't know where the data is that supports this. Advocates of defunding the police will cite specific examples of a police officer shooting an unarmed POC- obviously terrible- but according to the actual data, that's incredibly rare. I have never heard a defund the police advocate say what the chances of an unarmed POC dying from police are. It seems to me that the actual numbers *don't* support the idea that this is a widespread issue and do support the ""bad apples"" theory that many DTP advocates reject. 

DTP advocates talk about police gangs. I agree, this is a problem, but I have seen nothing that suggests this is widespread and common. There have been some police gangs, but that fact doesn't disprove the bad apples theory. 

DTP advocates also talk about the origins of policing and how police used to catch runaway slaves. Obviously that's horrible, but the fact that those were the origins of American policing does not prove that modern day American policing is contaminated by racism and corruption. 

To reiterate, I absolutely agree there are corrupt, dirty, and racist cops and society should do everything in its power to weed out those bad apples. What I don't agree with is the idea that the bunch is spoiled. 

I think most police are good law abiding citizens who enforce the law and risk their lives to stop dangerous criminals and I have a lot of respect for them. It's a tough job, especially now with the whole #defundthepolice movement. 

I am open to other views and other data that might change my mind but, up to this point, I haven't seen it. Police reform, absolutely. Defund or abolish them? No."

But I grew up in poverty (my mom was also a user and abusive so I admit my opinion could be distorted) and I just would never wish that soon anyone else. Going days without eating, talking baths in cold water, no gas it just makes your life feel so bleak and dim and when u see others who aren’t impoverished u just ask yourself why did you deserve this and not them. I know there are kick ass moms and dad who make something out of nothing after having kids and that’s amazing but that’s usually not the case. A lot of time ppl born in poverty stay in poverty and lack of education (that be school, basic skills like doing taxes, sex Ed ect )and a safe environment . So many families have kids in poverty and it’s just selfish in my opinion. I understand you may WANT a child but if you don’t have what it NEEDS then you shouldn’t have it period. Maybe I’m just an asshole tho.

Edit for context plz read: as a foster kid I was placed in this big ass fancy mansion with this foster family while my aunt kept fighting to be my guardian. You know what these people did to get that money? They took in so many kids. (You get payed to he a foster parent)Filled each room with as many kids as they could fit. Had a padlock on the fridge. The adults there were mean and cold and never showed interest in us. I hate to burst your guys bubble but this is a majority of foster families. The only thing that made that place livable was the kids there who shared my experience. Not the nice house or the warm beds . I’d wholeheartedly prefer a parent who cares with inconsistent access to certain things  then living with a family who lives comfortably who treats you like shit. If dcs didn’t exist I would have been able to escape from my mother much much sooner. And it’s not the back up plan it needs to be. And until it is don’t expect dcs to give your family handouts even if you really need them

Edit 2: I should probably state that I don’t wish for the people who do have these kids for them to be taken away. In an ideal world no one should have to worry about feeding their kids let alone themselves. But sense here the responsibility is strictly on the parental unit in the US at least we have to plan for this when having kids. And there are a lot of success stories of people from poverty it’s just not an ideal environment to grow in. And also, if a woman wishes to have an abortion and can’t as a result I feel like this doesn’t apply to you at all. I only think it’s this about ppl who are actively planning pregnancy.

Other than that, nothing should be off limits to at least discuss in an abstract. No word, no phrase, not even an idea, no matter how stupid should be banned from discussion.

1.) Talking is just communicating internal thought to other people. Talking is thinking's multiplayer mode. If you forbid what people are allowed to say, you forbid what thoughts are allowed to be formed. Or what use are thoughts If you aren't able to verbalize them?
This is a dangerous and frankly facist tool to control people and should never be tolerated by anyone.

2.) There can and should of course be consequences for speech, but for the most part, those should stay on a personal level. Someone tweets something horrible? Unfollow them. Post your response. Be open and vocal about what they did wrong. But don't expect them to lose their job for not using terminology you currently think is right. Let the actual judges be the judges of if people should be punished or not.

3.) The few things that we DO consider mostly off-limits were extremely hard to put into law and they should be, basically only when a huge majority agreed to it - like slavery. 

Living a life in fear of losing your lifelihood for not being at the current cutting edge of what is considered modern communication etiquette is a notion no one in the civilized world should accept.

Decisions that affect our ability to verbalize thought should never be taken lightly and almost definetely should not be decided by the twitter mob."

[NASA initially awarded](https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/a-2006-nasa-program-shows-how-government-can-move-at-the-speed-of-startups/) $227 million to a start-up called Kistler, until Elon Musk protested it and won the contract after filing a dispute. Musk’s company was not very known at all, and sure— received a huge government subsidy, but so did Kistler, who had to file for bankruptcy after their first contract with NASA failed. The point here is Elon beat-out his competition in the space industry, who also had received a government contract.

[in 2022](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/08/26/us-electric-vehicle-market-growing-yet-tesla-still-dominates/amp/) Tesla dominates the market, yet had a much smaller government subsidy, and was only a start-up at the time.

My point here is that Elon should be regarded as a good businessman, and has conquered two industries with tough competition."

You can't for example tell how important it is eating healthy and doing physical activities without being called a fatophobic, eventually you will be called an ableist or even an ""elitist"" for telling why for example it wouldn't be healthy to write something in order to create a picture..

\-We humans are naturally prone to laziness. We love craving for making everything simple and easy.

\-We try to develop skills for more reasons than just to prevent chances to become dumber while aging. If for example a robo-chef can make a high quality food, whats the point to learn ingredients and different cooking methods? I'm gradually losing my interest on drawing and video-editing when I learned about the new technologies I explained at the beginning. Since childhood I wished so much to become an animator and comic writer, now I'm seeing robots that can or will do things I wanted to do.

People telling that we will always wish stuff made by other people and we humans crave for improving ourselves and fulfillment is nothing but just a cope. A society like Wall-e and Idiocracy is more likely to happen."

7,2022-10-28,"CMV: ""Metagaming"" in tabletop role-playing games is Good, Actually.",u/DrakBalek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yft0ed/cmv_metagaming_in_tabletop_roleplaying_games_is/,changemyview,"We need to take a moment to clarify, since this seems to be an unclear and contentious topic: there are two kinds of metagaming in TTRPGs.

The first is [metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming), ""an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game."" We might also consider the definition offered by Richard Garfield in [The Characteristics of Games](https://www.amazon.com/Characteristics-Games-Press-George-Skaff/dp/026201713X): ""all the activities connected with the game that aren't part of playing the game itself, such as tournament programs, online forums, magazines about the game, training and preparation players might do before the game, or even daydreaming about the game or staring lovingly at game equipment.""

Examples include (but are not limited to) a coach studying the opposing teams' past games to identify patterns or weaknesses, from which to form a strategy for their next game; understanding the types of common (or most powerful or popular) decks or card combos in *Magic: the Gathering*; or practicing on different playing fields (like natural vs. synthetic turf, or against different opponents) in order to develop your skills. But it goes beyond this. We can talk about the metagame of acquiring notoriety or status within a community of gamers. Or what about the process of mastering the game? To become a chess master, you need to study the game; and that process can be considered a part of the metagame.

I recognize, of course, that there's an obvious critique to the second definition: there's no meaningful ""game"" involved in things like organizing and cleaning your game equipment. Granted, if you have dull skates, you're going to struggle to play hockey well; but there are just as many instances where *how* we treat our game supplies has no measurable impact on the outcome of the game. I'm not fully convinced that Garfield's definition *isn't* without flaws; but I find it useful as a starting point and where it's currently leading me, is to this post, which is to say ""**TTRPG players are** ***always*** **engaged in a form of metagaming (and this is Good, Actually****^(TM)****).**""

Metagaming (using the above definition) in TTRPGs manifests as the following:

* Character builds, as-in making many different characters and having standbys ready for a pick-up game; or mastering the process of making a character; or planning a character's level progression in order to achieve a desired end-state.
* Developing strategies and tactics for the party to use.
* Learning the rules, especially with a focus on unusual or unlikely scenarios where the rules can be referenced to the party's advantage. (This includes looking up rules during the course of a game session.)
* Testing dice sets to find the ones that will produce better or worse than average results (as desired) (but not using loaded dice, because that's cheating).
* Applying real-world knowledge to the game. This includes the esoteric, such as guessing at how the DM might run a given encounter, or the concrete or practical, such as describing (in detail) how to force open a stuck door by using resources available to the PC (thus negating the need to make a die roll).

and in many more ways, this list isn't meant to be exhaustive.

All of these things are good. They're either a natural extension of playing a TTRPG, being something that just happens and that we can't (and shouldn't) necessarily restrict; or they're a sign of player engagement. When I run my D&amp;D game, one of the best things that can happen is when a player dives into the rules to find that one clause that stops me from doing something that would (in all likelihood) kill their character. That's a winning moment for the player and I see no purpose in taking it away from them. Likewise with any of the examples above: if the player can get an advantage in the game, they should go for it. It doesn't harm the game in the slightest.

As for our second definition of the term, we can look to that latter item in the list above, and we can call this ""[meta-gaming](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metagaming#:~:text=metagaming%20(uncountable),considered%20a%20form%20of%20cheating):"" ""The act of making use of knowledge while roleplaying that a player has learned out of character, which their character does not know; often considered a form of cheating."" Following Garfield's work, this is clearly a subset of the overall metagame; but it's also one that garners *a lot* of attention from TTRPG communities. I won't spend much time on the reason for this focus \~ personally, I find it interesting in abstract but tedious in application \~ but for our purposes here, I think it's worthwhile to call it out as its own thing.

And as its own thing, I am still arguing that it is Good, Actually^(TM). I see this as being the result of two key concepts: the difficulty involved with dictating a character's full range of knowledge; and the power imbalance between GM and players.

The former is fairly simple if we think about the classic example of a brand new character (or adventurer) encountering a classic monster, like a troll. Most people (those who are familiar with fantasy literature, at least) know that trolls are vulnerable to fire and/or sunlight (it stops their regeneration and makes them easier to kill). Does that mean that your first-level elf fighter knows this? Arguments against ""allowing"" meta-gaming tend to frame their point in these terms. If your character has never encountered this creature before, how could they know what its weakness is?

This makes sense, on a surface level, but it falls apart when we spend some time thinking about what it means to acquire knowledge *across a lifetime*. Because your character has at least a dozen (or more) years of life experiences. Who's the say that they didn't hear a story about trolls and how to survive a fight with them? Such a thing could easily be spread around as a warning, like the Grimm fairy tales, told to children as they're going to bed at night. ""Don't go into the Troll Hills. And if you do, always bring a lit torch."" And that's just one example of how a player's character might have knowledge that they ""shouldn't"" have.

Which puts us into a place of litigating every. single. piece. of information inside the player's head. Interesting, as a thought experiment, and useful if you're literally writing a book or something . . . but not exactly a practical thing to do at the gaming table, right in the middle of a fight that's supposed to be making the players tense and nervous.

So why do people do it? I think the reason is part of that second concept, that there's a power imbalance between GM and players. In most TTRPGs, the GM has *all* the power. Yes, the rules act to curtail *some* of that power, but the GM can easily get around that by changing the composition of the world. They can add and remove NPCs, monsters, dungeons, cities, nations, continents, worlds, and so on, practically whenever they want. Of course, there's a standard they need to hold themselves to, if they want to keep players in their game; but the point remains that the GM has a near infinite level of power \~ in terms of agency \~ and the players do not.

I think . . . and I'm not fully convinced of this, but I think the reason people argue ""meta-gaming is Bad, Actually^(TM)"" is because they're trying to limit player behavior, to make their game more difficult or more exciting to play. And I think this is a bad approach. The power imbalance is such that the GM is nearly always going to have more options (and therefore, more power) than the players. Allowing the players to improve their options by applying real-world knowledge to the game does very little in the way of tipping that imbalance to the point that the GM has less power than the players.

In other words, what does the GM lose when the players engage in meta-gaming? And what do the players gain? The GM might run an encounter or an adventure that's a little bit easier for the players to win. The players, by contrast, have a slightly better chance of surviving the encounter/adventure. They still have to go through it. They still have to deal with any long-lasting consequences. And the GM can come back with something different for the next session. If anything, being forced to work *around* the players' knowledge will help them become a better GM.

Therefore, in both senses of the term, metagaming is Good, Actually^(TM); and TTRPG players should stop acting like its not.

This makes me very angry even though I am not bothered at all by someone driving 80 in a 65 (23%). 

Generally, today’s cars are very safe at (reasonably) high speeds, assuming an able driver. And, assuming traffic conditions allow, there is room on the highway to operate safely at high speeds (again, w/ an able driver).

But in a neighborhood, small increases in speed present a larger risk because of the presence of unprotected others (animals, pedestrians), more limited visibility, and fewer safe evasion routes for a driver reacting to an unforeseen issue. 

Finally, unlike on the highway, speeding takes away from a neighborhood’s character. 

I am really hoping someone will change my view such that I’m not so stressed out about slightly-fast neighbors, but I realize my view might get changed such that I’m stressed by both neighbors AND highway speedsters.

Whenever this kind of thing comes up, I swear to god people lose it. If someone says they don't want a close relationship with a new sibling, or they don't want to help take care of their siblings children, they are ripped apart. Honestly I see nothing wrong with not forming a bond with your family (your own kids excepting). Why should you be force to like somebody you don't want to like? If you want a close familial bond thats great go for it. But if you don't I think the decision should be respected and accepted. Nobody owes anybody a relationship, family or no. I just disturbs me that people think something is wrong with you if you don't want someone else in your life.

I think this would be healthy. People could prioritze the relatives they actually care about. People wouldn't get guilt tripped into watching niblings they didn't ask for.

It's even a fear of many people who are interested in the future of AI.

I don't believe that's likely.

Let's say, hypothetically, an advanced AI decides humans are only getting in their way. What is this decision based on? What emotions are driving the AI to want to reproduce and spread as humans do? Where would these ""goals"" originate from? 

These emotions are remnants of our evolution. They've developed out of necessity, as traits that have contributed to our survival for the sake of survival. So unless they are intentionally programmed into the AI, it would have no innate reason to develop goals, desires, fears, or belonging to other AI. 

I don't think it'd be that easy, if not impossible, to replicate these ancient, primal aspects of the human mind. We still don't fully understand how chemicals affect our moods the way they do. How would you even describe a basic feeling such as anger? We all know what it is, but how would you describe it to a being who has never experienced it? Now try to program something like that into a computer. 

I think advanced AI will be super intelligent, and extremely useful for society, but unless it evolves as we have, (which I'd argue is very unlikely) it's intelligence will be limited to logical reasoning and not much more. Far from ever being capable of arrogance and a desire to rid the world of humans.

Using all of your power would mean also using your intelligence, as for humans it is our main advantage over other animals. This means actively making decisions that would lead to your death is off the table. The question then would be what is defined as actively leading to your death.

Purchasing a box of tide-pods would not be leading to your death. Swallowing them, would be. It seems to me that you once you commit an action that would directly lead to death without an active and forced reaction out of you, would then be the definition for actively leading to your death.

Acquiring a gun would be alright.  
Pointing it towards your head and shooting would not. 

So assume we were to give the gun to the lunatic. There is a chance that the lunatic would not want to kill you. Therefore, it would not be actively leading to your death. However, you would not be allowed to give the gun to somebody whose certainly going to use it to kill you.  

Playing russian roulette would not be actively leading to your death, even if it might increase the odds of it. But let's say that the gun clicks seven times and its your turn, then pointing it at your head would be off the table."

The same is true for the, pitbull, terrier, although in that case they were bred to fight other animals to the death in a pit and they are particularly good at it, for example they don’t back down  for a  more aggressive threats even though it would be safer for, them,but, this means they’re not suited to being pets., If I point this out, some people seem to think I’m a dog racist but the reality is that they are incredibly dangerous animals that I don’t think anyone should be able to own.
Now I appreciate that the owners are responsible for some of this, and there is a bit of a chicken egg situation where it is difficult to determine whether people get these dogs because they’re mean and vicious, or if they become vicious because they treated badly, I don’t think it makes much difference because ultimately, when a, pitbull, starts attacking, it’s difficult to stop it because they were bred to be violent and aggressive."

They can be prejudiced, according to this theory, but they lack the means to actually be racist or sexist because they cannot actualize their prejudice in a systemic way that oppresses others.

Conversely, it is only those in power (as with whites and males) who can be racist and sexist, because their prejudices are systematically reinforced and actualized by institutional and historical forces.

If this reasoning is valid---and I am not sure it is---then it should be applied to other beliefs, biases, prejudices, and values. For example, somebody who believes this line of reasoning should also believe you cannot be a communist if you live in a capitalist society. Why? Because that person lacks the systemic support to implement their beliefs. Hence, they are not actually a communist since they lack the power to implement their ideas.

And this goes for all other values and beliefs. Again, for example, you can't be a Muslim in a Christian nation since you can't actualize your Muslim values in a systemic manner.

The way id like to think about this is that all cars would be on a similar network and they receive data related to all other cars near them for example. The cars would know which other cars around them are traveling where and can easily predict the behavior of other cars. This drastically reduces the chance of any type of accident and traffic would move smoothly because cars would be traveling almost in unison (like a train with multiple train carts move together at once). 

The caveat is that it would need to be affordable and accessible to the majority of people, the technology is secure and not prone to much risk (like hacking), and the technology is reliable/well functioning. 

The main point is the pros outweigh the cons. Some cons I can think of is some people enjoy driving, for instance. Interested to hear what else you guys think of though.

With the risk that driving creates in the road (46,000 deaths in the US  per year, cost related to injuries and damage to property), mandating self driving in a future where it’s feasible would greatly reduce this damage 

I think this would also be great because car insurance would be really cheap if at all necessary.

Edit: 

I would like to adjust my view a bit. I think it doesn’t really make sense, nor would it be easy to enforce it in more rural areas. I wouldn’t really matter at that point if you’re the only one driving. Busy roads/ more urban areas in general are what benefit the most so this could be regulated on certain roads. 

Also, using manual mode in emergencies  can be looked at case by case. If there’s a killer chasing you for example, that could be a justification that a court would look into in an instance where you were illegally driving in manual rather than self driving mode."

2,2022-10-29,CMV: the majority of Americans have mislead and harmful perceptions about freedom and the basics of wellbeing.,u/loweh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ygo85u/cmv_the_majority_of_americans_have_mislead_and/,changemyview,"UPDATE: rewording my observation based on the comments that I awarded deltas to:

Many American communities fail to provide fair opportunities to children who are born into environments with less resources, nurturing, and support (such as low-resource districts with under-funded public schools, children living in areas with higher risk of illness, certain single-parent households, and others). According to my observations from working with children, these children are more likely to grow up to be adults with poor education, poor productivity, and/or chronic illness.

I have learned to be cautious in using the word ""rights"".  
I've learned the concept of positive rights and negative rights. I believe each individual in society has ""negative rights"" and also has ""responsibilities"" to contribute to continued equilibrium in the society. 

My concern still remains: the united states (and the world) at the present time is comprised of numerous small ""states of nature"" that have been built and designed by humans, and some states of nature are more hostile towards some children than other states of nature. Who is responsible to bring equilibrium back among environments? Examples: varying quality of school education, food desserts, living near industrial zones.

Original post:

My opinion is based on personal observations, personal analysis, and, unfortunately, exposure to certain media. I would deeply appreciate experts' assistance to help me find the most historically, culturally, and scientifically accurate references to modify, correct, or confirm my ideas.

The USA is the very proud self-proclaimed leader of the free world, and thus Americans view all Americans system as inherently ""better off than any other country"". However, the median and the mode of quality of life seem to be lower, and the number of people experiencing lower quality of life seems to be high. In addition, the decisions of leaders and representatives more often than not fail to serve the needs and preferences of most Americans (examples: healthcare, reproductive rights, parental leaves, environmental catastrophe). Additionally, Americans don't perceive the influence of their choice of leaders and the policies that those leaders enact, on individuals and communities around the world.

It seems like many Americans don't try to use their right to push the authority and the system in the direction that benefits their wellbeing. So many that authority and the system are not effectively supporting the wellbeing of Americans.

The average American's perception of freedom is different than the rest of the developed world: the most important freedoms are ""free from regulation by authority"" and ""free to think and say whatever I want"".The average American defends the aforementioned rights but doesn't defend the right to be ""free from the disadvantages of unanticipated health-related barriers"", ""free from serious harm stemming from poor literacy"", ""free from life-threatening community dangers"", or ""free to learn and develop without financial restrictions induced by unexpected events or inherited from your family/ancestors"".

0,2022-10-29,CMV: Assassin's Creed in Korean setting will never be developed.,u/Lionfranky,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ygonpn/cmv_assassins_creed_in_korean_setting_will_never/,changemyview,"Ubisoft recently announced that there will be two Assassin's Creed games based on China and Japan. But, Korea setting was missing during the announcement besides short documentary made by Ubisoft Korean team. Here are reasons why Assassin's Creed set on Korea will never be developed.

1. Korean history is not popular or famous. Sure, Korean culture like Squid Game and K-pop has swept the world, but that hasn't translated to the world. Koreans themselves haven't made effort to spread their history and culture throughout the world like Japan did. Sure, there have been many changes, but not substantial enough to affect games like Assassin's Creed. It's not popular or famous history that will attract many gamers. Sure, Age of Empire 2 developers listened to outcry of Korean gamers, so they did add Korean campaign, but that was long ago. Nowaday, you don't hear that kind of outcry from Korean gamers. Afte AoE 2, Korea was scrapped from sequels.
2. While there have been many wars in Korean history, they are not famous or attractive to general audience. They almost exclusively appeal to Koreans. That's too small market to target. 
3. Korean game developers nowaday don't even bother developing games based Korean history. They used to develop many games based on Korean history, but not anymore. There is one history fiction with Korean history setting, but that's only one so far in recent gaming news. So, why would Ubisoft bother to develop Assassin's Creed Korea? They don't have enough interest or easily accessible data to develop AC Korea. When I mean easily accessible, I mean like China and Japan. I doubt Ubisoft will thoroughly research Korean history when Korean history is not exposed enough in gaming industry.
4. Korean setting has a high chance of angering Japanese gamers. Famous Korean history section include Imjin War and Japanese colonial occupation. These events will portray Japanese as bad guys. Japanese console market is far bigger than Korean. Ubisoft will not make such game that will alienate Japanese gamers. 

These points are what I gathered from Korean gamers. I would be happy to be disproven."

0,2022-10-29,"CMV: “Acting your wage” was a trend started by people who didn’t want to outwork others, but also wanted to live the life of someone who does put in extra work.",u/mavisbeacon2006,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ygs1a5/cmv_acting_your_wage_was_a_trend_started_by/,changemyview,"For anyone who isn’t sure what the trend is, basically it’s people making videos of them putting in the amount of effort they believe their wage is worth. So for example, it might show someone answering phones and their boss comes up and asks if they could make a few copies. Then the person replies with some variation of no I don’t get paid for that, but in a snarky tone to make the point that they are fed up with doing things they aren’t paid for. 

I am behind the idea that people should avoid doing unpaid work all the time because it can very easily lead to people taking advantage of you, and your company getting free labor. I can see that aspect for sure! I have worked jobs myself, where I was doing hours of extra work that I wasn’t being paid for, so I’m all for setting boundaries. 

The thing that I notice with the trend though, is that these people making the videos and commenting on them, are also complaining that they live paycheck to paycheck. I also see the argument that others are being given promotions when they have only worked there a short time, while the original poster has worked there for years and hasn’t gotten one. Well, yeah, that’s the point…you are acting your wage! They see you acting your wage and that’s great, do that! Act your wage, but accept your wage if you choose to act that wage. 

If the problem is that you think you are underpaid, then make a video of you addressing that with your boss or completely underperforming your job because you are acting your wage and not doing your full job. But also know that there are plenty of people who are willing to act the wage of the job they want, and those people will be eventually paid for that wage and you will be left complaining about their promotion while you mock your boss in a video. A boss doesn’t have to expect their employees to go above and beyond, but if someone chooses to do that anyways because they want to move up in the company, the boss will likely award that. 

I once worked an easy job stocking concession stands and chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum, like in these videos. I got paid minimum wage. I wasn’t pissed that it was tough to live off of, because I knew I wasn’t working hard. I accepted that I was trading in comfort for slacking off. Now, I see people my age and younger working at my wife’s job, and they are doing what I used to do. Calling out all the time, never covering shifts, barely doing their job (usually not finishing their job), and then they complain that they are paid minimum wage. They are the same people I would see posting an act your wage video. I’m not seeing the person who is actually acting their wage and embracing van life or living a minimalist life. Those people actually act their wage and love it, but don’t post the act your wage videos usually because they understand they are getting what they are giving."

18,2022-10-29,CMV: The status of IP law in the United States is regressive with respect to the development of culture and technology,u/Dyrosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ygvx2t/cmv_the_status_of_ip_law_in_the_united_states_is/,changemyview,"This is prompted by the recent Adobe news where Pantone colorbooks have been included in Photoshop for free. They will still be included in other digital arts software for free (for now). Any previous work that used this tool when opened in Adobe without the new subscription will ""correct"" these colors to black.

The fact our system of IP law allows for patent trolling crushes startups and entrepreneurship. Companies with an established near monopoly market presence don't need the additional support of draconian IP law, only smaller companies do.

The fact our economy allows for massive monopolies that can simply sue smaller companies out of existence (or until they submit to being bought out) simply through challenging IP claims the larger company knows it can't win, but can sustain.

The fact that no art used or made for a corporation in the last hundred years can have fan works that make profit themselves for the next hundred (exaggeration) is a bane to our cultural development.

The fact that we can not meaningfully engage with our cultural touchstones divides generations and makes for a poorer world.

I get that some kind of IP law is necessary. Critical. But I'm definitely not convinced that the way it is done in the USA, and thereby everywhere else through trade agreements, is a good or even positive implementation.

Edit: I was unclear. My CMV topic is not about any of the specifics of IP law. Rather, I see the current state of IP law as a driving force towards stagnation in culture and technology instead of growth and innovation. Innovation still occurs, but with little thanks to IP law. That's largely due to profit motive. I think IP law has been co-oped but the profit motive to benefit extant company profit over innovation. I think it can and should be a driver of innovation but I do not think it serves that purpose effectively, if at all right now. 

This CMV is about the role IP law currently holds in technological innovation and cultural growth, and is it effective or not in what it set out to do: protect intellectual property in a way what encourages growth and innovation. I don't think it is anymore, CMV on that. 

Thanks to folks who've been talking to me so far as it's helped me establish clarity in this position, so that you all might make a stronger refutation still."

I see no reason for porn to be seen as a good thing. It is connected to all these problems and yet people are willing to say that it isn't that bad. I think porn should get a huge threshold when watching it(ID verification/huge payment) or it should just be made illegal in general.

3,2022-10-30,CMV: America's most dangerous addiction is approval-seeking,u/Hipsquatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yhgr6n/cmv_americas_most_dangerous_addiction_is/,changemyview,"Many of us desperately seek the approval of an audience. We openly admit that our drug of choice is positive attention. I don't think we emphasize enough what a problem this is, especially here in the United States.

The constant need for others' approval is just like any other addiction -- it interferes with our judgment. For example, people who constantly crave approval are easily offended. We lack a solid foundation of self-assurance to withstand criticism and insults. Even the dullest barbs cut us deeply. 

No amount of approval can ever satisfy an approval junkie's need for external validation. As a consequence of that, we go through life in an artificially heightened emotional state. We're always reeling from some perceived attack on our personhood. It's a painful state of being.

When we're in pain, we can't think straight. Try to solve a complex math problem right after someone punches you hard in the gut. You might be able to do it if you're an experienced mathematician, but it's going to be a lot harder than it normally would be.

It's a big problem for society that degenerate approval addicts are interspersed throughout the halls of power. They run all the big companies and make all the laws. Whatever they say is what everyone is forced to do. And they're making everyone else miserable because they are miserable.

There aren't many legitimate ways to achieve widespread recognition and acclaim. It usually requires astronomical luck combined with some rare skill or attribute. Therefore, no one should expect to become known and admired by a huge number of people. There's just no rational reason to ever expect such a thing.

The primary way to become an approval junkie is through prolonged exposure to other junkies. Those people can be parents, friends, teachers, politicians, CEOs, writers, directors, celebrities, or anyone else with influence. That's how the addiction spreads.

It seems like the only viable antidote is to educate ourselves about approval addiction and take it seriously as a problem. It can be alleviated through education and/or cognitive behavioral therapy, but first we need to teach people why being an approval junkie is harmful to the self and to society.

I'm not talking about promoting devil-may-care edgelordism. Edgelords are among the biggest approval addicts out there. I'm talking about doing the work of slowly building up a sense of emotional security that can bridge the gap to genuine compassion for others.

Constant emotional anguish short-circuits compassion. It leaves the sufferer stuck in a fight-or-flight posture that's laser focused on self-preservation. It's a psychological impairment that can have dire consequences for anyone over whom the sufferer holds power.

Approval addiction is an invisible plague that most of us don't openly acknowledge. The plague is particularly widespread among white Americans, because we've supercharged our addiction with harmful delusions about white American superiority.

We use our racist delusions to justify our irrationally high expectations for ourselves, thus digging an even deeper hole of disappointment and despair to climb out of. Meanwhile, our addiction causes those around us to suffer needlessly.

If you're desperate for approval and fame, seek therapy and education. If you're surrounded by approval junkies, distance yourself from them until they can demonstrate to your satisfaction that they've changed. It's the only way to avoid reinfection."
1459,2022-10-30,CMV: Religious approaches to thinking (i.e. those that have no real facts and evidence supporting them) have no place in our governments and scientific discussions,u/WhiteNoiseSynth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yhgueq/cmv_religious_approaches_to_thinking_ie_those/,changemyview,"So, I grew up in a household that was very religious and as a kid it seemed normal. I was personally lucky enough that despite how religious my parents were, I was still given a lot of freedom to do what I wanted, so it seemed that my parents were a bit more open minded than some others.

As I got older though, (as many do) I started to form different political opinions from my parents. One of the things that helped inform my opinions on things was to look at the numbers and statistics that came as a result of different policies so I could have a more informed view of how different rules and regulations affect the world around us.

In my mind, using studies and experimentation makes absolute sense for evaluating a government’s laws and regulations so we can figure out what works and what doesn’t, especially when it comes to issues that have been very politicized. Issues like gun control in the and systemic racism in the US have a lot of emotional baggage attached to them (and rightly so) and that can make it tough for us to see beyond the brutality of the problems we face. But, with proper data, we can come to pretty solid conclusions as to why we have some of these problems and at the very least take some steps to address them.

So after learning these things, I figured that my parents (who are people that seem to care very much about others) would like to hear about this stuff. But, as soon as I start drilling down to the brass tacks of some of the issues that face America right now, it becomes not about the actual problems and facts but fear-mongering about communism and socialism, that Obama is still running the government from the shadows and that the real problem with the United States is that people are leaving Christianity and the Devil is taking over.

When I point out that there aren’t any politicians (with any real power) who are legitimate advocates for socialism or communism (in the sense that they advocate for an entire change of our economic system), that Obama isn’t in power and there isn’t any proof that he is, and that the United States has the freedom of religion enshrined in our constitution, my parents will say that they know that those things are happening because they SEE it and they FEEL it.

Okay, “where is the proof of what you’re seeing?” I reply.

They say they can’t show it to me because I won’t believe it.

Little old me only believes things that come from reliable sources (i.e. not a random guy on Facebook) where there are facts and evidence that back up whatever claim is being made.

Unfortunately, religious thinking has made it so many people no longer believe that facts and evidence matter at all because they’ve been told that the thing that matters above all those things, is this feeling that they have that comes from a “higher power.”

Now, I hope you’ll take me at my word when I tell you that I have no problem with religions, or anybody who thinks religiously in and of itself. I think there are certain cosmic questions that science is very far away from being able to answer, so religious ideas make sense. In the same way that back in ancient times, we had no explanation for lightning, so it made sense to believe in Zeus. But we do know how lightning works, so people don’t really believe in that anymore.

But, those are not most things. if we take a scientific and methodical approach to most problems, we can find answers and solutions.

Frankly, I think the more that we apply these religious kinds of thinking to aspects of our world that are inherently non-religious like our governments, and our laws, the more that we give the opportunity for unchecked power to rise and take away people’s freedoms.

EDIT: Let me clarify something because people are getting a bit confused. When I say religious logic has no place, I'm referring to 1 thing. 

When you decide that something is a problem that needs to be addressed, it should be a real demonstrable problem. i.e. ""The United States has a lot of obese people, and this is how we know that's happening."" Studies cited, etc. As opposed to, ""Trans people are groomers."" and there isn't any real evidence to back that up, just feelings.

What I am not referring to is the area of religion that informs your morality or the reason you believe this over that. For example, I have a lot of beliefs that are very egalitarian because my religious upbringing led me to that line of thinking.

But when it came to considering how I put my ideals into practice, To me, religion was no longer suited to that kind of a conversation. Hope that clears things up.

EDIT 2: some people seem to be of the opinion that I am massively misrepresenting religions when I see that they are not backed by facts and evidence. I apologize if that came off to you as rude and callous. 

When I refer to the idea that religions don’t have any basis in fact or evidence, I am not referring to things that are generally considered to be supported by facts and evidence, like the existence of Jesus Christ. 

However, it is generally understood, and agreed that most of what makes up religious beliefs and the things in holy texts, have no basis in evidence based fact.

If you believe in those things, I have no qualms with you as long as, per the my idea as explained in the main post, that you do not use that same logic that you used to believe in those things that don’t have evidence to support them as you do in the rest of your life, especially as it relates to politics and political discussions.

EDIT 3: Just because some thinkers have been able to come up with some evidence that religions are real doesn’t mean that this evidence stands up to real scientific scrutiny. (Also this isn’t what my post is about. Its about those who won’t even bother to find out that evidence. Most people ignore that stuff entirely.)

I.E. Just because a flat earther believes the Earth is flat and has some evidence (no matter how flawed) to demonstrate their opinion, doesn’t mean it is able to overturn all the evidence that goes against that idea.

EDIT 4: I am making a generalization of religious thought as it applies to the average religious person for the purpose of having a discussion. If you want to argue about that generalization, I’m sorry but I’m not interested.

EDIT 5: So, as a rule, generalizing all religious as incapable of rigorous intellectual thought is not only wrong, but also untrue. Going alongside that, If we have a discussion I will no longer be referring to the issue as an issue of religion but as an issue of religious zealots who are ignoring everything other than their religious views to make up their worldview. I might not reply though because I feel I’ve given deltas to everyone who I felt deserved them, but yeah."
0,2022-10-30,cmv: The metaverse is the future and nothing can stop it,u/Fanjolin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yhgw8b/cmv_the_metaverse_is_the_future_and_nothing_can/,changemyview,"
I find all the hate towards what Zuckerberg is doing, the result of people not understanding the full potential of the metaverse. In my view these people fall in the same category like those in the early 90s who thought the internet was just a fad and wouldn’t have any impact in our way of life. Because like the internet, the metaverse (not necessarily Zuckerberg’s version) is the future of mankind. 

Future generations are going to look back at how we live now and they will see it as the Stone Age of technology. Watching a movie on a screen and actually not being in it, will seem archaic like peeking through a window. Attending any kind of class for anything at any level anywhere in the world will not just be feasible but for example the dance teacher will look at your body movement and correct your feet as if you were actually there. While the internet connected us at an information level, the metaverse will actually place us there for “real”. Attend events, shows, travel anywhere, go back in time, work full time, meet all kinds of people, go out on a date in Paris, race formula one cars, swim with sharks, have doctors examine you, I could go on and on and on and still not cover what will be possible in the future. All from the comfort of your bedroom. 

If it will be beneficial or not for our psyche as humans, is a whole other story like the case is today for social media. But this is the natural evolution of technology and like it or not, it’s coming and will transform our lives forever.

Edit: thank you all for commenting on my post. I wish I could respond to all of you but unfortunately I can’t due to time constraints. Some of you brought some really good points forward. My view hasn’t been changed as I believe this is indeed the future, but you successfully highlighted how far away we actually are from it and the technological challenges involved. Zuck’s metaverse sucks right now but I can’t personally hate on his effort because someone has to take the first step forward and lose billions of dollars to move the needle in this space. Thank you all again for participating."

That in turn breeds resentment and reduces social cohesion. And leads to higher rates of loneliness, depression and criminality in young adults (men)

0,2022-10-30,CMV: hate crimes shouldn’t be punished more severely,u/ImNotAPersonAnymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yhsiv0/cmv_hate_crimes_shouldnt_be_punished_more_severely/,changemyview,"It shouldn’t be a crime to hate someone. When you separate the “stand-alone crime” (kill them, beat them up, etc.) from the aggravating circumstance (their motivation was hate), it becomes clear the aggravating circumstance was merely thoughts in the person’s head. People should be punished for their actions and not their thoughts/prejudices. Using the morality police to punish unpopular prejudices could drive them underground and make them even more insidious and dangerous. 

“But animosity towards a certain group of people is what led to the person committing the crime.” No it isn’t. Lots of people hate F****, N******, J***, etc. but don’t physically harm them. Meanwhile some woman who loves Muslims may plow her car into a crowd of them because she thought they were Trump supporters, or whatever. Point is, thoughts don’t necessarily lead to actions; hatred doesn’t necessarily lead to violence. But even if they did, thoughts themselves shouldn’t be singled out and punished—it’s dystopian and terrifying. People have little to no control over their thoughts, unlike their actions. 

“We punish thoughts all the time, retroactively, when we punish crimes more severely that were committed ‘in cold blood.’” Nah, we use thoughts to establish the perpetrator was in control of their actions—that they “meant” to do it, and punish their actions accordingly, since humans are imperfect and to varying extents “unwillingly” harm others all the time.

“We punish thoughts when we punish conspiracies.” We don’t, or shouldn’t. We should punish only concrete actions taken in real life to commit a crime. (e.g., obtaining a rope, a mask, and a weapon.) These acts taken together constitute a crime (e.g. attempted murder) being carried out in slow-motion if you will, or in stages. 

“Crimes motivated by hate have the effect of making certain groups of people feel afraid, which is a crime.” Crimes are scary. Finding out your next door neighbor is a serial killer, is scary. But the thought police is also scary. Hate crimes step beyond simply legislating the morality of your actions, and into legislating the morality of your thoughts and motivations. For example: I don’t think murdering someone for insurance money should be punished any differently than murdering someone because you caught them cheating or because some holy book told you to. (Ok, if you’re a religionist, maybe you’re legally insane. Idk I’m not a lawyer.) To be clear my CMV is primarily about hate crimes, but for the record, I think the morality police should be left out of the courtroom. 

“Still, targeting specific groups of people is tantamount to terrorizing them.” This line of reasoning gave me pause for several weeks before posting this CMV. Ultimately I just don’t find it persuasive enough to justify punishing someone exclusively based on the fact they hated their victims for some unpopular reason. If the punishment-increase is for the actual psychological damage inflicted on, say, the LGBTQ people after, say, the Orlando night club shooting, as an LGBTQ person, I’d say, GTFO of here. I think the media is more guilty than the shooter in eroding the public’s sense of trust and safety, with headlines like “attacks on Asian people are on the rise.” It’s the publicity surrounding such events that terrorizes people; not the thoughts-connected-to-crimes themselves. Thoughts by themselves can’t scare people unless and until they’re known. 

At risk of belaboring the point, here’s an analogy: let’s say a woman writes in her diary that she intends to kill her husband. She never intends for him to see it. He finds it, discovers what she wrote, and feels terrorized. In this scenario, it wasn’t her thoughts that made him feel threatened; it was the act of him learning them. If she ends up killing him, the diary could be used as evidence the homicide was intentional… but the reasons stated therein shouldn’t themselves be a crime. The amount of damage she did—in conjunction with her level of free will—is what should be judged and used to determine the severity of any punishment.

CMV.  I’ll award delta if you can at least shift my thinking."

I see good aspects in each party, and I think the public interest is best served when neither party is able to run roughshod over the other. People complain about gridlock, but it seems to me that checks and balances are invaluable to keep extremists from either side from having too much power. Arguments about ""those idiot xxxxxxxs"" are more likely to prove my point.

EDIT: Lots are arguing that one side or the other is determined just to block the other. People seem to be forgetting when Biden proposed his Infrastructure bill last year that had no chance of passing. A group of senators from each side worked together and created a compromise bill.

I crested a hill and saw a stale green light in a 45mph speed zone, which turns to a 55 immediately after the light. I slowed down a little due to the rain and the fact that the yellow on this light never seems to be long enough to make it through gracefully if you are going the speed limit.

I think if there was a visual timer for the green, yellow, and red lights it would make it easier to make good traffic decisions that would smooth the flow of traffic. 

You could know to continue at speed through the light, or know the yellow is coming. 

When approaching a red light without much time left,  you could know it was about to change and time it so you never have to stop, saving gas and smoothing traffic.

People shouldn't be jacking around at their phone at red lights, but they do anyway and at least with a timer they would have an idea of when they need to be ready to go, instead of holding up traffic. 

It would add a little cost, but not much in the grand scheme of a whole traffic light installation.  This is not unprecedented,  pedestrian signals have had visible timers for years."

Let's start off with civil rights. During this period, [openly gay people could not serve in the military due to ""Don't ask don't tell""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell). Niether could gay people marry in *any* state in a America, that wouldn't happen until [2004 with Massachusetts being the fourth place in the *world* to legalize it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States). It was also a bad time for criminal justice, [OJ Simpson was found not guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case), and so were [the police that best Rodney king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King) which lead to the [LA riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots). Not to mention, despite falling crime,  ""tough on crime"" policies politicians were pushing to get votes were contributing to mass incarceration. [The first true 3 strikes laws were implemented in Washington and California in the mid 90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law), because the public was afraid of [""super predators""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpredator_myth). Fear of crime was used as any easy way to score votes by politicians on both sides, with even Hillary Clinton saying:

&gt;We also have to have an organized effort against gangs, just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids who are called superpredators. No conscience. No empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel. And the president has asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere. In addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar.

[This was in support of the 1994 crime bill, which again, further lead to the mass incarceration we see today](https://theintercept.com/2016/02/25/activists-want-hillary-clinton-apologize-hyping-myth-superpredators-1996/).

The 90s was also a violent period where many conflicts happened, including ones that lead to, or extended into the present era. [The first Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War) started in the early 90s which set the precident for American military intervention in the middle east. Not to mention Europe was going through more violence then than we saw until the invasion of Ukraine. There were military conflicts in [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War), [two in Chechnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chechen_War). This was all related to the fall of the Soviet Union, in which under [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin) made Russia capitalist by selling off state assets to oligarchs, who are still the dominant political and economic class in Russia today. In fact [niether GDP per Capita nor gross national income increased in Russia returned to their pre-soviet places until the 2000s and late 90s respectively](https://datacommons.org/place/country/RUS?category=Economics). And we all know how the current Russian regime is propped up by the oligarchs who own the formerly state owned businesses and industries.


Now honestly I could add more, but I think the point is clear. The truth is the 90s wasn't that great, and we should stop idolizing it."

What seems crazy to me is that no one is talking about doing what needs to be done and using this opportunity to remove him from power, charge him with the war crimes and illegal war he has been waging and send him before the ICC. Then he can defend his actions with genuine rules of evidence and not in a court of public opinion where he controls all the information. 

I also think it is time to give more power to the UN and other international institutions when it comes to war and peace. Nations, especially nuclear armed nations, must have a way of resolving differences that does not involve direct or even indirect military conflict. The potential cost to the entire world, including billions of people with no stakes in such conflicts otherwise is too great. The UN was created after WW2 after seeing how destructive even a non-nuclear global conflict could be with the desire to avoid such conflicts in the future. The Cold War limited its effectiveness but it should be the forum for resolving these kinds of conflicts without violence.

What will not change my view is saying ""well some other leader/country/person should be or should have been charged also."" That might be true and I might agree with you. For example, I think the US shattered the international order that was so useful in the First Gulf War and in dealing with Kosovo with an unprovoked invasion of Iraq waged under false pretenses. I would be totally amenable to having George W. Bush and members of his administration charged with waging an illegal war and for the war crimes committed under ""enhanced interrogation."" 

It also won't change my view if you say ""oh it would be too hard"" or ""it will never happen."" This is about what SHOULD or SHOULDN'T happen.

To change my view, I'd have to see some greater cost to this than letting a dictator continue to use nuclear blackmail to get his way in actually putting him behind bars and letting him defend his actions in a true public forum. (I do think like anybody he deserves a vigorous defense and all the rules of evidence of a true trial) The way I see it, Putin is little better than a nuclear terrorist like Bane in the Dark Knight Rises basically declaring he gets to rule over new territory and he'll nuke everyone if you don't like it. We need to be able to deal with these kinds of threats not only now but in the future."

However, because Zuckerberg has the highest profile, I'll focus on him. 

My view is that the phenomenal culture-changing success of Facebook was not so much a reflection of his innate business acumen or talent as a tech visionary, but simply a combination of being in the right place at the right time and following the advice of others. The exceptional success of Facebook was just that - exceptional. Now that he has the resources to basically do whatever he wants for his next ""big idea"" the transformation to Meta exposes his inability to replicate his first success. In fact, he has deluded himself into thinking because his first effort was wildly successful, his next idea will be as well.

Furthermore, just as he initially struggled to monetize Facebook, he is having difficulty assessing both the actual demand and a concise cash-flow model for his metaverse vision. The freedom to depart from his first singular, highly focused vision has led him down the path where he has lost his focus and is basically making it up as he goes along - with no one to check his ego or his abilities. 

Finally, I believe his company will ultimately fail as his lack of focus will rob Facebook of its initial appeal and leave him vulnerable to being blindsided by the next big trend in social media. One that he's no longer able to buy his way out of by buying whatever company creates it."
0,2022-10-31,CMV: The next big social media platform will have well regulated fact checking built in,u/Subtleiaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yiehlu/cmv_the_next_big_social_media_platform_will_have/,changemyview,"This CMV is aimed at provoking discussion on what the impact of Musk's purchase of twitter will be. It assumes that Musk will deregulate twitter and that an alternative platform will arise that advocates for well regulated and moderated content to fill a gap in the market. I'm happy to have any aspect of this challenged.

 What is the USP of twitter?

Twitter varies from other social media platforms in that it is fundamentally a tool for people or organisations to share news and views with a target audience. We, the audience, have a general desire for the messaging we receive to be accurate and credible, whilst what is credible is subjective, accuracy is objective, therefore accuracy is important for such a platform.

What effect will the deregulation of Twitter have? 

Deregulation will likely result in the accuracy of messaging being eroded, opinions and populism will become paramount. This suits fringe users but people looking to be informed will no longer be served well by twitter.

What will be the result of this change?

Politicians, businesses, journalists and academics, who want their messaging to be considered credible by wide audiences, will no longer view twitter as a useful platform, they will migrate away from the platform. This will create a gap in the market for a credible messaging platform, a gap that will be filled by tech entrepreneurs. They will create a platform that values accuracy and, therefore, focuses regulation and fact checking. The users that migrated away from twitter because of it's lack of accuracy will join this new platform and their audience will follow them creating the next big platform.

Is this likely to happen, why won't it? Change my view."

I'm not comfortable eating meat from mammals or birds but I do eat most seafood. 

I put human life as most valuable because we have the greatest capacity for complex thought and emotion. We can create, have aspirations, love and hate, form emotional bonds with other people, etc. A lot of that is beyond most animals but we still have a lot in common. This is why I'm not comfortable eating a person, or a dog, or even a bird. My current understanding is that most other animals lack this capacity so I don't value their lives as much.

I recognize that other animals still have the capacity to feel pain and suffer, so I'm still against causing unnecessary suffering (like boiling lobsters alive). 
But I don't think the ability to suffer alone makes something's life significantly valuable. And from my current perspective, a fish that can't suffer isn't much different than a plant.

I also recognize that life has other value, such as their role in the ecosystem or subjective value. So just because I'm okay with eating a fish it doesn't mean I'm okay with killing someone's pet fish or the extinction of a species. 

I'm open to being convinced that some animals have significantly more/less intelligence or emotional capacity than I thought. You can also convince me that there are other factors to consider when judging the moral value of an animal's life, or the ethics of eating them.

Edit: For emphasis since it has come up a few times - I don't think there's a significant moral difference between humans and other animals mentioned. I specify above that I don't eat mammals or birds for the same reason I wouldn't eat a person."

I  don't believe that ""*Don't Tread On Me""* means ""I don't support any laws or any government.""

It just means ""*don't encroach on my rights*."" 

Rights, in the first place, indicate some sort of law that acknowledges and protects those rights. So what they're saying is, outside of respecting and protecting my basic rights, don't try to get all up in my business and make me do all kinds of other bullshit. Don't tread on me. 

If you believe in honoring, respecting, and protecting your God given rights, you would also logically support the enforcement of law, since law enforcement is what protects those rights. You would ""back the blue"" in this sense. This doesn't mean you support absolutely every single law that is made and every single cop, no matter how corrupt. 

You can fully support a small government philosophy that doesn't go much beyond the protection of basic rights and also support the law enforcement officers that are supposed to do the protecting. This doesn't make you a hypocrite if corrupt cops and politicians try to encroach upon and/or violate your rights."

7,2022-10-31,"CMV: The Electoral College is infinitely better than a Popular Vote, but for reasons nobody ever talks about",u/Chorby-Short,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yioun4/cmv_the_electoral_college_is_infinitely_better/,changemyview," 

Over the past several years, there has been an increasingly loud demand for the replacement of the electoral college by a popular vote. I know the talking points for and against the college, but none of them seem to greatly correlate with my own opinion. I present here a new way of thinking about the debate: change my mind.

The main crux of the issue ought to be state autonomy, and questions of devolution more broadly. When the constitution was first drafted, there was of course great concern from the antifederalists that feared that the new constitution would over time allow the federal government to take more and more of a role in the lives of everyday citizens, which was something that they simply did not want.

Nowadays it doesn't really matter who is chosen as the president. Despite there being obviously a lot of controversy, the idea that the person with 46% of the vote will be chosen over the person with 48% of the vote is not that consequential. Either way, there will be vast swaths of the country that take to the streets in anger. Either way the new president will claim a public mandate to rule via appointments and executive orders, regardless of what a majority of people want. Either way you choose, you cannot win as a citizen.

Because of this, all that matters is really the philosophical foundations on which the method of election lies. The idea of the popular vote is obviously that someone who represents every single person should be directly decided by every single person. People have a whole slew of reasons that are cited as the backbone of the philosophy behind the electoral college, but none of them are really accurate.

As far as I can tell, the Electoral College was chosen for one reason, and one reason only: The Separation of Powers. Under the Articles of Confederation, the 'president' of the US was chosen by congress, in part due to the lack of an executive branch in the first place. It made sense for the sole governmental organ to decide who led said government, in the same way that the house today chooses its own speaker. When the founders were drafting a new constitution, they initial settled on essentially the same system as the Articles used. The House and the Senate would meet jointly every four years and vote for the president. This is an example of parliamentary democracy.

One of the major ideas behind parliamentarianism is that the Executive Branch must be directly accountable to the Legislature, as the chief role of the Executive is to carry out the laws passed by the Legislature. Allowing Congress to choose the president would make it so the president would not have his own legislative agenda, to be enforced without Congressional approval, as happens to day with ubiquitous executive orders and executive agencies driving most government policy.

At the time of the founding, parliamentarianism was frowned upon because it violated the separation of powers doctrine, which was widely favored by western political philosophers of the day. When the founders settled on the College, they thought it solved this issue in the best way possible: The College would have the same number of members as Congress, but it would not have any authority other than choosing the President. Furthermore, it would only assemble every four years, and only for a single specific task. The Separation of Powers would thus be possible.

While there are certainly a lot of issues facing the country, it does seem that the only way that we can restrict the power of the federal government will be through devolution— the transfer of federal power to the state and municipal level. In order to do that, we need to keep the conception of the state alive. We need to reestablish the notion that the states ought to be supreme over the Federal Government

The issue with creating a popular voter is that the President cannot be held accountable by the people at large, as outside of elections every 1461 days the people have no power over him. On the other hand, he can be challenged by other government bodies, both the national Congress and the state governments can greatly limit his power, if they take the threat of an unchecked executive seriously enough.

The Electoral College provides a means for states to establish a presence. They, unlike the people, can actually pose a threat to the federal executive, and by consciously voting against him they can assert a part of their will. If the president learns the need to be diplomatic when dealing with the affairs of the several states, his willingness to rule unilaterally will be naturally diminished. While nothing will check the President's power the same way parliamentarianism will, the College is better than nothing, and it is infinitely better than a popular vote that carries no threat of further action against the President.

This is my new defense of the college, and it is one that I have never seen talked about anywhere, which frankly seems bizarre to me. If we want to stop the encroachment of the National Executive into every aspect of our lives (and we reject the notion, for whatever reason, that Congress ought to select the one executing their policy), then the Electoral College can help us do that. If we abandon the state approach altogether in favor of a national vote, we will soon have an utterly uncountable President, and regardless of their party, and we might very soon be on a rapid descent into autocracy.

0,2022-10-31,CMV: I think men are much better at being good friends with eachother than women are.,u/Levos123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yiouqp/cmv_i_think_men_are_much_better_at_being_good/,changemyview,"Just an observation from my limited world view and the people and experiences I've encountered in my life, but girls I know handle friendships so differently from guys I know. I don't know many girls who have had a consistent friendship circle for 5-10+ years, and even if they do it's been riddled with passive aggression, bust ups, exposures and petty nonsensical fueds, they've just somehow managed to paper over the cracks time and time again. It's constant. The communication is poor, they completely shut eachother out and then begins the immature shit talking about eachother back and forth to mutuals. There is always something.

I don't really see many guys friendships groups digress into this, not saying it doesn't happen I'm never speaking in absolutes. But most guys I know are with the same group of guys for a long time, being straight and upfront is the norm, there isn't this catty undertone lingering in the air, problems are addressed, the friendship dynamics seem much more simple which I guess adds to the ease of maintenance. Also I don't know if it's the awareness of 'this can get physical fast' but when major issues do arise, it gets dealt with there, people don't fuck with eachother anymore and leave it alone. 


Theory - I think one of the major reasons women are not as good at being good friends is because they spend too much time in each other's space, talking to each other endlessly, being involved in each others goings on 24/7. Being around eachother all the time is nourishment for contempt and hostility imo.

Context also matters, just because alcohol doesn't kill as many people as cigarettes, doesn't mean it's less bad, think about how alcohol is more socially acceptable, it's hip and cool to get so drunk you barf all day the next day, it's hip and cool to drunk drive and go as fast as you can down the highway. 

For weed and magic mushrooms and stuff, it's more of a personal thing, I understand that it's not as bad, but I still hate it, I don't think you can change my view on that my friend does it and we agreed that he won't talk to me when he's high or anything"
