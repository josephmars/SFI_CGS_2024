1,2022-09-30,Help with assesment for potential job,u/aby_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xsgmzp/help_with_assesment_for_potential_job/,jobs," I've reached the final stage of the interview process for a associate engineer/first line position where the responsibilities are split between answering calls from clients and fixing bugs on their websites and admin type tasks.

I've been told that the first half of the interview will be an assessment where I'll be placed in a scenario which will test my admin skills. I'll be placed in a scenario which occurs most days in the job related to customer service and based on prioritisation. I've never had any experience with this sort of thing so I'd really appreciate some guidance on what sort of things I can expect to be challenged with. 

Thanks!"

I have been applying since January. Recently, I had a job interview which I did great in after much preparation. It had been a few days after that so I decided to message them thanking them about the opportunity to interview and to let me know if they have further questions for me. They send me a message saying that the position is put on hold. It crushed me inside because I thought this was it. It’s not the company’s fault because it is what it is plus they seemed like very nice people when they interviewed me. I’m just tired of the constant being crushed after much hope. I started applying to more jobs because I have to keep moving forward, but it’s so difficult to stay positive now."

The manager who hired me mentioned that the salary offered would require an approval from their HQ in Europe as it wasnt within the salary band he could approve of by himself and that he’d be going on vacation for a week or two.

After patiently waiting and started to get anxious. I proceeded to call the manager on the 23rd of September, he assured me that they did not hire anyone else for the role  and that the salary/offer letter is still under processing/approval. 

Would I be wrong to follow up the last week of October or first week of November? I understand it may take several people to approve something within a large company, but feel this is taking forever."

I had the final on-site interview on 20/9 for a dream job in a big company. Legit thought I did really good, I want this job so much so I did my best. The Hiring Manager hinted many times that she likes me.  They told me they had to decide between me and another person for the role and that I would have received a feedback by the end of this week.

Well, things went radio-silent till yesterday when I mailed the recruiter asking for an update. She got back to me saying:

 “I confirm the positive outcome of the interview but at this moment we had to suspend the next steps. I believe it’s just a temporary delay, we will get back to you as soon as possible.”

What should I think about it? I really don’t know how to read into this message, if I should keep my  hopes up cause it means they selected me or not."

I've realized I waste a lot of time by filtering out job offers from companies that have offices too far away from me. As someone who prefers to work at the office (rather than remotely), but hates commuting to the other side of the city, office location is for me one of the most important factors when looking for a job.

Booking does it very conveniently when you want to look for a hotel as close to your point of interest as possible, by just letting you to pick a hotel on a map. Do you know any job boards that enables something similar?

I prepared for everything closely like the interview, my resume, and completing all the forms they sent me. However, because I'm an idiot, I never prepared any professional references to list on my employment application, and now I learned that I need 3. They just hired me yesterday, and they asked me to fill out the form as soon as possible. My first appointment date is this upcoming Monday.

I just requested 3 professional references from professors that I have a good relationship with. Already one of them responded, but it's the weekend and I don't think the other 2 would check their email as much. I feel like it would be rude if I just listed them without getting their response first.

Should I be worried that my position will be revoked if I don't get it done by Monday? I don't really have any other references in mind that I know would put a good word in. 

Should I just email my employer saying that I'm still waiting on my references, or does this look unprofessional for not preparing them beforehand (they know I don't have any previous work experience)?"

Although I was definitely  nervous during the interview for some of my answers, the committee complimented my responses several times, as well as the depth of my overall experiences. The district sounds like an absolute dream for me though (even if it would result in a further commute than my current one). The district also informed me they are looking to hire 2 candidates for different school settings (instead of 1, which was originally listed on the online ad). This other district is very familiar with my current district, and mentioned they want someone to start in the next 10 days, but understand that districts like mine require 30 days notice, and is something they have experience working out. They told me they will supposedly let me know, either way, by the end of next week if they will offer me a position, and told me not to ""stress"" this weekend, as they would not call me this weekend with a decision. I have never had an interviewer tell me this during a first-round interview, and don't want to get my hopes up too high either. They did not mention calling references yet either, but they do have that information from my application.

Are these positive interview signs? I did e-mail an interview thank you note after the interview too."

I got an email response from BSN sports that they would like to set up a phone interview. They also asked for my phone number too since I have changed my number since applying. I guess they might have tried to call me on my old number with no success.
I am open to the interview just to see if they have a better offer. Problem is the email address they is one of those where you can't reply back. They neither left a call back number or a working email to be reached at. I don't know if this is a joke or an oversight on their part. What should I do?

I recently interviewed for a internal job as Senior Engineer. I’ve been at this company 10 years.

There are about 4 people I will be working with but not technically their boss. More of a team lead.

This job requires more leadership and I have just started and am very nervous I can do it. I have no knowledge of the product they design but am able to learn. I officially start next week but am already just a wreck feeling like this was a mistake. Additionally I will be hosting a 7 am meeting daily as a Scrum master- another skill I have to learn as well.

It’s given me such anxiety that even on the weekends I’m scared to go start this job.. (likely due to stress over failure) how can I relax myself and become more confident? I will say by design I am a more quieter person in groups but I am detailed orientated and able to multitask well.

Ohk so they told me that they won’t be able to pay overtime which I understand (some businesses are like that) but my schedule was just released and it looks fishy.

They have me scheduled to work 9 or 10 hours mon-thurs, and now they have scheduled me to work 12hour shifts on weekends. Can they do that? In Alberta they say overtime is 44 hours+ but they are scheduling me to work for 60 hours+. 

This seems illegal and even if it isn’t (which is FUCKED) how do I get out of this or talk to my manager about it.

I started a new job a month ago, and I just moved to a whole new area. I found this job because I moved, I'm not exactly settled in quite yet. Anyways, I came into this job as the best person I could ever be, I always come in over prepared and set and ready to do my absolute best. I asked for full time hours or at least close. I got that at first, but then the last 3 weeks I've been working only 3 shifts a week and like 10-15 hrs. Literally nobody can live off that. So I'm sure I'm not a good fit, and they reduced my hours to quit (that's what every employer does, right?) Anyways I've had enough I'm not gonna go about this any longer, I don't even wanna work there anyways, it sucks, all of it.  I never quit so early in my life. I always get through it, but here I can't even force myself anymore. It's a waste of time and energy for me. I'm proudly giving up  There's a million other jobs that actually need me full time so I'm gonna look for them. I would like to quit yesterday but I'm a good person and want to tell my employer and employees I'm not coming back. Tomorrow is my last shift saying if I quit. I'm gonna tell my employer at the end of my shift and thank them for their time. I just have so much anxiety about it though, that I'm not sure what to say to them! I'm shy and don't like to be an issue for others. I gotta think for myself to be a better me but need some encouragement to stand up for myself."

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working at a small, family-owned restaurant near my college campus for a month now and began noticing a string of notable malpractices during my shift. The most notable being that I do not receive tips, which is illegal in my state (TX). I've received only one paystub so far since working here and all of my payments have been through Zelle. During my shifts, my manager has also told me, and specifically only me (upon asking my coworkers) that if I messed up any orders, I would have it deducted from my paycheck or I would have to pay for it myself, which I've also learned isn't allowed. As a result, I've grown rather distrustful of my manager and would like to ensure I am receiving the amount I have worked for.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot afford to quit this job for awhile until I have another one lined up, but for the time being, what information should I be looking for with each requested paystub moving forward?

P.S. The staff here is comprised entirely of students, aside from the family who owns it."

I have done food service, retail, office work, sales, and am currently in management. I am starting to think that I may just be overqualified for everything I’m applying for. 

Being a manager has destroyed my life outside of work. Long hours but still living paycheck to paycheck, bringing work home and stressing about work off the clock. I am just on the verge of a mental breakdown and honestly need a break (but a break where I’m still making money) while I figure out my next steps (I am currently back in school too).

I am applying for the most entry level positions that are quite literally always hiring in my area. I served for 5 years, yet keep getting rejected by serving jobs! I am barely hearing anything back from anyone and am not sure if seeing that I am currently a manager is hindering my ability to get hired at any job that isn’t also a higher up position. I’m not a job hopper, mostly every job I’ve had was over a year with the exception of a 6 month and 9 month temporary position (seasonal retail &amp; student worker positions) that need to be on my resume to explain employment gaps. 

Any thoughts on why I am not getting the time of day from anywhere I’m applying? I thought my experience would always work to my advantage but it seems like it’s been a disadvantage."

I have tried to get us working together as a team and help him focus on what is necessary and after months of him continuing to deliver not much I am done trying. And management don't care, don't give us any support either which sucks.

Due to reasons beyond my control I can't leave for several more months, I am demotivated and annoyed/frustrated all the time which at the start meant that I would do my job quickly then feck around for the rest of the day. Now I don't even bother progressing my work first.

The problem is this is actually making me miserable. I want to go to work and complete things, I want to feel like I am good at my job. I have accepted that no one will notice if I do a great job, no one will notice that the other guy is next to useless. I need to find a way to be able to not care/ignore that he does very little and to deliver work to a good standard just for my happiness and sanity.

I am a bit stuck in a hole and can't seem to kick myself into gear. Has anyone had the same experience? Or know of any good books, podcasts etc that could help me out?

Has anyone gone through a phase of literally not knowing what they want to do or are qualified to do?
I left a high paid job in sales a year ago because it quite literally made me depressed and I’ve been searching for what to do and I really have no idea.
If I can help it I don’t want to return to sales or my previous industry it was so stressful, but apart from GCSE’s I don’t have any degrees or specialist skill sets.
I believe in my old field I could get a job quite easy I’ve had people offer me good money so I must have good qualities but honestly my confidence has been knocked big time because of my old job and also not working for a year.
Has anyone gone through anything similar?
I don’t know if I should try my old field again or do something else but wouldn’t know where to start.

Because of the pandemic, the airline I wanted to work for was on hold in recruitment and I became an operational administrator at a company which I am currently working for almost 3 years and I enjoyed working here, it’s very good environment with drama free.

Beside learning from working close with them, I have many chance to show my work and abilities, can say that it’s a good path for me if I want to continue to claim the company ladder.  Last month, I passed the interview for a flight attendant which also was my favorite airline. Now I have to decide if I should quit my current office job to become a flight attendant or should I stay and claim the company ladder?  I understand that being a flight attendant has its perks but it also has a lot of disadvantages, and since airline just started slowly back to normal after a long time, I wonder if this is too risky to get into the field.  My boss also supports me for whatever decision I make, he is willing to get me what I want if I decide to stay; however, he understands if I decide to leave and follow my dream as well.  I don’t have much experience in flight attendant, is anyone here a flight attendant or used to be a flight attendant can give me some advice and insight for the job. I really appreciate!!"

I make $18.50/hr here, but with inflation and the cost of my company insurance, I'm really struggling to make ends meet.   


I never went to college and my resume is a little spotty, because I tend to leave a job if it bores me or feels impossible, or else I get fired for poor metric performance. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have been treated for these tendencies; but I've also been advised by my therapists and psychs that call center work, which causes me the most chronic unemployment, is not for me. Being queer has also, unfortunately, limited my options (some employers don't bother with onboarding once they realize they'll have to use a different name and pronouns than what my ID would imply).  


So, now I have 14 years of being in the workforce and really nothing to show for it aside from stints in retail and customer service. I can't afford to go back to college for anything, nor do I have the time. I enjoy jobs where I work at my own pace, and I thrive in positions where I am not micromanaged.   


Is there a job field for me? Is there anything I can do? I want to start a family with my partner soon, and less than $2K a month is not cutting it."

As the title suggests, I just got a LinkedIn account for the the first-time. I work at a large, national company and like where I'm at. I don't want to leave the company but of course I do want to move up and even mover laterally to other areas/departments. My question is - what are the Do's and Don't's of LinkedIn? What are the unwritten rules? I don't want to embarrass myself and be ""that guy."" Can I ask to connect with my manager and Director? They're both nice and we have a good personal relationship. Are you supposed to talk to people on there? 

Any advice you can give that could be beneficial for my career, as well as not making a fool out of myself would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

I've emailed the manager letting them know, but I don't think I'll get an email back before Monday.

Obviously the sensible thing to do isn't to go in anyway and infect the office. The government covid advice now is just confusing, and I don't want to be late on my first day if they decide I should still come in. What should I do? Is there anything else I can do?"

They just haven’t stayed competitive. I am genuinely worried about the long term viability of this place and potential layoffs especially as this recession potentially hits.

HOWEVER, I do enjoy the innovation culture and a lot of skills that I’m learning that could bode very well for me for future opportunities. But higher chance of layoff. Recently however, I interviewed with a much more “stable” insurance company. Pay is a little bit better but the technology they use is outdated and the overall data culture seems kind of meh. I do not know if I’ll learn much which could hinder me career wise. But it is definitely stable.

So my big question is, do I stay at the place where I can learn more and sort of roll the dice as it could pay off. Or do I go to the less innovative yet more stable insurance company?"

What is being said isn’t good, that I am a slacker and not putting forward enough effort. To put things in context I work for a small medical device company and handle international accounts and sales. As it’s a small company I have also taken on other duties as my boss fails to hire for roles needed like compliance and go for things like an executive assistant instead. Over the past few weeks one of the other sales people left and I was handling their accounts and another look a month long absence for family and I was handling their accounts too. So all in all I was in charge of all sales for the company and making sure that we were making them as cash flow has been a problem, as it’s a small company. I have been going in at 5am/6am to have meetings with clients, handling all shipments, going above and beyond and hearing that my boss speaking to my coworker as soon as they got back from their month long break really rubbed me the wrong way. The ironic thing is that they are leaving the company and haven’t informed him yet but they told me because they wanted me to know as they thought it was unfair after seeing all the work I did while they were away. I have 3-4 years of lab experience, 2+ years in sales and my Masters of Bioengineering. My main reason for this post is to ask two questions. 

- should I bring it up with my boss or wait as my coworker is leaving and I’ll be the most senior sales person left. 
- I’m applying for new positions but I wanted to know how to bring about moving to a new position after only less than a year. The company has cash flow issues as it’s a small start up and they have to keep taking loans.

I’m not sure I hit everything but like I said it’s sad to hear that my boss is speaking to my coworkers about my work ethic when I really do work extremely hard to make the company successful. I cannot go to HR as we don’t actually have a HR representative and the closet thing to one is very good friends with the boss so I’m not comfortable sharing anything. My immediate manager is also a friend of his. At this point if I say anything it won’t really matter but the company has so many issues that everyone who was at the company when I started at the beginning of the year has left and like I said, I’m currently the longest serving employee at the office. 
Thanks for reading if you got this far and any advice you might offer."

I graduated from nursing school in May 2021, and couldn’t find a job until January/February 2022. I didn’t really like the job, was unfortunately put on one of those “performance plan” things (like I said I wasn’t a huge fan of the job to begin with) so I resigned in April 2022. I got my next job in July/August 2022 (wasn’t exactly nursing per say) and I did get my skills signed off, however, I asked for more practice time which the company said they couldn’t give me (my boss tried her best for me) so I was let go a few days ago. My trainer and boss said I did nothing wrong at all, it was just their policy. They really liked having me around and I miss everyone there so much already. My trainer also said to look into more case management/doctor office jobs, she thinks that’s more up my alley. I would love to work in a doctors office but I only have about 4 months of experience (1.5 months of bedside hospital experience). I tried applying there when I first graduated but I guess no offices wanted new grads 🤥 

I used absolutely 0% of my nursing skills/knowledge at this job so I guess it’s a good thing I got let go."

for 2 years now.  In terms of formal credentials, all I have is my bachelors of science in math.  I learned the skills to do my job both on the job and from self-studying and working on personal projects.  Some people in my industry have a problem with this because theres a huge bias towards formal degrees in electrical engineering and/or computer science.  It was a very rough time getting my first job because at the end of +200 applications, it was maybe less than 10 interviews, 6 which made it to final round and only 2 offers at the end.  

I'm sure its a bit easier now for me to get called back since i have 2 years of experience.  However, its frustrating because I know I work hard, i'm passionate, and i love learning.  I'm also pretty nice and help (good social skills).  The fact that I know what I know despite not having formal degree should be proof that i'm a valuable employee because I often expand my horizons to learn new skills/knowledge.  Even though my coworkers acknowledge me as someone who knows a lot of stuff, still my opportunities are limited at my company because the work I want to do, I'm not trusted to do.

I wish people genuinely told me their thoughts/opinions about this rather than give me their ""PR"" response."

I’m working on a project and am curious about issues people have faced when trying to break into the tech industry.

I myself have faced many different issues throughout my tech career. I've transitioned from product support to account management to solutions engineering and finally software engineering.

To get the disucssion started, here are some issues that I have faced:

1. Not enough relevant work experience
2. Not enough experience in desired technologies
3. Not believing that I was qualified for my desired roles
4. Not knowing that there were other roles I could use to develop skills to then transition into my desired role

Should i stay with my current company and help them reach the next level, or should i leave and pursue my financial goals.

After doing research, countries require work permits (or equivalent). In order to get a work permit, you need a job offer. The thing is the vast majority of companies don’t have the time for you to wait to get a work permit or just want people who can already work in the country. This means that each requirement to get a job requires the other one first. 
How do you go about this? Or have I misinterpreted my research?"

To me my job is all reporting. I don’t do any journal entries. He keeps asking me to do things without showing me. He does show me an example from the previous month and ask me to do it the next month. I’ve asked him to show me stuff, but he asked yet. I’m guessing he’s busy or something. But he’s done it more than once. 
Monday is my third week

So I want to have a conversation with my boss and just be like

Nice version 

Some of the work I have been doing so far is a bit new and different than what I am accustomed to than my previous accounting roles. I am slowly getting the hang of it. If you can provide me with a few more hands on examples I think I should able to figure out a bit faster and become better at it sooner.



Direct option 
Hey I was hired to do accounting that’s not what I’m doing. I like working there and your great manager. The things you’re asking me to do, I haven’t done. So I would like more hands on training before being asked to do something. I learn best by seeing someone do something and then doing it myself. 

The only reason I’m thinking of the direct route is bc he’s done it more than once even when I asked to be shown.

Coming Monday is the start of my third week

Either way I think I’ll wait another week to see how things go 

What’s a better approach?"

Currently, I'm working as a ""barista."" It's in quotations because I'm usually not making drinks, as I'm the only one working there without barista training, and thus the only one who doesn't know how to use the milk frother. I also can't work In the kitchen because I don't speak Spanish. So I'm on the cash register the entire time, and even then I still make mistakes. I am well aware of the fact that I am the weakest player there. The entire time I'm working I'm somewhat crushed by the overwhelming feeling that I'm slowing everyone down. I'm the only teenager at my job and the only one who is a full-time student. I'm the only one that can only work weekends and since they're short-staffed I always feel a bit guilt-tripped whenever I need to take weekend time off to do something. But my life feels like hell. I go to school 5 days a week, and work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I do not get days off. Work is hell. I hate my job. I hate my job so much that I look forward to school and dread the weekends. What kind of teenager dreads the weekends???? My boss asked me to stay an hour later than I was scheduled and I almost started crying on the spot. I got home and I cried buckets, was fine for a few hours, then thought about work, and started crying again. I'm only working so I can save up so I don't have to work while I'm in college, but I'm genuinely filled will soul-crushing despair at the idea that I have to go back again on Friday.

I am in the midst of a mid career switch. I recently graduated from school after a decade of working in corporate. So after graduated I worked for this startup for 2-3 months without pay. It’s not an internship- they’re just use those months to see if you are qualified to work with them before offering an actual salary. However I’ve been doing their marketing work and coming down for meetings.

So last week this startup finally offered me an employment contract and also a high salary starting from October which means they are not paying me since end July- the time when I started doing work for them.

I applied for an apprenticeship with a major company and I managed to get in. So what is making me a little worried is  I haven’t told the startup that I have decided to not take up their permanent job offer due to this opportunity but before I do that, this major company hired another company to do a background check.

Part of me do not really care cos I have already aced the interview and I’ve told the recruiter I’ve worked for this startup and it’s freelance work. But at the same time what if this company who does the background check call the startup and then they say that yes xx is with us but only from October instead of July - October? And there’s no pay stubs cos they’ve not been paying me so I don’t have any documents to show any proof.

Is there anything I should do? Should I just tell the startup the truth- I cannot accept the full time cos I am joining an apprenticeship so at least she’s aware of my plans and perhaps can say the right things when the background check company call her(hr)? Or do I wait till I confirm pass the background check then tell her?

Why am I feeling so nervous when I’ve done nothing wrong?

Any advice would be great. Thank you!"

3. Full time offer is not guaranteed.

Otherwise, the company seems good. Good benefits and pay is okay.

I do have invitations for interviews from other companies
But this being full time, i wouldnt be able to schedule them.

Then again with recesssion coming and whatnot, I fear i might blow a good opportunity.

Since I'm applying to my favorite chocolate store, I was wondering would it be weird to buy chocolates same day of interview or even if i was hired and it was during my probationary/trial period? To be honest, besides loving the chocolates, there's some that i haven't tried and am curious about. This is the direct store and this place is the closest in the area, so there's flavors that you can't find in other stores it is connected to.

Would it just be safer and best to buy elsewhere until I'm hired or not on my interview day? I'm planning not to buy this day but I'm also scared it be weird overall to.


Update:
From comments.. lol i see i am being overboard and that there's nothing weird about buying from job I'm going to interview for or even if it is my work place.
People i knew made it weird so i felt weird or is the weird/unprofessional one. But now i know. Its not lol thanks guys"

I recently applied for a state government job as a forensic scientist that intersects with federal policies. 

They reached out to me a couple weeks ago and had me take a “comparative analysis” test, which was a series of theoretical questions along with demonstrating knowledge of Microsoft excel. 

I got another email a few days ago letting me know that I passed the comparative analysis and that they would be reaching back out to be for the second phase in the second half of October. 

I know that they require a extensive background check, a drug screening, a polygraph test, and what I would imagine to be 2-3 interviews. 

My only concern would be why do they require you to take a polygraph and what would they even ask you? I have a clean record and I would consider myself an honest person, but I am nervous about this just because I have anxiety. 

It is also stated that if you have done any drugs in the last three years, you are automatically disqualified. My question is, how would they even be able to tell if you have done drugs in the last three years, considering most only stay in hair follicles for 90 days? I am worried about this just because I used to semi-frequently smoke weed in college in a state where it is legal. I know that weed is not federally legal, but I also think that would be an insane reason to not hire someone if it’s within a state where it’s legal and if I no longer smoke weed at all. 

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated because this is my dream job! 

Thanks"

I’ve been trained for a highly specialised role over about a month plus given gear and all.

My coworkers are great, the company is great, and the project is noble but the issue is it’s the first week and I fucking hate the job itself and can’t take much more of it.

It’s also casual and the hours are too sporadic for me.

I’m applying for other jobs but if I were to land one and leave at short notice it would fuck things up for them so badly that they would probably need to end the project for a month or so until they can find a replacement. One recently died of cancer and they’re all trying to do their best - they act like I’m a saviour that’s come along but little do they know I’m already planning my escape. 

Should I be feeling bad about this or not? The thought that I could and will beleaguer people I respect doesn’t sit well with me but on the other hand that’s life and I shouldn’t let this hold me back from doing what I think is best for me right?"

A little background, I have always had scoliosis but it has never affected me badly until a week ago, when I started waking up with headaches, back pain, chills, shortness of breath etc. At one shift it was so bad, a supervisor told me I should go home if I didn't feel well. 

The thing is they had already ordered my outfits / badge to wear on the job and I'm already on my second week, I'm worried and is feeling really bad if I do quit.

I work full time at a company that has put me under a lot of pressure, and I got promoted. I also run an online shop. Additionally, On the side, I work at another company a family member used to work at that recommended me for a gig that had me as an independent contractor. This is the job I’m concerned about. 

I never had any issues in the past with them, but these past couple of months this gig has put me under a lot of pressure of asking if I can push through thousands of contacts manually using a new system I had not used before in a series of checks not done prior. Two times now have I said I would have x amount of work done by around x date, and fell through on it. 

My mental health the past couple weeks has really been suffering with this pressure, but also failure. This company will email me at 10pm wanting updates, and it ended up with me too scared to open my email. It would give me panic attacks.

Yesterday I apologized for the delays, but that I will have to give my two weeks and continue as far as I can.  I am too scared to see what they replied. 

This work is very monotonous and their expectations aren’t really feasible, as it’s almost expected that I’m a robot lol. But I am seriously cringing and very angry with myself that I fucked up by giving unrealistic expectations of when I could complete this project. However, it’s confusing, because ultimately the deadlines don’t really matter because this is a continuous project that will essentially need to be maintained forever. They just want me to go as fast as possible. 

My family member said I am giving them a bad look because of my fuck up, even though they’re at another company growing elsewhere. This made me feel really bad and upset because I just became totally burnt out. It got to the point where I would drink a lot due to the stress, and had to start therapy again. I have not discussed this with my family member, but I do believe I may be undiagnosed ADHD which could have impacted this work. 

I just feel very irresponsible and embarrassed. I don’t even know if I can use this company as a reference. How bad is this? There was a point where I was waking up at 7 and not going to bed until 1. I just totally let go once I couldn’t take the pressure anymore."

I know 20% sounds like a lot so let me give context.

**Current salary: $53,000** (received a promotion and raise in Jan 2021, starting salary in 2020 was $43K for Coordinator level)

**Years of experience: 2** **with the current organization** (3 in total with college internships)

**Education: Related bachelor's degree** and certifications my industry likes

Location: Major metropolitan area (5+ million people)

YoY US inflation rate: 8.6% (Aug 2022)

I'm a Marketing Manager at a very old, well-established non-profit for my region's business community. I have worked here for 2 years, this was my first job in marketing but I had two marketing internships while in school, so I have 3 years of experience in total. I report to the SVP of our department.

I did research and the median salary for a ""Marketing Specialist"" with my current experience (1-2 years) in my area is around $73K. In my research, I have found that nonprofits pay $3/hr to $5/hr less than for-profits. Assuming this org is on the higher end of that range, that brings that $73K figure to $63K for an estimated ""non-profit"" median. At my current salary, I am making what only 10% of my peers are.

Our team has seen half of the staff quit to go to better offers in the last 6 months, and those of us that are left have been responsible to pick up the slack. Our department has not put effort into hiring (no job postings yet). We have done a fantastic job at not dropping any crucial functions. I had a previous manager who left in March and she is not being replaced, I have assumed all of her responsibilities.

My role has recently shifted into project management for our organization's new website development (a very big deal, our current one is very dysfunctional). If I wasn't here I have no idea what would happen, there is literally no one else who would have done what I have. I have overseen everything about this website and it launches in a month. I am also the go-to person for marketing analytics and our other websites as no one else in my department has that experience with that now.

My Boss (SVP), his boss (CMO), and his boss (CEO) have all praised my work directly and have said they want to ""invest in my career here"" (I have no idea what that means exactly, but I assume they are looking to give me more money and a bigger title in the coming years).

&amp;#x200B;

Given all of this, **I am asking for a $10,000 raise to $63,000, a 19% raise from my current salary,** but if we are including inflation, my actual *felt* raise would be closer to 10%.

My last salary increase was proposed to me with zero discussion (It was more than what I was expecting and going to request) so this will be the first time I will have ever asked for a raise directly.

**Should I ask for more and leave room for negotiating?** $12K? $15K?

**Is $10,000 too much of a raise to ask for without a promotion?** I am assuming I am not getting another promotion as two consecutive annual promotions would be unorthodox.

Any advice is appreciated!

\- A friend

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

Assumed responsibilities of my old manager, she's not being replaced.

We lost half of our team in the last 6 months (no firings or layoffs).

I've gotten praise from higher-ups on my work performance on things only I can do regarding a very important project for the organization.

I make what only 10% of my peers with the same experience make.

I'm asking for a $10,000 raise which happens to be 19% of my current salary."

We're also an ESOP company, so we have the perks of that as well. We were remote for covid except we all had to come in 1 day a week for, and I'm not kidding when I say this, production visibility. Most of production had expressed they didn't really care as long as they could talk to whomever they needed. I've also been given opportunities at this company I've never had at others. I've held 3 different positions, including my current.

What this meant is that at some point, the entire shipping department got covid, and there were only three ppl in the company trained to handle the department - myself and two people in production.

We did end up coming back to the office, but many of us expressed to our managers and directors to express that our productivity increased at home and were unable to meet those expectations in the office now. We're constantly interrupted and pulled away from our normal duties to meet ""critical"" tasks. (Which everything is considered critical when we're present in the office.) People have been coached on their lack of productivity in office but also praised in the same session for their at home productivity. 

During work from home, I discovered the ugly side of two of my coworkers. I had heard about it, but they had never been directly toxic to me. They purposefully set me up for failure on multiple occasions, and it culminated in one constantly emailing me and being just downright rude. I ended up going to HR about it, and nothing came of it. I pushed and pushed for resolution, but nothing happened. And I mean nothing. They ""coached"" her on it, but we were to have a meeting to resolve it. Nothing. Instead, now she works from home once a week, and I still get demeaning and rude emails. 

I've been burnt-out for awhile now. I've had two losses in my family in less than a year, and it's taken its mental toll on me. I also have other mental health issues that I manage, but this year has been the worst. I do my best to not let it effect my work, and I generally just end up having to ignore my problems until I can speak with my therapist and vent to my fiancé. 

I'm just over it, especially after last year's and this year's raises. Last year we were told market and performance raises would be given out. We only got performance raises. This year we were told performance, market, and inflation based raises would be given out. They have all been late, and inflation wasn't even considered with the raises. I asked for a better raise, which is a first for me at this company. 

I'm mostly just fed-up with this company. Requesting help is generally ignored. Senior employees have preferential treatment, and the rest of us are told that's not true. Interdepartment disagreements are left unresolved and allowed to fester despite either party involved requesting resolution and HR interference. 

At this point, I'm only here for the benefits. I came to this company because I thought I could grow here and have support if needed. Instead, most people just bitch and moan if you inconvenience them. HR is a joke. While I have grown, all I do is copy and paste and deal with backhanded compliments and my coworkers asking if I'm even working (as I'm CCing them or forwarding them information they require). 

I'm just done... Worst part, I can't get an email or call back from an employeer now matter how much I spruce up my resume based on recent studies and recruiter recommendations. 

Not every place will be perfect and people will bump heads, but HR should help with that. Pay should reflect what we're promised. Needs of the employees matter just as much as needs of the company."
7,2022-10-03,27 years old- Don't know what to do with my life...,u/LifeBeater_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xuot5y/27_years_old_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,jobs," 

So as the title says I'm 27 years old and have had no idea what career I want to have. I know some people say this is normal and that everyone at this age is in the same boat, but this causes me a lot of stress.

I'm currently working as a teacher and have had this job title for past couple of years. I have known this is not my passion at all and I feel drained of all energy when I return home afterwards. Any motivation to work on other projects is GONE.

I'm stuck between wanting a more manual labour job(sense of pride I feel after this) and a job that has a higher pay and is intellectually stimulating. Quite a minefield I know.

So currently these are my options that have been rattling around my head:

1. Have an online business. This would more than likely be centered around social anxiety and self improvement in general. I currently have a sizeable following on social media that resonate with my content. There is no set income here also so that's a big upside. This would also satisfy my interest in psychology/biology.
2. Art: Specifically painting and drawing. This was my undying passion 2 years ago and thought that it was definitely my career path. However, I have no passion for it lately and this may have come from my realisation that earning an income as an artist is tough as sh\*t.
3. Firefighter: This is a recent one that has been alluring to me. I am drawn to the heroism of this job.

My brain seems to constantly changing and I'm beginning to wonder if the environment I'm currently in (living back at home in my hometown with my parents after 3 years of living abroad) has been causing a depression for me.

Anybody that could be of any help to me would be great.

Cheers from a guy that is very ambitious and motivated who seems to be losing that with each passing day."

* ""We are growing and therefore have a lot of work to do""
* ""We are like family.""
* ""We hope to hire more people.""

I was just offered a government job that gave the statements above. I was interviewed by six people and they set it to automatically end at 25 minutes so I had to ask the rest of my questions via email but they didn't really answer them directly.

The reason why I am concerned because I had a toxic employer that made the same statements in their interview. They described their work environment as pro-work life balance, **growing** and family-like. I explicitly told the old employer in the interview that I was only willing to work a few hours of overtime because of past burnout. They claimed to not mind and really wanted me to join because of my experience.

By my second week, that old employer changed their mind and said OT is required because they were growing. They demanded everyone to work overtime on nights and weekends. My coworker confirmed to me that they lied about the lack of heavy overtime to get me to join. She also said that they weren't honest about their claims to hire more people to address the workload.

So should I doubt a normal 40 hour work week when the company says that they are growing? Or is it just my trust issues from that previous employer?"

Indirectly work with two people the owner of the company and the director of the company. The director has to train me. but he does not say anything about the work. I sit like a student completely clueless. If I ask something he says that those things are not necessary, so he does not give the answer. He gave me the basic info.  The owner is on the move all the time, he is busy it's difficult to catch him and ask. So I see that things going south. I even don’t hear what is going on with operations inside of the company, because they gave me the office room very far away from where everyone is, and I  start thinking that they did this on purpose. but on other hand, there is no space to be closer. Also, all communication is very strange because the director of the department tells me to do things that have a  negative effect. I think completely opposite that his suggestions.  Sometimes he makes the point with a double meaning to justify his reasoning. I started to think about what was the real cause to hire me if things goes this way. It seems that the director is very anxious maybe he thinks that I came to replace him. Anyway, how can I benefit in  this situation, and how to get the information that I need for work?  Basically, I bump into some obstacle then I figure out what to do or  raise questions, other than that they just hide everything. Also, I  thought maybe they took me temporarily just to see how I do things to be more efficient. Please give me advice on how to go around things when the director is pushing me under the bus. How to handle this situation, I  think there are lots of people who had those situations in their carers

Around the same time, the customer service company I worked at for 2 years went under, and I had 2 months to find a new job. 

Thankfully, after 2 months applying and interviewing, I found a job as an IT Specialist. It's a new office the company opened up in my town early this year, and I'm the only IT Specialist here while the rest of the IT team is at the main headquarters hours away. 

While I love my new job, it's not on my career path, and there's not much room for growth long term. 

The other day, my friend reached out to me to interview at the tech company they work for, they're a recruiter for them. However, the job they want me to interview for is a product support specialist, so not a programming role. But my friend believes I could work my way to a programming role within the company over time. 

I'm wondering, is it possible to move from a non-technical role to a programming role? How long would someone have to work for the company before they could transition over? 

If anyone has some insight, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!"

My boss keeps asking weird questions along the lines of ""are you doing okay?"". I've been getting a crazy amount of work on high priority tasks and it's been borderline impossible to keep up. I really like the job and company, but it's starting to feel really uncomfortable. I also can never tell what my boss is thinking. I asked about my mistake and they responded with a casual ""we'll all learn as we go"" which seemed very blase considering the potential magnitude of the mistake. I don't really know what to do and I can't get a good read on my situation. To make it worse, there was recently a round of layoffs at the company.

I am now applying for other roles. My question is - can my CV say 'my current position / x position' as a job title, or would that be misleading?

Stick around or put in the massive amount of time necessary for starting a job search when I'm not sure WHAT I should actually search for?

Hey Jobs,

I currently work at a Makerspace as the Rapid Fabrication Director. It's a very unique type of job, and one that I thoroughly and whole-heartedly enjoy, but for the amount of time I put in, I do not see a lot of return. Some of my current responsibilities include:

* Curriculum Development
* Teaching (Including aspects of material science, design, engineering, and certain highly specialized softwares)
* Project Management
* Personnel Management
* Fabrication
* Rapid Prototyping
* Some CAD and design work
* Machine Maintenance

and honestly, a bunch more. This is literally a list of things I have on my schedule for today. I am regularly pulling 12 hour shifts and usually put in between 50-55 hours per week (I'm salaried). I've tried to set better boundaries, but it's still hard when everything coming down the pipe is an emergency.

Now, I feel very proud of the work I've accomplished in the past 4 and a half years, basically working my way up from nothing. I had no idea how to do the job that my boss hired me for. I volunteered for small stuff (i.e. giving tours, directing visitors, sometimes taking messages) and when my boss asked me if I knew how to do CNC work, I said no. My boss asked ""Well, can you learn?"" to which I replied ""Yea."" That was the interview. 

However, as of right now, I just don't have the ability to keep pouring into this job the way that I used to. I used to live with family, but that has since become impossible. I DO NOT live extravagantly. My current apartment is tiny (430 sqft), but manageable for a major city. I'm honestly not home enough to care. However, I still find myself struggling month to month.

I've asked for a raise and was told ""not right now"" which I can see the reasoning for. I received a raise and a promotion last year, which was excellent, but still not commensurate with the amount that I'm currently doing. Since then, MANY new responsibilities have been added. Since I know this is gonna come up anyway, I make $42k.

So, long story still kinda long, what's my course of action here? Re-up my request for a raise now that it's been a few months? (I'm past the 1 year mark for this position as of a few days ago) Or, should I start the unbelievably brutal slog through the churning vortex that is the job hunt? What would I EVEN apply for? I know that I can do whatever job is in front of me, but I have to convince a hiring manager of that, and I doubt my past experience would even get me in the door.

Thanks!"

Sorry if it's long, not sure what the most important info is.

After an intense interview process at a large, Bay Area-based tech company, I was called on September 19th and they told me they were moving forward with me as their chosen candidate. The recruiter is the one who told me this news. 2 days later on September 20th, I had a meeting with that same recruiter to go over salary and stock negotiation stuff. That day, the recruiter told me to follow up with them on Monday September 26th to see where we were at on everything.  I touched base on that Monday and they said my offer was ""still being reviewed"" and that they would check in again on Wednesday. Complete silence until I reached out on Friday, September 30th. On that day, the recruiter said something along this lines: ""Thanks for checking in. Your offer is still going through approval. It is moving a bit slower but it is starting to move through the review again this morning.""

&amp;#x200B;

I can't tell what this means and whether I am still their top choice or not. It's been 8 business days since I was given a verbal offer and still nothing in writing. I need advice on a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'm not sure how to squeeze a timeline out of the recruiter as they dodge the question whenever I ask.
2. Should I go around the recruiter and just follow up with the hiring manager? (I haven't talked to the hiring manager since my last interview which was \~2 weeks before my salary negotiation).
3. Should I just be patient and wait it out? Or should I email them back and persist they give me something in writing?
4. How pushy should I be at this stage in general?
5. Does this mean I didn't get the job?"

Got hands on-experience,  got papers, licenses, degrees, certifications,  practical useful skills and I'm humble too.  ;)  


Was out of work for a while due to a health scare,  even all-powerful plastic-wizards such as myself are mortal.   I have yet to work out the means to transfer my mind to a gob of polymer,  believe me that would solve SO many problems.  


ANYWAY - company 60 miles north of me calls up out of the blue.   ""We found your resume and we think you'd be an ideal match for our company!  You have experience on equipment similar to ours,  and you have (fill in various qualifications and alphabet-soup jargon)  -- When can you interview?""  


So I drove up there interviewed,  got hired basically on the spot.   Looked like a decent molding company.   Good machines,   good work practices,  top-notch safety programs...  


Show up for work...   Stand here don't touch anything don't talk to anyone we'll start your training when we have time and staff free to walk you through the basics of how we operate and how our processes work.  


8 hours later... 8 hours of just standing there I went home.  


Next day -- same thing.  


Next day  -- same thing.  


(week goes by)  


Monday (today) I asked if they had forgotten they hired me -- oh no not at all,  we're just too short-staffed right now to spare a moment.    I pointed out that I could shadow someone and that would probably be sufficient to get the ball rolling,  and then they wouldn't be short-staffed as I could come up to speed very quickly.   Previous experience you know!  


Oh that's preposterous,  we have to do it the \_\_\_\_\_ Inc Way.   That involves (long winded lecture on how they do things) before you can (do basic task you've done every day for 25 years of your life.)  


So... I say... so you want me to drive 120 miles round trip,  so you can pay me $40 an hour,  to stand here and do absolutely nothing.   All day?   This is what you want?  


They said right now training you is not a priority,  we are short-staffed and cannot spare the time or the people to train you.   We don't anticipate having enough staff to begin your training process until November.  


November.   They want me to drive 120 miles every day... stand in one spot for 8 hours and not engage with anyone...  for $40 an hour,  for at least a month.  


Now some people would absolutely love that sort of thing.   I'm betting there are any number of people on here who are going to say ""WHY THE \*CENSORED\* DID YOU QUIT?!""    


Quite simply,   I  quit because apparently the company is so poorly managed that they hired someone without planning ahead far enough regarding on-boarding and training.    I quit because they were ""desperate"" for a plastic-wizard,  yet couldn't unleash his awesome powers to their benefit because I was told not to engage with anyone or participate in any way.  


I quit because I wasn't respected by the employer,  to the point that they actually expected me to just stand there silently and not do anything at all.  


...Holy \*censored\* am I frustrated and cheesed off.   Two weeks (interview process and week of work) of my life and an immense amount of wear-and-tear on my car with nothing to show for it.   All because the company was so poorly managed they couldn't leadership themselves out of a wet paper bag.

Ok Reddit -- top that one.   I await your horror stories."

I'm currently 29 years old and have struggled with working what feels like a never ending cycle of crappy jobs since I've been out of high school. In the past 11 years I've worked roughly 5 years of retail, 2 years of hotel front desk-ing, and a variety of other short term jobs ranging from bank teller to a little over a year in admin assistant work for a medical office. While all of the jobs have been different, they all boil down to customer service at its core.

I'm currently working what's probably been the best job I've ever had, but even that's quickly wearing out its welcome. Right now I work doing scheduling for a home health company and have been doing that for about eight months. It's not an awful gig by any means, it's just quickly wearing out its welcome. Two months ago we were allowed to transition to a work from home setting which has been great, but shortly after our department was rearranged and everyone's workload increased, some more substantially than others. I do probably 2-3 times the amount of work I did for the first six months with no extra pay or incentives.

Part of my job involves, you guessed it, customer service. I take several phone calls a day from patients, the majority usually negative. I'm in a weird position where I'm kind of a middle man for my patients and the actual clinical staff, and as a result get yelled at and complained at a lot for things outside of my control. It's mostly bearable, but after a decade+ of working jobs involving getting yelled at by the general public constantly, I'm burned out. Combine this with a few other factors that are making the job more stressful than it needs to be and I'm at a point where I dread working every day. The stress is starting to seep into life outside of work and I don't get paid enough to deal with that again.

Long story short, I'm desperate for any kind of advice on how to break this cycle. I did go to community college for a few years on and off out of high school but never made it to a degree. Shortly after giving up on that life kicked in and I've been living paycheck to paycheck pretty much ever since. I'm finally slowly moving to a place where I can go back and finish, but that's probably another 2-3 years away still. I don't have any certifications or specialized training to speak of. I don't make enough money currently to pay for classes or anything that could help me. Honestly at this point I'd be ecstatic to work a job where I just don't have to interact with the general public. Unfortunately I'm not really physically built for manual labor at the moment or I'd probably at least look into it.

Anything you guys could recommend, however vague or specific it might be, would be super welcome. If you made it to the end, thanks so much for hearing me out."

823,2022-10-03,"How do I defend myself from ""girl-boss"" types?",u/Many_Bridge4619,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xuzo6e/how_do_i_defend_myself_from_girlboss_types/,jobs,"I work in the engineering field. Most of my co-workers are technicians, and technically I am their boss/team lead. This is a very male-dominated environment, with other teams more-or-less mirroring the gender makeup of my own, with a male engineering lead or two, and a small army of male technicians. There are a very small number of female technicians and engineers, but if I had to guess, I'd say our workplace is 90, maybe 95% male-dominated.

Due my recently being promoted/changing roles a little bit, I have started to work with program management and leadership more, to include admin staff, HR, etc. Previously, I wouldn't even encounter these folks, except for maybe once in a while to attend a meeting, pick up mail, ask a question, etc. Now it is pretty much on a daily basis.

Without getting into too many details, I've noticed that some of those who I start to work with will treat me in a very condescending, entitled, and rude manner. Telling me to do things, taking a tone with me, just generally being pushy. Last week I had a particularly unpleasant experience, where one lady, in public, began to berate me for something that I had little to do with. I just kind of stood there and looked at her like she was an alien, and when she was quite finished, I said I'd look into it, and left. I later responded with an email pointing her to the appropriate information and did not respond when she basically tried to make me do her job for her. One of my techs was present for this interchange and he was actually really pissed off on my behalf, I had to talk him down afterwards.

I ordinarily wouldn't bring gender or race into this, but today, it suddenly struck me that every single one of the people I have been having these problems with are ladies. I just scoped a few of them out on Facebook and saw a lot of ""girl boss"" memes, which makes me think this whole thing is a gross power play. As well, I am a minority and probably the only minority in the workplace, except for literally a janitor and one tech on a team I have never really worked with.

I do NOT want to yell at anyone, one because that's not how I choose to behave, and two, because I'm pretty sure that would result in me being disciplined lol. Other than the incident last week, I don't have notes or documentation of what has been going on. And due to my promotion, my boss is a senior leader who supervises these ladies and many, many others. 

I'm thinking of dropping phrases like ""That's not acceptable, let's talk when you're okay"" or in the case of rude emails, ""I don't appreciate this email.""

What's especially bizarre is that now that I think of it, as a senior/lead engineer, I'm higher ranked than any of these ladies, so the absolute least they could do is be professional and treat me like a peer. Instead it seems to have become some sort of twisted game, to bully me in public in such an overt, and unprofessional manner. 

What should I do?

EDIT: Some recent comments have accused me of misogyny because of a few reasons, such as my concerns with the ""tone"" I am being addressed with, and that I use the term ""ladies.""

To clarify, the tone that has sometimes been used to address me is very overt and intentionally disrespectful, accompanied with sneering. There is a pretty significant, night and day difference, including within the same conversation, between the way I'm addressed and the ways others are addressed by some of those who I'm concerned about.

As for the term ""ladies,"" it is the correct and proper way to refer to a group of female humans. ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" for example. It's certainly more polite and less weird than ""females"" and while ""women"" could be a reasonable alternative, one could easily perceive that as at least as misogynistic!"

1,2022-10-03,Planning on pressuring my boss into giving me a raise. Then I'll quit in a few months. I need some advice.,u/Pitiful_Bullfrog1384,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xv0ko8/planning_on_pressuring_my_boss_into_giving_me_a/,jobs,"A few weeks back I got to see my boss's true face. I was terribly sick with covid and was bedridden for 3 weeks. During those 3 weeks I was constantly getting texts and emails from him and HR on when I'll be back. When I requested for an extra week off with a doctor's note, he said 'covid doesn't usually take this long' and that if I took another week off then I was 'burdening my coworkers'. I succumbed to the pressure and was back in the office. I was and still am super disgusted and angry by how management treated me. HR was also supporting his comments.

 I plan to quit in January of next year without giving them much warning, and pressure my boss to give me a raise if he wants me to work for the remaining months, or I will quit in the middle of the year and leave him to scramble on who will take up my work. I plan to continue my schooling, I have enough money saved up to be able to live alright for 3 to 4 years without a job. I basically work the job of 2 people. All my coworkerkers already have their plates full and will for sure demand a raise

 For some context, they usually hire people during the summer. I would have to give 3 months notice. I will leave at the end of March. But not before trying to squeeze every last penny out of my company like they have been squeezing all the energy out of me. I know for a fact, that it would be expensive and a hassle to find someone for my position. They usually hire expatriates and I am a local here so it is less expenditure for the company in terms of housing, air plane tickets and getting work visas and housing. With me, they don't have to pay any of that. They would have to use other workers already there or hire someone from the outside or raise my salary for the remaining few months or if they still want to employ me for however long. He might reject the raise but that's fine with me. I thought I should at least try.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
0,2022-10-03,Role posted for higher rate than accepted - help!,u/Decent-Chain9834,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xv0qqv/role_posted_for_higher_rate_than_accepted_help/,jobs,"Headhunters reached out to me for a 12 month contract to hire role. They warned that the rate was lower than desired but asked me to get through the interviews and they would push to get the budget where I needed. I went through two interviews and received an offer before I found out that the job posting number had not been raised and publicized yet. However,  the company I would work for pushed me through via the relationship with the staffing agency. The job posting was created Friday and today I had a different headhunt reach out to me about the same job ID posting but offering me $10/hr (W2) more than what I had to fight for in my offer. Now I’m not sure what to do. This came to light because my current staffing agency needed me to sign the right to represent (which I haven’t) so I noticed the ID is the same. 

I know raising a Job ID after selecting a hire is pretty normal so I’m not concerned that they are trying to replace me but I don’t know how to handle the fact that another agency is offering $10/hr more. There were days of negotiations to even get me to the rate that I landed. When I brought this to their attention, I got a weird story about the airline posting a tier above what they agreed with my agency bc they are funding from a bucket. To me, this shows that the money is there to pay me but they must have a very large margin included so I want an increase. What should I do? 

Note, start date is still 3 weeks away. I did all my background checks and employment information with the agency but I have not signed the offer (my delay) or the RTR (their delay)."

There has been a ton of shuffling (I’ve had 6 different bosses and have changed departments multiple times to fit the company’s needs), but I’ve managed to do well for myself and have consistently gotten positive reviews and feedback. My plan up until today was to stay with the company long term.

Backstory: Three years ago, a manager position opened up in my department. Two leaders in my department recommended me for it. The (new) dept head turned me down (without an interview) saying he wanted someone more experienced. I understood it at the time, as I was fairly new to the department (like I said, lots of shuffling). They hired someone from outside, who became my boss. Early this year, I was told there may be a possibility for me to move into a manager role within the next year.

I just found out that my boss is leaving, so the manager role is open again. The dept head is, once again, refusing to consider me for the job. However, I was told I will now be supervising our new hire (who has not started yet) - they will report directly to me. This will not come with a raise or title change. I will also need to keep things running until a new manager is hired (and then likely train them, at least partially). They told me maybe down the road we can consider a track in which I eventually become a supervisor (a newly created designation in our department).

I’m trying to be as objective and professional as possible, but I am feeling incredibly surprised and hurt. I don’t get why they would pass me over for manager after previously telling me the goal was to get me there soon, and I don’t know why they’d mention that there’s a supervisor job they COULD give me but aren’t. I’m fairly certain I’ll be the only person in the company who isn’t in a leadership role but supervises staff. I’ve gone above and beyond for this company from the beginning. I’ve handled a lot of unfortunate change with grace, and I have a great reputation. I wanted to stay here long term, but I don’t feel I can at this point. It feels like such a slap in the face. And it has been so long since I’ve looked for a new job that I don’t know where to start or what I want to do.

Just feeling very insecure and lost right now."

I applied for a job as a service advisor at an Acura dealership near me since the manager liked my attitude when i came in for a service, and wanted me to apply; however, i couldnt get my application in on time since i had a week long vacation the next day and the position was given away. when i came back to pick up my car, i dropped off the application anyways and he said he would keep it in case any other positions became available. last week, a month later, i got a call asking me to come in that day to apply for a position as a BDC caller. The money was great for a college student, and they said if i get the job i would be the only caller and would receive all commission. they had me take a drug test they paid for (if that makes a difference), and told me today the test came back negative and the background check should be back in the next day or two. i really need the money to pay off my car and a surgery i had, so i am a little anxious that i wont get the position. the manager seemed to be very impressed by my politeness, handwriting that he said “looks like it was typed up almost”, and clear drive for the job. he told me during the interview that to be fully transparent, someone had come in before myself and interviewed, but then discussed how the older people hired have been disappointing. also, someone came in before me but he made the choice to call me and ask me to come in, which had to be after that interview (i got ready and rushed over, so there had to be a maybe 30 minute gap between the call and me arriving). anyways, based on all these factors, does it seem likely ill get the job? both follow-up calls (one from me updating them that i completed the test, and another advising them that i will be out of town for the next two days to travel to a small town where my cell service may not work in case they need to call) had positive reactions along the line of “thank you, we should be receiving the background check on (whatever) day and then we will proceed from there.”

1,2022-10-04,"With recent staffing shortages, are companies more likely to hire less-qualified workers?",u/Conflastibate,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xv8dtp/with_recent_staffing_shortages_are_companies_more/,jobs,"Recently (at least where I've been living, in Northern California) there have been a lot of staffing shortages. I've heard employers saying they're having a hard time finding people to fill the open spots, and also that the turnout is low for applications when a job is posted. That being the case, would employers be more likely to hire someone who is less qualified - and train them on the job - rather than remain understaffed? I don't want to take the time filling out applications if it's likely a futile effort. For instance, there are jobs that require a bachelor's degree or other certification, but pay approximately the same as I am making now (I don't have a degree).

Might it be worth it to apply for some of these jobs that require degrees/certification even though I'm not qualified?"

2,2022-10-04,Must have experience,u/ShelecktraYT,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xvagvx/must_have_experience/,jobs,"So, I am trying to convince a company to employ me at the moment. The job was initially through an agency, but they refused to talk to the company offering the job on my behalf... So I've done the normal thing and contacted the company directly.

Does the title ever anger some people when they see this? The job I am applying for is a class 2 tramper job, for those not in the know it's long distance truck driving sleeping out in the cab.

The trailer has something called a 'walking floor' it's a nifty piece of simple kit that operates bars on the floor of the trailer to move loads forwards or backwards.

Now, I've searched and there is no formal training for this, not like you get with HIAB, ADR etc. So it must be one of those competency things where you get shown in house how to do it, demonstrate you can use it, then get ticked off in the office. Not even a 30 minute job.

When I asked the agency how I am supposed to gain experience using something that can only be trained in house the guy sounded like I had stumped him. 

But the main point of this post - Should employers be allowed to demand experience for operating something that has no formal qualification? Qualification exists as a legal form of competence in the field you are qualified for after all...

I would totally get if I was applying for some top end job running a company that I would need experience, heck even a HIAB I would get (HIAB is a truck fitted with a crane) but we are talking about a piece of kit that is operated simply by 2 buttons! xD

Honestly, it's like the forklift fiasco... Get your license sure, but sit on it the rest of your life because no one will employ you without experience!"

I’m an anxious and emotional person that constantly overthinks so I’m finding it hard to stay positive and get out of the ‘I hate every minute of this’ mindset. I literally want to burst into tears the minute I start work (thankfully I’m working from home). I absolutely loved my apprenticeship and it’s just a big difference. I’m in a different team in the same department and they’ve given me a document of the things I’m expected to do but they haven’t actually shown me how to do it. I feel like I’m bothering them by asking so many questions and my manager isn’t even part of the same team so they can’t answer my questions. I’ve always worked 9-5 which suited me well but as long as I worked between 10-4 they didn’t mind when I started work, this meant if I had a later night I could just work 10-6. The new team I’m with have dropped on me that they want me to work 8-4 which is giving me so much anxiety as I’m quite precious about how much sleep I’m getting and I have to walk the dogs etc before work. I just dread going into work and it’s just really exhausting I don’t know what to do."
193,2022-10-04,Pronouns in email signature,u/Exciting-Ice-329,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xvbfbs/pronouns_in_email_signature/,jobs,"Okay, so the title isn’t what it seems I’m promise. And I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this in, please let me know if there’s a better place. 

I, a mid 20s woman, have my pronouns(she/her) in my email signature that I’ve requested my company put there. This is because I have a male passing name. This has caused confusion with potential and current clients and having my pronouns has cleared this up. It affects how I am addressed in emails and provide expectations for phone calls when I have to talk to these clients. Prior to having my pronouns, clients were confused about who I was and where I was calling from. 

Now, my HR department has reached out to my direct supervisor stating that I have unapproved information in my company generated email signature. Again, something I had to ask my IT department to place in my signature as it’s auto generated and I cannot alter it. 

They have yet to say anything to me directly however it’s frustrating. If this escalates, would I have grounds to say something? I understand company policies and such may have affect on this but I’m just curious if I would have the right to push back on them removing them. Thank you!

Edit: I appreciate all of the feedback. I have not spoken with HR but I did speak with my supervisor again. I mentioned they could possibly switch to Ms/Mrs as many of you suggested. He said that they probably won’t allow that either because they want the exact same signatures across our organization. However, he ended up showing me handfuls of email conversations he’s had with members of HR, payroll, other locations, and many I haven’t exchanged emails with, referring me to as a man. He stated he was frustrated on my behalf and that if HR pushes this issue with him he will tell them they should be willing to accommodate somehow."

I didnt realize the waiting list for daycare in my area are 2 years long. 
So, I'm trying to find something that offers a very flexible schedule while my kids are in school, which ends up being only 3 days a week.

There's an accounting firm in my area that has a note on their website saying they are always looking for new talent in all levels of experience and offer part time or full time, and encourage people to submit their resume for consideration. 

I also have no interest in doing tax returns, and that's part of their services. (They have multiple other services, as well, that I would be ok with doing)

I can already foresee it. I explained it to my manager so he knows that there's a problem &amp; needs to be assessed, I like me getting more hours, small pay rise I guess, and having stepped up.

*Hi X &amp; Y,*

*I would like to thank you both for the offer and for the opportunity to work with you at ABC. It was a pleasure speaking with you both and learning more about the role and the company.* 

*Unfortunately, another opportunity has come up, and although it was a difficult decision, I will have to decline your offer as I have decided to move forward with the other position as it is a better match for my professional goals at this time.*

242,2022-10-04,"I Keep Hearing About How The Job Market Is Hot But It Only Seems Like Fast Food, Retail Jobs and Sales are Hiring",u/gimmiefuelgimmiefire,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xvi4xa/i_keep_hearing_about_how_the_job_market_is_hot/,jobs,"I've been hearing now for months how the job market here in the U.S. is a Hot Job market and that employers can't find enough employees and their is a ""great resignation"" going on. But in my experience it only seems to be that Fast Food and Retail jobs are doing massive hiring and everything else is extremely competitive with few openings.

The good news is I have a job right now and a second part time remote job that I can do along side my first job. However, my first job is likely having layoffs coming up and I've been looking for another job. Even then my first job doesn't pay great and only offers medical insurance no dental. 

But applying to other tech jobs it seems most both in person and remote get 100+ applications and it's competitive as hell. It seems there are less openings compared to last year before I completed my degree. Also for interviews, it seems every salaried position does multiple rounds of interviews and it's hard to make it to the end. I've only made it to the final round once a few months ago and didn't get the job.

Then other side, it seems every fast food joint and store has help wanted signs and offering walk in interviews and same day hiring. The only career type jobs that I see doing a lot of hiring are sales positions. But they also have a ton of turnover and a lot of people aren't cut out for it.

Is anyone else noticing the same or is it just where I live?"
0,2022-10-04,Looking for insight after interview at dream job,u/no_idea_wut_im_doing,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xviahr/looking_for_insight_after_interview_at_dream_job/,jobs,"Hi there - was hoping to get some insight into how I should feel after a 2nd (seemingly final?) interview at a dream job with a social impact organization of about 200 employees. I know there are a ton of posts like this and no one can ever actually tell until you get an offer, but as life would have it, my nerves keep my mind racing!

\- The first round was with my would-be boss, and he kept me 15 minutes long and asked a ton of great follow up questions after having clearly read through my portfolio. Made a point to ask if I was okay with relocation. He said I can expect to hear from them within a week if they'd like to learn more, but I was emailed by the chief of staff requesting a conversation with her within one day of this first round.

\-  30 min 2nd round zoom interview with the chief of staff was last Wednesday. She was cheery and excited to talk with me. Felt like it went well and we connected on values/workplace culture. Had a few moments of personal chatter throughout convo. Spent \~20-25% of convo talking about position and organization and the rest was me responding to her questions: my story, my approaches to some of the role responsibilities, my preferred management style, what I'm looking for in a job.

\- Time was up but she made a point to keep me a few mins long to let me ask a question (which she enthusiastically answered and it was definitely in a trying-to-sell-me-the-company tone), explain an office policy change (going from 3 to 4 days in office) and if that was okay with me, and explain that I can expect some follow up within a week (and then corrected herself and said it could maybe be two weeks). She also asked me to keep them in the loop about other opportunities should I accept an offer elsewhere or if I decided I'd no longer like to pursue the position for whatever reason. 

\- Gut reaction at the end was that it went as well as it could have after a long week of preparing for it and contacting mentors for advice. There wasn't discussion of salary or relocation package, etc., however, and she didn't seem as invested in me as a candidate as my would-be boss in the first interview. I sent a thank you email to both the first and second interviewers about 36 hours later (Friday morning) and haven't yet received a response (it's Tuesday morning). 

I think this is a position I am perfectly qualified for (neither under or overqualified) and is a total dream job. Any thoughts would be SO greatly appreciated!"

However, there is the possibility that they might make you relocate for this job. This opportunity would be great since the entry level pay is great, would give me a major stepping stone in the company, and like I said previously I already like working here.

I’m just wondering how to make my resume better suited for these types of jobs. Do these employers care just as much about resumes as other positions with academic qualifications? Is a cover letter appropriate? I would just like to stand out as a promising candidate, but unsure how to do so without experience in customer facing roles. Thank you!"

I am a new grad with an entry level offer and need to choose my start date. It has to be at least 2 weeks out and must start on a Monday. As much as I would like to start within 2 weeks, my obstacle is the commute. I live 2 hours away from the place and am thinking it's best to move over there. It's not as far as moving to another state so I feel it would look like a red flag to ask for a start date too far into the future. 

I also know it takes awhile to find an apartment, roommates, etc. I'm thinking of starting in 3 weeks (around 10/24) at the earliest. I would choose 4 weeks from now but that Monday is Halloween so I don't know if they'll let me(I'll still suggest it just in case). 

My plan is to start on the 24th and look at rooms or apartments for rent right now and in case I don't live in an Airbnb to hold me off(about a month).

Does anyone know if this is a solid plan or is 3 weeks way too early? 

Any advice in general is greatly appreciated. This is my first full-time job and I don't want to mess this up."

Im looking for some advice on what I should possibly be expecting and/or asking during a verbal job offer? I’ve been working in my field for 3 years now, and my current job is my first out of college. With my current job, they sent me and email with the job offer and I just signed and that was that. This however, is different. 

Ive had two interviews and my references were called. I was told on multiple occasions that they want to hire me, and I know I already have the job. They called me sometime last week and originally told me the salary was between 75k-90k. I asked for 95k based on my skill set, and the things told to me in the interviews. They informed me they’d reach out to my references and then get in touch with me, along with seeing if they have wiggle room to work with what I want. I have a call today and I’m pretty sure it’ll be an offer. 

I already know the responsibilities, who I’d be working with, and flavors of the company culture. This call is negotiating and I’ve never done that before. Can anyone give some good questions to ask and things to think about in a call such as this?

Thanks"

yesterday I've become watchman at some company in my town, but I'm not really sure, if it's worth it. Basically my shift starts from 1:30PM and lasts until 7AM in the morning. I know, it's a lot. In normal circumstances I wouldn't take it, but I really can't find a job and we are short on money at home.

Technically I don't have to do much there: close a few gates when everyone's left, light the lamps and give dogs some food, after that I take a walk around the place every hour or two. What's the main problem is the fact of me having to sit there for almost 18 hours without sleeping. I really didn't feel good this morning when I was going back home. My contract lasts until the end of the month (contract of mandate - new contract every month from what they've told me), so I can resign then, but I'm really torn about it all. On one hand, we need money (I get the lowest hourly wage possible, but it's net salary, because I'm a student and under 26, so I actually get paid more than some people working for many years.), on the other hand, I'm not sure, if I can endure it physically.

There's also the fact there's not much to do there to kill time. I was surfing the web on my phone for most of the time, but it gets boring after few hours (hopefully they'll give me Wi-Fi password, so I can use Internet freely without using my own mobile data. I also hope I can actually connect to it from the building I'm in.).

Just to clarify a few things about me: I'm living in Poland, I started studying part-time last weekend and working yesterday. I'm guessing most of you are from US, so some stuff may be unheard of.

As of now, I've slept for 5-6 hours when I got to bed at 8AM. Tomorrow I have next shift, so I have to sleep at night.

I'd like to hear your opinion about it all and maybe some advice what to do."

I really like my current temp job, even though the work is very tedious and detail oriented my supervisor, manager, and coworkers are all really nice and helpful. I have two other coworkers who were hired through the same staffing agency, so we are currently the only temp workers for now. 

I’m 18, so i’m looking to get an apartment and start living on my own, but I have relatives who tell me not to rely on a temporary position because there is no promise of me becoming permanent. So i’m being told to just take the full time position i’ve already been offered even if the pay isn’t a huge difference. Just asking for advice, what would you do if you were me?"

Without going into specifics I'm not interested in expanding my company outside of just me. I love it because of creating art, not because of income. 

I've been doing this over ten years now and its starting to wear on me a bit. I think if I could find a work from home job that offered similar pay (60-80k gross/year) I'd have no problem leaving my business behind, or at least drastically reducing how much work I take on.

I have no college degree but I've always been good at IT type stuff and clearly am able to market myself and be good at social relations which is needed in the wedding industry.

I'm currently just entertaining the idea but I don't even know where to start. I've been doing my own thing for ten years and I wouldn't know where someone like me would begin searching in the regular job market or if I should go back to school."

As soon as I was started I realized the work environment is extremely toxic and there is absolutely no work life balance. 

I am under a 2 year contract and have no clue how to get out of it. If I could get out I would leave today even with no job prospects. Even if I can’t leave I need advice on how to create boundaries.

It is expected that I stay to finish projects I am given with very late notice. So I am staying 2-3 hours a day extra. I have tried to fight back in this but I’m told what needs to get done needs to get done. I am given most of the workload when my coworkers take 3 hour breaks during the day and are nowhere to be found. I take zero food breaks. I should be given an hour. 

My boss has no clue what I do and believes the workload is fair. I have tried to talk with him, but he doesn’t want to hear it because he is extremely close with the other coworkers. 

On top of that I’ve been told I can’t report any PTO and I will be compensated in other ways. A day off here or there. I am not salary I am hourly. So I should be getting OT. I’ve tried to discuss this with HR and I’m hit with this is the expectation and how it has been for years. 

I hate my job now. I use to love my work and have an amazing work life balance. Now I don’t even have time to cook meals when I come home because I am working so late. 

I think I was hired a diversity hire and my coworkers treat me as the bottom of the barrel work bitch. It’s extremely negative.

I need to get out. I have no idea how. I’m not sure how to set boundaries in this type of environment. I can’t just not show up ever again because I will get sued and forced to pay out my salary. 

Please any advice would be beneficial. I have posted in the r/hr and never get any feedback. I’m at a loss and truly in a bad situation."

The company (medium sized business) I work for has been hiring recently and there was a particular position in a different department that I was interested in, hence decided to apply. The advertised salary was only a a couple of £K higher than my current one and the role would involve a big jump in both time commitment and responsibilities. When I applied, I did it with the intention of negotiating salary. 

Completed the interview and my future line manager informed me I got the role a few days after just before going into an unrelated meeting, ensuring we’d discuss salary and everything nearer the start date. This was about a month ago.

We’ve both been busy in the meantime and didn’t have the chance to catch up. Since then, the company has hired my replacement and my move to this department has been communicated internally. My start date for the new role is in 2.5 weeks and to this day, I haven’t received a job offer, salary information, or a contract. When asked last week, my future manager confirmed we’d go through the bureaucracy. 

However I can’t help but feel that i have no more bargaining power. They were in a position of need with lots of capacity issues so at the time I felt I had a solid position to negotiate the salary, but now that it’s been made official (despite the lack of paperwork), that is no longer the case. 

I don’t think they’re trying to screw me over but I am conscious about not getting a good deal given the circumstances. I’d still take the job even if for a lower than expected salary because it’s great for my career, but I want to at least try and negotiate. 

What’s the best way to approach this discussion with my future line manager bearing in mind I am officially starting my new role very soon? 

I was hoping they’d bring it up soon but I don’t want to leave it to the last minute.

Thank you for reading this far!"

I’ve been working as an Admin Assistant/Office Manager for a financial company for about 7 months. My boss asked me about a week ago if I liked the job and what my future plans are, which is nice. He then proceeds to ask me if I was comfortable moving up in the company, which isn’t realistic and not what I’m looking to do long term, so I told him probably not. He then offers a year long salaried contract to be an advisor in training, or turn in my 3 weeks (wants me to stay till upcoming deadline). So, I ‘turned in’ my 3 weeks because I am moving once my lease is up in 9 months out of state and the job doesn’t align with what I see in my future. The issue is, I don’t have a job lined up once I’m out of the office, and I have bills to pay that need to be picked up when I leave, and I told him this, and his response is that I’m too skilled for the position I’m in, and being paid too highly for the position, so he wants to have someone else fill my role that’s paid less and have me take a more income generating position. I’m in school full time, and I’ve worked hard to help out his small company in the past 7 months, hence the promotion, but he won’t help me out to stay just till my lease is up, and frankly doesn’t want me because of my pay rate and ‘lack of ambition’ moving up in the company. He said he’s willing to do a lot to help me find a job (referral, contacting agencies) so I can have him speak to an employer once I get an offer, although I don’t know where to look for a well paying job to transition to that’ll pay the bills in that timeframe. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - Boss doesn’t wanna continue my higher pay rate and offered promotion or quit. I chose to turn in a 3 week notice because it doesn’t align with my future and now am left looking for a job, Need advice on where to look for a quick to hire job that pays enough in CA (~$25/hr). I can provide more info if needed to help. Thanks!"

I guess my problem is not so uncommon, but I still would like to hear your opinion.

I started working for this international company 3 years ago. Ever since I started working here, I had to define my own tasks, my own projects, basically my area of responsibility, basically everything I am doing right now. My role is rather about process optimization and honestly, I feel I am stuck. I think I optimized everything I can (of course it is never completely over) and I solved things nobody wanted to, I constantly give my boss ideas related to topics we should do, I am giving all the ideas and recommendations... But I am tired. I am tired, because I have no clear objectives, in order not to feel bored, I am constantly searching for new tasks.... If I find any, I do them right, and I go to my boss, look what I have done... What do you think, could we still do this and that? Unfortunately he has literally no idea what we as a team should be doing. He sees her job as ""coordination only"" . He doesn't have an opinion on anything I show him, he has concrete ideas about what should be done. If I didn't say anything, we would not do anything. I am tired... I feel like I will drown, because I can't develop... I am tired of developing my own boss... 

Is it normal working like this? I mean I am creative enough, but I would really like to have a mixture between ""doing what needs to be done because the management wants it and needs it"" and ""doing something because I think it should be done, it interests me"". Is it normal not getting any feedback from the direct manager or not getting any instructions from him at all? Is it normal that an employee like me needs to define a department's tasks?

Thank you for the help."

I also have extensive volunteering service and was involved in like 5 clubs and founded 1 when I was in uni. Since then, I’ve applied to almost 200 jobs. I mainly started with copyediting jobs, as this is what I want to do, but as I wasn’t hearing back from any, I started applying for jobs in customer service, admin, banking, pretty much anything I am reasonably qualified for. I literally only got 1 interview, which went really well and advanced to the final round (it was a contract position as a reading tutor for a national charity). I was going to be hired, but I was told today that the position was not approved by the school. So the company can’t hire any reading tutors for this area. I’m pretty crushed and kinda feel like a failure. I have way more experience than my peers, but a lot of them have managed to find jobs. Meanwhile, I’ve been having to live off my brother and sister just to eat. Not even the local gas stations or grocery stores are hiring! Im so desperate, but I don’t know what to do. Any advice is welcome. (Btw even though I’m good at creative writing, I don’t want to write for newspapers or blogs. So I haven’t applied to those and won’t) (another side note, I don’t think it’s my resume cause I’ve had it looked over by professionals and optimize it for every job I apply for)."

It’s frustrating because I need reassurance but don’t want to sound too pushy since I already asked about the transition date when it didn’t happen. He is currently out of the office but has been online in the messaging system we use. I am also due for a bonus I get quarterly that wasn’t discussed when I got the promotion.

He works M-F, 8am until 4pm.  He is working there to get tuition reimbursement while going to school to get his teaching certification. 

Since his full time job only pays minimum wage, he also works part time on the weekends at a Young Adult home as a RA (resident assistant).  They house young working adults 17-21 and teach them life skills like applying for a job, balancing their finances, and other life skills.  His job is to be onsite Saturday at noon until Sunday at 4pm in case of an emergency.  It’s very chill and he rarely interacts with the youths unless they need a ride to work.  He is able to study and do homework in a quiet setting and gets paid to do it.  It’s a win-win for everyone while he goes to school.

His boss at the weekend job just told him he needs to attend a 3-day training 2 hours from home during the work week.  Obviously he can’t attend since he works all week during the day.  He told his boss at the part time job that he is not available during the day M-F when they hired him last year.  They have known his availability for over 10 months and now are threatening to fire him if he doesn’t attend this training.  Does he have any recourse?  If he goes to the training, he’ll jeopardize his full time job and tuition reimbursement.   He doesn’t have enough vacation time or sick time either."

5,2022-10-04,How Do I Resign?,u/The_Reading_Turtle,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xvvtpe/how_do_i_resign/,jobs,"Never had to do it before. My previous jobs have all naturally ""expired"" via sale of business, end of contract, graduation (work-study position). This is my first resignation.

The company used to be toxic to the point where I threw up EVERY morning before work, every single work day, for 3 months (I thought that I was dying or something). Something happened, bosses may have read the Glassdoor reviews, whatever. They have attempted to get better but unfortunately it's too little top late. Honestly manager sent me an angry as a hornet 9pm email the other day demanding to know why I didn't send an email...the very one I CC'd her in days ago...sent out already. 

I love my coworkers to death and management I had come to respecting a little more lately (at least...until that angry email in the middle of the night) but it's too late and busy season is right around the corner. I alone handle one of the forms for over 200 clients and last year I got no support. Imagine Black Friday if there was only one lane open and it was mine. I can't do it again. I nearly quit last January on the spot. 

How do I leave? I know they'll be VERY upset and I'm (unfortunately) someone who cries if being yelled at or even if I made someone unhappy 😬

I could literally write a paper on why I'm leaving but I want to leave amicably. I fully intend to make the transition as smooth as possible. I'm ready to make notes, training packages, video tapings, presentations, whatever is needed. But I know they'll lose their minds. I won't know how to react other than to spill everything and tell them just how awful this place has been for my health and then there goes me trying to leave without burning bridges...

So how does one quit? What would the reason be? It's a remote job so do I just send the resignation email and ask for a meeting? I've been thinking about this for months and now it's almost time. I really don't want to leave on a bad foot ...

TLDR: How do I leave a job that I've started to like, but it's a little too late and their efforts and changes to be less toxic too small to really notice? I want to leave without burning bridges."

I applied for this “Account Rep” position, low and behold they contact me via email to set up a virtual interview. The job description says 55k-100k a year + commission and bonuses. Well I go check out reviews and this job is 100% commission no salary. How are they going to expect to get a decent person to fill that position if they are going to straight up lie to them from the get go? I would have never applied for this position if I had known it was strictly commission. Yes I know I should have done my due diligence and researched it before even applying but it looked like a legit, sweet gig. These sites should filter out jobs that are commission based and not let them show up when you are looking for a specific salary. Sorry for the rant, just a heads up for anyone looking for this kind of job."

Would it be annoying to shoot an email to the HR person who sent my offer just to clarify the questions I have for my first day?

I start in 6 days and this is my first job in a more corporate setting and my first time being remote so I'm a bit nervous I'm going to miss something."

2,2022-10-04,Should I reapply for a job that wouldn’t negotiate salary?,u/Tiny_Contribution144,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xvy9zb/should_i_reapply_for_a_job_that_wouldnt_negotiate/,jobs,"I have been working in the insurance industry in Florida for about a year and a half. My current job has relatively low hourly pay with potential for pretty decent commissions. I have averaged $5300/mo between salary &amp; commissions this year, maxing out my employer’s commission brackets several months. I’m good at sales because I love working with people and helping them. 

However, the hours have been long and grueling, and I have 3 young kids, so it’s not sustainable for someone who is family oriented. Plus, I have no benefits, and no real guarantee for a livable income to provide for my family. 

A month ago I was recruited for a job with an employer with fantastic benefits, generous time off, and much better hours. I applied for the initial job, but the hiring team switched my interview halfway through for a different position with “manager” in the title. The hiring manager called me a couple of days later and stated that the position seemed better suited for me &amp; was paying more than my asking salary. Flattered, I applied for the job and was called with an offer a week and a half later. The offer sounded AMAZING until he offered the salary: $48,100 annually. That’s a $1300/mo pay decrease. That’s a barely livable income in Florida. I tried to negotiate salary, but they were firm, so we parted ways.

Well, now I’m second guessing myself. The paid holiday were 3x what I get now, 2.5x the PTO, and the days between Xmas &amp; New Years paid time off. Great health insurance. Plus, my current boss has been playing “move the goalpost” weekly. She’s never satisfied, and she’s begun pitting her sales team members against each other. I’m too old for a catty sales team. 

So all of that to ask:
- Am I being shortsighted in wanting to the lower salary job?
- Most importantly, how would it look if I reapplied for the job and put the salary offer amount in as my desired salary??"

When I first started I was supposed to focus on store items only (I’m an assistant buyer) and now I’m doing stores and some online (half of another coworkers job actually because they are overwhelmed with the other online items. In just data entry set up for the online items, I have spent 172 hours in 10 months doing just that aspect of their job. I have 157 hours to go in creating online items before December. Over 13.5 months (oct 2020- December 2022) this averages to about 6.5 extra hours a week and totaling 9 weeks consisting of 40 hour work weeks dedicated to data entry for my coworkers items. I will be mentioning this in my document I will be presenting along with the other responsibilities aside from data entry. I also help out other team members in my spare time making me a valuable team member (I know I am and I plan on saying this). 

I currently make $52k and other assistant buyers in my city (according to glass door, payscale, LinkedIn etc) make an average ranging from $54k-$64k. I want to ask for $60k, $8k raise, or about 15%. Is this too little or too high? My company has open jobs as an assistant buyer with the pay range of $47k-$60k (which is why I’m wondering if I am asking too much?). Should I ask for the dollar amount or the percentage? Realistically I am hoping they wouldn’t counter lower than $57k."

I do greet them when they come in, inform of any deals and events, and ask if could be of any help before anything.

But just always found it awkward especially when my area or floor is often clean and organized so i don't really need to touch anything but i do anyways. I don't hover the customers but be in proximity. And often times, they rrreally don't want my help.

My bosses/superiors always make it weird like they would be pushing for me to force sales despite they were clearly just browsing (by their words or really avoiding/ignoring me). And when i couldn't, they get upset.

I'm often stuck with this situation in retail jobs I've been at because the sales floor would be neat and organized too. The sales floor would be dead. I don't want to stand idly so i usually help out others or find out from superiors if there's extra work until customers are ready. I see other long time employees stand and talk. I figure it is because I'm new-ish but still.. what do you do when customers don't want your help, everything is put where it should, and other employees/superiors don't need your help? I'm iffy on myself where am I wrong? Like should i push more? Start convo?

So I'm wondering what would you do in this situation as a sales retail employee, and what do you specifically do in retail, and what do you think the boss/superior is expecting? I want to know your experience."

One of the condition of the offer is, they will contact my current employer to verify my employment. There is no other solution, not even through pay stub or other documents.

They're employing a third party background check company to do the check.   
I guess this background check company will contact the HR department as I don't give them my manager's contact. My current employer is fairly big and they have several layers of HR personnel before the HR person who handles me personally (each employee has  a designated HR).

How is this kind of check conducted?   
Will the background check company say that they're contacting on behalf of company XXX and would like to verify my employment as part of a recruitment process?  
And normally, will the HR regard this as a red flag and notify my manager that I'm applying for a job?

My dream has always been to work in publishing, but I'm having no luck breaking into the industry and even if I did, the salaries are so low it's a joke. I suppose I knew this going in, but I just thought something would change I guess. I was recently working as an editorial assistant but got let go.

What bugs me is that when I was a senior in high school, I had been debating going into science. I was so close, even took a couple summer classes in Neuroscience. I had great grades and could've gotten into a good school, but at the time I was unwilling to leave my home state.

I have over 60 applications out there right now for different jobs in publishing, marketing, publicity, and communications. Out of that, I had 3 interviews. 2 have reached out saying they went with someone else. What am I doing wrong? I've had professionals tell me my resume looks great, I am writing individual cover letters, and applying for jobs I am qualified for. I'm just not understanding what I could do differently.

I am in such a funk over this. The last two years of my life have been especially difficult, and I just feel like such a loser right now. I really wanted to be somebody and do something worthwhile, but my biggest fear is getting into a stream of just taking jobs where I can get them for the rest of my life. 

Is it worth it to go and get a masters in English? At this point, I've been debating going back and getting a second bachelor's degree in a higher paying STEM field, since I was interested in that in the past. That way I can live comfortably and write or be creative in my free time rather than looking for a creative job. I just don't know how much longer I can sit here and apply/reach out to 'check the status of my application' with employers."

She is great and I often go to her asking questions, i think she is much better at the job than me and knows a lot more about how the company works. A new position has opened up as our team leader, I secretly also applied as I saw the quality of outsiders applying for it and thought I was better. However I feel my peer deserves it more both due to how long she has been there and how good she is at her job. She has also applied for it but I’m now concerned what if I get the job, I feel less deserving, like I’d do worse at it and don’t want to ruin our relationship. Should I pull out?

I’m only worried I’ll get the job because the Manager who is hiring for the position is new and on our calls we’ve had similar thoughts on how the company could improve, or at least I just kept agreeing with her. So I think she likes that we ‘think the same.’

TL;DR - new position opened up, me and my peer both applied, I’m sure I’d do worse at the job but am worried I might get it. Do I confess?"

0,2022-10-05,Should I take a new job just because they changed my schedule?,u/cicero779,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xwh45t/should_i_take_a_new_job_just_because_they_changed/,jobs,"Hi all! Title is kind of not much help without background to the situation. 

I (22f) am a EMT/education coordinator at a local Ambulance. My husband (23m) is also an EMT at that same company, and recently got promoted to a supervisor position - he’s now 3rd in charge to the entire company. 

Pausing here (because I know how Reddit is) to say that I did not come to receive feedback on the company hiring both my husband and myself. Like it or hate it, it’s not the issue at hand. 

I really enjoy this job because of my relationship with my superiors, as well as the extra work that I have with providing community education and being in charge of orienting new employees and coordinating with local classes to provide contact hours for EMT and paramedic students. I’ve never had a position that was beyond just being an EMT before, and education is an interest of mine so I genuinely like my job. I really enjoy my schedule where I work a 36 hours over the weekend, and have 4 hours that I’m paid for throughout the week strictly for holding a class or other duties that I can’t do during a shift. Plus, my husband and I interviewed and got hired within the same couple weeks of each other and our managers were very attentive to creating our schedules in a way that suits us having time together and reducing the need for childcare. The major downsides, though, by far is the pay and the benefits. I took a $6 pay cut from my previous position that really hit me hard, it’s been easier getting Medicaid than benefits through the company because of the hoops I have to jump around with their ‘contact’ to set up insurance, and then I found out that once I do (if I ever) set up insurance I pay it out of pocket and then have to go to the director with the payment receipt to get a check for reimbursement. I’ve never even heard of this before and it’s a huge red flag. 

My husband, on the other hand, is making more money than he ever has (although it’s 50 cents more than what I’m paid there so it’s not enough to make a difference in our household income) and is happy with the potential for more promotions. A huge benefit for him (and the both of us) was not having to arrange childcare since we both worked 2 days a week on different days. 

We had a meeting together with our supervisors about a month ago about changing our schedule, and sat there and worked out a couple potential solutions that would make the need for childcare as limited as possible, plus would still ensure that we got at least one full day a week together off as a family. Our two supervisors above us are also married with children, so they were really pushing for us to have them off together too. 

Well today rolls around a and we find out that as of the 30th of the month, my schedule will be the same, but with more hours added to it (Saturday 24 hours 7a-7a, Sunday 7p-7a, and Thursday 9-5) and his has changed to M-F from 3-11.  Keep in mind that on his days off, I will have 12 hours at home in between shifts that I most definitely will be using for showering and sleeping. This means that we will have no days off together as a family, will have just about 3 weeks notice to find a daycare for 1 day a week, and now have the added expense of the daycare (on top of a recent pay cut). We don’t even get sick time until May, and when we do we will both be given 20 hours, which for me, might not even cover a full shift. 

The more I think about it the more justified I feel in beginning the job hunting process, despite liking the job. But despite how logical it is for me to get another job with a better schedule, I’m still worried about being looked at negatively for “job hopping” even though there is an abundance of opening for EMTs and a few other positions that I’m interested in in my area. I also can’t help but to feel stupid for giving up a job because of scheduling. 

Give me some words of advice, Redditors, would you stay or would you go? Am I actually justified in leaving? Tips on giving notice in such a way that it’s still respectful and not personal?

TLDR: company me and my husband worked at changed our schedules in such a way that it would greatly effect our family. It makes sense for me to leave because I took the job exclusively for schedule considerations to benefit our kids, even though I took a large pay cut and loss of benefits. Torn because I like the job itself and the people I work with, plus I feel like it’s stupid to leave a job just because of a schedule change."

Opportunity A is for a large multinational company. I knew about this opportunity through an old colleague. About a month ago he posted the job on LinkedIn and I reached out and applied. My old colleague put my job application directly through HR and so I got scheduled directly for an interview with the hiring manger. The interview went well. This hiring manager reports to my old colleague, and he said as part of the process, he would schedule a second interview between himself and my old colleague and I should expect to hear from HR soon. A week after the interview, I did not hear back from him, so I sent a thank you note and a follow up to the hiring manager. He said the delay was on him, and that he would try to speed up the feedback process and ask HR to schedule the second interview with me. 3 weeks had gone past and I had not hear from him, so I thought maybe they found a candidate to fill the role.


Today I reached out to the managing director (MD) of a second company. This is a much smaller company (team of only less than 15). This second company and I have known each other for a while, because I had a chance to visit and work with them for a short project, so I know everyone in the team. The relationship is so close because my close friend works here, I left a good impression with everyone when I was here, and some people in this company loved me so much they all encouraged me to join them when I consider a career switch. So I sent the MD a LinkedIn message telling him I’m on the lookout for opportunities and he immediately welcomed that and said he would send me a PD and schedule a call. This is opportunity B.

Guess what, a few hours after this, my old colleague told me he has asked HR to schedule a second interview for opportunity A. So now I’m stuck. My heart is with opportunity A, and I would like to pursue it. But how do I tell the MD of company B that I’d like to put the application on hold while I was the person reaching out and inquiring and acting excited about it? I don’t want to burn bridge with company B. Chances are they’re a small team so he might have told everyone in the team and probably got them hyped up about me wanting to join. Also the second company is directly owned by the MD so I’m afraid this would hurt our relationship as they might think they’re only second on my mind.

2,2022-10-05,Not sure if I should take on a full-time position at my company,u/krocelly,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xwkeek/not_sure_if_i_should_take_on_a_fulltime_position/,jobs,"I'm 23 and currently a temp remote worker for a pretty well-known company in the HR department. I mainly work back office, the pay is pretty decent, if there is no projects or requests, I get a lot of free time or easy work. I do not stress too much and been here for about 10 months and I get to easily do what I love which is travel while working here. 

I was recently asked by my managers if I would be interested in a full-time position with the company to do what they do. I feel like the most obvious thing for me to say is yes because of higher pay, security, benefits, etc. However despite being remote, I've always noticed the managers are overloaded and they work many hours, I see them hop on around 8am and work until 9pm. It's just consistent busy work and meetings throughout all of it, and they always seemed stressed. I did ask if my current work/job would no longer be needed when some things get automated, and I was told not to worry about that since there'll always be work for me to do, but I also feel like I would be missing on a full-time opportunity.

Regardless, if I take the job I am also concerned that I will barely have any freedom/work life balance which I value very much. Also, HR/Business is not really the end career I want and I personally want to go into something that is more in the realm of graphic design such as UX/UI Design and may not have time to really practice or get into it. All my friends and family have sort of make me feel bad and lazy for questioning if I should take this full-time position.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr; I work a pretty relaxed, flexible remote job with decent pay that has allowed me to have lots of freetime and travel, but I was entertained a full-time position where I'll be working around 12 hours each day and be constantly busy. I really value my flexibility and freetime but feel like I would be missing an opportunity for a full time role with a pretty well known company."

I'm currently being considered as a finalist for a position (job #1) in a different unit of my company (higher education). This position is basically the most senior staff for the unit and is the senior HR approver/faculty coordinator and academics manager. 

My current boss has been super supportive and has asked to start the process of retention for me even if I don't get the new job offer, which is basically unheard of for ed jobs. We both know she'll have a hard time getting close to the salary (going from ~65k to 95-100k with the new position) but she's going to try to get the money and to have my position have more direct reports since this new unit would have me as a manager for 8-10 people and head of staff. 

However, there is another position (job #2) I also applied for around the same time that is just now starting their interview processes, same institution, different unit again. This position has less direct reports but way more freedom and is basically creating a new department that works with a bunch of other units; and less HR/reporting more of fundraising and outside stakeholder comms with some academics. This position pays between 95-110k.

Job #1 is a unit I've worked in before and while it has changed some it's still a hot mess in a lot of ways (welcome to higher ed) and Job #2 is in a new unit but I've worked with people there before just not as a direct employee/co-worker. Job #1's duties are less interesting to me than Job #2 but money is really tight for my family right now and getting closer to six figures will be life changing. 

I've reached out to Job #2 about being a finalist for Job #1 but it's been radio silent from the hiring manager. I've heard from a friend who works in Job #2's unit that the hiring manager will be reaching out to me today/tomorrow about an interview. Due to Job #1 likely making an offer on Friday how would you proceed? I don't want to make demands of Job #2 and their timing but if I had both offers in front of me I'd take Job #2 over Job #1 in a heart beat if the salaries were close. I know I'm jumping the gun in this a lot because I don't have an offer yet but I've been kicking this around in my head for so long I just need to hear other peoples thoughts!

I have not had the first day yet as I needed to give my present employer 2 weeks notice. I don’t want to be a guy where it looks like I’m job hopping. When I accepted the job about 4 hours after that I get a call from a company who had interviewed me offered me a position but I turned it down because I had already accepted this job offer. Now I have jobs that are better than the current one that I accepted are asking if I have time for an interview. Kind of doesn’t make sense to me. What do you suggest I do? I want to be professional about this.
1,2022-10-05,Returning to old industry,u/RayZone555,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xwm0ro/returning_to_old_industry/,jobs,"Hi All
I left a sales job around 18months ago as it was unbearable, mainly because of management in the company but it did make me recent the job and it did get me down quite a bit.
I’ve tried looking at other things but I cannot get a interview and certainly wouldn’t get the same money elsewhere all my experience is in sales.
I’m close to accepting a offer for somewhere doing the same job, from my gut feeling and research into the company it does seem a lot better, I’m hoping I’ll do it and enjoy it but I’m not 100%.
But right now with the economy it’s really bad I don’t think I can be picky the next 18-24m are going to be very tough.
Has anyone left a old industry to then return? 
In my head before when I left that was me finished with sales so it’s really hard inside excepting I’ll have to return.
Thanks"

I think I may need a bit of insight here. I started a new job as a project manager 6 months ago. My wife &amp; I moved to a new city for the job(which we were going to do regardless), fully funded ourselves. 

My wife’s older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer about a year ago. For awhile, things looked ok - she was starting treatment, and even showed slight signs of improvement. We felt comfortable moving because we were only a 3 hour drive away and could visit on weekends. Shortly after we actually moved, we found out her cancer was terminal. Just in the past 2 or so months, the doctors have said that hospice care is in the near future.

My wife wants to move home for her sister, her nieces, and her father during this time. I don’t want to, and won’t, stand in the way of that. Nothing is more important than family, especially now. 

However, I’m anxious to approach this at work. I’m not crazy about this job anyway - I find I’m in over my head and stressed out with it, regardless of the family piece. I would offer to stay on remotely, but realistically the nature of the role would make that almost impossible without me commuting in at least once a week and staying overnight (at least I imagine).

Anyone been in a similar situation? I know I need to be a grown up here, I just feel guilty for leaving so quickly. My wife and family wins every time but I guess I’m just looking for some encouragement to do this."

I have an interview for the external position next week. I've been assured that I'll be interviewing for the internal role too, but they're further behind in the hiring process.
Ideally, I'd have all the necessary information about both jobs and whether I'd be a fit for the roles, but it isn't looking like the timelines will align. 
If I'm successful in moving forward in the interview process with the external role, at what point should I loop in my current employer? Since they know I'm looking for a new job, is it more reasonable to keep them up to date on the application process?"

I work from home with guaranteed 40 hours a week and my shift is 8-4:30 M-F. Its customer service which sucks (due to rude customers sorta like call center) and ultimately made me hate my job. I did ask for a new position a few weeks ago but was asked to wait due to working on a project. Few weeks later, we were told that our project would be extended and possibly a new department so my manager never mentioned me changing positions again. I got hired for another job which is per diem and i will work 30-40 a week with no benefits. Plus the cons for that job is not having a set 40 hours a week and transportation. They did tell me eventually i can become full time or part time. I was set to leave my job with tomorrow being the last day of my two week notice but then they pulled me into a meeting before my shift ended to discuss why i wanted to leave and offered to help me apply to another position in the company where I can make more and no have to speak to customers at all. I would stay with them but only if they guarantee me that position. 

How could I make sure they give me that position and do you guys believed it? I never hated the company just the rude customers. At the same time, I don’t want to be screwed over."

My career so far has a bit sporadic. I received my B.A. in Communications, and then started working as a product specialist in the building materials industry. Worked there for 1.5 years and then got a job as a project manager at a bank, where I worked for another 1.5 years. I burned myself out, and left to work as a carpenter for a year. About 6 months ago, I was offered another project management job in the construction industry where I’ve currently at.

However, due to some family health issues, my wife and I are really considering moving back home. I can’t take my job with me, and to be honest, this second go-around with project management has me feeling like it’s really not the fit for me. I’d like to explore some other (preferably remote capable) industries that pay above $50k/year that I can get into on the entry level.

Any input appreciated. I’m aware my career has been a case study in job hopping, but I’m really trying to put a focus on exploring new industries to find out what I’d like to do long term. That’s very dependent on my personal interest, I know, but just hoping for some general ideas. Thanks!"
9,2022-10-05,Out of work for 8 months. I am very discouraged and demotivated.,u/Extension_Laugh4128,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xwo5b9/out_of_work_for_8_months_i_am_very_discouraged/,jobs,"Hi not sure if this is the right subreddit.  I need advice or encouragement.
Background: I, 22 have 1st Class in Biochemistry. I graduated in 2021. Afterwards I worked in a mega lab processing COVID-19 samples for 6 months before I was made redundant in March. From then I have actively pursuing interviews, using the careers service from my university, refining my CV and cover letter. And to be completely honest I'm at my wits end. I sent so many applications that I've honestly lost tracked But it's definitely easily in the 60 range.

I've been getting roughly of 1-2 interview per month at very good companies (Oxford Nanopore, Evotec, Illumina, University of Cambridge, Avator, GSK, Immunocore, Oxford Immunotec, Thames Water etc) And I get passed with the first interview stage, and during the second/third stage interview I usually prepare very well. As I've studied the job description along with the associated techniques and soft skills that are required in that job description. But not getting an answer or being rejected without explaining why I have not gotten the position is slowly making me lose iy and made me feel slightly depressed at times. Each application proceeds in the same way. I do a phone/video screen, they tell me there are still 2-3 rounds of interviews, I move on to the next round, I speak to someone, seems to be going well for me. I can't figure out exactly what I'm doing wrong. I'm not sure it's because of the way I speak (As I speak formally. And if I explain a idea Although it may take a bit of time to explain it I.e a maximum of two-three minutes the panel understood the concept/ I might stumble across my words. But this is something them actively trying to address). So I don't know what more can change.  I understand that I don't have an extensive employment history, which makes it harder to compete against the competition. I was considering going back to university or do volunteering but the problem of volunteering, for example, is that puts me in the worser financial position  And I cannot afford to work for free. I've also considered going back to university, but it also has its own issues in regards to do my Masters degree regarding my financial situation I am in and delaying the Inevitable.
 
Currently right now I'm living with my parents. And the ominous aspect of going through all of this during my early 20s is that. If I was suddenly unemployed in the future I'm not sure how I'm going to cope.

Any advice or encouragement is appreciated."

Each job application is a success of its own right.",u/otrtfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xwpsmr/to_anyone_feeling_isolated_embarrassed_or/,jobs,"The past months of job searching have been one of the hardest things I've ever done, and left me feeling isolated in ways I never could have imagined. My routine, social life, and sense of self-worth and stability are all suffering. I'm scared to even tell people where I am applying or get excited about opportunities because it always seems to turn into a letdown. Older adults or peers who are in industries where finding a job is easier seem to have a look of disappointment or confusion when I tell them how many places I have applied. 

Holding on to hope that it will work out and reminding myself of my strengths feels like clawing my way out of a growing void - each time I do it, it gets harder. I was rejected from a last resort temporary position, which I joked would be my final straw as an adult with a college degree and a year of full time experience. But it happened. 

And this morning, I kept applying to jobs. I kept feeling excited about positions that sounded interesting to me and that I truly believe would be a good fit for me. Right now, that is my win.

So to anyone who is feeling similarly, please know that you are not alone. Staying confident in your self-worth takes strength, and simply continuing with the process can be a victory in and of itself.

1,2022-10-05,"Hourly employee told to write hours in employment contract on time sheet, rather than actual hours worked — is this okay?",u/recalcitramp,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xwtbqv/hourly_employee_told_to_write_hours_in_employment/,jobs,"A coworker spoke with me today about some confusion over what to write on their time sheet. They are an hourly employee with an employment contract that states the specific hours they are required to work.

A somewhat strange hiccup at the job has put them temporarily working a position not stated in their contract — a position usually filled by salaried employees. So their question was very reasonable: *do I write down the time I actually finish work and leave, or do I just write down the hours stated in my original employment contract?*

I just found out their supervisor, someone I work with every day, has told them in the past to write down the hours stated in their employment contract, ""even if you come in early some days or stay a little late.""

Part of my own job is to act as a sort of liaison between administrative (""higher up"") and other employees. I've heard this same supervisor tell a different employee to ""write down the exact time you come in, and the exact time you leave.""

So, since I found this whole ordeal wildly confusing, I spoke with the owner of the business to seek some clarification for my coworker (keeping them anonymous, I wanted the person who reached out to me to maintain their privacy). The owner confirmed that ""they need to write down the hours stated in their employment contract, and not the hours they worked — the contract means we expect them to be able to finish their work within the allotted time, and if they have to come in early or stay late to do that, it's considered on their own time, and is a 'performance review' issue.""

Mind, this coworker is HOURLY, not in a salaried position.

**Here's the tricky part:** this employee, due to filling in for a position that is NOT in their original employment contract, is sometimes *obligated to stay late due to reasons beyond their control.* That's why this position is usually filled by salaried employees — the exact ""clock out"" time can vary. Not by a lot, but sometimes 15 - 30 minutes. ""Beyond their control"" isn't *oh I wasn't fast enough and didn't finish everything that needs to get done*, but more like *I have to wait for someone else before I'm allowed to leave my posting.*

**TL;DR:** An hourly employee, who is temporarily filing in for what is usually a salaried position, has been told to write down the hours they're ""supposed"" to work on their time sheet, instead of the actual hours that they're working.

Is this okay? Should I be pushing to get my hourly coworker an accurate wage for this temporary switch in work duties?"

It is not about the money, I genuinely love software development so much, I would even do it for free! That is how dedicated I am to working in programming. I learned to program in High school and I've been doing so through college. I've just graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and no one since then want to hire me.

Here is my story:

I have been very unlucky when it comes to getting a job. I applied for internships in my Junior year and I was able to get a few test assessments and interviews. As I am approaching my final interviews, I got Covid and had to cancel all my interviews. It took a while for me to recover and by then, all of the positions were taken. A applied again and got a few test assessments and interviews and boom, a personal emergency and I had to reschedule the interviews again. Those positions were soon taken.

I didn't get a single internship in Junior year so I decided to try harder for Senior year. I was going to study abroad and I have an internship offer from the UK. I applied for my student visa and waited. Nothing. I waited even longer. Nothing! I started contacting UK Immigration and they told me it was processing. Nothing! University in the UK has already started and I am still in my country waiting for the Visa. Nothing! Then my internship was canceled on me because my visa didn't arrive on time. A day later I got my visa approved. AFTER 2 MONTHS of waiting! Talk about sheer luck, all of my classmates got their visas within 15 days, for some reason mine took 2 months. I filled everything out correctly, I am not sure why mine took so long.

Now, I came back and just graduated with no internship experience, but still passionate about software development. Sent out hundreds of applications (with personalized cover letters) in these 4 months and little to no response. I feel so disappointed in myself, I really want to be a software developer, but not having any recruiters give me a chance to work for them (even for free) has been weighing on me. I feel like I don't belong in this position and my dream career has died even before it started. I feel very depressed and these few months have been my darkest. With the recession looming overhead and companies doing a hiring freeze, I feel like that is the nail in the coffin for my dream job.

Please give me some encouragement, tell me that everything is ok, because I am about to give up at this point :("

But ultimately it was kind of a dead end position with nowhere to go beyond where I was.

So after working there 4.5 years, I ended up taking a job in sales which paid significantly more and promised a lot that my old job didn't. Now I've been there about 4 months, and I just absolutely hate it there. I've had two different managers leave the company in that short time, the job expectations are just progressively shadier to the point of feeling like scams, management is constantly just throwing things at the wall to see what sticks and then blaming the employees when it doesn't work. 

So now I'm trying to find other work, and I'm at the point where I don't even care if it pays less than what I make here just so I can work somewhere that isn't such an awful workplace. But I'm hesitant if I should put this recent job on my resume. I've been there four months, so I guess maybe I could lie and say I've been at my old job this whole time? Or would it be better to include it on my resume, even though I feel like it makes me look skittish?"

I’m not being paranoid, as the place I’m working at has been known to follow former employees after they’ve left and call their new employers to talk whatever crap they want.

How does it look to potential employers if this happens? Do they take it seriously if it’s not from a reference? Might be a stupid question, but I’m getting pretty anxious over this."

I was fired during probationary period - the conversation happened so quickly, the envelope was handed to me almost instantly that i didn't even have the option to ask if i could resign.

How does this affect my background checks - i was under the impression employers only really give dates and status 'hireable/not hireable' but i just realised that being terminated during probation is most likely flagged under 'not hireable', right?  Unfortunately this final meeting HR was not present, just my manager and boss.  i've tried contacting the company but HR can only really be contacted via an internal ticket, once you're out, its very hard.

does anyone know?  I'm really freaking out.  As i'm sure you've guessed, i've fired off some Resumes and likely will get some calls, due to my experience but to think i'll be declined at that final stage would be embarrassing and will pretty much bar me from applying to those companies.

2,2022-10-06,"I got terminated without prior warning. How should i psychologically handle this, and my upcoming interviews?",u/CrazyTiger9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xx6ngp/i_got_terminated_without_prior_warning_how_should/,jobs,"**Context**:

I was hired by an IT company a year ago (a fully remote position).

Initially, there were impressed by my DevOps skills since I love working with server administration and cloud providers (even though I filled a different position). After discussions with the technical lead of my team, I would be working on related projects so I could use my skills in practice.

In my first months, I advised my managers that the company needed to be the ""go-to"" solution in our business field. For that to happen, we need to place our company link to already famous and established open-source-based software companies because this creates brand awareness that will bring customers in the long run. I offered myself to gladly lead the way because I know how to work with the specific software and make the appropriate integration (DevOps-related job).They didn't seem to care about making this happen...

This lasted for only 3-4 months. After that, I mainly worked on updating existing content and generally on Gitlab issues that were not challenging my skills. Simply put, it was boring, and I felt I was wasting my skills.

In the summer, I had a discussion with my technical lead and the head of department, and I told them about my concerns. Still, they replied that there is no workload for ""devopsy"" issues, and I should concentrate on anything else that is currently in my queue.

I was not happy anymore with what I was working on. I didn't have that spark that initially existed.

In the August, I had quite a few problems to resolve, silly arguments with my girlfriend, house repairs, and generally personal issues that negatively affected my performance.

My manager noticed that I was working fewer hours than before and reached out to me, asking what was going on. I told him what was happening (he thought I was going to quit and said they needed me), and we arranged to talk.

He was away the day we were supposed to talk, and we booked a meeting for the next week.

The bad thing is that the meeting we had seemed kind of aggressive (but I'm not sure because it was morning and he might still be sleepy, but his way of reacting was like he caught his girlfriend cheating and didn't want to hear any excuses, and basically he didn't want to work on solving the problem) and told me there was a decision to terminate my contract.

My contract clearly states that after 90 days of employment, any party should give 30 days of notice.

I never received any email from management or HR that they would cancel my contract if my performance would not improve. That lack of transparency totally turned me off because they were talking behind my back without telling me what was happening.

The funny thing is that while I was working for the said company, I received interview invitations from other companies (some very popular in IT) with 2.5x times the money I was already making.

I also noticed an increasing number of engineers left the company especially from my department (bad people's management perhaps?) that made me believe that something is off.

At the moment, I feel very bad psychologically, and I want to concentrate on my next job hunting, where I will apply for the last interview offer I received 1 month ago, where I see the position is still open.

What is your opinion about this, and how should I move forward for my following job interview?

Thank you, everyone, in advance.

I really had to speak this out to relieve some burden."
1,2022-10-06,Recruiter terrible with email responses on a job I was referred to…what are my options?,u/ETPHNHM,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xx6u2w/recruiter_terrible_with_email_responses_on_a_job/,jobs,"So here’s the story: I applied to a job online because a soon-to-be hiring manager asked me to consider it. I did. Soon after, I got an email from the talent acquisition/recruiter asking me to have a chat.  She spelled my name wrong in this email and you know what, that happens….but I’ll let you know why this is starting to bug me now. I got back to her with a few availabilities.

Well, a whole weekend passed by and she didn’t respond. So I followed up on a Monday with a friendly hey, let me now if any of these times work. I also suggested, alternatively, if she has preferred times, I’d be happy to coordinate logistics.

Well, no response. So two days later, I followed up again.  She immediately responded, thanking me for following up, and said she’ll schedule around me. Well, I reiterated some of the times that worked for me and if she has anything available. Now she has gone silent.

I know people’s schedules get so busy, so I’m trying not to hold this against her. But…
1.  I had to follow up multiple times for her to even acknowledge.
2. This position was an internal referral, so while that alone does not mean I am qualified, I thought this would count for something? 
3. She got my name wrong. Adding to everything else, this is completely unprofessional. 

I’m trying to think of why this person would be delaying a call.
1.  Maybe she really is busy.
2. Maybe they already have a preferred candidate (but then why not tell me?)
3. Maybe her foot is out the door.

Based on her LinkedIn, I can’t tell that she lacks experience, but certainly is not the best recruiter I have ever worked with. Either way, I don’t want to sit and do nothing and possibly miss a chance at a great opportunity. Any advice?

Thanks in advance!"

5,2022-10-06,I'm a soon-to-be unemployed Ph.D. grad in a dead-end contract job and my network isn't helping. What do I do and how to cope?,u/chungusalert,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xx9uri/im_a_soontobe_unemployed_phd_grad_in_a_deadend/,jobs,"Using a throwaway for anonymity

**TL;DR: I'm a recent Ph.D. grad with a dead-end contract job and my network isn't helping me find a new one. What should I do to land a job before I end up unemployed in January, and how do I cope with the depression that comes with the search?**

I got a Ph.D. in May from the top school in my field. I've been a contractor for about a year at a large company doing the kind of research I did for my degree. I hoped to stay here and be converted to full-time, but they've been stringing me along and don't seem to have any intent to hire me given company layoffs and the recession. So it looks like come January 1st, I will probably be unemployed. 

Moreover, my network either doesn't have the resources to get my foot in the door somewhere or doesn't seem to care. For example, at some places where I have a connection I've been told to apply online, where my application gets sent to a black hole and I never hear back. At other places there isn't a solid referral process, so my connections have tried to put in a good word for me with no response. Plus some places my connections work at have hiring freezes with no signs of ending. On top of this, my Ph.D. advisor, who I assumed would care where I land, refuses to connect me with any of the many people she knows outside of academia unless I have already applied for a job in the specific area of the company they work at (and she won't tell me who any of them are, so I don't know where they work). Therefore, since there are few open jobs that fit with my background and experience, she hasn't helped. Finally, people keep telling me to cold-reach out to new people on LinkedIn, but understandably, nobody ever responds (even if we have a mutual connection, I'm still a stranger to them).

I've been told there's nothing wrong with my resume or interviewing - last year, I applied for about 15 jobs before I landed my contract role and had several offers. I feel like an idiot for choosing the contract role over those (though it paid better), and now it seems like nobody wants to hire this year because of the economy. My Ph.D. feels like a waste too. Plus I've been feeling so depressed and worthless during this search.

So where do I go from here? Is there a way I can get my network to help more? Should I accept the reality of potentially being unemployed long-term? How do I deal with the depression that comes with the job search? Any advice, info, commiseration, etc. is welcome!"

How would you respond? I'm open to hearing about other opportunities, but I also want them to know that it would take a lot for me to leave my current position. I don't want them to think that ""Yes, I'm definitely looking for a new job"" but I'm also open to hearing about the position.

Am I overthinking how to respond?"

45,2022-10-06,Which job site did you have the best luck on? +my job search stats,u/Cheap-Safe,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xxdgx7/which_job_site_did_you_have_the_best_luck_on_my/,jobs,"Long story short, I got a job from a company that found me on LinkedIn and sent me a letter in the mail. 

Job search details (in depth I guess):

Indeed:
421 applications sent, 7 “interviews” (2 scam interviews and 3 that were actually sales webinars where they were trying to hire everyone they could find instead of performing actual interviews)

ZipRecruiter:
197 application sent. A billion emails from recruiters, spoke on the phone to around 15 of them and they all said they’d endorse me for a position with the company. Only spoke with actual hiring managers for around 8 interviews. Got 5 job offers, but declined them due to weird contract terms and conflicting information between job posting, recruiters, and hiring managers. Realized that I’d have better luck on ZipRecruiter than Indeed, but also realized that I’m just gonna have to work harder and smarter since some of these recruiters are being dishonest. 

LinkedIn:
So then I moved to LinkedIn because of recommendations from a post I made here on Reddit. I filled out all of my info and searched for jobs on there for a couple weeks. Sent my resume to maybe 30 positions. Had multiple great interviews, but I didn’t accept any offers. Only good thing that came out of the interviews was the networking. There were a few people that were interested in my qualification, certifications, and what I currently specialize in….so there was some unplanned successful networking that happened. There was one position I really wanted to accept, but the company only paid in commissions and I was looking for hourly+comms. This company’s CEO eventually called me back two weeks later and said that he’d offer me hourly+comms because he listened to my recorded interview and really liked me. I actually couldn’t accept his offer because I had already accepted an offer from a different company just the day before. And get this…I didn’t even apply to the position I accepted. They found me on LinkedIn, then sent me a letter in the mail. 

My LinkedIn experience:
Jobs and recruiters are more trustworthy here. Higher positions available. Seems like recruiters and hiring managers are able to focus more on one person with LinkedIn compared to the other sites where it seems as if they interview 200 applicants a day even if they don’t have the correct qualifications. Better chance at finding a job that actually cares about you and your contributions rather than a job that just wants another robot to help with the workload."

And today just walking in I felt like a ball of nerves and anxiety like I was going to have a fit again. I’m embarrassed to quit because I know that I can learn so much from my manager and working here. Plus, I set up meetings to introduce myself to coworkers in my department. But I just can’t take it anymore. I wish I relaxed in finding a job and just did retail for a year. I’m going to talk to my manager tomorrow about quitting.

Help!,u/demonharu16,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xxgjfp/work_environment_incites_flightfightfreeze/,jobs,"I have been with my current employer for several years now. It's a very small family-owned business (I'm not related). During my tenure, I've heard screaming matches and witnessed tantrums, found out that the boss wanted to lay off the entire office at one point (near the holidays, no less), and have been around the general dysfunction of this family. For the first few years, I didn't work closely with the head boss. But then I noticed how often my coworkers would mention his moods, and how they would tiptoe around him. I didn't realize how bad it was until I saw firsthand the micromanaging (think him sitting over someone's shoulder for hours literally watching them do their job) or when I witnessed the condescending and negative ways he's speaks to everyone. One coworker admitted he was getting panic attacks as a result of the stress. The few times he shows any semblance of self awareness it's been followed up with finger pointing. The other family member deals with this behavior by walking on eggshells or taking it out on others. The boss will literally go in and berate that member constantly. I overheard that person the other day mention that the boss will do that daily in 6-8 week cycles. This person was happy he wasn't coming into her office to do that lately, even though she just got belittled in a meeting that same day in front of everyone. I was in absolute disbelief. While I'm attempting to get certs and look for work, I'm feeling utterly stuck. I get super anxious on the days I have to be in the office and even more so when I'm in the same room with them. I turn my camera off, stay muted, rarely speak, and will sit as far away as possible. I know it's immature, but I'm so deeply uncomfortable that I'm not sure what else to do. I also feel pure anger at the way they communicate as I dislike when someone is being disrespectful to another. I've tried to share my feelings with my immediate supervisor (same one that walks on eggshells) but wasn't taken to heart. I'm at a loss for how to handle this as I don't like to stew in anxiety and anger all day, but am aware they won't change. We've also had a low level job empty for well over a year and they've been dumping those duties on me with no compensation or plans to fill that gap. They'll wonder why I'm backed up. I've been hearing that the boss has been talking about my work to other people. He wants to change things, communicates zero of this to me, and has been pissy I'm not a mind reader. Sorry for the rant and ramble. Any help in handling this would be super appreciated. I'm not great at confrontation. I had worked remotely during the pandemic and loved it. Now I'm back in the office part time and I had to really push to get an extra day added. Should I push for 100% remote or say I'm doing it and just deal?"

I showed up, the employer asked some basic questions. Asked about the pay and then had me meet her partner. I was given a job application to fill in case I decided to accept and told them I would complete it if I decided to accept the offer. In total there were only 3 people in the office, the receptionist, the boss and her partner. I tried to research the company and although it shows up online, there’s not a lot of information about it. The address and actual location of the office is completely different from the one on the website. The company has apparently been open since 2018 and shows a different address but based on the look of the company it seems like it was recently opened.  Am I just being paranoid?"

I’m struggling with some mental problems and have very low self esteem and has gotten hired up as a waitress at an old folks home after having worked at mc Donald’s (management bullied me) but I am stressing to much at this job.

I’m very good at it I get everything done I’m clean and the customers love me and no one can see why I physically can’t do it.

Everyone’s telling me there is no job I’ll find comfortable I was thinking writing at home but that doesn’t make much money does anyone have any ideas?

I love animals, cleaning, stocking, cooking, writing, news, I am a performer as well never much public stuff except a few school plays."
3,2022-10-06,Spent the last 2 years being self-employed and now its hurting me in a background check,u/CarlosChampion,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xxkm7h/spent_the_last_2_years_being_selfemployed_and_now/,jobs,"I'm looking for some advice, and please don't rip me apart too hard I'm really stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 12 month contract offer at a large investment firm, and I despererly need this job. I put down self-employed for some of 2020 and all of 2021. When in reality I was working under the table for my in laws. I was barely working, still figuring some stuff out, didn't earn a lot, and worked very inconsistently.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today and I am supposed to start this new job on the 24th. I'm really excited for it. This is really going to turn my life around. I get an email today asking for either 1099's or Schedule C's in order to verify my employment.  


for 2020 I filed taxes, but did not include the $900 I made working for my in laws. and in 2021 I probably made under $20k (barely working I was really depressed at the time). Never filed taxes for 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

What are my options here. How do I make this right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm gonna have to file a modification to my 2020 taxes, with a Schedule C and then pay the amount owed. And I'm thinking about filing taxes for 2021 now, but I'm not sure what they are looking for in my background check. Could I get away with just filling out a Schedule C. I'm thinking they are able to crossreference with the IRS database.

 I don't mind filing my taxes. really not trying to avoid them, I'm just coming from desperation here, and I don't know the way forward"

I’m 20F, currently working as a hostess at a restaurant. This is my first time working in the food industry. The hiring manager was fine with it and willing to give me a chance. 

My Front of House coworkers are extremely friendly and helpful. I love hosting. However, I’ve been assigned food running and kitchen shifts. I wasn’t told this when I was first hired and was nervous because like I said, no prior experience, and it’s a very busy restaurant. Hiring manager assured me that I would be trained properly and scheduled for food running only when necessary, like once a week.

The issue is they’re..not doing that, nor have I been trained. They sent me to work a food running shift and I basically just spent the entire shift copying whatever my coworker did. The chef is an aggressive man who yelled at my coworker for my mess ups and then said “don’t worry, I’ll yell at you when you run out of excuses.”

I basically just sucked it up because I was mainly still hosting. Now I check my schedule and it’s pretty much all food running shifts. I get it, but I didn’t sign up for this nor am I trained. The kitchen staff regularly berates me. One of the chefs yelled at me for holding a plate a certain way and only stopped when a male server intervened. Another cook made a comment about how “pretty women don’t know how to do anything right”.

This leads to my main issue. The male staff are very passive aggressive. Managers regularly comment on my appearance. One of the bartenders said “(MALE MANAGER) will never fire you because of how you look, so get out while you still can.” Another supervisor who I get along with well is leaving and basically warned me to do the same. 

All in all, I don’t think this is the right fit for me. I’m just not doing the job I was hired for, and quite frankly I feel anxious each time I go to work. I’ve got burns on my hands and I’m sick of being demeaned because I’m a young woman. One coworker flat out told me I should stick to being pretty and find a husband when he learned I’m in a tough uni program. 

I just want to quit. I don’t need this as a reference because I have plenty of other work experience. I don’t want to deal with two more weeks of this, but I’m dreading having to pick up my last cheque after quitting on the spot. Just feel really defeated. Any advice is appreciated."

I did this interview the 2nd week of September, and the hiring manager said ""well I'd love to bring you on""... which I'm assuming means that I'm being offered the job, though I'm really not sure lol.

So the manager advised me that the building will be open to the public come December, that employees will begin training in November, and that offer letters will go out in October. At the time of the interview, he said I should expect to hear back in about 4 weeks, which will be exactly 4 weeks this upcoming Tuesday. I already reached out once, about a week after interviewing to send a thank you letter, and I'm 'looking forward to the opportunity and all that, I didn't get a response and wasn't expecting to. We also connected on LinkedIn last week.

I'm wondering if should I reach out again at that 4-week mark to follow up, or should I wait til say the end of next week to follow up? And from the ""love to bring you on"" comment should I even worry about it? I have been off work since July due to an injury, and I actually really want this job. But given that I haven't received communications, I'm trying to figure out if I should keep applying to jobs or if that is a waste of time and if I should just be patient about receiving the next steps.

0,2022-10-07,Do you think it's safe to work in Web3 full time?,u/opposite_sending,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xxt3pf/do_you_think_its_safe_to_work_in_web3_full_time/,jobs,"Crypto jobs are quite undersupplied, because of the existing talent gap, there is less competition and higher pay at both large corporations like Meta, Coinbase, OpenSea, and small and mid-sized businesses. However, at this stage, I'm more likely to consider freelancers instead of full-time, here is why:

(ngl I’m also wary about the red flags I saw in the crypto market, that’s why I won’t put all of my eggs in one basket)

**Immediate loss of income if full-time job vanish overnight**

Scam projects frighten not only investors, but also employees. What if I work for a Web3 company that fails eventually, and the founders even flee with golden parachutes made of all the money they received from unsuspecting investors? Full-time literally means all-in. When a project fails, it equals unemployment and more terribly, arrears of wages.

**Inflexible schedule**

Everything fixed may mean “stable” for people who work in traditional fields. However for web3 creators it means less flexibility and opportunities. My inspiration is usually strongest at night, if I have a fixed 9-6 schedule, I find it difficult to come up with creative ideas. As designers, we frequently work on a project-by-project basis, the more productive you are, the more work you get. However, if you only work for one company, opportunities are much more limited.

**Less creative and fulfilling work**

Full-time in-house designers are always working for the same project with the similar branding and style, unless they’re working on rebranding, otherwise designing more or less the same stuff can be boring. That’s why I started to look at some Web3 freelance marketplaces like Layer3 and CreatorDAO. Among the dazzling platforms, I'm on the fence about an unlaunched marketplace called 3D Creator DAO in ChapterX world. Obviously, the word ""3D"" drew me in because I learnt 3D animation in school, and I'm assuming higher salaries and more opportunities in the future.

Would you prefer freelance or full-time in the Web3 space? Feel free to recommend any recruitment platforms you find useful."

Just not sure if it comes off as looking like I am lying about it which is why il fumbling. 

I think the rest of the interview went well though because overall I did show enthusiasm and went on to ask a lot of questions because im genuinely interested."

The first interview was a technical one, I have been asked about my knowledges and degrees. At the end of the meeting the recruiter (possibly future manager) told me that I have a very good profile and that our ways of thinking match pretty well. He told that he wants me in his team, and that he would reach the HR team right after for me to be interviewed a second time. He also told me that given the fact that I will work with him and not the HR team, I should have no problem at all succeeding this second interview.

From what he said, I thought I would get a call or an email during the day following the interview, but as of today I got no news. I'm stressed because I really need this job. I am scared that someone changes his mind about me.

Do I have the job? Given that my ""future"" manager loved my resume and my profile but I still have to be interviewed by the HR team.

How long do I have to wait to receive a call/email from the HR team?

Thank you!"

Then; the next day I get an email from the interviewer saying she’s going to contact my references and if it’s okay if she can contact my current boss and if my current boss knows I’m applying to jobs. 

I honestly don’t remember that I put my current boss as a reference so ..I ask a few people what to respond to this. 

A family member told me to just say yes ? And that my boss will understand. My boss is a very nice lady but..I actually didn’t tell that I applied to other jobs. And so I thought it would be weird if she randomly received a call from a prospective employer asking about me? 

So, I email the lady back saying that I actually haven’t told my boss yet, and I that I’m worried it could affect my current standing at work and I would feel more comfortable if she contacted my boss if an offer had been made. 

She emailed me back the next day saying “No problem, I understand” that’s it. Now I’m freaking out bc she hasn’t emailed me after that? Did I respond with the wrong thing? Was she expecting me to just say yes? Will this affect her decision to offer me the job?"

My most notable careers are as an IT helpdesk professional for a hospital and as a realtor. I’m 21 years old so I’m very proud of these accomplishments.

However, I live in a pretty rural area and didn’t consider this before getting my real estate license so now I’m looking to relocate to a different state with a bigger population. I have a place picked but I need a career that can give me the funds to move.

I didn’t enjoy my IT job at all, but I’ve been considering getting a salesforce certification and seeing how that plays out. I don’t have a degree so certifications are what I’m leaning towards. I just really need a career that makes a decent income. Enough to pay the bill and help me save for my move.

I know I’m young and I’m not supposed to have my life figured out but if you all know any better career paths or certifications it would really help me out. I’m just looking for something somewhat enjoyable or at least bearable that can help me make the money I need. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I start a new job in 2 weeks but I don’t know if to put in time for PTO before I put in my 2 weeks notice or not. Of course they require PTO to be put in 2 weeks in advance as well.

Has anyone put in PTO and just quit after or resigned and said forget the PTO?? I don’t know what to do

11,2022-10-07,A job that I was passionate about was taken from me and now I don’t know how to regain that passion,u/bruceclaymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xy61qv/a_job_that_i_was_passionate_about_was_taken_from/,jobs,"I had a great job one year ago in an industry I was passionate about being a part of and had been a part of for 5 years.  It was in the entertainment industry and while the hours were hectic, I was able to maintain a good work life balance.  I built up a great staff and we felt like more than a family than coworkers; I had their backs and they had mine.  Our revenues consistently exceeded targets, staff were engaged, guests were happy.

After a few months I was passed over for a promotion that I was more than qualified for by an individual who was hired from the outside because he was buddies with a client of ours.  This was the most open and egregious case of “it’s not what you know it’s who you know” as this man had never worked in this specific industry, though his prior experience was “adjacent” to what we did.

My new boss and I came to an agreement that basically I would run the operation as it had been run and he would be the “face” for this client.  This lasted about 6 months as he was not able to ingratiate himself to our staff.  He never took the time to learn the business, staff names, or how the business operated.  He came in late, left early, frequent smoke breaks, etc.  He wasn’t present except for his friend who got him the job.  I was still running the business, but making less money than him, longer hours, and more involved.  He started showing resentment when others would not talk to him and only come to me; it wasn’t my fault as he made no attempt to make connections.

After 8 months he presents me with a “final warning” for poor behavior with made up stories about attendance and attitude; nothing which was addressed until this moment.  It was disheartening.  I was angry, furious.  I had given my all to this place and had him come in and take my operation from me and now tell me what I was doing wrong.  I took this as a chance to just sever ties with this location and look for something else.  

I found a job in another state that was a promotion.  The problem is my wife and children miss our old home (which we hadn’t sold the house yet) and I find myself not being anywhere close to as passionate as I was about my previous job.  My coworkers at this new place are amazing and great at what they do; I just don’t connect with them.  I want to move back but there’s nowhere that is hiring for the industry I miss being in.  Part of me doesn’t want to go back to that industry at all because of the hours required and I want to spend more time with family.

My current and former jobs are in hospitality, an industry I know a lot of people are fleeing.  If I’m not going to be passionate any more and just there for a paycheck, I might as well get decent hours and pay so I can support and spend time with my family.  I’m just trying to find that job right now."

I  have been waiting for an update and kept refreshing my email and their website for any updates and then I noticed it was updated yesterday with this \*the picture I posted\*

&amp;#x200B;

What gets me is this part - 

"" We appreciate your understanding as we take the time to consider and evaluate you and the other qualified applicants for the role. You will be contacted as soon as the recruiter has an update regarding your interview. ""

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if I should worry about that or not. Maybe I am overthinking it as during the interview process they did mentioned that training class starts next month so I am thinking they are just trying to get a class together. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be frank, the part that has me worried is my pay demand. I mentioned I requested a certain amount that I know is a bit higher than normal but expressed that due to my experience I would like that amount however I did mention I am willing to negotiate. I would not mind something slightly lower than what I am making now.

12,2022-10-07,12 Linked in Algorithm Hacks to get more offers,u/xRayox,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xy7etb/12_linked_in_algorithm_hacks_to_get_more_offers/,jobs," 

1. **Company Connections:**

Linked In Recruiter Solutions ranks candidates relevancy by how many if any connections the candidate has with the hiring company

**2. Keywords in Expirience section**

ATS systems do this on CV's, so does LinkedIn with jobs. Say you've got the keyword ""Javascript"" within the description of a job you held for 3 years. Your skill of Javascript is now weighted MUCH higher than if you had just listed it as a skill. Inject keywords in long time frame jobs.

**3. Skill Endorsements**

Listed skills in the ""Skills"" section carry no weight at all. However, if you get endorsed, specially by someone who has been endorsed themselves at the skill, carries A LOT of weight. Ask around for endorsements.

**4. Engage with brand content**

Linked In Recruiter Solutions ranks candidates relevancy also by if they follow the hiring company's page or if they have engaged ( liked, commented) on their posts

**5. Keywords everywhere**

Go watch any tutorial on how to use Linked in Recruiter solutions. Most of the time is spent on ""Boolean searches"". The boolean search funciton scans your profiles for certain keywords. You want to inject this on project descriptions, about me page, Feutured section, Education description. Use hard Skills/industry standard terminology: ""React JS, PHP, Project Manager, Excel Macros, SQL"".

**6. Open to Work**

I know, its obvious, but look at the recruiters dashboard on linked in Talent solutions and it is the MAIN filter. Put the green logo around your face, no shame in that.

**7. Job preferences**

You are open to: On Site, Hybrid, Remote

Willing to do: Full-time, Contractor, Part-time, trainee

It don't matter if it's true, cast a wide a net as possible.

**8. Job location**

Make sure your zipcode is well written, this determines the ""100 miles away from"" filter in recrutiers.

Also, for In site jobs, put cities with a variation of name, say "" London, England"" ""Greater london Area"".

For remote job use COUNTRIES. Jobs are legally bound to a country, so cast a wide a net as possible by typing the whole country and you will catch all remote offers, regardless of what city the recruiter types.

**9. Custom link URL**

If you haven't change your URL to firstname-lastname, this will make you Search Engine Optimized and your profile will appear on google searches when people type your name

**10. What to do if I have no real experience - Henry**

Enough text, go look at it yourself. There is a company that offers free bootcamps that you pay off when you get a job. They have optimized their alumni's profiles for job seeking purposes in arguably the most overmatured field ( web development). Go check the alumnis and you will see people people with no real experience but really good, filled, keyword rich profiles. From \[academic\] ""experience"" to a ton of endorsements, to projects, you will see what to do if you've got no real experience.

**11. Industry standard roles**

Yeah, it's obvious. But always translate your roles, titles and skills to industry standard:

First is good, second is bad.

48,2022-10-07,Feeling emotionally harassed by my bosses after putting in my 2 weeks notice,u/2baked2bake,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xy8597/feeling_emotionally_harassed_by_my_bosses_after/,jobs,"Cue your not-too-uncommon situation where bosses are seemingly retaliating after putting in a notice. 

I put in my 2 weeks this week, which is what’s requested in our employee handbook, though I work in an at-will state in the US. I’ve been here for a few years and really put my heart and soul into this place but unfortunately bad management turned that all around this year. My two bosses are not much better, but better at hiding it. Manipulation and gaslighting is the name of their game. 

Despite the toxicity, I found my flow and I’m the top performing employee. Patiently waited 2 years for another raise, and when I brought it up with examples of why I deserve it, they swept it under the rug and told me I don’t do all these things. That’s when I woke up and realized my long-term is not here. 

Found a great new job, fully remote, better pay, with way better benefits and a career step up with a path ahead. Put in my 2 weeks as soon as everything was official. My bosses did not take it well. 

They told me I’m disrespectful for giving 2 weeks, and that I should’ve given them 3 months if not at least 6 weeks. I told them I wished I could do more but I at least wanted to abide by the 2 weeks per our handbook. 

Told me I’m dishonest for not telling them I’m interviewing at other companies. 

Told me they built the business around me and how I could dare to do this to them. (This is also news to me)

Over an hour of trying to break me, guilt me, and put me down. Told me I’m going to be miserable and *when* (not if) I am, to let them know. I somehow managed to end on kind of a decent note and then sent my written resignation as well. 

Ever since they’ve been watching me and not looping me in on changes I need to help with, which is fine by me. But it’s not fine that they keep requesting to meet with me just to tell me how screwed they are and 2 weeks is just not enough and I’m not doing it to just them, but to my coworkers too. I once again reiterated I wish I could do more but I’ll do all I can while I’m here. Got scoffed at. 

I said I hope my past years of dedication and hard work are not now being overlooked, and they rolled their eyes. 

I said I want to do my best to help and remain professional and they were taken aback I would say that (?). It’s just a mess. 

I feel like they’re preying on me, and unfortunately for them there are projects they’re depending on me to finish so they can’t just walk me out. I’ve seen so many people come and go and we’re a pretty small company. They’re used to people quitting or them walking employees out on the spot. I haven’t seen a single full-timer put in a notice or leave on good terms. 

I have over a week left of my notice, but I’m not gonna lie, this is really affecting me. I’m so on edge and so disappointed they’d treat me this way. It sucks. 

If they try to ask me for another meeting and still bring these things up, I think I’ll need to let them know I’m not comfortable anymore and am beginning to feel emotional harassed. To either move forward professionally together or clearly document/record our conversations and have a third party witness. I never thought it’d come to this. 

Not really sure what I’m looking for with this post, but I think I needed to just get it off my chest. I’m tired. Please feel free to share any advice or experiences, thank you for reading."

Help!,u/iTheGreek,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xyatfk/over_a_year_and_a_half_and_about_500_applications/,jobs,"Note: I know I am very lucky to have a job and there are others who aren’t as lucky. I’m not looking for sympathy just some advice or help with my situation. 

I’ve decided to post here because I’m at the end of my rope. I’m a 36/M that has been working at his current company for over 7 years. The past 3 years I’ve been a Business Analyst.

During COVID we were work from home and I loved it. Gave me an amazing work/life balance. Gave me time with my two small children and I was able to spend time with my wife. After COVID restrictions ended we were all sent back into office. 

Currently, I have an hour and a half each way in order to get to work. The commute is killing me and I’ve been looking for a WFH job since March 2021. I’ve sent out around 500 or more applications via LinkedIn, Indeed and ZipRecruiter. 

I’ve had my resume redone about 5 times, three of those times by professionals. I’ve had about 7 interviews and no job offers. 

I’m applying for jobs that are well within my scope of expertise. So I’m not sure what or if there is anything else to do other then wait for my luck to change. 

Once I get home I’ll attach my resume. Thanks."

It essentially seems to come down to either having a 3 day weekend or having some days longer while others are shorter.

I'm 7 minutes from work so don't really have to consider that in terms of saving/maximizing time. Also don't have kids."

I am familiar with paycom online . com but I recently tried to apply to a job whose careers site redirected me to paycom online . net. I did not finish my application so I attempted to resume but it noticed that my email is associated with an account (which I did not make when first starting this job’s application) so I assume it noticed my email associated with paycomonline (dot com). 

When I tried to reset my password, the reset email was auto generated by paycomonline (dot com). Does anyone know if paycomonline (dot net) is a different domain used by the same company and legitimate/can be trusted?

It’s not something I’m entirely passionate about doing anymore due to a variety reasons but was easy to fall back into to get out of the job I hated. I was definitely bait and switched a bit and lied to about how many hours I’d get which is super frustrating. 

I want to still keep my options open but also understand this probably would look crazy to a hiring manager. How do I navigate this? I just started a few weeks ago so for now do I just leave it off my resume and make up some excuse as to why I left my last job? I know this all sounds all over the place but also life is too short to not be happy at work so I still want to keep options open for a better fit."

After working there for 3 months I've had around 2 days of training. I shadowed my only coworker in my division for a week before she got tired of me being there. Then I completed online training in a day and one of the training classes another day. I've asked several times but I'm told that I should be more patient. When I reached out to my university manager (not my state social work one) about the research I was told that I may complete a form about that later. 

I really feel like I've given this a chance but I don't think this is a career path I want to pursue further and I'm looking to go back into social Sciences research. I have two interviews coming up and I'm struggling to schedule them with my work schedule as it is.

Not because they tell me too, but because of three reasons:

- The volume of work is quite high. My previous job I would finish projects then have a day or two of very little work. Now its just constant and I'm not used to that mentally.

- People ask me for updates too frequently causing me to mentally tell myself ""I'm not doing enough"" even though I do too much.

- I'm anxious when I just have things ""hanging"". It bothers me alot so I can't stop thinking about it

How do I ""turn it off"" after work and just relax? I have no idea why I'm like this. 

Its getting in the way of my physical and mental health, my relationships, my side hustles, and hobbies. I stress eat from it impacts my health and savings, I do work outside of work instead of working out or hanging out, my back hurts from this shitty chair. I can't let my life waste away lol.

On a side note I am lucky enough to be in a position where I can negotiate and temper expectations in terms of how fast things get done. Anyways what do you recommend?"

I have no one I can really share this with so I am posting it here. I enjoy reading stories on this sub and it was inspiring when I made my first job jump. So here it goes.

Things are feeling extremely surreal, kinda feeling the imposter syndrome vibes a little. I recently accepted an offer for 120% what I was making less than a year ago. I jumped jobs originally from a long term abusive position to where I am currently and it was a much needed switch. I got an office, ran a whole department, learned a new program, flexibility with school, come and go as I pleased. I really loved this job and my team/coworkers. Pay wasn’t that great but I was gaining a ton of experience. Well, I did a resume revision as part of an assignment for school (part time night classes at the university) and thought what the hell and sent it out to a few places. Out of five applications, I heard back from two. I completed 3 rounds of interviews at each (one company being a place I’ve applied to for over a decade with no luck.) All in all it has been about a month of interviews. I accepted an offer last week that is going to change my family’s life. Last year I was making 50k and breaking my back. This year I will be doing something I could have only experienced in a dream. I could cry knowing I will be able to support my family and not be operating in the negative each month. WTF. Just don’t stop."

For one of the jobs I had a 1 hour long conversation with a hiring manager although it was supposed to be for 30 minutes and then he seemed to like me and asked me to check out the shop next week. Today was the day I came to the job site and the hiring manager showed me around the office and the shop. After a 30 minute tour he wanted to talk about the compensation in his office and he asked me” Is 45 /hr ok” out of the blue. I told him I have to think about it although a week ago on the phone I said I’d like to receive the same amount of salary as in 2020. I strongly feel that since then a lot of things rose starting with the gas price ! Say the inflation is 8% since 2020 45/hr doesn’t seem right because that’s what I received in 2020. Btw I have over 10 years of software development experience in the embedded field. Because I have been out of work for almost 2 years (for the last 2 years I had a contracting work and worked for a non profit for a year) I should be happy with this offer but for some reason I’m not so convinced to take the offer. I think it’s partly because in the past I have had 3 to 8 job interviews for one job but for this particular job I only had a casual chat and a shop tour and the hiring manager verbally offered me a job. I guess I’m pretty confused and am not sure… anyways what do you think ?

I go to the doctor semi-regularly, and my blood tests are all average--vitamin levels, thyroid, everything has been fine health-wise. But after work, I have been trying and failing to do much more than taking a brisk walk every day for exercise.  I'm in my mid twenties, and to be honest, I'm really jealous of people my age who are able to go out and be more active socially. I get about 7-9 hours of sleep, and eat as healthy as possible, but it feels like I've hit a wall.

Do you have any tips or advice for staying energized throughout the day? What in your experience has helped?

1,2022-10-08,I (accidentally?) lied in an interview about my current wage. Can they find out I lied through a background/employment check?,u/Euphoric_Low_5518,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xylth7/i_accidentally_lied_in_an_interview_about_my/,jobs,"So I had a phone interview with a recruiter for a big corporate company. This is a new position at this company so I was asked what compensation I would like since they are testing the waters on salaries. I am new to career type interviews and this was the first time I was ever asked this. I didn’t prepare to be asked this question, I just didn’t think of it I guess. I answered the question by saying “I make $xx per hour in my current job. So I would ask for a slight raise if offered this position.” But the number was a lie by $2 more per hour. I lied because I feel like I’m underpaid now and I didn’t want them to think I wasn’t valuable enough to be paid fairly I guess? 

Long story short, I’ve been stressing about it for 24 hours that they will figure out my current wage. I have a 2nd interview next week, I have a lie that I can cook up already to justify what I said. But if they can’t find out I’d rather not bring it up. 

Is this something they can find out through a background/ employment check? I live in California btw."

I don't know what to do in this situation.What makes this worse is that my friend, who is my coworker, was hiding the pay difference from me the whole time. The thing that makes this weird is that, after I texted my boss my question, that ""friend"" right after told other people that they shouldn't have told me about the pay difference.

Hi all!

I am in a little sticky situation here.

I resigned from my current role due to stress/crazy workload and have to serve a 2 months notice.

In the 2 months notice period, I managed to land a role and just signed the offer.

My new employer does not know that I am serving my notice period when I was interviewing with them.

How do you think I should explain it when they eventually finds out via the background checks that my last date of service at my current employer does not match up?"

Overthinking?,u/MrGatsby16,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xys9io/should_i_accept_overthinking/,jobs,"I’ve been working for a MFG company for 3 years as  senior finance member. The company was owned by a European public trading holding company. We were just sold to a private equity company, with the plans to build out a new platform for resale in 4-5 years. 

This seemed like great opportunity for myself, given new company didn’t have a FPA function. It’s been 4 months and it’s been a disaster. New management doesn’t know what they want or how to do anything related to a transaction. My new boss flip flops on answers, on calls says 1 thing and email is different. I struggle is I’m 100% remote and make a good salary (170k assuming salary and bonus). 

I recently was offered a position to create an FPA department at a private held / family run business. 70+ years of business, 400m rev. They offered 210k total comp, with salary raise being 20k more. Benefits are largely equal, as is 401k and PTO. I would have to be in office 2/3 days to start, tapering back to 2/1. It sounds perfect, just nervous that it may hurt future employment (currently 31) that this company isn’t a large public company, and doesn’t have a large name, that it may disqualify me from larger roles later on down road. I think it offers an ability to build a department and function - which is a really exciting. 

Thoughts? Am I over thinking this ?"

How should I handle questions about what I did before 2021?",u/UppityMorlock,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xyu9eu/im_an_older_40s_entrylevel_worker_and_was_out_of/,jobs,"Hi folks,

I have dealt with massive and severe problems with anxiety that prevented me from working for a very long time. Finally I made sufficient enough improvements to be able to finally try to get employment and then I was actually able to find a job and get back to work last year.

I work now with a different company than the one I started with. I'm a new hire and I started about a month ago.

My work has been entirely remote so far.

The company is hosting a major event for all the senior managers - director and VP level - and team leads and rank-and-file 'individual contributors' like myself to meet in person, and gather and 'chat'.

This will be a confusing mix of formal work stuff, semi-formal 'chats' and very informal 'fun' stuff such as hang-outs and leisure activities  and meals together etc.

I WILL be quizzed by both coworkers as well as direct bosses and non-direct bosses about my background in work. I have just one year of work experience now - despite being a lot older.

ALSO - I look way younger than my real age. Plus I even look a lot younger than my LinkedIn pic. So I think that will end up being confusing as well for all the remote bosses and coworkers meeting me in person for the first time.

So how do I handle the inevitable barrage of questioning about what I was doing prior to my one year of work experience?

The company does a background check on all new hires which I of course passed since I have no criminal involvement whatsoever. But my bosses and coworkers will nonetheless be very puzzled and confused about my 'past' and want to know what I was doing before last year.

I was in community college for a while as a part-time student. And that is reflected in my LinkedIn profile as well as what I have discussed about myself at hiring interviews and introductions I have made about myself when I was brand-new. 

But for sure, there will be nosy and inquisitive people, superiors and coworkers alike, wanting to know what the hell I was doing BEFORE 2021 and why I was not working before then, and what all I was up to.

How should I handle this?

One way I have handled this before is to say I was in school and was also working as a caregiver for an ailing relative. It is essentially true - I was indeed a caregiver for an ailing relative - just not at the same time as the anxiety problems that kept me from working.

Also just a couple years before working, I had to have a series of minor surgeries that made it impossible to work anyway.

Is this a good way of giving an answer and deflecting questions when my boss's boss will prod me on my 'background' and work history?"

Due to various circumstances outside my control I found myself in Kazakhstan, having to pretty much start my career from scratch. I have 9 years of experience in PR, from writing and adapting content all the way to strategic planning and leading a team. I’ve worked with multiple markets and fields, and I am fluent in English and am a native Russian speaker. Local job market, however, is pretty small and I might find myself having to move on to another country so I’ve decided to look for remote PR positions. Can you give me any tips on how to find jobs, applying for which won’t be a waste of company time and my time? I know a lot of places will likely turn me down based on citizenship alone, and I know a lot of companies will have a hard time finding my experience relevant, but since the way back is likely lost forever, I am committed to building a career elsewhere.

I’m on day 2 of a 3 day training course and feel utterly overwhelmed. There are SO many forms and steps and procedures to memorise that I’m terrified I won’t be able to learn it quickly enough and will end up losing this once in a lifetime job opportunity.
What do I do? Any advice would be much appreciated!
TL;DR = Landed an amazing job, not in my field, and am terrified I’ll fail and lose it!"

I assumed I wouldn’t hear back, it’s been a little over 2 months. That recruiter just reached out and wants to interview, I’m really considering having an interview because I would like to hear what they have to say, and the job would be a 20k raise. I know I haven’t been offered a position but if I was I’m worried about burning a bridge with this company, but also the higher pay would be great as my wife is pregnant.

And I'm just. so. tired. Especially now as we move into full-bore
election season. The  campaign leadership above me has me working not only every weekday and weekend day, but starting next Saturday, the 15th, I'll be working from our staging location for Get Out The Vote, from 8 am to probably almost 9 pm every Saturday and Sunday, on top of working about 9-6:30 every week day. And then the final four days before the election, it's going to be working 7/8am to 9 pm or later Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues. 

And I've just started moonlighting at a local brewpub one - two days a week to try to make ends meet as well. 

I don't even have the mental or physical energy anymore to knock a single 'nother door, or make another volunteer call. You can make 500 volunteer calls and consider yourself lucky if you get 3 people to volunteer, 2 of whom will probably cancel anyway. 

They just seem to expect everyone to be happy to knock doors and call people and work 70 hours a week for a barely median wage. 

And when this is over, I'll be back in the restaurant industry, scraping by on tips,
and probably having to work doubles, which are 12 hours a day, just to make ends meet post-election.

I'm so tired, physically, mentally, emotionally, and just drained, depressed, and exhausted in all capacities. 

I've made my mistakes but god what I wouldn't give to just have what seems moderately reasonable to me: A job where I work my 35-40 hours a week, Mon-Fri, with two days a week to breath and have off, and make enough to pay my bills. 

But that seems like a pipe dream to me at this point. I just know I can't keep doing campaigns. I'm like Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon, working on electoral campaigns with these 20'somethings when I""m rapidly approaching 40 - ""I'm too old for this S#!t."""

A good friend of mine recently came from overseas via F1 study visa. To those not familiar: this visa allows you to attend U.S. university to study. However, you are not granted a social security number or official work authorization.  

The guy is a programmer and is studying for his database scientist master degree. He really wants to gain experience in the field, both to improve his English communication skills and to gain relevant experience in professional aspect. 

However, the F1 visa does not allow one to work, or attend internship outside of programs provided by his university. Absurd, I know, but it is what it is.

What advice can you give that may help him to overcome this obstacle? Can't a company vouch for him should he be hired? Does a person not have a right to work without jumping through bureaucratic hoops? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

As I walked into the building the CEO met me at the door and said ""welcome Emily, we're so glad you're here"" ... Well, that's awkward because that's not my name and not even close to my name. It seemed like an honest mistake as he corrected himself and seemed sincerely apologetic. We continued into the meeting room to meet with two other supervisors and began the interview. Halfway through the interview and the other head supervisor called me ""Emily"" before she began her question. Now, I've been to my fair share of interviews from entry-level to higher-up positions, and never once have I been called by the wrong name - not even when I interviewed at Target as a teenager. It seemed like a red flag as far as their respect for me as a candidate, but maybe I'm just being overtly sensitive to it. Has anyone here experienced this before in an interview process - any insight into what it means - and any ideas as to what it might say about the company/team? Advice wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I did get offered the job today. Yet, instead of the site director position, they gave me a different role in my field as a family therapist. They gave an honest review of what they saw and said the decision is mine to make as far as if I want that newly offered role or not. The role would be twice as much work divided into social work and therapy, requiring a lot more hours, and in my mind would be higher pay but they haven't communicated that yet.   
The new offer would be a better fit from my experience and I want to say yes, but also want to seek clarification about those few red flags first. Any advice would be great.

Side note: There were other red flags I reflected on in the interview. So, to be frank the position went from site director to family advocate / sorta like a therapist. I have my master’s degree in counseling and am working on my license currently. It feels as though they are taking advantage of my educational background and training by throwing me into this new mental health program I’d start - to which I did not apply for because the site director has a higher paying salary. So correct - it goes back to are they going to low ball me on pay for this new offered role? They did offer it to me and are going to give me a call tomorrow with more details. 

The reason I am hesitant is due to their approach to therapy versus my own. This is a nonprofit field and they do not have trained counselors or therapist on hand. I’d be alone in that regard. The job serves underprivileged families and they need someone there to go into their homes and care for their needs in both care work and counseling. Well, in my background and experience as a healthcare chaplain  - clients come to our clinic willingly. We do not serve those who do not first want to serve themselves. It sounds like they want to have someone there to meet this need but do not want to program or do the work - they’d want me to create it from nothing and do all the managing over this care facilitation. So yes it would be a lot."

I currently work in a store and they hired me on a short notice because the last person quit on the spot! They introduced themselves as a “we are a family” type of business. Well they literally were, My boss and her daughter runs the store. 

At first they were acting super nice but soon became toxic. They did not properly train me and just let me deal with the customers right away. Because i didn’t get proper training, I would make a lot of mistake and they would gaslight me and make me look stupid in front of the customers. They have been saying a lot of hurtful stuff lately. The daughter of the owner would usually lash out on the workers and would bring outside emotions (boyfriend problems and messy friend group?). I just wanted to vent out.

I recently got a job offer that was more aligned with my career and just waiting to be hired so I can hand in my 2 weeks notice. I’m very anxious right now and just crying in the break room :)"

I've been itching to move for years! First, I was dead set on Los Angeles- having visited there tons of times and absolutely loving it. My mom has been sick for the last few years and I've been on a hiatus from work as I took on being her full-time caretaker. Now that she's getting back to her normal self, it's time that I re-start my life and living in New York isn't what's making me happy anymore. In fact, it's contributing to a decline in my mental health.

Now, I'm considering Austin, TX and although I have never been there before, I feel as though it could be a great fit for what I'm looking for. The salary range for the work I do is incredible and it seems as though a lot of people are heading to Texas from NY and CA.

I apply for jobs that I am both qualified for and overqualified for, and emphasize (in my cover letter) the commitment in relocating promptly upon finding the right fit in a position, but I'm never contacted for an interview. I've reached out to recruiters/ HR of companies in Austin and explained my situation, and also never receive a message back. To add to this: I've been applying through every search engine possible for months- a year.

It's just not financially wise for me (or anyone IMO) to move to a new city without having a job in place first, unless you have the means to/ have a friend or family to stay with for the time being. Unfortunately, I don't know anyone in either Texas or California and I feel at a complete loss.

If anyone has an advice or experience with getting a job in a different state before moving, I would love to hear about it!"

So now I'm worrying if this is going to be affecting my employment opportunities for the internships I applied to. Since it still a mistake in my application which I can go back to edit them.

 It's just that the question that had me filled out didn't clarify such terminology.

0,2022-10-08,Back to school for human resources?,u/itaehtom,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xz60bm/back_to_school_for_human_resources/,jobs,"Hi everyone, I (mid 20s M) am currently a retail sales associate living in Canada and I've spent the last year and a half trying to find my feet in a new city, but want to take steps to upgrade my life and begin a lucrative career that can support me and give me the means to carry out my other (less lucrative) goals.

I've been looking at human resources for a while now as it seems to really align with my skill set and values but the time has come for me to get serious about it. I need to be speaking to more people who are actually in the field to figure out if I have a place there.

Most importantly, I need to decide if I'm going to pursue a certificate in HR while looking for jobs. There's nowhere at my current job that I can take on HR duties so I'm looking at other positions and HR assistant positions but obviously someone with no experience in an office environment will have a hard time landing those. A lot of these postings mention that HR certificates/degrees are required or an asset, but I've read several messages from HR people saying that they don't actually really help you get forward in the same way actual experience does. I have a Bachelor of Music that could maybe come in handy if I went to the right place but for now isn't good for much.

Right now I'm trying to get a receptionist position to break into the office/admin environment after years of restaurants and retail, and hopefully from there find my way in. My question is: Is going back to school (I can afford it and likely would have minimal student debt) worth the time, or should I just keep sending out those resumés and hope for something to come along?

Disclaimer: I understand that human resources is about protecting the company and not the workers, but I'm also interested for other reasons and it seems like a better way to help people than something like finance or big tech, while supporting myself more than if I was at an NGO.

Hope this post is in accordance with the rules and thanks in advance for your help!"

Started a new job in a new sector, I have some experience in this sector by being self taught. The position is WFH and I seem to be the only one that does WHF. Currently on my 3 month probation however from all the red flags I'm seriously thinking of handing in my notice within the probation period.

My time at this new job so far:

Before starting the job I got a mic and webcam for daily meetings I assumed we would be having. (They have not left the box)

I was barely trained on and off for around a month via phone calls and them badly videoing tutorials. You'd think they would just screen share rather than me struggling to see what they're doing because of their bad connection.

I'm usually left to myself most days and for the past few weeks I've been getting one on one calls with my manager. This is to see how I'm doing and updating me with feedback on my performance. At the moment it's not looking too good as my numbers are low and it's all about numbers here.

This past week I have felt really alienated by my colleagues ignoring my calls for advise or assistance on what I'm currently working on. They don't even attempt to return the calls or message to say they're busy? This has made me feel really low along with my manager pretty much belittling me on every phone call making me very demotivated.

I feel completely devalued as an employee, I feel like I'm doing my best with the training I was given. I love the sector I work in but I know this particular role is not suited to me personally as its largely to do with numbers. 

The company is small so I can't bring my concerns to HR.

I'm currently job hunting as I'd like to have something to go on to. 

However if I do hand in my notice with nothing lined up how can I explain that on my CV?"

My coworker and I are the only ones on our team who haven’t been able to even schedule the test yet due to the way HQ handles things now. 

Last week, I found out from my coworker that she checked the compensation website and it shows she’ll be receiving the bonus this year end anyway without taking the test.  I checked and it doesn’t show for me. She said that I should receive the bonus as well, since I do the same work as everyone on the team and it’s been out of our control about scheduling the tests. I’ve also been handling more new projects.  

I feel a bit upset and conflicted.  I took on this job during the height of the pandemic (when people were being fired/laid off) at the lower end of the compensation range, because I was laid off from my previous job and scared of the company saying no to my counter. I like that I get to WFH and it’s been the most I’ve earned so far. 

I know I should ask my boss about it, but I’m not sure about mentioning my coworker…I can’t really do anything if he responds by saying that I need to wait until passing the test. I haven’t been in this type of situation before and not sure how to handle it. I’m also somewhat hesitant about confronting my boss due to fears of afraid being let go again. How should I confront my boss or should I even at all?"
5,2022-10-08,Job offers are coming in and I have no clue how to negotiate (companies are giving me a bit less than I asked for pls help),u/Niiimo_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xz92w7/job_offers_are_coming_in_and_i_have_no_clue_how/,jobs,"Long story short, I've been interviewing with a couple of jobs and I'm about 4-6 interviews in with 3 jobs, and 2 interviews in with another 3. First interview they ask what I want compensation wise and I tell them I made 50k at my previous position and would like to at least match that.

* Graphic Designer  
\-Charlotte NC  
\-3yrs experience  
\-one degree in Design and one in Graphic Design
* Things I was looking for  
\-Remote  
\-$50k+  
\-Benefits

Company 1 has come in with an offer. $47k/yr, said that with benefits that they pay (their half of medical insurance, their 4% to my 5% matching 401k that kicks in 6mo in, gym reimbursement(I have my own gym) etc etc ""brings my compensation"" to $50.5k. I haven't gotten back to them since it's a Saturday, but I'm kind of flustered. I've been through 6  interviews with them, 2 surveys and they got 2 references and from the first phone screening I said that I was looking for at least 50k. They said ""okay"". This would be my 2nd salary job after working for a company that works you to the bone so I have no gauge of what is normal or what is fair.They're a 9-5, but state they work a 35 hr work week so I assume that means an hour break each day.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR for Company 1

* $47k/yr
* 15 days PTO/SickHealth Insurance (they pay 60%)
* 401k (Kicks in 6 months into employment, they match 4% to my 5%).
* ""Mostly"" remote. Seems they are more hybrid but my ""potential"" supervisor said she was slack and would be okay with me only working one day in the office (nervous about this because last employer said they were hybrid and I worked 5 days a week in office from 8-5:30pm)
* ""Potential"" for bonuses up to $3000 quarterly. They tried selling me this as a way to bring me up to $50k/yr as well.. but aren't bonuses supposed to be the cherry on top and not a layer of the cake?"

When I graduated college in 2020, I had no luck with getting full time jobs or anything part time other than working a project based job where I would sign up for data center projects. Then I got an internship testing radioactivity in cell phones. Then in September 2021 I got my current job through Robert Half as an ""assistant paralegal"" (which is actually not the title of my position, but it basically is an assistant paralegal) at an immigration law firm in San Francisco. I am tired of commuting to a big city every day and I am a suburbanite, I would like a remote job, but I would prefer it fully remote  so I can move across the country to a semi-rural area in a cheaper state of my dreams and no commute to a big city every day. I am trying to be realistic too.

I have more interest in law than in IT. I also have prior law experience in my 2 year part time job as a clerical job at a small law firm.

I have been applying for jobs when I was just a temp. throughout October 2021 up to January 2022. I was getting a few interviews throughout that time, but I took a break from job hunting in February 2022 since I was being converted full time at my current job at the law firm. Then in March 2022, I started applying again. and no interviews at all until two this August 2022. I improved my resume. My resume is pretty ATS friendly after I used [Rezi.ai](https://Rezi.ai) (back in 2020) but after I edited my resume many times on word it messed up the ATS friendliness a little bit, but I eventually went back on my Rezi account to edit my resume. And I even paid TopResume to rewrite my resume in which they really did not do the best job except for the content, and I used the content to add to my ATS friendly resume on my  Rezi account. I have noticed that ever since I went back on [Rezi.ai](https://Rezi.ai), the ATS friendliness of my resume improved, but I think this is causing rejections to spew out faster in my email than before since ATS systems can easily read my resume.

And I am not just mass applying to jobs like a lot of applicants. I am have tailored versions  of my resume to suit different type of law jobs I am interested in. Why did I get interviews months ago but no interviews for months and just constant rejections? Is it just a tough market out there right now with inflation?"

20M. I have an unfortunate past, 'cause I've always lived with my mom struggling to arrive at the end of the month. Due to reasons I had to quit twice my last year of highschool (not because of me not wanting to study but because discrimination and bullying and from stress from my own life).

 I was studying company information systems 5-6 years and i really enjoyed the course, but couldn't find another school nearby that could help me finish my study there. If I had finished and had the opportunity I would have gone to university most likely.

But I had to find a job.
And I worked in a pharmacy as internship full time (doing also extra time), and only reaching enough to get by to the end of the month, I got a contract later on but they changed what I had to without giving me a proper explanation of my role and yelling at me on every mistake I did, which of course led me to being burnt out and leaving. 

When I first started my role was being basically a secretary, spreading information about covid, register and checking results of covid tests, informing customers and selling the services. But I also started doing edits for Instagram and Facebook, posters that improved the awareness and sales of the pharmacy, I'm not an expert in graphics or anything, I just wanted to help out as much as I could on my first job. 

When the Russian attacked Ukraine, I suggested that we'd make a collection point for medicines, bandages and similar needs and mostly handled it on my own.

After I left I found a job as a night porter(Idk if it's the right translation?).

I have done training from the end of July to August to learn most of the aspects of this job and would start working on September.
What's required for this job is to work 9 days in a row, once or twice in a month depending on the three porters rotation.

The first two days would be a Saturday and a Sunday afternoon from 12pm/2pm to 7pm here I don't do much and I don't have any complaints about this.
While the 7 next days of work are at night from 6:30pm to 5:50am (on contract it's from 7pm to 23pm from 4am)
The contract would also say that I would get paid a remuneration for those 5 hours of that time just for being available, but if there was the need in those hours I SHOULD be paid as the standard night hours. 

The issue is that I'm always working during those hours since I'm required to be cooking the breakfast for the guests, paperwork doesn't usually ends before 1 am and I have to accept new guests during all the time I'm there, so I don't really have any time to relax, if the place is close empty at best id get 1h of those 5h free. But this place is really often full.

When I signed the contract I didn't expect he wouldn't count me those hours because it's obvious I'd be working at those hours.
But when the salary came I saw only the remuneration that would be close 1/4 of the actual pay for those hours (so I got paid 108h (without counting night service) + 14days remuneration x10€ instead of 178 hours, which would be about a 300€+ difference).

I talked to the owner being honest with him and told him that I would like to quit if stuff would keep going like this, since he expects stuff from me to be ready and perfect(otherwise I often get yelled at or abused verbally) but I expect to be paid for the job I do. 

He told me he won't change policy and after this week that I'll be working I'll quit by talking to the worker unions.

-------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah I'd like to find a honest job but I need some tips from seniors. My English is decent and I talk Italian. I wouldn't mind part time jobs or full time as long it's within my capabilities. I'm even up to learn something new.

Sorry for the long text and hope I wasn't too boring."

However, upon reading the contract, the remuneration only states for example: ""pay will be a minimum of $50,000 or higher depending on the market conditions at time of start"". 

I feel like I should ask the HR if I could get a fixed amount sent to me, but I am not sure if I should do this given this is my first full time job. I am worried they might rescind their offer?  The offer is also less than the average I can see for that role (AVG is around 70K, however this role is new, tech related, and not much info on it, so could be wrong too). 

For negotiations, I feel like I can mention that I have worked other part time jobs in the same industry before . Also I feel that the role is specialised given only a few people have the knowledge to do the role (did an undergrad and masters). 

Any Advice would be helpful!! THANKS"

A little background about me. I need to get a job ASAP and it has to be related to my field of study (I’m not a US citizen and I need work visa, etc). So long story short, I’m actually interviewing at several companies at the same time and I need the job. In terms of the job, all the companies that I’m currently interviewing are the top companies in my field. And I don’t care which company I’ll be joining. I don’t really care about other factors in terms of location, pay, benefits, etc. I only need the job to continue my work visa. 

So, what should I say by any chance they ask me this question.  

Any advice is appreciated!!"

7,2022-10-09,Background Check Advice,u/literaturelover1850,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xzo574/background_check_advice/,jobs,"So I recently landed my first real ""paid"" internship from a company as a college student (F500 Company). The background check will come closer to the start date according to HR. I was just wondering if anyone could provide insight/advice for the background check for my situation. I am probably overthinking it.

For all my internships on my resume, they were all unpaid. If needed, I can provide references. Should I put these on the background check or not? No W-2/Paystubs, so I will have to put it as unpaid regardless if that's an option.

Additionally, I have a small business I started on my resume. I started this small e-commerce business in high school which did a high 5 figure amount. I listed the shop on my resume as a founder, not owner.

While I started the business, I did not legally own the shop because the platform I was selling products under didn't allow minors to own a store. That being said, the platform states in their policies that a minor can run a store with a parent (which is what I did) (this is stated in the platform's policy)

Hence, the taxes paid on the store were paid and filed through a parent. I have access to the store's login and everything if needed. That being said, I was wondering how this might be categorized as the taxes were not filed under me.

I really appreciate any advice. I am probably overthinking it."

Getting a sick leave would be the obvious thing to do but the point is: then one gets the ""stamp"" of a sick employee forever--&gt; that means career development is closed (ad I am not that young so I do not have forever to go up). I am desperate as I do not know what to do....I am of course assuming here that I WOULD be abe after all to process some work right now, which I am not sure about. I will see.

He is highly competent, intelligent, and good at what he does, he has always been able to add value to all of his employers. In his free time, he enjoys studying, which allows him to pick up new things easily. 

The job itself seems great and aligns with his expertise (+7 years) and interests. He was very happy when he heard he passed the interview rounds successfully (he rarely gets excited about things like this). However, the offer was a bit disappointing, next to that, the job requires him to relocate and the cost of living seems to be much higher than where we currently live. The monetary offer matches his current salary (+ €5000,- p/y), which based on the research we've done will make life in the new country somewhat challenging or we would at least have to adjust our living standards significantly. With the average rent being €3000,- p/m vs. the €1500,- we pay now.

I am worried that all these challenges, will deter him from taking the offer. It would also require us to spend some time apart, while I look for a job. We are also looking to create a family of our own, which complicates the scenario according to him.

Now, I am looking for some advice and some perspectives as to how we could approach this situation. I am worried he will regret declining the offer at a later point in time, not sure what to do. Any advice?"

Since I've started, I've been consistently working 12-15h days in addition to time spent on the weekends. Some of which is due to it being a new field and career for me, but all in all it is just a demanding role. I usually excel at both time and task management, so not only is this new a challenge for me, but it makes me wonder if the workload is unmanageable or if I’m just not the right person for the job. 

I feel completely disconnected from reality, my girlfriend, my family/friends, etc. due to working so much. 

To make matters worse, I was just assigned a new boss, who can be quite cold, condescending, and demanding-a complete 180 from my previous manager. He isn't easily pleased or impressed whereas my previous manager (and even peers) often praised my work. 

So at this point, I feel as though I'm busting my ass and abandoning my own life for very little payoff. But finding a new job is like moving apartments-no one wants to have to go through it again. Not to mention, with what time?? So l'm not sure what to do."

And normally I'd be excited about this but I felt really... weird vibes throughout the entire process, and I'm not sure if this is a ""suck it up you got a job"" type situation or a ""GTFO"" type situation.

1. After I applied, instead of emailing me to ask for an interview, some person on the staff called me telling me they wanted to interview me, and it had to be in person. Okay, fine. Cool. This person didn't introduce themselves or anything, but I know they were from the place.
2. They called me again two days later and rescheduled the interview saying ""the owner actually is going out of town we need to reschedule."" Okay, a little weird that they didn't check in advance but whatever. 
3. Called me again the morning of the rescheduled interview saying they have to cancel and need me to come in on another day. I told them I was not sure of my availability for next week and I'd have to let them know. Again, not sure why these aren't just emails.
4. Got an email a few days later with them ""inviting me"" to put an interview on my Google calendar, without emailing or asking me if I was available at that time. I was, so I accepted the invite.
5. When I got to the place for this two-time rescheduled interview, the place was completely locked and dark. I emailed the company after 10 minutes saying I was there, but nobody else was. Within two minutes that same person calls me again saying ""the owner is running late she will be there in 10 minutes."" So I wait another 10 minutes.
6. She shows up, we have our interview (apparently the person who has been calling me for 2 weeks is her assistant). She does not ask about references, explains some of the job and says there will be some training on the job. Then says ""okay you have the job congrats, get fingerprinted ASAP,"" and looked visibly nervous when I said I could start in ""a few weeks"" instead of a few days. 

Is this weird? Am I overthinking this?"

I recently got a job offer through a recruiter, however during the last stages I asked what the salary offer was and to my surprise it was less than the original range posted in the job description. I went back and asked if I can get the minimum in the range. While the recruiter said they would message the firm and see, they did preface that “employers may just rescind the offer completely”. 

Im panicking because i want the job but just feel that i was short balled without a prior heads up. Im tempted to just say I’ll accept, but i believe the message went out already. 

From your experiences, have you ever encountered something like this ? 

Thank you in advance!

Edit: Hey all, i just wanted to thank each and every one of you for your feedback on this issue. As it turns out the company ended up offering middle of the range. Seems that the recruiter wasn’t even aware of the offer. 

To anyone looking for a job; as these generous redditors put it below; follow your gut if you get a back feeling about a job."

I dislike my current job because it’s not very exciting or the type of work I want to do. So I found a new job with the city with great benefits as it’s a government job. It’s the best for my career. 

basically I interviewed for this position on September 6th. I got a conditional offer letter the same day. It was conditional on my background check and me passing the physical. Well, I didn’t get anything to schedule the physical. When I asked them about it they said theyd send the info for it “soon”. But didn’t send it until a few days ago. Almost a month since I got the offer letter. I went to my physical on Friday and my new job won’t get the results for 2-3 business days. Then, they’ll give me a proof of employment letter. 

The problem with this job is it is academy based. They only have this academy 2x a year if enough people apply. And the academy starts on Monday the 17th... so basically the most notice I’ll be able to give my current job is maybe 2 days. I feel really bad about it. We are unionized, so they would give notice before firing me. And my work partner will have to get sent to work at another place which he hates until he gets a partner again. I feel bad because he is a nice guy. I still haven’t told him because I’m not telling anyone until I get that letter from my new job.

However, I’ve found out he’s making about 15k more than me and I find him to be a know it all and I don’t think we are going to mesh well. I get along with most people that I have to work with on a daily basis. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m dreading going to work in the morning and have become burned out and exhausted. I also voiced during my review when I got a raise that I was not happy with my pay. 

I’ve made my mind up that I’m not going to going to stay after my 2 year mark (have to pay back my sign on bonus if I don’t). Im also staying on to try to train the guy so other people I work with don’t get screwed when I leave. 

Am I crazy for staying on for the remainder of the time? Or am I overreacting for feeling this way? I enjoy the work i do (not the company), it’s challenging and I actually use my degree every day, which most of my friends that I graduated with don’t get to use. Also I know that I could demand higher pay but I just think it’s better for myself if I just move on."

A key item here that companies may be way more willing to wiggle other than money is PTO.  Other benefits are definitely on the table too.  I had a candidate ask for 20 days when my place normally does 15 days PTO standard and it was a non-issue.  Good luck with the hunt!"

3,2022-10-09,relocating states while trying to keep my job in the process.,u/Toobaforsale,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xzy62q/relocating_states_while_trying_to_keep_my_job_in/,jobs,"I’ll start by saying bless anyone who actually reads through this entire thing. It’s a long complicated story but I’ll give the bare basics. I moved with my family from the Bay Area to San Antonio, TX. When I moved, I was in a job that was going nowhere, and in an industry I wasn’t planning on staying in. So I moved unemployed, which was fine because I had sufficient savings.

We’ve been here about a year and my family doesn’t like TX. Personally, I like it here, but am not really picky with where I live, so long as I’m able to bring in income.

Shortly after I got here, I was recruited for a salary position, where my company licensed me, and ultimately really takes care of their employees. It’s been a dream being in a job where I’m taken seriously. You could call it my first “big girl job”

Because I’m a corporate worker now, It feels like I can’t just up and leave, nor would I want to. However I can’t leave my family behind. So the plan now is to hopefully transfer to the corporate office in Denver, CO, as they’re all  raving about Colorado. 

I think I would really love Colorado, and am excited to live there, but I’ve only been at my corporate job for a month. 

When it’s too soon to ask for a transfer, and what the hell do I do if there’s no open position anytime soon?"
17,2022-10-09,I thought I wasn’t professional enough for LinkedIn,u/Cheap-Safe,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xzypzs/i_thought_i_wasnt_professional_enough_for_linkedin/,jobs,"I’m not sure if I’m the only one who thought LinkedIn was just for professionals with degrees and lots of work experience and professional friends… but just in case there are other people who think that, I wanted to get on here and say: 

Stop comparing yourself to others. 

MAKE AN ACCOUNT! 

Use the experience you have, even if it’s not a lot and even if it’s not professional. Spruce it up, use fancy words, and make it professional! Even if you don’t have extensive work experience and a college degree, you can still be qualified for a good job. I definitely don’t recommend lying about your experience or skills, but I 100% recommend using fancy words to get your point across and let people know you’re smart and can perform the necessary duties. 

Here’s an example.. umm, if you helped your neighbor build a desk that they ordered from IKEA 3 years ago, you can say things like this: Ability to follow complex directions, problem solver, excels in social environments…

Something like that. You get what I mean. It’s not lying. It’s you sharing your previous experience to let people know you’re able to use these skills in a bigger way. 

I just landed a job that only hires people with degrees and extensive work experience. My resume was so good that they interviewed me even though I don’t have a degree and don’t have much work history. I did AMAZING in the interview. And I’m a big introvert..so if I can ace an interview like that, anyone can. They loved me and offered me the job on the spot. And don’t get me wrong.. I did many interviews. Got some no’s, got some offers. Don’t be afraid of rejection. That rejection will most likely teach you something to give your next interview a boost. You can do this. You WILL get that yes! Best of luck!"
1,2022-10-09,thinking of quitting my new job,u/urlocaledgygirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xzyr8x/thinking_of_quitting_my_new_job/,jobs,"gonna try and sum this up because i’m at work at the moment (waiting for my laptop to start). i started working at a new job around two weeks ago. i’m 20, and this is my first time not working in retail/hospitality (this is a call centre). 

don’t get me wrong, i love it so far! i love my colleagues, my manager, the atmosphere… i’m enjoying it more than any job i’ve had so far. 

but there’s one problem. i’m on a contractorship, which means that at any point, i could be left without a job. i can’t afford to have this happen, because i’m saving up to move out of my abusive parent’s household at the moment. i need a job that’s stable, pays enough for me to be able to afford an apartment, and preferably one that i enjoy. 

now, i do have a job lined up for if i quit this one. it’s a banking job, pays almost $15k more annually than my current job pays (for an entry level job, that’s amazing), is stable (i’m not on a contractorship), i get benefits of the bank i’m with (which i won’t name for privacy reasons) AND after 6 months of working, i won’t have to travel all the way into the city to work every morning and back at night (as it’s mainly work from home). in every sense, it sounds better, but i’m so hesitant about switching for a few reasons:
- like i said, i enjoy this job. it’s a relaxed environment, and self expression in terms of piercings, tattoos, hair dye etc. is not only permitted, but welcomed and encouraged
- the other job which i have lined up, although it has all those benefits, will likely not be this relaxed. i know this doesn’t seem like a big deal, but tattoos are important to me for a few reasons. first and foremost, they seem to confirm my gender identity for me. more and more recently, i have been certain that i am not the gender i was born as, and tattoos help me feel more masculine physically, as i am quite small and look very feminine generally. apart from that, even if i can’t get any more tattoos after this one, i have a very special one planned out for my dog. he’s getting older (13 y/o) and is struggling with mobility, and i’m terrified to lose him. i want to get a tattoo for him, but not in memory, rather as a reminder of him when he’s gone. i want to get it while i still have him. and i want it on my forearm, where i self harm, as a reminder not to, because he’s stopped me on countless occasions. 

i know jobs tend to be more relaxed nowadays about tattoos/piercings/hair dye - one person at my current job has close to 50 tattoos, a split dye with coloured hair and multiple piercings at the age of 30 and everyone loves it!! however, at a banking job, i know it will be much more formal, and i may not be allowed such luxuries. 

i realise i haven’t covered this, but i love everyone at my job currently, and i’m terrified to not enjoy the other job. most of the people here are around my age and fun to talk to, as we all share similar experiences. i am almost certainly going to be much younger than most of the people at my next job, meaning i’ll probably not enjoy talking to anyone as they will all have wildly different life experiences to me. 

all in all, i probably will end up taking the other job (i have already accepted, but am still debating), but i’m just very apprehensive, because i really do love absolutely everything about this job. i would be willing to forego the extra income for a job that i know i absolutely love, but the only thing that has got me to pause and think about it is the instability of it. i need something stable, and i’m just kind of upset about this, as if it weren’t for this, i would have definitely picked my current job. 

tl;dr: although i love my current job, i’m considering switching to another job i have lined up that i’m terrified i may not like. my current job pays less but is very inclusive, and encourages expression of self, whereas the other job will likely not be as relaxed, and i’m scared i won’t enjoy it as much because most of the people will be older and i won’t be able to talk to them like i do the people at my current job. 

also, i did a terrible job of summing it up like i said i would at the beginning. sorry about that XD"

I am introverted and don't have the mental stamina to continue to do this.  I don't have the energy to do anything  I like because I feel as though I need to channel everything into getting amped for the following morning of work just to end up desolate regardless. I look at my peers in jealousy because they are all moving away, getting jobs, and starting their careers. I want to have the energy to go out and do more in my free time like I once did but I cannot seem to find it. Going out to do basic tasks turned has arduous and often I find myself just wanting to go home to finally be myself.  While I am thankful for this job; I am miserable and I am tired of being this way. 

 I have a degree in Public Health I graduated a year ago. I do have some technical skills such as knowing, Python, HTML, CSS, and a bit of SQL accompanied with a TINY BIT OF JS (I've used it to help build a project that was basic, no confidence whatsoever.)  Ideally, I'd like a remote or hybrid job like the one I was interviewing for prior to getting this job. 

 I don't mind interacting with people but I'd like to do it on a more minuscule scale compared to en masse. 

I wouldn't mind doing consulting as I was interviewing for that too at another point (the recruiter never showed up to the interview). 

I revamped my resume millions of times but I never get passed an interview and if I do; I am rejected because I lack experience (I've been told this too many times.) So I've hit an impasse because how can I get experience in other trades if I am blockaded into this one? I don't know what to do and I am appealing for help."

I’m thinking of quitting the job but…,u/Apprehensive-Dance49,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xzzsk5/i_just_got_enrolled_in_university_and_acquired_a/,jobs,"My boss and colleagues are amazing people, the office culture is commendable too. However, my workload began to pile up in less than a month and I started responding to ‘urgent’ emails on my days off while studying. 

It was fine at the start, but subsequently felt rly jittery and anxious which is a BAD sign. I have worked a few jobs and never felt this way before. I usually pick things up within 3 weeks and am able to run independently afterwards. I’m also not extremely new to marketing/design as I took three gap years from school to work in this field before applying to university.

1. The workload is quite manageable. 

2. There is a lot of communication on text and email. I find it annoying as I don’t like looking at my phone 24/7 on days off or weekends (but is necessary in office culture)

3. Some emails are urgent (even on days off) so I have to respond but everyone in the office does that too. 

4. I don’t want my co workers to pick up my slack since my boss hired me to help them.

5. Turnover rate here on average is 3-4 years so my early departure may startle them.

I still need a job for daily necessities / transport and my school fees (it’s not hefty because of govt subsidy) but I find myself dreading work now, and would feel guilty if I leave my boss because they are so understaffed. Thing is, my 3-month probation ends in 2 weeks, I want to offer to help her with the transition or provide a longer notice period since she is so nice to me, but I’m stuck because there’s nagging feeling that tells me I shouldn’t stay any longer than my given notice period which is only a week.

It's my first job right out of college, and honestly just took it because it's remote and it pays pretty well. I also got promoted pretty soon after I joined.

Over the last couple of months, I've been thinking about resigning because of my mental health and I want to apply for grad school. I feel like my anxiety has been really bad, and after work I just don't have the mental capacity and energy to work on grad school applications. Haven't resigned yet though because I was too afraid of not having any income.

I do have some money saved up, and that would last me quite at least 6-12 months . Recently I got an offer for a part-time job in a field I am really interested in (and is honestly more relevant to the field I'm planning to apply for in grad school), but the problem is they're paying such little money. It seems to me that there would be many growth opportunities, and even a chance to join full-time after probation but then again, that's in 3 months time.

Do you think it's a good idea to resign from my current job, and take the part time job so I can focus on my grad school applications and preparations ? or it's a stupid decision to leave the stable income ?

I have a auto immune condition, so I have a lot of trouble fighting off simply illnesses. My boss cares more about a weekend off with her boyfriend than she does for my staff and me.

On Friday I started getting really sick, like coughing, high fever and vomiting. I left early that day as I quite literally couldn’t do anything. My girls are angels, and I don’t want to get anyone sick as they are all in college. I told my boss on Saturday that I’m not going to be able to work because I was so sick. She started quilt tripping me and long story short I went into work as I was the only one to open and close. Now it’s Sunday and my third key said she could work, but turns out not. She has a disorder and she can’t work 99% of the time. Which is a huge issue as her main job is to cover for main managers when they’re unable to come in.

I don’t know what to do. I never take sick days, ever. And the one time I’m genuinely sick no one cares enough to cover for me. I’m so frustrated and have no idea what to do."

After getting straight up exploited during COVID, we both agreed that our sanity was more important, and we quit our jobs to do DoorDash/Uber Eats instead.

We're actually making the same if not more doing delivery work, but we know we've merely traded one master for another. We're still completely at their mercy and this could disappear any time. We've been working to expand our sources of income into as many things as possible. We're making and selling things on Etsy, and are talking about converting our plot of land into an Airbnb.

Basically, we just want to have as many irons in the fire as possible so life doesn't feel like such a grind. We've looked into a locksmithing course, which would open us up for simple stuff without taking a full time job or getting time consuming certs. We thought about getting a notary license just for whatever small incidental help that might bring us. (We looked into process serving, but that doesn't seem to be a thing in upstate NY.)

What are some skills we could learn that would make for some good gig work and add to our passive or incidental income?

If this is best suited for another sub, please direct me accordingly and I'll post there instead."

I (24f) currently work retail and frankly I’m exhausted by the physical toll, unstable hours and poor pay. The idea of entering my 30s making my current poor pay and lack of career prospects doesn’t align with the lifestyle goals I hope to achieve. I want a new role where I’m on my feet a as much due to a bad knee and ongoing physio. 

Recently I’ve been considering trying to get a customer service role at a bank and working towards getting the bank teller certifications. I did 2 internships at banks and they both said this was a common way folks moved up the career ladder. Most would then get their relevant specialised chartered qualifications eg. Pensions/ mortgage advisor. 

I’m very passionate about personal finances/financial products.I don’t dislike maths. I just suck at it which is highly ironic considering my dad was a professor of mathematics/sciences at a university. I enjoyed the accounting modules when I did business in high school (college in the U.K.) but started my undergraduate in HRM and psychology instead (however I dropped out before my final year).

5,2022-10-10,"Recruiter reached out to me, scheduled a meeting and disappeared",u/randy_cameraman,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y0krhy/recruiter_reached_out_to_me_scheduled_a_meeting/,jobs,"Hello everyone! A couple hours ago I got a call for a recruiter stating that they are looking to fill a data engineer position. They mentioned that they found my profile on my university's jobs board (I am master student). They asked if I would be interested in the position since I started a job some days ago (probably looked at my linkedin). I told him that I would be interested in exploring another position, since my current job is a student job and I signed a one month contract to see if it works out for both parties. Unfortunately, I was on the road walking to class. The street was extremely noisy ( I did not even hear well the company's name and his name). I explained the situation and asked him if we could schedule a call later. He said yes, and that he will call me on 5:30 pm. Great I said! 

First issue: he called from the UK while I am in Belgium (one hour difference). He does not call on 5.30 (my time) and I call him after 15 minutes more or less. He said he will call me later, since he is having a meeting. 

Second issue: If he meant 5.30 pm UK time, well...he is 1 hour late! 

I am not really used in working with recruiters, since this is my first time I am contacted by one (without me applying for the job). Is this some trick or something? Personally I believe that it's not. Did the meeting took that long? Probably. But isn't this kind of unprofessional behavior? I rescheduled my tasks and you can't even be on time. After all, you were interested in me! Anyone has similar experience?"

0,2022-10-10,How do you all resolve bad relationships with your managers?,u/OrangeBarney,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y0medw/how_do_you_all_resolve_bad_relationships_with/,jobs,"I am a temp worker for a startup company. I was hired along with 20 other people along with the manager. One of the major complaints about this new role was that there was nothing to do. Everyone else on the team wants to be a programmer or developer. They all keep themselves busy by doing projects on the side and ""proving"" themselves. I loved writing documentation and Human Factors/Ergonomics. I was good at writing guides on how to use the new software and was really motivated to put out the best guide. There were times when I messed up on something minor like when asking questions, forgetting to put a link to something, etc. I didn't like how the manager would come to my desk and talk to me in a way that I was incompetent or stupid for the team to hear. The thing is, things change and as a new department there is a firehose of information and sometimes I would miss it. One thing that sucked about this gig though was that my team members were all contract and getting paid different rates. I was on the lower end of the spectrum yet some of these people had degrees which I didn't think was fair.

I had assignments that I would get done to the point that there was nothing to do. I tried to keep myself busy by learning new skills or proposing new ideas or projects. The higher-ups would ignore my proposals or ask ""how is that going to help us""? I just eventually kind of gave up and lost a little motivation to do well. I wish I was a programmer, I was trying to learn python code but I didn't like coding and I am pretty bad at it. When I would finish my assignments I would just be on my phone a lot as a result, which I know is bad.

Well, when we got a few new hires to the team, the manager asked me to give up work for the new hires to get them up to speed I was to shadow them and help them when needed. Honestly, the work was very easy and straightforward. I didn't have to do much, because my new co-workers were pretty comfortable with it after they had gone through the training. well after a couple of weeks, it was time for me to come back to training. Long story short I messed up on an assignment due to things changing and me not knowing, and It angered the boss. I asked my co-workers for questions, but they weren't much help. The boss pulled me into the office sat me down and talked about my performance.

The manager said my work could use a lot of improvement and that I was on my phone. He made me do additional training with another team member. One thing I wish I had brought up was the way he addressed this. He just had a ton of assumptions not trying to find the cause of why I was on my phone. The biggest thing that angered me though, was the fact that the manager had said I need more improvement, but couldn't give any examples specifically. I feel as though constructive criticism is addressing the problem and giving clear examples of how to fix things. We had team members approve and check work before being pushed out, and my co-workers have said things like ""Looking good"" or ""wow this is smooth"". Ironically, I was the one who had written the guide on how to use the software and trained others to use it. I went through training and there was improvement according to the manager. In fact, he said he was very pleased and happy with my work.

One day I got a call from the temp agency asking If I wanted to switch jobs or if I think it was a good fit after six months. Well, the manager asked if someone could volunteer in designing something for the team. I happily volunteered along with two other co-workers. I came up with different ideas, and my co-workers came up with nothing. in fact, I was the only one working on this project, and I came up with three different designs from scratch in only a week in a half. I didn't know what the manager was really looking for, and even when we asked them they couldn't tell me directly. The manager said he was impressed, as I was working on it, the co-workers set a meeting up for the boss and me to go over it. Long story short, the manager didn't want to go with my design ideas and instead decided to go with his. To go with him required me to learn python and master it, and gave me a deadline of four weeks. So I was to master a new coding language by myself and work on this assignment and have something done in 4 weeks. My co-workers jumped ship and said that they were busy with other assignments and the manager said this might be an impossible task to do as he wasn't sure how to do it himself. I admit I got really angry after this and had a passive-aggressive attitude toward the manager. after rushing to learn python I just gave up. I don't like my manager anymore for some reason.

I and the manager I noticed do not really talk to each other now. He has been micromanaging and nitpicking my mistakes compared to other people. It's driving me insane and I am starting to hate the job and company I am at because of it. One day after being nitpicked twice in a row I had enough and yelled at him when behind closed doors. The next day he made me do a bunch of busy work and gave me a really hard deadline and added rules as he went. I am thinking about talking this out with him but not sure how to approach him other than starting off with an apology.

TLDR; I have a bad relationship with my manager, am I about to get terminated? or is it ever worth talking disagreements out with the manager? I am going to apologize, but I want him to know how I had been feeling about the job too."

Advice needed.,u/IzzyMcFuzzysnort,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y0muj8/should_i_take_a_new_job_or_wait_for_awful_interim/,jobs,"My awesome boss quit his job in July, and I have an interim boss until Feb. 1. She is inconsistent, condescending, accuses me of emailing ""curt"" emails (they aren't, just professional), harps on my mistakes and demands apologies, and has threatened to tell my new boss (the one starting in February) that I am a sub-par employee. My past performance reviews have been stellar. She's got me so tied up in knots that I'm making more and more mistakes (and she's given me lots of extra work) even though I do my absolute best. I don't know how to make her happy, I start shaking when she's around, and I've had two major mental health crises since she started.

I received a job offer for a position that I'm not sure I will like. I have a crippling fear of change and have turned down jobs in the past because of it. It's really bad.

Should I stick it out until February? Which aspect of my mental health should I prioritize - boss or fear of change?"

I recently quit due to the pay becoming stagnant. Now there's a restaurant I've eaten at ever since I was kid, so much so that I've become friends with the owner, we even know each other's family. Here lately he's been talking about how he wants to hire a store manager, someone he knows, can trust, that loves the restuarantas much as him. He's offered me the job but I'm scared to take it for multiple reasons. I have 0 experience in a full scale restaurant let alone managing one. There's also the nerves because it's someone I know and fully respect.

Should I take the job despite my lack of experience? Or should I pass and tell him to look for someone else due to it?

If I do take the job what are the differences between the 2 restaurant styles? If anyone else has made the switch is there any advice you could give me or things you wish you would've known when you started."

After seeking advice for my CV from a friend, I have started reapplying for jobs but its too big of a risk leaving my current job and not finding a new job after a month. The last interview I went to, I told the interviewer of my notice and explained I can work there when I am not working at my current job but he said they aren't allowed to do this as the place I was applying for and my old job are 'rivals' (I work in fast-food).

I have also been advised by my friend to request less hours to my manager and say its due to college so I can work elsewhere during my notice period and I am going to take this onboard. 

Tbf, by the way things are going at my workplace, with the management hiring folks the same ethnicity as them and putting them in for more hours than us non-Indian folk, that advice could possibly workout as we have multiple staff (who are not of an Indian ethnicity and on zero hour contracts) who either get very little or no hours at all and they seem to be cutting down my hours too"

I told them  that I'd prefer staying at the company I chose, but that I'd be open to  consulting for them during early morning hours and afternoon hours when  I'm not working at my current company.

They seemed open to the idea.

When  I initially rejected their full time offer they asked me which company I  chose  to work for since I wasn't accepting their offer. I told them I  did not want to disclose that, but gave them the industry the company  was in.

Now I'm thinking since  they are open to bringing me on as a consultant, they will really want  to know which company I ended up working at since they wouldn't' want me  working at a competitor, etc. (It is not a competitor)

I still do not want to disclose which company I'm working at, but I don't know how to tell them in a polite way.

I was thinking of saying something along the lines of:

""As  you know, I just started at the company and prefer to not disclose who  they are at this point, but I can assure you that they are not a  competitor, nor do they even operate in the same industry as your  company.""

The reason I don't want  to disclose which company I am working at is I'm worried that they will  reach out to my current company's HR and ask them if it is Okay that I  consult with them, and get me in trouble.

There's  nothing in my current company's offer letter that says I can't consult  for another company, but I don't want them to know."

My current flight paramedic position is temporary however it has the same responsibilities, duties, etc as my coworkers, it just lacks the benefits.  When I was offered this temp position I was told by my boss that temps are typically the first to be considered when a permanent position opens.

In August I was contacted by my boss and told that a coworker was leaving so I would be getting his permanent spot, I just had to apply and interview again since it was technically a position change.  Of course I was elated.  Then in mid August my boss went out on Medical leave so the hiring process was left up to other department members.  I interviewed a few weeks ago and was informed today I did not get the position.  I was told that despite having more than sufficient years working as a paramedic and now 10 months working here, that the person they hired had more years of flight experience and that is why he was chosen.

My temporary position has reached the maximum time limit and will now be ending.  I've been told they are trying to make a new ""substitute"" position for me that will still not be permanent but it would be a way I could get back to work sooner and then hopefully apply for the next permanent position.

I can't help but feel like it's a bit if a slap in the face.  I understand why experience matters, but in our unique environment where I work the fact that I wouldn't need to be trained in local procedures is invaluable.  I do love working here so I'll take the sub position if it works but I also can't help but feel shame for getting passed over and a bit helpless too because I feel like there will always be someone with ""more experience"" out there."

I've had no luck on sites like indeed, everything requires at least a bachelors. I have my insurance producers license and have 7ish years of sales experience, but that still doesn't seem to get a call back.

Is it worth it to go back to school online and get at least an associates? Or are there any certificates that companies would actually like to see on a resume?

I recently found out that Richmond has a contract with this hospital, basically saying that you cannot hire their employees, which I'm rather confused about. I wasn’t aware that a job could chose if you can go to another workplace? Could someone explain this for me? Or is that even allowed?

Many of us in the office have move far away and will be looking at commutes of 2+ hours one direction and being in Technology we find it more productive to work from home than constantly being distracted in the open concept office.

I’ve only worked for this one employer since I graduated and know my worth at this place. I was going to schedule a meeting with my supervisor next week and tell him that I’m more productive when working from home with no distractions and that the commute to the office would completely destroy my work life balance and affect me work negatively. On top of these things since starting to work remote i’m one of the few that are always available answering chats within a minute most of the time unless i’m really focused on a task, in the washroom or having lunch though most of the time i have my phone on me and answer anyway while im away from my desk.

Was wondering if anyone had any experience with this same situation or if anyone has any advice for me. I know i could probably find work elsewhere through the network I’ve built up (this place has high turnover) and am willing to walk from the position if they decline. I wonder if they are legally allowed to force employees into the office on short notice when they live so far from the office or if there needs to be some period to allow employees to relocate."

 I (25m) am soon going to have my annual performance review where we get a pay raise. The company I work at (a marketing and advertising firm) very often gives a flat amount, which I have calculated to be a 7.5% raise with my current salary. However, with inflation rates in my country being almost 15% I want to ask for a raise that matches said inflation. I predict they are not going to be respond kindly to a request double their original offer. From previous experience and from what I heard from colleagues trying the same thing I know that their answer would be something along the lines of ""We don't control inflation, that's out of our control"". I believe it's more than fair seeing as anything less than inflation is a pay cut.

  
How do I respond to these sorts of arguments? how do I build a solid case for myself where I can convince them to match inflation?"

He’s a laborer at a quarry pit and they work super long hours 

He brought up the other day how he really wanted his foreman to have some time management and try to stick to the schedule at least on a Saturday when it says there supposed to work from 11am-7pm after getting off ay 3/4/5 am the Friday before 

Well his 2 coworkers are all a lot older than him, and don’t have young kids like we do so they don’t mind working 60-80 hours, (sometimes over that a week) 

They are upset that he doesn’t just want to milk the hours
-let me be clear if there’s actual work to be done he never complains, it’s when they don’t do anything and let him do everything by himself to get all the hours- 

So yesterday the foreman that doesn’t like him said he had done something that is a fireable offense and was sent home and is most likely going to be fired

The thing about this is there no proof, and he knows he didn’t do it, it was two weeks ago and it’s hearsay from a man upset that he brought up the hours last week and his brother backing him up 


He called his union but we’re all really freaked out, we have a baby and a 5 year old and economy sucks right now

I’ve been with the company I’m with for about 2 years and I was recently reached out to by another shop owner. Issue here is that the owner is a major micromanager and allows for no independent decision making as well as has an adult child who works at the shop that makes more than me to do basically nothing but watch tv, talk on his phone and do about 30 mins of actual work all week. Not to mention that the son is battling addiction issues and sometimes goes off the train for a couple of weeks at a time. Overall my current gig isn’t horrible. Most days are easy and the pay is good 94k year salary but there has been investors looking to buy the property and they have been listening to offers which makes me think that it’s only a matter of time before the shop is closed and sold off as the clientele list has been getting shorter over the past few years. Potential new company would pay me 100k salary and up to 40k in bonuses through the course of the year to work 5 less hours a week but it’s clientele base isn’t nearly as easy going as the base I have now. He wants to meet up for lunch and put a firm offer together. Just trying to figure out if I should really consider the offer and move on or just stick it out in hopes that things will get better here and that the shop doesn’t get sold. I think I know the answer already but sometimes the grass isn’t always greener so I had to ask."

I interviewed on the 28th for an administrative manager position that would work directly under the CEO of a moderate sized hospital organization. The interview was with the CEO and Strategic Operations officer thus I don't believe hiring managers are involved in this process. I was told they were interviewing internal/external candidates for a week or two and then would follow up to determine the next round of interviews. I was given their emails and told to reach out with any questions.

I followed up the next day with a great email and got a quick reply from the CEO stating it was nice speaking with me. This is my first time working with C-suite level individuals and I don't want to sound pushy, but if best practice dictates to follow up I am all for it. Advice?"

""I work with kids on the spectrum and am embedded in an elementary school classroom with small children. The job itself is fine however the teacher in charge of the classroom micromanages and often gives unwanted/bad advice about how to treat the kids, for example, ""be less enthusiastic"" and while this would make sense for children that don't respond well to enthusiasm, I have 12 years of experience in the field and am able to gauge that this is not the case, furthermore, she's told me I'm not allowed to have water in the classroom, and gets upset every time I have to use the bathroom. These last two points are what really cross the line for me, I am an adult and shouldn't be told when and if I can use the bathroom. I am a human being and should be able to hydrate when needed. This is worsened by the fact that I have legitimate health concerns related to both as I'm on medication that gives me a dry mouth and makes me have to use the bathroom more often. The way she speaks to me like I'm beneath her is also affecting my mental health and I was wondering what the smartest thing to do in this situation would be, I need the job and enjoy my work but she's making it very difficult to give it my best.""

The supervisors works us hard like we’re well oiled machines not so much like human beings. And I must say this job is taking a toll onto my mental health. I’ve been feeling very unmotivated and depressed. I can’t sleep because I am so anxious about the next day what I have to do for work. Also ever since I started this job I barely could eat (probably has something to do with the depression). If there are any Costco employees out there. Can you give me any advice?

Near as I can tell from the definition that would mean free food at the corporate cafeteria (mostly as a way to discourage people from ever going home)? But not entirely sure how that would make sense for remote work. And this feels like the kind of ""insanely obvious once you are told"" question that I should not be asking the hiring manager if I want to make a good impression.

I'm 28 years old this upcoming Sunday and I'm in a bit of a third-life-crisis. I don't know what to do with my life. Growing up I worked in a banquet hall, restaurant, car wash, general labor type jobs. I graduated high school, took a year off because I didn't know what I wanted to do (first mistake) and got a job as a chairvan driver while studying for my EMT (6 month course). Left that job half way through the course (I had been there about a year at this point) because they tried to take away a day I already had off for a wedding 2 days before and told me if I didn't show up I wouldn't have a job (first instance of something like this no prior attendance issues, just saying this so there aren't any assumptions of my character). Worked at planet fitness for a while as I finished my EMT and decided that I wasn't doing anything so I figured I'd join the Army. My enlistment date came, my EMT practical hadn't happened, and I realized I threw away $1000 for a certification I wouldn't even obtain. This is just context for later because I'm actually an EMT now.

Anyways, enlistment in the army. I was an intelligence analyst but rarely actually did that job and was more of a general laborer, SSO, and office clerk. I was awarded several times however and try to leverage those during job interviews and say that even though I hated it, I was good at doing whatever my unit needed whenever they needed it. We were an Intel unit, so we were all fairly casual with each other and I gained the respect of several higher ups.

I got out and decided to use my GI bill on a degree that I would ""figure out later and take gen-ed's until then."" I am currently 3 years into a education/computer science/ communications and marketing/ random credit debacle. I would like to go back to school, but I still owe them money and unless it falls into my lap, probably won't be being paid any time soon.

I am currently working as an EMT full time and paid on call firefighter in a city I  moved to about 2 years ago as my girlfriend is from this area. I always thought Fire would be a good backup career, so I got my EMT as most departments require it. I now realize I don't want to be an EMT and really don't like fire as much as I thought I would.

In a perfect world, I can log onto my laptop from wherever (allowing me to travel) and get work done, preferably something creative (graphic design? I know nothing about it but the idea of being artistic somehow fascinated me) and my job pays enough that I don't have to worry about going to dinner every once in a while and be concerned my card will decline.

I enjoy playing music (can't read so can't give lessons) and would love to be able to play live music out as a source of extra income. I also love football and really all sports so I thought a career in sports would be great too, I just don't know what I would like to do within a team.

Feel free to ask anything if it helps formulate an answer. Any help is appreciated. Thank you inter-friends"

Hi all, so I’m a part time tutor at a tutoring center (I tutor until I can find full-time work in my field, in media)

My schedule is really never the same every week due to cancellations, new students coming in, etc.

My work usually sends out two schedules: One “weekly” one they send out at the end of every week, in a M-S format, with the times you are supposed to come in (no names of students) and one “daily” one with the names of the students and the times their sessions are . They usually email the “daily” schedule the night before you are supposed to come in to see which students you are working with the next day.

This past Friday and Saturday (I don’t usually work Saturday) They send out the schedule for Friday, but my name isn’t on it. I text one of my supervisors if I was supposed to be coming in that day, and she said no, that it was a mixup, and she and I went on with my day. For Saturday though, I never received a “daily” schedule for that day, (but in the “weekly” one said I was supposed to be working from so and so time) and so I call in and one of the other tutors that worked there answered, not a supervisor, a tutor and I asked if they could check to see if I was working that day, and they said my name wasn’t on the schedule. I wasn’t about to drive 20-30 minutes in traffic only to not be working.

I like this job, and the supervisors are chill and nice,  but the scheduling errors happen quite frequently (and they have taken note of this during a meeting once, and that they are trying to do their best etc.) and I feel bad because they’re probably overwhelmed with other work and stuff, but its still kind of annoying, because if I was supposed to show up and didn’t, then I might get in trouble (hasn’t happened yet), and if I showed up when I wasn’t supposed to be working, that is a waste of time and gas. I don’t know if i should start looking for a new job elsewhere or just roll with it.

Edit: I haven’t talked to my supervisors about my schedule because they have noted its a problem in past work meetings (with a lot of other tutors, not just me) and they have said to bear with them and that they are trying their best, etc."

TL;DR: how many days in a week do TDP people go into the office and what are the locations?

(If there is a better place for this post, please let me know and I'll move it there.)

\--------

I'm offered a TDP position starting next February with, and as someone originally from Texas and living in New Jersey currently, I am considering the Dallas and Philadelphia office.

On their website, it seems that they have Monday and Friday being the days where people can work from anywhere. I have a feeling that this may be team-dependent, so I would like your inputs.

My rationales for locations:

Dallas: my entire family will need to move and rent out my current home, which is going to be a huge hassle.

Philly: I am considering if I can go into the office only a few days a week, and will most likely be sleeping in a hotel at night and coming back to NJ in the weekends.

Wondering if I should re-apply.

I applied to a company who had a role that seemed to align very well with my experience and what I do at my current job. This is sort of a dream company of mine and I have always wanted to work here. Now that I have built up years of experience it just seemed like the perfect time and place to apply. Unfortunately I received (what seemed like) an automated rejection email. Fast forward a couple weeks and I come to learn that someone one my team (let's call him Rex) actually accepted an offer to that exact same position. I was a little confused and quite frankly a little envious of Rex, as he is a more junior person on our team, and has less overall experience than me (I've been with our current company for 4+ years and they had only been with us for about a year, and still contract).

While I'm happy for Rex to accept the offer, I am wondering if its worth reapplying to this company for that position. And if so, how long I should wait. Its been about a month now since I received that rejection email. I feel like if someone were to compare our resumes side by side, I would be the obvious choice for this position (I'm sorry if thats a douchey thing to say, just trying to keep it objective and real based on experience and skills). Another thing thats really enticing me to reapply is that when I talked to Rex, he said that the company is trying to find more people to hire for the role. I'm wondering if maybe my resume just wasn't seen by the right people, or any people for that matter, and just tossed to the rejection pile. I'm so tempted to send another application so I can reintroduce my resume to them in case the right people didn't see (if thats even a thing?). Would also love to hear what any recruiters and HR people think and their experience of this. Thanks all!"

We spoke briefly before they joined. The one gentlemen asked me a bunch of in-depth, detailed questions but he had to go early on. Lastly, the lead HR woman and I spoke for another ~20minutes and she did a lot of the talking but it seemed semi-conversational. The whole interview ran over 10-15minutes. The lead HR woman said something along the lines of ""hope to talk with you soon"" or ""talk to you later"" or something like that. Then when my-would-be boss came back, she asked if I had any additional questions for her but I didn't because I already asked them to the other two. She said she was leaving for vacation on Thursday and wouldn't be back until Monday and didn't want to make any rash decisions prior, that she liked to think things through before making a decisions (which was something I said I did prior in the interview) and I said that makes for both of us.

I have 12 years of experience in account management, but this role is less AM and more marketing - which I have about 1.5 years of experience in.  

After multiple interviews I was offered the job - when they gave me the salary, I became concerned since it was about $7K less than I make now.  Plus, this job will require me to commute 3x/week into the city (currently in a fully remote position) and the health insurance is more expensive than my current company.

I've been going back and forth with countering - I've been told I should ask based on the commute, insurance costs, etc., but I feel like my salary is dependent on what I'm bringing to the table for the company - and since that's less experience in the particular field I'll be working in, I feel its not justified.

They said I'm a reserve candidate and 'they will advise me of the position as soon as possible'. I want my follow up to be appropriate. Should I wait until they 'advise me of the position', or could that be months from now?

I would be grateful if someone can shed some light on this.

======= UPDATE =======

I got the job offer, so I am very happy and excited. I didn't send a follow up e-mail and am still not sure what it meant to be 'reserve'. All I can guess is that there were other similar positions advertised that required more specialist knowledge, I believe there would've been internal applicants for those, so maybe they've moved staff around to fill another more specialist role.

So now I'm just worrying, a lot, about my references.

Thanks everyone for the help.

Edit:

Not that there's anything in particular to worry about from my references. I am just catastrophizing to high heaven."

The biggest game changer for me was having an informational interview with an HR higher-up a month ago. They encouraged me to slightly alter the wording in one of my job titles on my resume. My title had pigeonholed me into the sales industry despite my job description being full of transferable HR skills. After doing that, I started getting interviews left and right and knew it was only a matter of time.

There were a few points in my search where I felt like I would never get there (especially after final interviews), and applying to jobs felt like a useless waste of time. Don't give up hope. It's all a numbers game, and the right one is out there."

Why should we hire you back?


I want to emphasize to them that in my current company (lol the company I left them for) I feel there's no more room for growth and that lack of structure and leadership has gotten me frustrated.

I feel the skills I have learned in my current company have really made me more of an asset to wherever I go.


I learned after some time that it was truly a case of ""the grass really is not greener on the other side"".  

Tbh - still kick myself to this day of jumping ship from them  because they were even offering to fly me out of state to help train new employees but I declined it because I was going to go to another company. It was all for money honestly at the time - I had debt to pay off but now that that is settled down, I don't mind taking a small cut from what I am making."

I thought I could get a job in a new graduate training program at a company somewhere but it seems to be rejection after rejection. Should I be sending out hundreds of resumes each week? I usually just stick to openings that seem to make sense given my lack of work experience and econ background which usually end up being about 10 a week. 

It's been 5 months of unemployment and I'm not sure if I should just literally get any min wage job for a bit of cash so I can stop relying on my parents for money or keep trying for something a bit better. I'm also new to the city and I don't know many people so networking has been difficult.

A lot of the postings are for co-ops/internships so I'm wondering if I should go back for a masters but try and focus on co-ops/internships unlike I did in my undergrad. It's just going to add up to more time and money and I'm already 25.

The team leads I was working under did not like the fact that I was moving up fast and got me terminated for having a “bad attitude”. My bad attitude consisted of not wanting to pick up sharp, splintered wood without protective/construction gloves. It wasn’t even in my job description 😭😭  I was effectively blacklisted in my field because of lies. They thought they ruined my life but today I just finished up day one at my new job. I make more than them and their supervisor. I have benefits. A great schedule. 20 PTO days that aren’t holidays. And people here seem to move up fast. 

Just wanted to inject some positivity into this thread. I feel like it was not too long ago that I was on here feeling absolutely hopeless and not capable of achieving gainful employment in my field. I was only ever being hit up for contract roles or jobs that pay $12/hr. I submitted about 600 apps within a few months. 

I really feel for anyone who is going through a rough time. It is disheartening to feel like you’ve really put your best foot forward, are absolutely qualified for a role/capable of excelling in it, to then hear either radio silence or another “no, not at this time.” It got to me; I lost so much weight and was always getting sick because I was stressed. Please don’t let yourself get to this point. 

Fr, all it takes is one yes. A single one. Perhaps even the job you’re too afraid to apply to because there’s “no way” you could get that if you couldn’t finesse the lower paying positions. That’s how I felt about the job I now have."

Glad to find this subreddit. I went through many posts and found them really helpful. I have few questions regarding gap after graduation and job search.

I graduated in 2019 in masters in bioengineering and due to health reasons, I had to take a break. I had waited until this day to be able to work and start job search. My employment authorization document (EAD) card will arrive in a week. Now, I can start searching for a job. Since I have a huge gap (and no job experience), it might take time to find a job related to my field. But I would really like to start working as soon as my EAD arrives.

I am searching remote jobs (help desk, etc. so that I can work as well as have time to prepare to find job in my related field) but I am not sure if I would even get the remote job or not (as I might not meet the criteria for those specific jobs) and I am not sure how long would it take to get the remote job). I am trying to find a job that I can start in a week. It had been a tough wait and I patiently waited all these years, I just want to be able to start to work.

Could you please let me know about remote jobs that I could maybe start in a week? Also, do you have any suggestion on finding some jobs related to my field that I could get maybe in a week (eg, lab technician or something similar to this)? Your suggestions and advice will be highly appreciated! Thank you all !

Edit: This EAD is through adjustment of status and is valid for two years. Until then green card might be approved as well. My husband is the principal applicant and I am the derivative applicant. Since, the EAD is valid for two years, I am hoping that this would make things simpler regarding the sponsorship situation."

Now human resources said i was a potential candidate and that they really liked my profile but thanks to the company's changes and this new direction they're taking they needed to freeze the position for a while.

I was wondering if It's a good idea to contact the CEO on linkedin, even tough it's very probable that he wont see my message, I wanted to try to at least contact him and let him know how passionate i am about projects such as his. Of course this may seem like a distress call and that im going towards pity but to be honest is not my idea. I have been in the startup world myself for at least 10 years and i do like to contact people like him every now and then so i'm also doing it for the networking but in my perspective it wont hurt to get noticed.

I don\`t know that\`s me but wanted to hear everybody's perspective and see if it may look right

Thanks for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

\-UPDATE -  October 16th- So i couldnt send the CEO a full message because my premium subscription expired but i did sent him a small note and added him to my contact list. He did accept me so I'm thinking on now send him a full message now that we are contacts and go from there. Wish me success."
2,2022-10-11,Struggling to find a job due to DBS checks,u/Mwgmawr,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y1q3nc/struggling_to_find_a_job_due_to_dbs_checks/,jobs,"Hello all,

This is mainly aimed at the British lot on this sub. 

I am a 28 year old Criminology graduate with what I would call a minor blip in his life that has cost him massively. I committed a crime before university but due to some investigation and time I was arrested at university. 

I only got cautioned but it was significant enough to consistently show on my record forever which prevents me from applying for pretty much any role that has more than a basic DBS check which is a lot of jobs that I should be eligible for with my qualifications. 

I have found work in retail and customer service but it's a far stretch from working with the ONS or Home Office or something which I would obviously much prefer. 

Some time has obviously passed since then and in truth I haven't applied for a job with an enhanced DBS check because I'm a little terrified of the entire situation. 

Has anyone else ever been in this sort of situation? If so how did you get around it? And how have you gone about letting potential employers know about such information? 

I am currently working in a security role in a retail chain but it is unenjoyable and draining the life out of me. 

Thank you for your time."

I've been in my current role for about two years and have become one of the best people on my team in terms of output, accuracy, and being a goto person to solve other team members problems, etc. 

Additionally, I wrote a simple, but time-saving software program that has helped many team members able to be more productive.

I talked to my boss today and they are open to seeing if they can get an official team-lead position approved for me. They are also open to giving me extra time to further develop the software program I wrote.

To my surprise, my boss asked me what percentage increase I had in mind, to which I said I would have to think about it.

I have no idea how much to ask for. I feel like I'm adding considerable value to the team between being a goto person and development of software, but I don't want to be overzealous either. 

This seems to be a rather unique skillset to determine the value of as well because it is encompasses different attributes.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

TL;DR - I lobbied for a raise, but because of the uniqueness of the skills I'd be applying, I have no idea how much to ask for.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice, I ended up asking for ~ $15k increase and used u/f02f2e6fa0b3 advise as a template. I will update when I hear back!"

The two interviewers asked me several questions pertaining to my experience with design programs and softwares, along with my knowledge of printing and photo equipment.

I had only dabbled with one or two design softwares in the past and had little to no experience with anything else. They reassured me that they would be training me prior to the job anyways, but I still felt horrible for having no experience whatsoever. I’m not even sure if I got the job, but they asked me for my availability afterwards (I should’ve asked them to clarify on that bit, lmao). It was embarrassing to respond “no” to every experience-related question they asked, and after they thanked me for coming, I walked out crying.

My parents can’t afford college, so I have to pay for it myself, but I can’t even get my first job. I know it’s not my social media either since none of it is linked to my real name or work email and even then there’s nothing on there that would be anything bad since I basically only post stupid little drawings I do on all platforms except Reddit. I just don’t know what to do, I feel useless and horrible and how am I supposed to go to college if I can’t get a job? No one wants to hire anyone without a bachelor’s degree but I can’t get a degree without getting a job first. I also have a minor disability which scares off most employers if I put it on my resume but I have to disclose it during an interview and then that completely ruins my chances of getting hired. Who wants to hire the disabled 18 year old with no work experience? No one. I’ll take any advice you guys have, I’m stumped and I’m tired and stressed and I can’t keep going on like this. I gottta change something but I don’t know what."

Initially I have applied for a position and then apparently that position is closed so the recruiter offered me another position and asked whether I’m interested or not.
So I said yes, went for interview and had that interview.

According to the internet, a good sign can be :
The interview felt conversational 
You are introduced to team members
You are told what to do for the job
The interviewer said goodbye with a warm smile.

I checked all of the signs ✅

Apparently I asked for a follow up on the next week and the recruiter said they have a positive feedback and they will reach out to me by early this week. It’s Wednesday and I am quite anxious.

I also saw that last week they were shifting office so they will be a little busy.

It’s a quick service restaurant so it’s very fast paced. Although I can handle the fast environment, the problem is that I work midnight/overnights and the only person that I’m working with, is very toxic. 

I want to leave and apply for a different quick service restaurant that’s hiring near my current job. The place that’s hiring seems to be desperate for workers since they’re hiring for all shifts. So I’m confident that I would probably get hired pretty quickly. 

So what’s the process for leaving a job? For added information, I’m only 18 working as a part-timer there and I live in Ontario Canada, just in case it’s different for each country or cities.

As far as I know, I’m suppose to give a three week notice? I’m not too sure what that is and I have no clue as to what to do after that? 

Also should I apply for another job first before giving my three weeks notice? Would a quick service restaurant employer wait for three works for me ?

Edit: Hi everyone! Thank you so much for your response. It was very helpful and eased my concerns. As a teenager who is basically clueless, I’m thankful that I have people to ask and help me."

1) My boss micromanages everyone but somehow also does everything last minute, which adds more stress to everyone in the office. Then, my boss takes out their frustration on us when things don’t go according to plan, such as making snarky comments and being passive aggressive.
2) My boss has accused me of multiple things in this short time span. This ranges from implying that I rewrote a letter they wanted me to draft when I legit just copied the example that they gave me and only updated key information (dates, locations, etc.) to accusing me of misplacing/stealing a large sum of money. 
3) I don’t feel challenged. The job that I am doing right now is not the one that was initially offered, and I’m busy but also bored out of my mind. I want to think that I’ll eventually get more responsibilities, but my coworker who has been at the company for a year is still stuck doing basic tasks. 
4) I’m stressed but I don’t feel like it’s stress that I can manage/take care of because of my boss’s tendency to micromanage everyone.
5) I don’t believe in the work as much as I thought I did, so there isn’t anything that is making me feel fulfilled.

Am I just being silly? Are these things normal?"

Quick background: I'm 18 at Uni, no customer service experience and this will be my 2nd job (first job was a tutor at Kumon), also I'm from the UK if that makes a difference 

About a week ago I had an interview at a bubble tea shop (small business), and they said they usually go for people with customer service experience, but were willing to give me a go, so I got a few trial shifts, which I did. I really liked the trial shifts even though they were quite busy and there was a massive menu to get used to, but I liked keeping busy and the whole team seemed super nice. 

Today I got called in for 'training' and basically got sat down by the owner/manager and told that from the feedback she got from the team, I wasn't learning very quickly and not taking much advice (I was trying to take the feedback that I got, but maybe I didn't do it right?) from the more experienced members of the team and she also said that I wasn't enthusiastic or friendly enough and implied I didn't fit the 'vibe' of the team. I'm a pretty shy and anxious person and I was trying to make an effort to be friendly and do good customer service, but since I have no experience and nobody really told me what to do specifically maybe I wasn't doing something right. 

After some further discussion she said she was willing to give me 1 or 2 more trial shifts to see how it goes, and to see if I can improve. I really want to keep this job (it seems much better than just working at a supermarket or something), but I don't really know how I would improve in my next trial shifts (also kinda awkward because the team were the ones who said they didn't 'vibe' with me). 

Any advice for how I can show that I'm learning fast and being more enthusiastic and friendly?

Update: I am not going to the extra trial and am now looking for another job, thanks for your help"

I checked my resume over thousands of times; the career counseling center at my school reviewed it; some friends &amp; family read through it. I don't know how this happened or how to proceed. Some were submitted via LinkedIn, Indeed, directly with the company, or via email (through referrals). I was able to replace the resume in 2 of the applications through their respective portals. 

Based on what I've read online, I  have 3 options here: 

1. Reach out to the firm to correct it 
2. Withdraw my application (can't reapply though)
3. Hope they don't notice - I don't like this option. 

I would love to reach out and address the mistake, rather than withdraw my application. I fear that pointing out this mistake may lead to an automatic rejection because they will think I lack attention to detail or am incompetent/liability. On the other side, it may show that I catch my errors and correct them. I attempted to write something this morning -  it's been hours and I've got nothing. 

Any advice?? 

Thank you! Greatly appreciate your time."

I asked multiple times why I’m still in this phase of orientation, and my supervisor tells me “it’s nothing you’re doing, you’re doing everything right and we just have to give you more time.” I’ve been with multiple different trainers, and my supervisor called me this morning and told me they’re extending my orientation 8 more weeks. I’ll be with a different person training me these 8 weeks, as a result of different trainers my schedule keeps changing. I only know my schedule like a week in advance because it keeps changing. I can’t get a clear answer from my supervisor or trainers about anything I’m doing wrong to extend my orientation. 

Thinking about quitting because of how my schedule keeps changing and I keep getting the run around.

Is this a big deal?",u/smiling_fusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y2b52t/my_boss_lied_about_how_many_days_ive_called_off/,jobs,"I’ve been at my workplace for almost 3 years. In that amount of time I’ve only called in sick once. I’ve taken an 8 day vacation to the beach, but she knew about it 8 months in advance when I booked my condo.

The workplace environment is odd. Our boss is always around my coworkers and I. She’s usually a cool boss. We don’t have time off, so if we’re sick, we have to cal off.

We were all talking about how many times we’ve called in sick, because our one work is constantly calling in sick.

Again, I’ve only done it once. My one coworker, Megan goes “He’s only missed once”, and my boss goes “No he didn’t!” With a smile on her face. She wasn’t upset, but she obviously wasn’t telling the truth. She said “Now don’t lie, you called in sick in numerous occasions” which isn’t true! I said “I had that vacation, but only called in sick once” and she responded “No not the vacation, I’m talking about your call offs”. 

My coworkers backed me up, but she wasn’t having it. She kept saying “No. I remember. A boss keeps track of those things”. Again, she wasn’t angry, but she kept trying to prove me wrong, and make it seem like I was lying.

I’ve called in sick once. I’m 1000% sure of it. My coworkers know the truth too. But why keep trying to call me out, and catch me in a lie? I don’t know what she’s thinking, but it’s not true. And why talk that what in front of fellow coworkers? 

And I plan on using her as a reference, and she can’t even keep track at the amount of days I’ve missed? 

Is this a big deal? Should I just forget about it? I don’t like it when 1). Someone lies about me, and 2). Talks shit on my work ethic and attendance.

Am I making too big a deal out of this? It really made me mad…"

1,2022-10-12,Is going through a recruiter (like OnStaff) worth it?,u/xfloomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y2hq10/is_going_through_a_recruiter_like_onstaff_worth_it/,jobs,"I’ve been looking on Indeed for jobs and I’ve came across some decent jobs that I thought would be a good for me, I applied to them then saw that it wasn’t the actual company posting it, it was the recruiting firm OnStaff USA. About 30 minutes after I applied to the job, OnStaff called me and asked a couple questions, one of the questions was what pay am I looking to start off at, which was weird to me because the pay was already in the description of the job I applied for. 

I have a couple of concerns, 
1. I’m concerned that I won’t get the job I applied for. 

2. I’m also concerned that they might try to cheat me in some way. 

I read on some reddit post that job recruiters, not specifically Onstaff but another firm has hired a person to work a job that pays more than what he gets and the recruiter keeps the rest  (I think what the reddit post said was the guy worked a job that pays $50hr but the recruiter talked him into working it for only $30hr and the recruiter kept the rest). The job I applied for isn’t nearly as much as that but still. 
If anybody has any advice about recruiting firms and if they’re good or not I’d greatly appreciate it."

 I was being harassed and didn't want to ""snitch"" bc everybody would've found out at the place I was at (I feel it is a embarrassing situation) + it was a tough commute (I would've had to leave or relocate eventually bc of my car breaking down). 

So I was only there for 4 months ... now that I am searching for a new job I put the work experience (four months) onto my resume because I did feel I performed relatively well &amp; simply bc of the Tiffany name to stand out to future employers ( I have no real previous work experience because I never got a job during college) 

being that I left on sort of bad terms (couple of store managers didn't want me to leave) -albiet I still quit and I dont want to use them as a reference (I never asked a manager + its been EIGHT plus months since working in general dont want to reach out now) 

so my question is when it comes to applying and they ask the question can we reach out to said employer can I mark (no) ? or will that be suspicious ? ...

 I know my situation is suspicious as is (only at the company for four months) but in my mind I would just put yes they can reach out, then use another reference (Family or friend phone number and have them know my start and end date to verify during future background check should they go that far) and then just use some bogus reason as to why I had to leave (this was still during covid) and why its been a long gap in my resume.... 

or should I just mark no when a company asks if they can reach out to x employer? 

so can/should I still use Tiffany as work experience on resume ? 

if so How can I navigate such situation so that I left on a neutral/positive note ? 

thank you all in advance"

Today, (they were late) I had the 10-20 minute-ish phone interview. It just felt... bizarre. 

Barely was asked any questions other than my citizenship, willingness to relocate, and a few other things. Never asked behavioral questions. Then proceeded to talk about the hiring process and benefits. I couldn't get much details about the actual job.

I was persuaded to schedule a coding interview and a technical interview in 2 days because they have a system where they take and test people in batches. Both interviews will happen on the same day. After these interviews, I will undergo training and then take a project BEFORE they will decide to grant me an offer. 

I'm feeling all kinds of wrong signals about this, but I don't know if I'm getting way over my head about it."
4,2022-10-12,Company asking for references before extending an offer. What do I do?,u/Remillia,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y2i691/company_asking_for_references_before_extending_an/,jobs,"I currently work in civil engineering and had an interview last week and mentioned during the interview that I'd be happy to provide references from my current employers upon receiving an offer (don't want to jeopardize my current job by letting them in on the fact that I am looking for a new job).  Interviewer seemed to understand and told me that the references would be part of a conditional offer. However, today I received emails saying that they would like to move forward with me for the position, but that they still needed me to provide CURRENT references for a reference check. This needs to be done within 24 hours so current employers would need to be notified about receiving a link for the reference checks within the 24 hours as well. This is an amazing opportunity for me but my biggest concern is jeopardizing my current job and relationship with my bosses if the company decides not to extend an offer after all.

In my favor, I was told during the interview that there were exactly three spots available and that they were only interviewing three candidates total, so I'd like to believe that I am a priority candidate and that they are already ready to offer me. I also believe that including my current employers as references would be good as I have a pretty good relationship with my current bosses and do a good job.

I am coming to Reddit for advice because I am not sure how to proceed.  Should I email the company and insist again that I'd be happy to provide current references upon receiving an actual offer, or should I just include my current employers as references and talk to them tomorrow morning at the risk of jeopardizing my relationship with them if I am not hired by the company? Should I try not to include current employers as references and just include current coworkers and previous managers/supervisors instead (not sure if I can do this because I believe they want current employers). Please advise on the best way to handle this!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I have included all past references, but there is a section that specifically asks for current manager/supervisors as a reference.

Here are the emails for reference:

Unfortunately my hotspot wasn’t working either and I then realized the recruiting organizer hadn’t included any dial in number on the invite (it only had a zoom link). At this point I was panicking and didn’t know what else I could do. I confirmed with Comcast that this was an unplanned outage and was able to reconnect about 15 minutes into the scheduled interview. But of course by then my interviewer had dropped. I had no other way to contact the interviewer. I immediately emailed the recruiter and told them about the outage (I didn’t go into any detail around my hotspot failing or the lack of a dial-in number, because I didn’t want to come across as whiney or difficult).  The recruiter agreed to try and reschedule this interview, but I wonder if it’s a lost cause now. 

I’m just pretty devastated right now because it’s a role I really want. After several months of being unemployed and struggling through recruiting, I finally found a role I think would be a great fit for me.

For anyone who has been an interviewer, I just want an honest perspective: would a candidate missing an interview (even if it’s due to a network outage) negatively impact your perception of the candidate?  Does having a legitimate excuse even matter? And is there anything I can say to the interviewer or recruiter to salvage this?"

I graduated with a Computer Science major from a U.S university last year but had to return to my home country due to legal issues (South Korea). Anyway, I started job hunting in Korea 2 months after graduation for entry-level software engineer positions but no luck so far. I struggled a lot with Korean high school Mathematics and never enjoyed it when I was in high school. And I screwed up the Korean university entrance exam several times because of the exam stress related to Mathematics stuff. But at the university, I had no problems getting decent grades in mathematics or computer science courses. I easily got A+ when I was studying at a Korean university, and even scored first place in some math courses among all classes when I transferred to the U.S university. But coding interviews are different stories. I solved more than 400 problems on platforms like Leetcode and others. But I still struggle with coding questions. It's like 'Why the hell I couldn't come up with the solution during the interview'.

I have ADHD and take meds for more than 10 years but it's still difficult for me to solve interview questions in a limited time. I still have nightmares of failing the exam, just like I used to have in high school.

I can easily pass the coding interviews for tier-2 companies, mostly startups, but I don't think I can be accepted to Top Tier companies like Google and Korean Big Tech companies (Kakao for instance). And even I clear the first tech interview or Online Assessment of lower companies, I get rejected during the second round because the entry-level job market is much more fucked up in Korea compared to Western countries. I asked for feedback from the companies I've been rejected a couple of times and they usually responded ""You have good skills blah blah.. but we had to move on to other candidates with work experience."" Yes, they just say sugar-coated responses not to make an applicant annoyed so I don't give a damn.

I don't have an extreme passion or love for coding but I somehow feel happy when I get the code working. But I'm sick of solving algorithm problems and never enjoyed it, although I had no problems with Computer Science subjects and programming stuff when I was in the university.

I regret choosing a Computer Science major when I faced reality after I graduated from the university but I have no skills related to other industries.

I have quite good but not highly gifted IQ scores ranging around 130-135 (SD 15). My teachers and professors used to tell me they think I have high intelligence but now I realized all of them were lying.

I'm trying to build a SaaS myself to make some money, but I can't think of any profitable business ideas. I have no ideas how to make living as a software engineer. Honestly, I don't want to live as a software engineer for the rest of my life forever. I planned to get employed as an engineer, have some work experience of 3 to 5 years, quit the engineering job, and start my own business. But I can't even start with the first step of my career. I really hate my ADHD."

I have yet to find any real passion, I have hobbies but I would never pursue a career in those industries. I consider myself to have a strong work ethic, flexible, and hardworking person, as long as I can support myself financially; I'm willing to do whatever it takes. 

The only thing I really have going for me as of right now is that I have a long work history and I'll have a BA in Business Management. 

I just need some type of guidance as to how and what I can do with my degree. What kind of jobs could I qualify for as a newly graduate.

I been working as a dishwasher at my new job for 2 months. There’s a lot of benefits with the job and this is a job I work in between school and I only work 4-5 days a week (which doesn’t sound bad) but each day I work late shifts up until 3 in the morning sometimes. Some shifts are close to 12 hours but on average 7-8 but these shifts are becoming overwhelming and I feel like I never have time to do anything because every time I go into work its the entire rest of the day for me. And on the days I have off, I either have class and when I don’t have class I’m sleeping because I’m tired from work. The job made me sacrifice my weekends so it’s really hard to balance quality time with family and friends. I don’t have time to go to the gym or focus on other things since these shifts take up my whole days and whole nights. I feel bad because I want to ask for an extra day off so instead of 4-5 days a week it’ll be 3-4 that way I have more time to balance school, work, social life, etc. I also want to speak about my Sunday shifts because on Saturdays I work till 3am and have to go in the next day from 1pm to 1am and that shift is killing me to just wash dishes for that long is exhausting. I really need some rest and to balance out everything for my mental. If these shifts didn’t end so late every time, I’d be ok but I just feel like I don’t have enough time anymore. I want to tell them this but I’m afraid to upset them because the people at my job are nice. I’m afraid that I’ll be letting them down as a new hire.

Also I’d like to add that I’m the only dishwasher who works these hours. All the other dishwashers work 2-3 days a week with way shorter hours. They have shifts that end at 10 but all mine end past 1am."
155,2022-10-13,What are some ways to make a new boss extremely glad to have hired me? Both big and little things.,u/iDecidedToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y2yqrv/what_are_some_ways_to_make_a_new_boss_extremely/,jobs,"Edit: I just want to illustrate that I’m someone that’s responsible and is able to get the job done without being fake or a kiss-ass. I have beef with my current boss and it sucks. 

Edit 2: (I should’ve added this in the beginning for some context. It’s a $120k/year sales job where after a few year would likely get to $200k/year and it generally 40 hour work weeks with some overtime. So working over time we get paid extra AND it gives more time to make sales. Honestly, I’m just a perfectionist and like to make lists. This probably isn’t necessary but suggestions here help me (and probably others reading it) visualize how I want to be in my next role. )


I’ll try to add to this list as I see comments.

While a lot of things are common sense I think it’s helpful to have lists that serve as a reminder. It’s easy to get comfortable and complacent.

I’ll start (and ad more as they come in):
- Always early
- Always willing to work a bit later and help out
- Showing deference: eg. prioritize responding to boss
- Don’t ask questions until you’ve already researched available sources
- Just a general attitude of being grateful to be there.
- Taking pride in being a good employee
- Never complain. (While not being a pushover)


Edit: Added from comments below
- Don’t gossip
- Be meticulous with adding activity to CRM (sales)
- Write things down so you never ask what’s already been said
- Generally positive, caring, empathetic
- Learn other positions
- Say yes when other say no. (Go getter).
- Accept positive constructive criticism. 
- Communicate wins, progress, and road blocks. 



Those are some bigger things but I’ll add smaller things as well. 

The job I’m about to get is a high paying sales job and so more of a solo job. Not much teamwork. But still, I’ve been on bad terms with my recent boss, despite being successful, and it definitely sucks. Unnecessary stress and bad vibes for sure. So I want to make sure I do it right at the next place."

I am so unsure of my available hours because I'm still trying to get out of my agoraphobic tendencies.

1 mini flag was on interview day.. is that the manager/boss couldn't make it in so i basically came in to go on zoom with her while assistant manager(she only greeted and ask me availability to write down) was in room. And just to rush it because they wanted to ""speed up things"". They made it a interview with another interviewee meanwhile everyone else and after was ""one"" on one. I was one of the earliest appointments of the day. There was only 1 person that came a lil after me which is the one that ended up going with me in.

Another is.. a week after to sign papers. It is my fault because i just signed without reading as it was on computer and she scrolled. (I should've asked questions but was super eager. Until today(2 days later) I noticed on the contract said oct 11(day i did paperwork and training) to oct 24th. It says they could change contract to extend. i just never heard or experienced something like this. I experienced 2 week or 90 day probationary period because I was told. This though.. is different. They did tell me training is technically just ""2 days"". Is this their way of not wanting me?
But on this same day of signing papers, they did ask me to start training for 3hrs. I said yes because i really want this job. And gave me uniform (black dress shirt and apron with their company label).


While there i did fix my availability 2x like one during signing papers and 1 before i left, I'm now worried if i did it too much or if it could be misunderstood because i did say when it picks up, i will do more hours. For now..Its kind of short hours on Monday, Friday, and that i could only work 1 weekend day. I'm worried if that would rub them the wrong way since they want full time. My boyfriend agrees but said positively, they wouldn't change their mind before the 2nd training if they gave me a uniform shirt and apron. I worry they would and I'd have to do a walk of shame to give it back lol 

I'm also told that they'd call me back with my schedule. Which I was happily waiting until.. i saw this contract. I'm thinking they could just call &amp; make it next week. But contract also says you could be terminated anytime if you don't meet the hours they're looking for  that contract start to ending date, and knowing how busy days are mid November too.. I'm getting super anxious.

I am currently employed at an agency and I’m not being treated well. Despite hitting all my goals, connecting with the team, no complaints from my clients (they are always emailing my management how well I’m doing) and running an entire “club” for the company, and completely built out a new department for their company based on former experiencesI’ve had, they just don’t see my potential I guess. 

I asked for feedback and they said “We love you, you’re doing amazing and hitting all your goals but there’s just something missing and we don’t know what it is.” They are now thinking of creating an entirely new role for me 

So that kind of told me it was time to start looking for a new job. Only problem is, I’ve been with this company for 6 months and all the new jobs require me to upload my LinkedIn profile. 

Does it look bad to have this job on my LinkedIn since it’s been under a year? I’m also nervous bc this industry is very close and we all kind of mingle with everyone. I haven’t put in my two weeks yet (my director isn’t in office until next Monday) and so I’m just nervous. 

Any tips/advice? Just apply and say fuck it or wait to put in my two weeks?"

What are my options from here? Every employer is just going to think I'm completely incompetent and couldn't hold a job. I don't know what the hell I can do, I'm freaking out really bad... completely panicking. I have no other real world experience besides this.

The agent called to learn more about me and when talking about my expected performance bonus, he casually mentioned he’s a friend of one of my colleagues in my current company, and even mentioned his name and his bonus amount.

So, now, I’m freaky out: given how unprofessional the agent acted, I’m quite sure he’ll mention me to his friend. Though that colleague’s department have little involvement with mine, I worry that he may still somehow know my boss and leaks this to her…

I don’t hate my current job, just that I feel I’m overlooked in a recent promotion even though I have taken up more responsibilities, and the pay raise from my last promotion is meager. Recently, I’m having a better rapport with my boss, and I think I may get a promotion this term (around Apr 2023), I really don’t know how she’ll react if she finds out! Besides, my job hunt so far is not going well, so it’s not like I have a backup plan if she retaliates/ no long considers me for promotion.

Is there anything I should do? Or am I just overthinking?"

Pretty disappointed to find that almost all my old coworkers have ghosted me, even the ones I would hang out with outside of work. 

Based on the fact they ignore any communication, I reasonably confident if I messaged them about a job, I would be ignored again. Before I left, they talked about how it’s cool having a connection at another company but I don’t think I would want to refer anyone based on how I’ve been ghosted. Also I realized how toxic most of my old coworkers are after seeing how nice my new coworkers are, so now I feel it’s just a culture fit issue

So overall, would you guys still refer someone who would probably ignore you if you asked for a recommendation? Or would it be petty not to refer since I can’t deny that a lot of them did good work

Edit: couple people getting angry over this question. Just to be clear, I’m asking what others would do because I’m not sure what I would do personally. Not looking to justify one mindset or the other"

To be honest I am not feeling it. There is a total lack of guidance and training. I’ve been sitting at my desk doing absolutely nothing for 3 and a half hours. 

While setting up my account for the system, manager did not even tell me which was the proper job category to select for example. He pulled up the page and was like here you go, just fill this out and go from here when I had a question about what to select since none of the options seemed to pertain to my job description, it was kind of hard and awkward to get his attention and I ended up not being able to get his attention. I watched like 6 training videos and then he couldn’t find the other training videos so he just manually showed me the system and just told me to click around and play with it and then left me alone for a long period of time again. 

I also had to actively ask him basic questions like tips on how to approach a customer or if there was any sort of script I can look to for reference since I had no idea. Basically any question I try to ask to get a better idea on how to work my job, I get a very vague answer that doesn’t seem helpful. And now I’ve been left alone again and it’s been almost two hours. 

My first impression of this job has not been good. I feel that there is a lack of guidance and no official training. That makes me feel uncomfortable and it feels awkward sitting here not actively learning my position. Am I just overthinking things and give it more time or should I just quit and find something else?"

As a benchmark, I work in Business Intelligence and I have been over 90k and as high as 107k in 2 roles since COVID. My main concern originally was stability and somewhere to stay a while. But now, it is a matter of maintaining my current lifestyle or dramatically cutting back. Here are the 2 offers, both BI roles &amp; remote:

**Big 4 (not KPMG)**

* 72k, 6-9% annual bonus
* Clear path to manager
* Sub-par benefits (partially employee paid HI, very low 401k match)
* Massive career growth potential/firm has any role I would ever want
* Will have to downgrade apartment, get cheaper vehicle
* Huge exit potential/Top MBA springboard

**Mature Startup (founded early 2000s)**

* 95k, no bonus
* Amazing benefits (full employer paid HI, 5% 401k match)
* There is huge personal growth potential but unsure of path to manager or career
* Same lifestyle
* Pretty unknown company (at least I had never heard of it nor my colleagues)
* Unknown exit ops

I want the Big 4 role, but the pay discrepancy is vast. HI (health insurance) is also extremely important to me for personal reasons. I also absolutely love the city I live in, but with the role I want I would have to move outside of downtown. That being said, the other company seems to be very good for a job, but I need to think in career terms..

I really need advice on what to do here."

This is more of an inspirational post than it is about just looking for a job. I have been unemployed for 6 months now (after being fired 2 weeks into a role that did not have bandwidth to onboard me) and things have gotten really REALLY bad.

I have ran through my savings about 2 months ago and I currently earn the money that I have from a few odd jobs here and there. But it is not even enough to survive. I owe a lot of people money but they are extremely patient with me, for that I am grateful :D I have people who look out for me and want nothing back in return. 

People in my life have left me outside with the wolves but I am thankful that I now know of the ""conditional"" love that some people had for me (I have NEVER felt entitled to anyone's help and nor do I like asking for it. But simply: a few did not want to be associated with an unemployed person). 

To keep it short: I am extremely thankful for my season in-between because I know that when I eventually land a good job, I hope to stay grounded because of what I am currently going through. I have probably applied to over 700 jobs now, 10+ first interviews and about 3 final interviews. My ""YES"" is on its way and I cant wait :)

Keep going! If you feel like you're too tired? Remember to rest but not for too long, and keep applying. Your dream job is out there. Network with as many people as you can. Go to meetups and talk about your skills or things that you are passionate about.. but the most important part is to keep going!! 

&amp;#x200B;

Sending everyone much love and positivity from Tanzania. KEEP..GOING!!!!"

I'm looking for alternative job options that I could pursue as ""backup"" plans in case my current path as a music teaching entrepreneur, composer, and community college professor, does not stabilize by mid-next year. I'm curious if anyone out there knows of careers I am not familiar with that could be a good path to pursue.

I am happy to get additional skill training for up to a year. Tech bootcamps are on the table. For a path I feel passionate and certain about, even 2+ years is on the table, but I am reluctant for extended training as I am already 28.

**General Background:**

Bachelor of Arts in Music, Bachelor of Arts in Asian Studies (Includes a year studying abroad in Japan)

Master of Music in composition

Many years of teaching experience, individual lessons and small groups, ages 4 to 65.

**Interests:**

Tech, education, music, story-writing, acting and media, sustainability, language study

**Why a backup plan?**

Professor-ships in music are rare and highly competitive and usually require a PhD, which I am not interested in getting just for the sake of chasing after these very rare positions. Until tenure is achieved, which is also increasingly rare in terms of availability, this job is not stable even if you have it. I think I would prefer a career path with more security in terms of abundant opportunities, so that even if I am laid-off for whatever reason, there are other paths I can pursue.

Meanwhile, I am not interested in teaching classroom music or going back to school for a teaching credential. 

Freelancing could work out with big effort, but it is not stable. I am tired of feeling stressed about money after years of being a student in the arts. A stable salary and benefits is highly appealing. I would rather have a stable job and do music on the side.

Thank you for your perspectives!"

Currently, I work as an image annotator for a company that does Machine Learning and AI. I began the job in June and yesterday my company announced ""Temporary Layoffs"" as they wait for a new contract to be signed with the client. I've been told by long term co-workers this layoff can be 2+ months and my employer hasn't given us a restart date...

I was already looking for other jobs but haven't landed anything. I'm doing a Udemy Course and learning to become a Full Stack Developer. It's a long and challenging course and it will be a few months before I am finished. I'm hoping to then make a few GitHub projects to see if I can land a full-stack dev job or a backend job.

But in the mean time I need something. I have a Master's in Cybercrime but not Cyber Security. During my courses they really didn't teach us any tech skills other than the basic use of Linux. I do know how to use Linux Mint. I feel like the biggest problems are that I don't yet having any certs and I don't have that 1-2 years of tech industry experience that employers like. I know the mantra in tech is spend a 1 to 2 years in a low entry level job, earn a cert and then the mid-level market will be begging to hire you. But laid off 5 months into my job, I'm not sure how this will effective me.

I also know how to use Windows Virtual Machine and CVAT. Are there any jobs I could get?"

i have almost no experience with negotiating or asking for specific types of hours, but i would like to ask if anyone has advice on asking for as few hours a week and/or the shortest possible shifts. should i discuss these things during my interviews? should i attribute it to my disability (or even disclose it during the interviews)? i am hoping to go back to college next year, and could attribute it to that if it sounds better to employers.

im afraid that asking for minimal work is going to hurt my chances, but ive also had a couple of opportunities where i was hired in 20&gt; hour advertised positions and then given 40 hours on my first weeks which i am incapable of doing, and would like to avoid having to walk out before i even start. thanks in advanced!"

Although the other tasks that were assigned to me went well, they let me go because of that one.

I was lucky to find another job and...I am doing more of the same type of stuff: I gather files and fill in invoices. It's quick and dull, I like it well enough but again...incompetent.

I feel....defeated. I thought I was like medium intelligent and turns out I can't do the most banal crap.

I really don't want to be fired again :(

I mainly wanted to vent. I hope I can find something I am good at that can allow me to live okay. If you have tips that were good for you, I'd be very interested, thanks!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your insights! Looks like I have a ""one-month check-in"" interview with my manager, our boss and HR next week. :( I don't think it bodes well but we'll see.."

In my hometown, where I just moved back to, there’s a cinema i’m a regular at. I’ve become friends with almost everyone who works there and the boss, Jack, likes me a lot. 

A couple months before I left for school, I had an interview at this cinema. The reason I didn’t get the job was because I was going to school &amp; they needed someone who was gonna be there for at least 8 months. They told me to email them if my plans changed and i didn’t end up going to school, however I did. Through this exchange, I got Jack’s direct company email, rather than the general one. 

Now i’ve returned &amp; i’m looking for a job, would it be unprofessional to email Jack’s direct email asking if they had work available or any opportunities they could extend to me?"

Note it is just me and the two owners in office everyone else is remote. Idk what to do anymore. Wouldn’t mind if it was remote, but since it’s in office idk what to do. 

Do you think they are slowly firing me?

I'm so fk fed up by how I have to be nice about it and can't just fire them. I'm sick of wasting my energy on this person.

He will be retiring soon and getting rid of the business, so I am pursing a different career.

I became a real estate agent nearly 2 years ago. I loved it, and had a ton of great experiences and interactions, and have had a mentor take me under their wing and help me a ton. But I’ve only made $4,000 in 2 years and the competitiveness is insane. And the cost of living where I am is also through the roof. I have a girlfriend of over 5 years and we likely won’t be living where I work now as the prices continue to rise (we live with my parents.) 

I’ve recently been accepted to go to Oklahoma and train to become an air traffic controller. It’s a career that my sister has, and one that I believe will give me and my girlfriend financial stability. Because I truly want to pursue this, I want to quit my real estate job before I continue to waste any time. 

This is the first time I’ve ever quit a job, as I’ve only worked for my dad and my real estate manager. I feel both my manager and mentor will be disappointed and shocked at me quitting. But I truly believe it’s best for me and my future. How do I go about this? Thank you all🙏🏻"

I know manufacturing and warehouse jobs are a good one — sometimes you can get a good paycheck as a lube tech, especially if they’re short staffed.

**TLDR** I worked for an autonomous driving startup and my role was contingent upon me having a valid driver's license and 3 years of driving experience (this is stated in my employment agreement). I am 30 years old so I am easily able to prove that I meet both of these requirements. After 4 months on the job I get pulled into a meeting with my manager and the HR director where I am told that I am being terminated because my driver's license had a previous suspension on it from 2020 due to an unpaid parking ticket. When I pointed out that the previous 2020 suspension had been taken care of in March of 2020 and that my current driver's license is valid, and pointed that I meet the requirements set out in my employment agreement, I was told that it didn't matter and that the decision to terminate was final. The termination happened exactly one month (to the day) after I had escalated a report and corrective action plan that I had written to upper management regarding unsafe work practices that seemed to be commonplace at the company.

So...

1. Do I have some sort of legal case here? Seems like a BS reason to terminate someone, and the timing of my workplace safety report (7/30) and my termination date (8/30) is too convenient. I would think that a good lawyer could argue that the company possibly retaliated against me for ""blowing the whistle.""
2. Should I leave this role off of my resume if I was there for just 4 months? If I leave it off I am afraid of the perception that recruiters will have when they see a gap in my resume. I am also not sure how to explain why I left a job after only 4 months should I decide to leave it on there. (Again I am 30 years old, so explaining such a short stint with a company at this stage in my career is a lot harder to do now compared to someone who is in their first job out of college).

Any advice is really appreciated."

I’ve worked for the past 4 years as a kennel technician in a vet hospital. I have always loved my job overall and have established lots of great client relationships and love all of my boarders and regular bath dogs. I even pet sit for a lot of clients. I get lots of cool perks for myself and my own animals as well. I have 2 bosses that are 50/50 owners of the office and they overall treat us really well. Since I started my goal was to work myself up to be a Veterinary Assistant. I have learned a lot and definitely have the basic fundamentals. I can do tech appointments, draw blood, administer vaccines, take vitals, etc. but for whatever reason whenever I try to move up it seems like the bosses make it really difficult for me to do so. A good handful of the vet techs who are there started in kennel and worked their way up a lot faster than 4 years. The last time I brought it up which was earlier this year they told me I could clock out on my half days and shadow like an intern. I’ve never done it because I work over 40hrs a week most of the time as it is and I cannot afford to give up my free time like that, and none of the techs who moved up before me ever had to do that. So when they told me that I started looking for another job and got an offer at a second hospital to work in their dog daycare. I ended up not taking it in the end because my heart was not ready to leave my clients and regulars and despite everything else I love all my coworkers and I just couldn’t do it. The manager at the new place was very understanding and said she admired my loyalty to the first office and left it on good terms.

Well fast forward to now, I am currently the only kennel technician. We normally have 2 or 3 kennel staff but one was fired and one quit cold turkey and they’ve been having a hard time filling the position. I’ve been understanding of that but lately am so overwhelmed. I went and spoke to my manager about how overwhelmed I was because I’m also now working 6 days a week because of it and I also am getting married in 2 months and then I’m also in the process of buying a house that will be ready in 3 months and so I just have a lot on my plate and I was kind of just brushed off when I brought it up. So I ended up reaching out to the manager at the other vets office and she offered me the job and I accepted and was ready to put my 2 weeks in at the first office. 

Well, the day of I go to put my 2 weeks in, one of my bosses handed me $100 bill and said it was a wedding gift. Then I thought to myself I can’t put my 2 weeks notice in after he did that, I would be such a jerk. And then like 15 minutes later my manager hands me a thank you card with $100 in it that said thank you for your hard work I am working hard to hire some help for you. 

Now I am conflicted. If I put my notice in I will feel like such a jerk. But I’m not totally unhappy there just overwhelmed in the moment. But on the other hand, I already told the manager at the new office I accept and I feel like if I tell her never mind a second time I will be a total jerk there too. I am just so conflicted.

Since I'm casual I thought about just giving them a week or two of notice.. but then I realized if I left within the next month the team will probably collapse...and I'm in a specialized role which that required a month of training which I don't think they could afford to give to someone else. I also think they will resent me if I leave because it will be a huge inconvenience to them...

But also I'm young and this job is getting me down. 

So I'm in a bit of a quandary over what to do now."

For a little context, i worked there for a year now and barely made any friends because the environment isn’t very friendly. everyone is very competitive and will throw you under the bus so they don’t get yelled at. This really nice new employee was hired; she used to work in a friendly environment and really hopes her new job could develop that at some point. Everyone loves being around her because she’s just such a positive person, me included. She has an empty desk next to her so I find that when i’m getting very depressed with the work, i go and sit there because it makes me more productive to sit near someone who’s actually capable of smiling in this terrible workplace. Anyways my boss got very pissed at that and yelled and told me to never leave my desk and that i’m slacking (even though i was getting so much work done so that’s a lie), and he told me instead of working i’m just sitting around gaining weight (i’m a really slim woman according to people but i have an eating disorder / body dysmorphia and his comment really got to me). and i hate that i cried but i just don’t do well people with someone yelling at me. 
i don’t know. i’m just very depressed. i tried to alternate between my desk and another because it was making me a little less depressed in the workplace but now that’s gone. I just wanna know, was i wrong? am i being very sensitive?"

Through indeed reviews it seems I may be selling my soul if I go to the new company. Most reviews claim management will have to work 55-60 hours per week and there are lots of internal problems, micromanagement etc. Also, I never had an in person interview ...only 4 phone interviews which is incredibly weird in retail. I want to see where I would be working.
I don't want to make it awkward with my present boss and company but a 20% increase in pay would be huge for my family."

I got a salary increase from it which was good which felt like a win-win. But I feel somehow awkward because of my colleague who was in the same role now being my manager. It was they first time in a management role. Also maybe because I started a few months before them. 

I feel like I still enjoy my role and I'm motivated but wonder if I might look at another job? 

I'll get the chance with my current manager to attend a management course which sounds good and also focusing on the path I wanna take next if it's management or technical."

My boss said we will be required to come in the two days the president is in and will be catered and I didn’t think a thing of it and thought it was just for show until I realized that they may be asking everyone into the office because they’re going to announce it and/or give us bad news. 

This seems like a unique situation that doesn’t happen often so I’m not sure if you would know, but are these treated like regular mergers where an outside company acquires your company? Or is it irrelevant because they’re already inside the same company? I want to be prepared because I was laid off 2 years ago when my company was acquired and given two weeks notice. It was super traumatizing during COVID and I almost had a mental health crisis. So wanted to be ready and prepared to look in case.

Edit: I should add that the parent company is in another country."

At first it was going well but it is important to note my entire department’s current staff all started around the same time as the previous few people had all moved on to new roles. I was unaware that that would be happening when I went through the hiring process. 

Anyway the job was good at first but the past 6 weeks they’ve been talking about expanding my department. In some ways it sounds exciting but I also don’t like change too much so it did make me a bit apprehensive. Anyway they were talking about getting another 1-3 people to do my job in addition to myself as they feel playing a greater part within the organization would benefit the organization as a whole.  Fast forward to recently my supervisor and her supervisor have started seeking out that much work proactively to back their idea of getting more people and in the meantime left me floundering. I have continually expressed needing assistance and not feeling supported from lack of knowledge required to do my job and having incorrect hours to complete my job as I need to be there at the same time as certain other staff across other departments. my supervisor has previously said she should be more hands on anyway based on our qualifications and seemed like she was going to take over some of my roles but has recently been very hands off. I could tell I was very quickly going toward burnout so I have been trying to take a step back and just take it a day at a time and recognize that I can only do what I can as my supervisor switches between telling me I’m doing a great job to asking why certain things haven’t gotten done despite me telling her I desperately need help. It’s taking a toll on me mentally and physically. Im not sleeping at night because I can’t shut my brain off, I’m sick again, and constantly getting migraines. 

How detrimental would it be to my longterm career path if I found a new job and quit after only a few months?"

See it as a stepping stone to life,u/abovesobelowmoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y41i55/dont_feel_low_because_of_where_you_work_see_it_as/,jobs,"When I was in high school, I got my first job at an industrial plant. Because I was still young, they gave me a basic job, nothing high pay and very physical work. To say the least, I was at the bottom of the barrel in the company. This other older employee had what appeared to be a good modicum of authority over us, though he also did the same job. He was very rude, not very nice, and would constantly criticize.

Since that time, I had near finished a four year degree, have a family, moved out on my own, obtained years of work experience, and had recently applied and got a job there (same place) again. 

They had hired me again, though this time I had a lot of experience, education, and was now a young, strong, independent individual. That old individual knows who I am, but won’t say a thing to me. They look the other way when I pass, and are still in the same position in life. Though this time, I not only have a much high paying job, I’m also in a much higher authority position within the plant.

This isn’t to brag, or write myself up. It’s to encourage people to believe in themselves. Working is about providing a service for your time. Always remember your time is the most valuable thing you’ll have on this earth. We never know when we’ll have more, we only hope we do. But if we have hope in ourselves, with time, we can truly obtain something miraculous, and set ourselves free. Every placement in life is a stepping stone. Never become complacent, find who you want to be."

Should I leave this job off my resume? Will they know I had it if I don't list it? If I do put it down should I be honest that I was fired or just lie. Will they know that I was fired if I don't say?

So today I got fired from my job after only being there for three weeks. I worked for a mid size engineering firm in their HR Department as an HR assistant, and this just came completely out of nowhere. In the three weeks I was there,  I was thrown into about 4-5 programs with minimal training, and was given generally good praise. I'm trying to learn the new HRIS system, all the additional spreadsheets and programs, schedule important meetings, monitor our covid tracker, onboard new employees and get their first day items ready among many other one of projects.   


Anyway, I get called into a meeting and informed that my performance isn't what the expected and that I was getting let go. I had been given constructive criticism once from my supervisor over using the wrong template for an offer letter, and that's about it. I don't know what I did wrong, maybe I'm just not cut out for this (despite getting my degree in HR).

Thanks to everyone who responded, I appreciated each and every one.

Today is my 7th day on the job, but the 3rd day I’ve actually had a computer to work from (I explained at my interview that my laptop was broken and couldn’t open pdf files and was assured I’d receive a company one ASAP but it was only delivered on Tuesday and I spend all night formatting and reinstalling the necessary programs at their request). In those three days I’ve mastered 4 important tasks which were done completely differently to any other college I’ve worked at. Regardless, I practised these skills and feel confident doing them.

Today my trainer had a panic attack and stated that I should be learning much quicker than I am and there’s so much more to get through that we’ll never finish. Upon querying her I came to find out that the girl I replaced had warned the management that she was leaving and to hire someone for her to train for two whole months yet they did nothing. Literally two days before leaving, they hired me and she gave me a 3 hour training session on teams and left. Now the girl I’ll be working with who is currently training me, is juggling the responsibility of training me, her job and my job until I learn everything. THIS is why I’m being pressured to learn everything so quickly. 

I completely understand her stance but at the same time I’ve been up and running for 3 days. I spoke to the manager and explained the situation, stating that her worry is logical given her workload but that I was working at a fast pace and would need time to learn everything. Rather than appease my fears he stated that he was under the impression that I had experience and would have been able to learn more than one task a day, and that I was too slow. (Bear in mind that an example of one “task” is learning how to prepare a visa application with all paperwork, documents and certificates filled in precisely, not some quick thing).

I’m stunned. I expected weeks of training yet after 3 days he told me I’m slow and should be doing everything by now. I mentioned needing 3 weeks and he scoffed that that was way too long, yet the girl who left told me that that’s how long she trained the other girl for when she arrived!

This is a bad sign right? What do I do? I need the money so badly but the stress is killing me…..

TL;DR = management has unrealistic expectations and the stress is making me sick."

Hope everyone Is doing well. I just wanted to gather some opinions based on what I went through at work. One of my coworkers is accusing me of hitting her in a space where there were no cameras. I obviously did not lay a hand on her as I am not a violent person. Well anyways, she ended up going to the ER and claiming that I hit her with a pole. This is just untrue and crazy. She went to HR and told them that I was disrespectful and that I had hit her. They said we’re both suspended but I overheard some coworkers say that she’s back at work and she’s been making fun of the entire situation and laughing at me. She approached a coworker and told them that because she’s a supervisor she can drop whoever she wants from the CO. And that they’ll always believe her. This makes me feel as if they’re neglecting my side of the situation and I feel like they’re going to terminate me. I feel like she is a liability to the company as she just lies and gets what she wants? Can I sue? What can I do to combat this? Thank you in advance for the advice.

Being a chef, I don't make  a TON of money, but I make enough. The issue is..

I live in super cheap staff residence on-site (like 400 dollars a month cheap). I'd love to quit because I'm sick of my sous chef and management is a dumpster fire. The only problem is the housing market is extremely tight and expensive out here, so unless I find another job with staff accomidations, I'm gonna be stuck here for the time being.

The resort is pretty remote, 45 minutes to the nearest town (Banff). And it makes it difficult to find new jobs in person, I can pretty much only apply online 

This job makes me very unhappy, and honestly, the things we're are told to do in the kitchen go against everything it means to be a chef, and I'm not proud to serve the food we serve.

I've been searching around on indeed.com and other job sites, but there isn't much out there for me, it would be very difficult to afford even a 2k a month apartment for me( that is the lowest price I've found so far, 1.8k a month) 

Do I just quit and ride by the wind? Or do I stick it out until I find somewhere to go, because as soon as I quit, I'm given 2 days to pack up my things and move out. So it is a very tight time frame"

Both companies never asked me if I was interviewing with other companies. 

Company A told me at the end of each interview that they are still interviewing other ""successful candidates like me"" while never giving me a clear timeline.

Company B gave me some, but failed to comply with it.

I'm salaried and co-supervise a handful of hourly employees. 

I went across the country for business travel this week and things started falling apart at the facility I manage. I made a detailed document (at his request) with step by step instructions for somebody to cover my daily duties, but expected my supervisor to assign the person covering for me (as he did the last 3 times I've been away). This time, he didn't, and I'm pretty sure he didn't even read the document that he asked me to make. I'm now going to have to work during my off days because there are a few things that need fixing because nobody was covering my daily duties. He has on several occasions chastised me for making requests across the department because ""I am not their supervisor"".

Am I justified in being upset and feeling like he dropped the ball, or am I not shouldering enough of the burden for coverage while I'm away?"

I work hard and take my job very seriously. Some of the biggest customers to my office reach out to management to make a point of how much they enjoy working with me and how great of a job I do for them. I make the company a butt load of money building these relationships and having the technical skill set necessary. by numbers, I am more efficient than almost all of my counterparts. Management told me for about 9 straight months that I was overperforming, they can’t believe how knowledgeable I am with only a couple years of experience, and on occasions recognized that I outperformed coworkers. 

I gained the courage to ask for more money. I pointed out my efficiency, my ties to VIP customers, the deals I made, the fact that I’m paid below market average. I asked for about 6%. 
The response I got: “you’re just so young. The money will come”
 “you’re no better than anyone else here, what makes you think you deserve more money” 
 “I think you make great money for your age. You won’t find something better if you try”

Found out a counterpart older than me, with less experience, makes about 25% more. Another counterpart, also older with zero prior experience, most definitely makes more but I don’t know exactly how much.

I know you’re not supposed to compare yourself to other employees but… fuck

Edit: I really appreciate everyone’s feedback, a lot of this helped me rationalize that I owe nothing to the company even if I like the people personally. 

There will likely be an exit interview. I’m really nervous about this part. To avoid conflict, should I just stick with “it’s just no longer a fit for me” and give no details, or do I be honest even if it’s insulting to management? 
This conversation between myself and management is definitely not the only factor to my decision…"

Started this job as an MA last Wednesday and was fired today. Reason being I took 2 days ""leisure time"" on Monday and Tuesday, which were my original start dates. Which wasn't the case at all, I got strep throat. I even went to the emergency room and everything so I've got papers. It's a shitty feeling, but apparently the doctor told the office manager I wasn't a good fit for the office either. I would have been okay with them just telling me that the job offer was taken back because they needed someone on the spot. But nope. They fired me today. They also said I needed to get my personal stuff sorted out before I go out and get my next job. So...yeah that's it. How's everyone else's Friday going?

Edit: sorry for the confusion. To clarify, no I don't work in a hospital, I worked in a doctors office for rheumatology amongst other things. The Dr who told the Office manager that I wasn't a good fit was The Doctor at that clinic not the ER Dr I saw. Also I had strep to the point breathing and swallowing and talking was unbearable, it got even more unbearable at 3 am, I did not know at the time it was strep throat so I went to the emergency room to see why I felt so ill. It was 3 am on a Monday. No urgent cares were open around me at that time. Also I am a Medical Assistant. Sorry again for the confusion."

My facility is an in-house SNF in northern KY and is 120 beds with 2 SLPs. I’ve been there 2 1/2 years.  (FEB 2020) 

The other SLP has been here closer to 3. She left her position due to moving and we are now seeking a replacement for her role. 
I looked up the listing online and the listing is for 39-44 an hour. 

Up until April this year, I was making 36 an hour. 
But then I was offered a position at another facility at 40 dollars an hour. Brought that offer to my Rehab director(boss) and the facility administrator (her boss) and was able to negotiate to 41 with my company and stayed. My company made it seem like that was a huge stretch and that was super high pay, but I was grateful for the raise, regardless. 

I have no idea what the other SLP made before she left. 
But should I be concerned that I am making 41 when they are willing to pay up to 44 for a new hire? 
Should I bring this up to my boss?
If so, how? Especially since I just got a raise in April from 36 to 41 an hour."

Our team's Sr. Director who started a month before me has recruited 4 of his old colleagues to join our team. One of the people from his team was \*hinted\* that he will be replacing my boss's job in the near future. (Even though he was hired for completely different role initially). 

Team dynamic is very awkward and tensed right now and there seems to be a divide between the old crew and the people who the director brought in. 

I have a feeling the director does not like me (or my boss) very much and is actively having his people shadowing/learning our work and I just feel very uncomfortable. 

I'm still very early in my career and was wondering if anybody else had the same experience?  
Is this something I should be highly concerned of and maybe starting looking now ? I am having a bit of regret join this company now. 

Thank you."

The well-paid position is a retail job in the telecommunication industry with AT&amp;T, it was the 2nd one after my 1st with T-Mobile. I quit the T-Mobile one because I felt like in the end retail was not meant for me. I hated pretending to recommend products I did not believe in to customer knowing they don’t need it. I hate lying to a customer and making things sound better than it is to get someone to buy something. I hate telling people something it’s part of a deal when it’s extra charges on their bill. All just to satisfy a greedy corporate. 

2 weeks into the AT&amp;T job and all the reasons why I quit the retail industry came back to me. I remember getting cursed out by my manager for not closing a deal on a super picky customer, or that one time he throws a demo phone across the store for the same reason. So I quit, because I know it will put a toll on my mental health again, because I don’t want to go through the same thing. 

Now I’m on a new job hunt, and I will most likely get a $15/hr job since I wont want to be in retail again, but I feel like I will be happier. I have mixed feelings about this. On one side, I feel like my Southeast Asian family will say I’m dumb and not determined to do anything for money, like I’m a coward.

Anyone in professions or jobs that have clients or stakeholders chase you for your business or services? Like being courted or treated really well in hopes of getting on your good side?

I'm assuming there's alot of market competitive laws that prevent alot of this from happening in the form of bribery for tender awards etc. But wondering if there any jobs where people are being treated to nice dinners, exclusive events etc. and how you got these jobs.

While I'm hoping to earn my clinical license and practice psychotherapy, I'm also thinking about some of the other paths I can explore down the road, especially with more education such as a doctorate or MBA. 

What are some lesser known positions that you've seen social workers or therapists fill? Have you yourself been in an unusual position? Some examples I can think of:

* Therapists at big tech companies (Youtube, Google)
* Working with insurance companies or corporations in Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)
* Mediation &amp; conflict resolution
* Human Resources, talent management/acquisition, 
* Healthcare &amp; DEI consulting
* Financial Counselors (financial social work)
* Research institutes, think tanks, R&amp;D (this is more for PhD level clinicians)
* Utilization review

Would love to hear what other options are out there, and about other advanced degrees that were combined with the MSW to create unique sets of skills such as the J.D., MPH, MPA, MBA, MPP, etc!"

I do not know how many top candidates there are, but I would estimate about 15-20 people made it to that first round of interviews and they narrowed it down from there. 

This is a position within the same company I currently work for, and it would be a HUGE step up for me. I also believe all of the other candidates come from within the company. I have already been told that the hiring manager loved my experience &amp; personality, so I just really need that to continue to shine through in a group setting as well. This is a remote position, so the interview will virtual. 

I have only done one group interview in the past - it was in person for a retail job and I did get the job. However, this is much more high stakes because they’re only hiring one person as far as I know, and this is a career with a huge salary increase and amazing benefits instead of an $8 an hour retail job that I worked in college. 

How do you make yourself stand out from the crowd in the best way during a virtual group interview? I want to make sure that I am remembered for all of the right reasons. I did a thank you email after the first interview which was responded to within an hour, and I also know this hiring manager has already contacted my current manager who had nothing but great things to say about me, so those two things could already be working in my favor. 

To say getting this position would change my entire life would honestly be an understatement. I know not everyone is religious, but I was praying for guidance on my next steps in life and how to get myself out of the hole I’ve been in. Very soon after, this position is posted with the exact hours I’ve been looking for, a huge salary increase, great benefits, fully remote work, and within my current company which I love. It was like everything I was looking for all bundled up into one, so part of me does really want to believe this is my big opportunity."

My goal is to get a job quickly so I can get into college asap(my dad also owes me 20k so I wouldn't be starting from 0). Basically I just want to major in computer science so I can then eventually get a solid coding job that would let me be reasonably financially stable, while also being able to learn and get better at using coding languages, so I can use them elsewhere for my own ideas on the side. I'm stuck right now trying to perfect the process so I don't screw this plan up but in reality I don't even know where to start. My best guess is just some entry level customer service IT job since that's probably the only thing I can land, are there any specific companies with this kind of position, that if I got, would potentially enable me to more easily get into a coding job in the future?"

My current program consists of 2 different buildings, and on day 3 of this school year, due to staffing shortages and lack of seniority, I got moved to the other building (same admin). The transition has been a nightmare, as I don’t have a functional workspace or place to even see students, so I essentially am walking around the entire building all day to try and find space to see students. The student population is also a huge learning curve, and different than anyone I’ve ever worked with in my career; most of my caseloads does not have aides either for support. I’m not tenured either (still have 2 more years until tenure), and my district is experiencing significant related services, space, and aide shortages, amidst a huge unexpected increase in student enrollment. I had great observations what my admin last year in the other building, and this year, I’m in a much less supported position (with the same admin).  I had my pre-observation meeting this week (with my actual observation 2 hours afterwards). My pre-observation meeting consisted of me crying in front of my AP due to the stress of not having a workspace and feeling inadequately supported, in general. My AP validated my feelings, appreciated that I was honest enough to tell her I was struggling, told me she felt helpless that she couldn’t improve the working conditions, and essentially told me that if I was looking at other job opportunities, she didn’t blame me either. I’m not even sure how I should have responded to that comment. My AP offered to observe me a different day/time, as she saw how upset I was, but I told her it was okay to still come and observe. My actual observation didn’t go as planned (including not being able to have an aide for my student due to staffing challenges), but I was flexible and engaged with my observed student the best I could.  2 days after this, my AP said they supposedly found a desk in a different building that would be shipped to me (unknown yet if it will fit though, which is another challenge).  Overall though, I feel very embrassed about my situation, and my AP has not mentioned anything to me about my actual observation feedback. As someone who isn’t tenured either, I’m worried I may have put my job on the line by complaining about my lack of resources, and that I will be marked down on my observation because of this. Union is aware of challenges too, but says there’s not much they can do, as this is an issue throughout the district (not just my building). Union will mediate through if I get an “unfair” evaluation. I’m actively looking for another job, but haven’t been successful.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to cope with feeling inadequately supported at their jobs? I’m really trying not to quit without anything lined up either..."

Right now, I'm studying to enter the Arts and Film industry, and I've done the research on internships for animation and film studios, but I guess I don't know, I'm scared to pursue either career field? 

I love the creativity and honestly, fun I have digitally creating, whether it's making motion graphics, animations, concept and graphic art, whatever to filming and editing videos to post on social media. And I'm aware that work is work, and it could potentially lead to some soul crushing. But I don't mind working and creating for somebody else, helping to produce a tv show or movie, or even working on graphic design and art for advertising or studio work for video games and animation studios. 

I guess just like, I'm really passionate about the idea of working at doing art and film stuff for a living, but I'm really getting caught up on the idea of it being a ""non-essential job."" As soon as I told my parents about what I wanted to do, I basically had to sell them on the idea like I was a real-estate agent looking to sell a multi-million-dollar home to some sketched out clients. Eventually they came around once I told them the horizontal growth the field has with the endless number of careers for me to pick from, but once I told the rest of my family, man, all I heard was ""hey, have fun working at McDonald's for the rest of your life."" Like, what the hell? How come they can indulge in all of the media they want, the endless number of movies and tv shows they stream to their living rooms, the unending number of magazines and art they can view, but the second they have to entertain it as a career? Well then whoopsie do, look what's no longer ***""essential and important""*** anymore. I have all the respect in the WORLD for trade jobs like HVAC, electricians, plumbers, doctors and so on, but this is important to me, and it's what I feel like I want to do with the rest of my life. 

Anyway, any advice on what I should do? I'm at a point in my life where it's now-or-never to commit to my career path, I almost have enough credits to graduate community and go to an Film or Art University, and I'm so passionate about working in the industry and meeting so many cool people, but I'm also worried about what other people think about me and making my family proud, I want them and my friends to take what I care about seriously. 

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this, I dropped something similar to this in other advice subreddits, but this one was pretty job-specific, so I thought I'd drop it here. Anyway, thanks for whatever help I might get in advance."

I had an interview back in mid-September for an IT position that was very local. I thought it went rather well personally, as it was over 70 minutes long as I was able to talk to multiple people that work there, got a small tour of the building, and even had enjoyable small talk with the employer and the employees too. As the final words were being said, The employer told me he was finishing up interviews the rest of the week and he would get back to me after they were done. I waited until 10 or so days later, the first week of October, and politely emailed him to see if there were any updates on the position. He emailed me back within a few hours saying his schedule got delayed a bit with some cancellations and postponements so he was aiming to make a final decision by the end of next week (which was this current week) but I was still in consideration for it. 

As you can imagine, I didn’t get any updates back yet so I was wondering if I should wait until Tuesday morning and send another email asking for an update on the position or should I just wait it out? I really enjoyed the interview and am nervous that if I don’t ask for an update, the company might not think I’m interested. But at the same time, I don’t want to pester either.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

The company I got a full-time offer from (SaaS) is asking if I'm interested in an internship there. 

The work I'll be doing as an intern (data entry) is unrelated to what I'll be doing full time but it's a chance to get to know the office and software I thought. But, at the same time, I also want to spend the last few months as a student doing things I probably won't have time for when I start working. 

My friend who also got the offer is going to do the internship because he ""had nothing better to do"". Should I prioritize gaining a headstart for when I start working, or my last few months as a student? 

**tl;dr:** Got an internship offer from a company I got a full-time offer from. Should I prioritize gaining a headstart for when I start working, or my last few months as a student?"

However I see this job listed as usually working for a hospital, government or school. Is there a similar type of thing where I could do 1on1 with families? Like could I do it sort of private practice style where I would advertise my own services and work for myself without it being so “doctors office” style? Or even have more of a referral type relationship with certain professionals as opposed to them just “coming to my office”? I feel like the type of family I aim to help would be more likely to receive this kind of therapy type service from someone who isn’t directly tied to an authority if that makes sense."

My reasoning for charging:
- Better salary
- International company

My hesitation to bot change:
- My current employer trust me and they want to give me more responsibilities
- Still new, changing now might look bad on my resume

9,2022-10-16,Job Prospects,u/melljr12,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y5hpj7/job_prospects/,jobs,"Have been feeling bummed, and applied to several hundred jobs with no offers and barely interviews. The only time I get a reach out on LinkedIn is mainly for the current role I have despite requesting for a different role.

My current role is mid level Service Desk Analyst, and as I am about a year shy from finishing my ba in cybersecurity with a concentration in Project management, I want to start getting into entry level project coordiantor roles to eventually be a project manager since cyber security is really tight right now with jobs. So, I initially applied with an internal position in my company, the manager of the pmo department immediately reached out, got approval from my bosses and all in all I did four interviews with the whole team. Things looked good and we were off, they mentioned getting back in two weeks from my last interview. Cool. Was really hoping as this would also increase my salary, as in my role it’s already underpaid but I get good tuition benefits. I work for a hospital, which is an important factor later in the story.
So two weeks passes by, and I’m like okay, no news. The day after Labor Day, which was the next business day after two weeks, I emailed and gave my thank yous and what not, but did not hear from them. I knew it wasn’t good. Then I got an email from HR to finish out my HR interview process, which is normally done before. I asked how my prospect is looking, HR said there’s another candidate.


Now, the job description only required for mid level, a high school degree and 1 year of hospital or IT work, with a preference for associates to Bachelor’s degree. The senior level was the same except three years of hospital or IT. I do have my associates in Computer Science and Business admin, with a college cert for network engineering. So I’m not under qualified.

I find out the following Monday, which is a month after the interviews, that I wasn’t selected and given a cold email with no explanation as to why I wasn’t a good fit, for future growth, which is something our CIO is particular on. 

I waited to see who the candidate was, and ended up finding out she’s from the clinical side, and has a bachelors in Psych and Masters majored for her clinical job. Of course she’s definitely overqualified. I should also mention, they did have a position for a project manager which would be more in line if they went for degrees alone, but regardless I don’t feel the fit was there and I am a bit but hurt about how difficult an entry level job even is. Of course, it doesn’t change the outcome and I did end up emailing last week after finding out who got it, and just asking how I could have been better qualified for the position as that career is my path of choice. So we’ll see. 

I’m also still on edge if there was any other factors that maybe discriminated or if it was just nepotism. 

TLDR, Regardless, just the factor they selected a severely overqualified candidate how can we even navigate this as job searchers. I get there is always someone better, but I wish the overqualified would just stay in their lane and let us newbies through. 

Bit of a rant too.."
8,2022-10-16,Leaving a job after 6 months?,u/flowergonzalez,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y5ihd4/leaving_a_job_after_6_months/,jobs,"I started a job in April as a payroll specialist/ hr admin assistant and I want to leave the position but it’s only been 6 months.

Pros: manager and most of the staff are nice. I have learned a lot about payroll processing. Good benefits. 

Cons: commute is an hour and 15 mins each way. Stuck in old ways not open to change (a lot of paper is used). It’s a lot of work for one person. The manager is aware about the workload but hasn’t really done anything about it and she herself is overworked and always stressed out. I have mentioned we need to have at least 2 full time employees because we are about 350+ staff and just filing can take up days but I guess the CFO doesn’t see that. 

So would leaving after 6 months look bad in a resume?"

I have been busting my ass in my financial service role for 16 months. It is my first job I’ve had after a 2 year hiatus and I accepted it because I interview badly and it was the only firm that gave me an offer (I lost a lot of confidence after quitting a similar role at a different firm due to burn out and then the havoc of the pandemic). I have given it my all, I am very competitive and also a people pleaser. All of my KPIs consistently outperform that of my peers, My work output is higher than everyone on my team, the quality of my work always ranked highest, and even though being a registered rep was not a requirement for the role, I took the initiative to obtain my licenses (7 and 66, had to retake because they expired from previous firm). That didn’t get unnoticed - by that, I mean management was quick to throw me on the phones to do trades and corporate action elections whenever call volumes spiked or they failed to ensure adequate coverage even for foreseeable circumstances, despite me never actually receiving trader training. In January, compensation increases were discussed and I was disappointed that my raise and bonus was exactly the same as every one else on the team, even though I was the best performer, volunteered for additional responsibilities and got my licenses (nobody else was registered on my team).
Fast forward to last week. I have maintained, if not improved, performance in all of our deliverables. I applied to a new role in a different department, interviewed (fairly well for once) and was offered the role. The role is client resolution specialist in our risk and recovery department, which basically entails taking care of client escalations and complaints. It is a much more challenging role, and although I enjoy a challenge, I worry I made the wrong decision. I was told it was a lateral move, so there was no increase in salary. Keep in mind that department is burning down and they are desperate for help. It is more work and it is more stressful (resolving angry client complaints ALL day - my current role seems so cushy compared, I am sort of like a processor and make Outbound calls for account remediation, so happy not to be an inbound rep).

I have never actually received a”promotion” in my career , so I was excited for the offer. Obviously they think I am capable to perform duties of a more complex role. I asked the HR rep if there was room for negotiation, (mistake -I think I should of just countered or asked for even a little increase outright), she just repeated that it was a lateral move and that my compensation would be discussed in January along with everyone else based on the performance in my current role. So I just accepted the offer for a more stressful role with a higher workload for the same pay I am receiving for a job I can do with my eyes closed. 

I am a woman and am terrible at negotiating. While I feel proud that I got the offer, I feel like they are taking advantage of me, trying to squeeze blood out of a stone or whatever the saying is. 

What SHOULD I have done? Can I retract my acceptance and add stipulations? 

PLEASE advise!!! Thanks in advance"

They are really interested in me and I'm pretty sure they'll offer me the job. Too bad that I didn't have the same response to them. I have this bad gut feeling that it'll be a stressful, toxic environment. These are the red flags I picked up on:

\-told me the person I'm replacing decided to leave (not bad in itself but....)

\-proceeded to tell me the team was unhappy with her because she didn't know english well enough (got the feeling that they're already badmouthing her. Btw I'm in Italy if you're confused)

\-also complained about her because when they asked her to do someone else's job she refused and that I should be flexible

What do you guys think? If I get a second interview what questions should I ask? Should I contact this person and ask why she left the job?

I will feel guilty if I don't take the job but I also don't want to ruin my own life working a shitty job."

I'm a recent college grad and have been searching for a job for about 8 months. 

I have not been able to find anything at all that either doesn't seem wildly outside of my qualifications or ghosts me/doesn't reply/decides to move on from my applications (besides insurance sales positions with thousands of applicants that don't respond either).

I understand that this job hunting is supposed to be an uphill battle, and often causes a lot of negative feelings, but it's so hard to continue without seeing any light at the end of the tunnel. I have sent out well over 100 applications, and have only received one interview and around 10 or so denials. I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking for, as every entry level position seems to be with engineering or data analysis and accounting, which is not at all in my realm of study.

All I want to do is work hard to prove myself to an employer, but it feels like I'm not wanted or needed anywhere. I feel that I am incredibly teachable and have (had) a drive to learn anything and everything that I need to for a position, but I feel like I'm clueless until I get to that position. I had planned to learn a programming language at some point to have a chance at anything, but my recent inability to focus and mental state have prevented that so far.

It's been excruciatingly difficult to think positively recently, or even focus on anything, and the thoughts that I'll not be able to support myself anymore in the near future or ever achieve my goals has lead me to feel that it's better than I'm not around anymore than continue the mental agony of feeling worthless to the people and companies that I'm to rely on for survival. 

My retail job has been slowly killing me physically and mentally, and the looming thought that I'll be stuck with this physical and mental pain for the foreseeable future is draining my hope.

Apologies for the likely incomprehensible rant. It feels like my thoughts and focus has been attacked with a hand blender, and my mental state is very dire these days. Thanks for allowing me the space to rant."

As background/context; I returned to my job after 4 months of STD; 3 weeks ago- was cleared by myself, my General Practitioner, psychiatrist AND my insurance provider case manager. I had a gradual return to work order for the first 2 weeks (basic stuff, 6hr shifts, extended breaks) and then back to full 8's, no restrictions for this last week. 
I have a myriad of diagnoses that drain energy and make life difficult, but I have a whole slew of coping skills, medications and tools to use and aid me- meaning I struggle, but am not prevented from completing my daily tasks or being a danger; and all of them are slowly starting to make me stronger and allow me more better days than bad, decreasing the need to take days off (although it still happens) 
Now obviously since being back I've had to do multiple meetings and updates regarding my condition and how my return has been and how I've been managing: and my new General manager (only a month on the job) has decided that because I don't always get 5 or more hours of sleep; he's uncomfortable with me being on site, regardless of me having already been cleared. 
So now he's forced me back on short term (with reduced pay again) until my GP reaches out to the company Dr. And reiterates that I am in fact well enough to return to full duties safely and effectively. 
But of course I'm understandably pissed because up until that meeting (end of day on friday) there was no indication that anyone was concerned with my ability since I hadn't done anything remotely wrong, and was exceeding expectations for this stage of being back...
I'm also upset because I was proud of my progress and my ability to rise above my limitations and refuse to let them run my day to day life, and was finally getting back in the flow of things; but by the actions and words of my General manager, he all but told me that my hard work and effort wasn't good enough and that he didn't trust myself nor my medical teams decision, and vetoed it. 
I'm so angry because I've clawed my way back to some semblance of financial stability and now I'm back at square one with no way to change anything. Only wait and put pressure on my Dr. To reach out to theirs. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Can employers force you on leave when your medical team has cleared you?? 
Or did he seriously overstep boundaries and his station? 
Is there anything I can do about this?"

I don't have experience working an office job or being salaried. I just started a job where I have both.

My boss is just a great guy, and the job and environment are just about perfect. I'm really happy to be there.

It's a small office (my boss, me, and 2 other people are at that location). My boss leaves a couple hours early, and the other 2 are responsible for locking up the office.

I'm doing paid training on the computer so I can test for a license in a few weeks. I take a couple short breaks here and there (which my boss encourages).

At the end of the day I have found myself at a good stopping place/ a great starting place for the next day, a couple of times. This has happened about 15 minutes before end of day.

I'm also currently not able to do anything *aside* from study.

I'm just worried this will be seen as unprofessional or lazy, and want to make sure it sounds like I'm in the clear.

I'm finally at a place with a boss who treats people like people with people needs, pays enough *before* commission for me to live, and just generally fosters a positive work environment. I just started, but thought those times I left 15 min early made sense. Especially since I can't stay late, either.

I just really don't want to fuck this up, when good employers are practically unicorns at this point.

Can anyone tell me if I'm fine doing what I am, or if it's going to get me in trouble somehow?

64,2022-10-16,Does anyone ever worry about their job security just based on the sheer dysfunction of their workplace?,u/Oneofthosepeoplewho,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y5uhkc/does_anyone_ever_worry_about_their_job_security/,jobs,"I work in an office for a company that sells a membership based product. My workplace is extremely dysfunctional. Our software infrastructure is profoundly out of date and non-automated (the kind of stuff that makes you think it would be easier to just do shit on paper). We're extremely understaffed for the kind of output that the higher ups expect. Constant last minute asks from people all over the company, priorities getting shifted at the last minute and then people bitching that certain things didn't get done. Everyone's fingerprints are on everything because there's no separation of powers. I'm in customer support and I do accounting things.

This leads to constant shit shows happening. Things get done poorly. Bosses find out that things can only be done a certain way do to tech limitations and throw shit fits (even though they've been ignoring recommendations to upgrade our tech for months) I always worry that some shit show will happen that I'll be blamed for. Again, so many people's fingerprints are on so many tasks, priorities and business practices change so rapidly and incoherently, that there's no way to really objectively assign blame to one person or another, ever.

An example might be me saying to my boss ""hey, the system can't do X."" The boss thinks this isn't a big deal, but doesn't realize that the consequence of this is that the company won't be able to do Y. Boss is coasting along expecting that we'll do Y when the time comes. When I get pinged with ""hey, time to do Y,"" I'm the messenger. ""Well, because the system can't do X, Y is impossible."" It's these kinds of situations that I constantly worry I'm at risk of losing my job, because someone else will conveniently point the finger at me. They'll imagine some alternate universe wherein ""well if you saw into the future and did XYZ that would've prevented this even though you weren't in a position to anticipate or avert this."" I'm constantly in this messenger position when completely unrealistic asks get made.

We have an elderly employee that constantly gets accused of making mistakes. She's under my report. When I came on board, I didn't have any preconceived notions about her performance, just was told on day 1, basically, ""she's not that great."" Me, being fresh eyes, actually investigate incidents when she gets accused of fucking up, and lo and behold, in most cases she's minimally culpable. ""Actually, she is using this old outdated SOP that she was provided by you (boss) and it does say to do things the way she did them."" Which makes me wonder how much of this perception is rooted in reality. And makes me worry about the culture of blame at my company.

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder if anyone else has a similar situation."

All the time I spent looking to climb up the ladder to this position and it's really been a huge let down. My mental health has plummeted, I can barely enjoy a vacation, taking any time for myself always seems to come at the worst time...I'm exhausted from the grind. My team respects me and loves having me as a boss because I'm a lead by example type, but my superiors are always pushing me for more and I'm just too worn down. So that being said, I'm looking to make a career path change. 

I don't have any formal education aside from a HS degree and a few semesters in college. I have 10 years in the automotive industry in various parts roles. I'm quick to learn anything and have excellent interpersonal skills and consider myself very outgoing.

My first thought was looking into an outside sales rep position, brand ambassador, etc. I'd be willing to stay in automotive, just not at a dealer level. Any other ideas where my skills could be transferable? Going back to school is not really an option at this time with my schedule. Usually up at 4, into work by 6, and out between 5 and 6. Least I can settle for with current obligations is around 60k. Thanks in advance for any ideas and advice!"

So far I've been here for 5 months at a place called Crate and Barrel, My position in the workplace is called ""Merchandise associate"" Basically meaning I take product from the back of the store and deliver it to customers in the front, but I also do curbside pickups from the back door of our store. Anyways I've been liking the job and all of my coworkers are really good people. Anyways ill get to the point. One day i accidentally forgot my backpack which i needed for school at my house, so i called my sister to come drop it off at the curbside delivery that way i could just run out and grab it quick and be back to work in no time. All goes well and i run out and grab my bag and run back inside. I drop the bag right beside the door because i noticed that we were getting really busy and that i didn't have time to go run over to the front of the store and drop it off. However the lead store manager was also back there and by the time i went to go get my bag he had in his hands. He asked me if it was my bag, i said yes and explained that my sister had just dropped it off, All seemed well and he said he would put it with the other bags... About half an hour goes by and another manager in the store asks to see me in his office. I get there and both the actual head manager and the manager who asked to see me are standing there.. At this point im kinda shitting myself cause i thought i must have done fucked up something really bad. I sit there and the head manager makes me explain my whole story of how the bag ended up back there. I explain my story short and to the point, i even tried showing him texts between my sister and me, however he ignored that.. He started by asking if i ever had a retail position in the past which i had not so i said no. By this time im sitting in a chair while both of them stand infront of the door as if im gonna run out or something. The head manager then proceeded to go on about how he's worked in retail for billion dollar companies and how he has 20 years experience in retail... Nothing crazy rude about that part but afterwards he began telling me how he could end my career just as fast as it started.. in my head at that moment i started freaking out because i know he was assuming that im a thief.. this goes on for an hour to the point i lose all of my attention to the conversation because im in shock that my boss really humilated me infront of another manager, but also the fact that he doesn't care about my evidence despite them even having cameras in the back that would show if im stealing or not.. I've only ever had like two conversations with the head manager and didn't think he would threaten my career on the third conversation.. Im still pretty shook about it cause he's yet to apologies or anything. what should i do??"

At the time he was working at a gas station call center, and quit shortly after since he just started school and wanted to move down to something part time. He's been searching for weeks and landed several interviews with mixed results. He's either been turned down or the amount of money that he was offered in the beginning turned out to be a lie to get him into the interview. 

On the contrary, I've been incredibly lucky and I've absolutely nailed every interview I've ever been to (aside from my first one ever. I bombed that one so bad that I think the interview gods are taking pity on me now). So watching him struggle so much breaks my heart. It sucks to watch him be rejected again and again to get the most basic, entry level jobs when he's almost 30 already has a degree in a different field from what he's studying now. 

I want to be supportive while he goes through this without seeming like I'm pressuring him to get a job. He's never asked me to help pay for things on our dates, and I'm terrified to think that he's putting himself into debt or something for my sake. What can I do to help him find a job and let him know that I'm here and that I care about him? Should I bring up that I don't want him to get buried in a bunch of credit card debt for my sake? Any advice would be helpful."

Basically my country is third world country. Trying to move to EU country because I am sure that my country is totally useless in actually getting in EU, so I want to improve my life conditions and my family. I have experience working remotely most of my life so my financial status is not bad, but my other part of life that are not depending just on me and my family are pretty shitty here, like healthcare, education system for kids, political situation, corruption, etc.    


Most of the interviews went pretty well, until the point when they become aware that they need to do some extra paperwork with work visa allocation. When interview is done the following couple of days I receive email that they will not continue with my application. They wont tell me directly but in lot of cases I feel that it is one of the reasons. I am not saying that in every interview there aren't any other reasons and that this is the only reason, but in most cases I feel that if I am citizen of EU I would land a job easier.  
I dont blame anyone and I understand that companies have their own calculations, but I just feel helpless just because I was born in country without any future, to have much less chance to land some job that if I am in EU would probably get or atleast get it sooner, even some lower positions are not interested.  


Does anyone have any advice in terms of what to do. Should I first move out to desired country in EU, and than look for job there, or should I continue to look for the job like this, with slimmer chances than other people that dont need paperworks to move from country to country within the EU? Why would any company go trough any visa trouble when in almost any case they will find candidate with same knowledge within EU?"

After completion of the program, the estimate pay of the new job that I will be seeking is roughly around $75,000/yr-$95,000/yr. This number is based on what I researched on the internet (glassdoor, etc) for this job in my specific area, as well as what my mentor who has decades of experience in the field said as well. The $95K would probably be reserved for people with years or experience and/or a grad degree (which I have neither of) so I would probably be expecting an offer at the lower end of this estimated range.

My question is, in the event that I receive an offer after an interview and it's time to negotiate the salary, is there a possibility that they would low ball me due to my last position paying much lower than the $75K-$95K? In other words, once they find out that my last position paid $39K, will they then offer me a salary much lower than $75K?

I don't have experience negotiating salaries so I'm quite new at this."

I'm graduating from high school and don't really know what to do, I want to take a 1 year break before I go to university and do something probably related to cybersecurity or computer/data science.

I don't think chances of me graduating with a WACE are high, for 2 whole years I was in denial or something so my brain just didn't work with English class.

I feel like I can get in via alternate pathways such as by getting training in TAFE. I have a decent predicted ATAR but i don't know if i can use this to get into uni or not.

Any recommendations or helpful stories of personal experience about something like this?"

I would in the FinTech space (""Metaverse"") and I do not think the business I work for has a high chance to succeed. I only took the job because it paid higher than my last despite not believing in the business model.

My boss has been mentoring me to become a better manager. I am not sure how to process this so some perspective will help:

1. He told me it is not in my nature to be aggressive but I need to be firm with our vendors
2. I have skills as a middle manager and not upper manager. And that he will train me up for it

I've posted before here on how I have always felt like a failure despite what I have achieved and I was told to pursue an upper management role. 

Question is should I just look elsewhere if I do not believe the business will succeed or just stay and learn from my boss who's really kind and willing to teach. If so, how do I express why I think the business may not succeed and mu suggestions to turn it around."

I am finishing Enginnering at one of the best univesities here in Brazil.

At first I didnt got any important task during this Internship, so I worked my ass off to get the confidence of the team... And it did not worked a bit, every time I try to participate in decisions or give my opnion people dont listen to me and think I cant contribute. Also I dont have anyone in my Team to teach me stuff, all I learn is from people from other divisions. All that my team gives to me is tasks that dont require any brain usage, sometimes I dont even know exactly what I am doing, because of ""It is important confidencial stuff"".

I earn a shitty sallary and have alot of friends earning more then 6 times what I do and are also specialists in the companys they work for. I want to move to jobs in Bank or Consulting, but I am getting rejected every time.

All that working enviroment, rejection and seeing my friends doing so good are destroying my confidence and I can feel that people that inverviwed me can notice it.

I feel so bad about myself. I hate myself. Why is nobody ever accepting me. I graduated from a good university with a good grade. Performed well in school. But no job ever accepts me and it makes me think that im a fucking loser. I did everything. Did my research and practiced for interviews.i have work experience. Wide skillset. But it frustrates me that no job is accepting me. I feel pressured. I feel depressed. I dont know what to do. I did not and cannot even follow the career path i want. Cause no one is accepting me there too. I want a government job. But i dont have the strong credential cause i also failed the civil service exam. Im so disappointed. I dont know what to do with my life anymore.

Later that day I received 2 of the forms for verification but not the 3rd and not the benefits information. It took a little longer for me to get in touch with my references (I like to ask each time) so I sent them an email Thursday early afternoon with their information and asking about the missing form. I followed up with a voicemail Friday morning.

I haven't heard anything since Wednesday. All previous offers I've received moved very quickly so I'm beginning to get concerned that I haven't heard anything from them in 3 business days. They haven't reached out to my references yet, I asked.

The problem is they want to have me drive to another state 5 hours away for training (even though the position is onsite 15 minutes away from where I live) and they said they would be paying for my hotel and mileage. Because it would be too expensive to fly me out there and get me a rental car. I was okay with that. Today, they changed what they said and only said they could only pay for my hotel every day but friday and saturday nights even though the training is 2 weeks long. So I would have to drive there tomorrow and then drive back home on friday and then drive back on Sunday to finish out my training which is next friday. Is this completely unreasonable and scammy? I've never heard of a company that doesn't pay for the full hotel stay especially considering they're forcing me to drive out there...But now they want me to drive there and back for an extra 10 hours.

  I managed to get a lot of certifications for various Adobe programs, Microsoft programs, HTML/Web Design, Unity, and Toon Boom during high-school and I recently started doing some art commissions on the side for a bit of money so I do have some experience with working with clients/customers - a lot of the remote positions I’ve been looking at are not entry level so I was wondering if it is possible to find fully remote jobs as someone with no job experience and no current degree/college experience? Also something that would be flexible enough to do through college since I do plan to start college in August of 2023.

As far as job types go, I have no idea what would be a good fit since I’ve never been in the field before. I’ve been recommended to look into data entry by some family members though so I’ve been looking at those, I don’t think I can do any creative roles until after college though due to the requirements I’ve seen.

  Are there any alternatives I could consider? Do you have any advice?

Never able to get ahead. And it's always seemed that basically every time I do happen to get a little ahead, and get some savings, something catastrophic happens. 

The short list of some of the things that have happened to me when I thought I was building breathing room: 

* A former roommate's ex-boyfriend smashed my motorcycle to pieces when he was mad at her, and it was not salvageable
* My car's engine blew up within two weeks of moving several 
hundred miles from where I lived for a new job, and had to buy a new car in cash with the second paycheck I got. 
* The new(er) car I bought, I then got sideswiped at a red light less than four months later, and it was totaled. Took two years to get my small insurance settlement and be able to buy another car in cash at the time.  
* Said next car ran fine for about a month, and then needed new pads, rotors, calipers, radiator, and radiator hoses, and then two new tires in the course of a month. All while I worked as a journalist for a POS small town newspaper for $13 an hour. 
* My dog passed away, and I had to pay several hundred for his cremation and vet services.
* Moved cross-country for a break from the midwest, and was staying with a friend, until I got my own place. Once I got my own place, began getting parking tickets if I left my car running outside for 15 minutes while I went inside to get changed from one job to the next, eventually leading to a boot on my car as I headed to start a newer, higher-paying job. (this is all of course e my own fault, it just seems like it compounds and I can't ever get ahead is my point, fault or not). 

And so forth. 

So from the time my contract for a non-profit as a digital organizer ended in 2020, until I took a new position at a brewery in July of 2021, was about the only respite and time of calm and peace in my life. 

I had $5k in the bank, all my bills were paid, and could breath easy, and was making enough with the federal aid in unemployment that until I took the job in July, I didn't have to take the first job I could get no matter how bad it was. 

I was able to go cross country with the dogs, twice. Stayed on the gulf of Mexico in Port Aransas, TX, and camped on the beach with the pups, visited 20 states, and camped across America. Went to the great Sand Dunes in CO, and visited Mt. Evans, the highest road in America, at 14,410 feet, just within a month after being on the Gulf of Mexico. 

Now I'm back to living paycheck to paycheck, after having to pay deposits, moving costs, and everything else to move for my new job I've been working since April of this year. I like my job, but it's extremely stressful and ends right after the election, so I'll be back to square one. 

And the only thing I want to do is just go back to having savings and find a way to actually lead a better life, and do what I want. Not work grueling, grinding jobs to make other people rich while I live in squalor. 

It's exhausting. But I don't know where to go from here. So I guess I'll just keep grinding til the wheels fall off this old corpse."

there *was* a second doc with the 15th deadline but the first doc aligned with what she told me verbally: the 28th.

i (19f) have worked at my job since january. it’s in food service. we recently got a new coworker (19F) i will call her ‘A’. A is very forgetful. i always have to clean up after her because she forgets to put away things. whenever i ask her to put things away she would act annoyed and never end up putting things away. i get it’s annoying to be reminded like that but she has been here for a month at this point and i am tired of cleaning up after her. everyone at my job recognizes her problem with giving attitude and having just an overall poor work ethic. two days ago i was working a shift with her and i asked her to put away something. she told me she has short term memory (i didnt think she was serious about it) and i’m like hey, i get it i have attention deficit issues but could you still please be more mindful . she then screams at me in front of customers calling me a rude bitch saying how i invalidate her disability and that it’s as bad as cancer and how i don’t know her struggle. she literally yelled at me for five minutes in front of customers. i said if her disability affects her work performance she should ask for reasonable accommodations. she told me to shut up and how her disability is none of my business. i literally said nothing and just rolled my eyes because i could not believe someone who was working here for a month was talking to me like this. and of course i know people are disabled but honestly her short term memory is such bullshit because her memory is fine unless i tell her to clean up after herself. i was so upset after this and told my manager and he said he would talk with her. i told him i was not comfortable working with her the next day so he takes ME off the schedule. Why am i losing hours over this dumb person???? it has been two days since it happened but all my boss told me is “we will sort it out going forward” like what kind of response is that? am i crazy for thinking she should not be employed? should i just quit or talk to my boss more about it. i was so upset after that i was literally shaking because i try so hard to be nice to people and i was not ready to be screamed at like that"

2,2022-10-17,Is there very specific criteria for hiring entry-level(zero recruiting experience) agency and/or corporate recruiters? I can't seem to catch an edge on a job in the field for the past years.,u/jaywonger93,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y6l54g/is_there_very_specific_criteria_for_hiring/,jobs,"Either I interview terribly, my application/resume is poorly written, or my experience is just not good enough for the job. I've been applying to very regularly for every recruiting position(recruiting coordinator, associate recruiter, staffing manager, talent specialist, etc.) since 2019, and I can't seem to get my foot in the door even for agency recruiting. COVID kind of put a damper on things, and I'm having trouble getting my bearings and getting responses for recruiting.  


I've tried both the large staffing agencies and the smallest boutique ones. I understand it's easier to enter recruiting via the staffing route way so a lot of my focus is there and I'll put in the time and work and move around from there as I see fit. But it seems like maybe they only want new graduates from college? I graduated in 2019 with a degree in marketing and held a few office admin jobs which have allowed me to gain necessary experience. I've had two jobs after graduating– got laid off from one, and held one other job since then. I'm looking to re-enter recruiting as I just recently moved to a new state with my partner and had to leave my last job. It's really a terrible time for jobs as I know there are many layoffs on the brink of recession, but any advice on how to break into agency recruiting(or corporate) is greatly appreciated!"

**Background and Details**: I am currently interviewing for two companies - Company A and Company B.  Both are great opportunities, but I would prefer Company B due to higher salary, better benefits, and a better product.  Company A is also an amazing opportunity and is also offering great salary, benefits, and a good product. Both companies have high Glassdoor and G2 reviews.

 I have to prepare a presentation for both companies as part of the final steps of the interview process. Company A will be on Thursday, Company B will be on Friday.  Company A has been very fast to respond and has moved me forward on the interview process typically within 24 hours, whereas Company B can take a couple of days. I am fully confident in my presentation skills and do not feel like I will mess this up (I'm thinking completely positively right now for sake of this post).

The Question:  I know that Company A will not have any interviews beyond the presentation, with an offer call being the next step.  Company B will also follow this, but it was implied there might be one more interview after the presentation with one more Sr. Executive.  If Company A offers me a position and I am unsure of the timeline left on Company B, what would be the best course of action here?  I would want to accept the offer after a little deliberation, but ultimately if Company B offers me a position I would take that instead.  I  understand that if I accept Company A's offer and then turn it down, I will be nuking a bridge.  

Maybe I just needed to type this out to help deal with the thought process ultimately, but I'd also love to know what you all would do in this type of situation and what would be the most diplomatic option."
1,2022-10-17,should my wife find a new job?,u/avin8701,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y6mo32/should_my_wife_find_a_new_job/,jobs,"So my wife is paid fairly well at a start up, but she has no manager and is constantly blamed by others that she needs to do more. The problem is a majority of the company is a bunch of guys that worked together before, so her voice is abysmally small. They even hired her an assistant that they liked even though the work was not there for her (she pretty much had no say), now they are saying why the assistant is not working and talking to others while they work. Don't get me wrong there are thos that like her, like some of the board of directors, CSO, and CEO, but in small groups she's blamed for one department for not fixing stuff (even tho it wasn't part of her job description she just does it to troubleshoot and since there isn't enough work). Her job is dependent on those same people providing her the material she needs to complete her section. 

I want to state I was recently let go, (and actively looking for another job). My opinion is to stick it out, with top brass looking at her favorably I believe that when the company does expand they will offer her those director/VP level roles down the road, but I don't want to force her hand either, I just see it as the nature of work, and her being soft spoken. I've advised her to speak up,  but again because of how close knit the other employees are and how against her they are she's worried that rocking the boat will give her the boot.

Thank you for the read."

I am looking for any words of wisdom. For some background, I’m an undergrad sociology student and it’s my senior year. I am lucky enough to have scored an interview with a non profit that is looking for a community outreach/engagement position. I felt pretty confident at first. 

HR sent me a list of questions to look at in advance. That was awesome of them, and I’m so glad they did…because now I’m worried. I would have been blanking if I didn’t know them. Basically, they’re asking about experience regarding donation solicitation and whatnot. This plus  other questions, but this is making me nervous. I have no experience with that whatsoever. I am actually terrified. 

I know it’ll be fine regardless of what happens, but I’ve never interviewed for an internship before. I have a mixed bag of job experience. Any help or assurance? Ah!!!

Edit; I will be doing this as a volunteer internship next quarter if I get this position."

I gave my current employer a resignation letter and was immediately asked what it would take to stay. Fast forward after the weekend my current employer came back with an even higher offer than the new company (25% higher than my current salary and nearly 15% higher than the new company) with the opportunity to create an entirely new role that is theoretically being made for me and has never been a position with the company. So it would be a new position that I have limited experience in but they think I can excel and be a large help to the company.

Is it dumb to think about staying with my current company?  
If I decide to stay, how do I decline the job offer from the other company that I already accepted? The starting date is tentatively Nov 7.

It all seems overall okay, except for one coworker who is extremely rude (literally swearing loudly, being a snake/bully in front of and behind the back of other collegues that point that out). Other collegues just tell to accept her, because 'if you don't have problems with honest people, you won't have problems with her'. Imo, she's just being extremely vulgar and aggressive. Honesty doesn't necessarily require being like that. I don't mind swear words at all, if they're used sometimes, but this is something else. This kind of bothers me and makes me want to avoid that person as much as possible, even though I, as everybody else, have to work with her. It feels like sitting besides a burning trash can. I have a feeling she's one of those people who think that the one with the loudest voice is more right. 
I've never been in a situation like this, so I'd appreciate some advice. Thank you!"

“it was brought to his attention “ that employee from another department said I told them things that “didn’t make them comfortable”  , and he keeps telling me just be careful how you say things. This happened twice, I swear I always use all that phrases to make sure I’m nice and accommodating such as , please, can I , would you, thank you, can you , you welcome anytime… etc.) I’m close to kissing-ass on how I talk and I know many people who hate a person for their skin color or race , will hate no matter how nice that person is nice to them. 

He refuses to tell me their names and what it was said to them (as this is against the company policy ) and what made them upset or annoying. 
There was a time where I feel like he blames me on things just to make me get better at my job I’m ok as long as he doesn’t put more pressure on me but I feel like this isn’t professional to do and Now I’m the one who started to feel uncomfortable. However, I don’t want to make enemies at work and I don’t want to talk to HR about my boss as well talk to HIS boss . Thats Because I know he is in a higher position, he will not lose his job because of me ( entry level person ) and this will make it more worse for me as he will not trust me. which will stop me from promotions and team trustworthiness and perhaps can lead to bad review.

I’m not saying he is lying a 100% to me nor I’m asking if I should report him . I need your advice on a way to talk to him without losing my job and without getting him mad . I’m 24 male married with 3 kids  so I can’t just quit. This is very complicated to deal with. I’m getting close to be quiet all times at work and minding my business but we all know we have to make interactions with people at some point . With that being said I am confident that I’m not being an asshole to employees around me in my organization but I feel like this is starting to get out of control. P.S Sometimes I don’t feel like my boss is trying to get rid of me using special tactics that some bosses do to cover thier nasty corruption in an organization without getting questioned by law / hr department because he keeps encouraging the team to open doors for me by letting me access certain sensitive areas in the job. But at the same time I get so delusional about it and think he is doing that to make it normal but he will stabb me in the back anytime. Smh I’m so confused as I never had a job like this."

I've been unemployed since June - facing a lot of rejections and lowball pay offers. Finally, I got offered a part-time job in my training field (20-33 hour weeks) but am (of course due to anxiety) second guessing if I should go full-time instead or just accept the fewer hours. I'm personally at a loss on what will work for us and need some advice. What has worked for your schedule? How much time do you put into your school per week and how many jobs/job types do you do at the same time to afford it? (for those who were or are in school).

Also, is this good pay for part-time? The job pays $23 an hour and my two weeks of virtual training will start November 1st. My courses for grad school also start this week and we're also moving into a $ 1,550-a-month apartment next month. So yeah, it's a crazyyyyyy season. Literally."

2,2022-10-17,3.5 months long zoom calls/project/in-person interviews. Does the company respect my time?,u/DrewHaef,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y6vx1t/35_months_long_zoom_callsprojectinperson/,jobs,"So this has been a very long process, and almost two weeks ago they flew me in for an in-person interview day, and I honestly felt like my interview day wasnt handled that well. I'll get into that in a bit, but first, here is a quick breakdown of the process I have gone through:

- First contacted by recruiter June 30th

- Interview with hiring manager July 6th

- Interview with co-founder July 20th (They are a mid-size start up)

- Then I was told they needed to take about a 4 week pause on my interviews to hire two new roles above me

- They then requested I do a project for them on August 24th

- The reviewed my project and by Sep 7th

-  They scheduled me for a trip to visit the office for an in-person interview on Oct 5th

- I had a full day of 4 different hour long interviews on Oct 6th. Then flew home with no information or offwe.

- I am supposed to hear from the hiring manager this week.

Now, the day I showed up to the interview, the first 15 minutes were supposed to be an office tour. I showed up, no one greeted me at the door (no receptionist). So I just walked into the office and started looking for a familiar face. I stepped out into the main office and people were working at desks right in front of me. They looked at me and never said anything. So I kept walking further into the office. I walked clear to the back corner of the office before I found someone I knew. He said hi and showed me where the coffee was. That was the entire extent of my office tour. There was basically a group of 20 people working right there in the main office that I was never introduced to, although I was walked by them several times throughout the day as I walked from one interview to the next.

Then at the end of last interview the person who was conducting it asked ""So who do you meet next?"" I said, ""I think I am done."" He looked at my schedule and was like, ""Hmm yeah that's it... So what do you do now? Do you need to circle back with someone?"" I said, ""I don't know what I do from here."" So I ended up walking out into the main office again and slowly collecting my things just waiting for someone to acknowledge me and tell me what to do. Two people I spoke with earlier, popped out of a con-call shook my hand and said ""nice to meet you"" then headed back into their call. So then I just grabbed my suitcase and walked myself out of the office. The last guy I interviewed caught me as I left and said, ""This is really strange and I feel bad. So I'll walk you down.""

I left the office, flew home, and was told through email they'd be in contact soon. I've heard from them through email since. They've asked for references which I sent. 

I don't think they are turning me down, but now I am not certain I want to work there because of that experience.
Am I wrong to think that was poorly run?"

Few days later we spoke again about a higher level and discussed salary expectations. The salary they are offering is lower than the lower level position.

After a weekend to think it over - I turned it down. It felt like they wanted me to do more work for less pay and didn't even consider me for the original role I had applied for in the first place. After kindly emailing them and calling them back after they asked me for a reason why I declined the job - I recently got another email after one week of silence saying they'd still want me onboard ""if only I felt more comfortable in my abilities"" as they see me ""still being a great fit for the role"". The job is $28-$30 an hour with benefits, but the catch is that it works in two homeless shelters providing mental health support and social resources. I would need to be at two sites 30 minutes away from each other and an additional 30 minutes away from where I live. The details of the job sounded like A LOT of work. I'm also in graduate school and have a part-time job, it just didn't seem to make sense at the time. However, after thinking it through an idea I had was to take the job for only one day a week, (negotiate the details), adding that pay on top of my part-time $23 pay to increase my salary. While within a year I'll be done with grad school and on my way to being an LPCC therapist. I'm just not sure if I can handle jumping through all these hoops for this company - seeing how they communicate already, it isn't great. Should I email them back with my idea for one day's work or just decide to stick with what I got now?"

I really don’t want to get my hopes up, but got some very positive sounding signals. For example, towards the end the hiring manager said ”I feel confident that you would perform and I also need someone on the team that has been in the game for a longer time, who I can spar with.” He also mentioned that he has a certain brand portfolio in mind for me, as one of the target markets for those is also my home country (I’m an expat). 

The hiring manager and HR both talked about how they are flexible with WFH or while commuting, and with a certain brand portfolio I would also work some days in an office closer to where I live. They also said they have a great canteen so it’s worth coming to the office 😁

At the end the hiring manager said he is very happy to hear that I am still interested in the position, and that they will get back to latest early next week so there’s still time to give my one month notice before the end of the month, so that I could start in December. 

Salary wasn’t mentioned, but it was asked in the application form so I guess it’s in the ballpark 🤷‍♀️

Edit: I am of course still looking into other open jobs and applying, I also have an interview to another company tomorrow."

*English is not my native tongue so pls be considerate🙏🏻💛


2 months ago I got a job at a great company, with great salary and AMAZING boss and the team.
BUT… I am outsourced/ a contractor since they don’t have a headcount for my job at the company. It is a contract for 1 year with the possibility of prolongation. And in my country that possibility is an option for max 3 years, then…who knows. 
So, when I accepted that offer I just wanted to run away from terrible terrible job and that contract at the time wasn’t so important. But in the meantime I started to think about my future. I am over 30, and want children in near future. With that unstable contract (since they can decide that they eon’t renew my contract for example if I stay pregnant or get seriously ill) I am afraid to plan my future since I don’t know if they will keep me or not. And I dont want to stay at a company for 3 years when they can decide not to keep me indifinitely or don’t know if they will get a headcount after all.

I feel guilty since I started to look out for new jobs with indefinite contract since my team is amazing and my boss is wonderful and salary is great. 

What would you do in case you get the job with indefinite contract? 

Help and thanks ✌🏻😊"

I knew pretty early on during training it wasn't the right fit, and I was going to try it out for awhile. But at some point I just knew I couldn't drag it on and just felt so negative about it, so I talked to my boss and ended up giving a month notice (yeah, never again I know). The company had weird communication, basically none at all, and I was just tired of how the company ran. 

So after I gave notice things were slightly awkward with my boss - we would work together alone in a building pretty much every day, in a random isolated office. But he had lots of meetings so I would work alone too. But anyway, it's been about 3 weeks since I gave notice, and I had to take a couple days off last week because I was sick and the agency had intense covid rules. Then on Friday I went in, worked for a couple hours, and felt bad again, so I had to leave early.

Later that day, the agency calls and tells me my boss had contacted them, they found my replacement, and they wanted me to drop off my keys (to the office) at their office. And it was my last day of work. No contact from boss. No email, no last day to straighten up my desk, just nothing. My boss never wanted to see me again. No check-in to see if there was anything to finish. This happened like 3 days ago, and I have been feeling so weird, like I can't move past it because I can't believe it's just over. I know I gave notice and should've expected this, but they were just like ""fuck you"" except they didn't, all I got was silence. I just don't know how to feel lol. Like I'm happy the job is over, but I wanted to have things end on a better note? I honestly feel so weird that they would choose this, and it makes me feel so shitty."

The first one: AGM at a hotel downtown. Honestly I applied to this position semi as a joke but they actually took me seriously. I talked myself up during the interview to an extent (like everyone else does these days) and they reached out with an offer. This is a company I have never worked for before and don't know anybody that has worked for them. Reviews seem middle of the road. They aren't a big company but they aren't small I would say small to medium size. Compensation package is very good given the market and the benefits are good. There are a few things that worry me though. The hotel is very old, and has a party reputation, given its location (they are trying to change that and the property is up for a reno next year), would obviously be salaried but I wouldn't really have a set schedule, and probably would be working all over the place so I'm worried about work-life balance (staffing is ""lean"" as they put it), but at the same time it's a really great opportunity given where I want to be in this industry in the next several years. But I somewhat don't really know how the company operates as far as training and resources so I don't want to accept and start, and come off like I don't know what I'm doing. 

Second offer: this is at a company I used to work for, with a manager that I used to work directly with at one of my other properties. He's really a fantastic guy and recently took a promotion to run his own property. This is a operations supervisor position, so I guess if you want to look at it at face value it's lower on the totem pole compared to the first offer, but the hierarchy of that property will go the general manager, agm, and then me. Essentially he would be my mentor. He would take me under his wing and would teach me everything I need and want to know about every Department within the property. Ultimately I would have supervision over these departments, and a heavy hand in normal managerial duties like process improvement, recruiting, scheduling Etc. Essentially, through our conversations we had yesterday this would be in his words a introductory manager position to propel me to the next level within the next 6 months to a year whether that is with the company or elsewhere. I would have a set schedule, working mostly mornings.

The downside is the benefits are more expensive, and it is a pretty steep pay cut compared to what I used to make ($4 pay cut, but hourly so OT). I'm going to call him tomorrow to see if they can nudge a little bit on the salary but knowing the vice president of operations for the region I'm not very hopeful.

As far as my background goes I have quite a bit of Hotel experience, including manager experience directly in front office but I have cross trained in housekeeping and have done quite a bit of back office admin work. 

Any advice?

TLDR: two offers on the table. Not sure which one to go with yet. Dilemma."

If I feel like I haven’t done much I stay overnight to get more done so it looks better when I have a meeting. The meetings are to see what I’ve been up to and give me support btw. But I’ve had plenty of meetings where a person just says “sorry didn’t get round to it” and no one bats an eye. 

How can I be relaxed and just leave it. I feel no matter what I do, it won’t be enough unless I’m spending every waking moment on it. I’m treating everything like I’m being tested and it makes me sick with anxiety sometimes."

And then I just gradually found out how disorganized and dysfunctional the whole management structure is - and I guess I just answered my own question lol. I think the problem is that they are so bad at addressing and acknowledging these issues that I feel constantly gaslit just for thinking about how bad things are. I’m sick of all the gaslighting and “sweeping all issues under the rug”.

Idk how much time I’ve wasted applying for jobs on those sites, just to have my application go to the bottom of the pile. The other day, I started crying while filling out job applications because of how inefficient they are and how much I hate it. Indeed is a waste of time, but the application process on employers websites always take forever. They have the upload resume option that pre fills the app, but it ALWAYS fucks it up, so you end up doing it manually. 
 
It’s gotten to the point where I’m done fucking around. Why can’t I just email my resume to an employer/HR, and tell them to (politely and respectfully) cut the bullshit and just tell me if I qualify. Yes or no. If not, then I won’t waste my time. 

This could back fire, but I’m out of options. Idk how to stand out, the only thing I’m go but the point is to make an impression…in person. Especially in this job market, standing out is way more important now. And frankly idk how to do that. I’ve been on an off the job hunting since 2019 and I still don’t know what employers want, and don’t know who to ask. 

- A woman with zero fucking patience left

Edit: I changed some grammar and took out some of my aggressive tone. Forgive me I wrote this at 6am after staying up all night contemplating my life and all of my regrets. But my feelings of frustration and failure are still valid."

Normally, I would use a blanket answer along the lines of: avoid such topics in the workplace and while I'm open to other viewpoints, I believe there is a time and place and the work environment is not an appropriate place 

BUT... this company really prides itself on it's diversity and inclusion, so on the other hand I was thinking  along the lines of: We should identify the appropriate method of conversation and establish good intent and listen to learn.

On top of that, every inMail that I receive has been from recruiters that I know never looked at my profile or are offering jobs completely outside of what I know.

Just some background, I am working towards becoming a web developer, it's what I am in college for, and what I've been learning about since 2016.

From the time I started until June, I’ve experienced a heavy workload, but it was manageable. It mostly consisted of report writing and whole classroom consultation. I then got a chance to do a small project with another colleague. It was great! I felt like I was building on my leadership and project management skills. 

In August, one of our top employees quit. I didn’t think anything of it. In that same month I was told (very last minute) that I would need to go to a school district an hour away from me for 3 days that week that fill in for a colleague who’s daughter was sick. I did not want to do this for obvious reasons which include excessive mileage on my car, the cost of gas, and the energy it takes to drive an hour to and from. When I spoke with my supervisor, I asked if this was for the rest of the school year and she stated that it was only for that week. The very next week I am told that I’m needed back in that school district to support another colleague because he has “too many cases”. I was frustrated by this because I thought I only needed to go out there last week to fill in for a colleague. 

It has now turned into me being in that school district 1-2 times a week. I have also taken over a caseload with 6 students who all need reports, I am being told to do another colleagues data interpretation and report, and teach a class at 7:15am (reminder: I live an hour away). I also have to stay at the building all day until 2:30pm. One would say this doesn’t sound too bad right? But I have my own caseloads and responsibilities at 2 other school districts. 

One of the other school districts I have a caseload of about 7-8 kids who need reports and supports, I have to write their district FBAs and BIPs because the district claims their professionals who should be doing this are “incompetent”, I have to provide trainings to them once a month until march (in which I’m not qualified but my supervisor is forcing me to do it anyway) and provide behavioral coaching 3 days a week. Nobody supports me with this caseload. I have this entire school district all by myself, but yet I’m TOLD I need to support everyone else. 

In my other school district I am responsible for building live initiatives. Apparently I pissed my coworker off by doing my job. I spoke with a social worker and school psych about a building level program (which is my job to do so), and I told my colleague about it. She (my colleague who is NOT my boss) then called me and told me to not speak to anyone in the buildings unless she tells me to. 

I have been reprimanded for everything you can think of. I cannot do or finish my own work because I’m doing everyone else’s. I have been reprimanded for talking to school administrators without asking for permission but I was never told I should. I have been scolded for being 2 minutes late. I have also been scolded for being late to the school that is an hour drive from me due to construction and traffic (I have to drive through 2 counties to get there). I am doing my very best and it’s never enough. I feel excluded from everything, many of my coworkers speak to me in a condescending tone. I never get time to work from home given my large caseload even though I was told via e-mail I’d be given 1 day a week to work from home and do paperwork. That has since changed. 

I feel like I’m going to break. I’m reaching my breaking point and I’m not sure what to do. I have no time to take care of myself, my colleagues page my work phone constantly after work hours. I’m being micromanaged for absolutely no reason. They are constantly telling us that we need to make time for self care and wellness, but how can I do that when my job is my entire life? I received another job in the same city and it only pays a little more. But they have a hybrid work model. I’m contemplating if I should take it."

Here's my application metrics to provide some reality/assurance for current jobseekers out there.,u/ChiRealEstateScam123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y7fg2y/just_finished_whitecollar_job_search_with_1yoe/,jobs,"**Summary**: https://i.imgur.com/KU0qoqF.png over 3 months from start to finish.

**Disclaimer**: The Total # of Applications does not include Linkedin Easy Apply or one-click application since those take minuscule amount of effort (Greenhouse and the like that are quicker than workday but still require effort are counted.)

**Salary Expectation**: $80k base minimum. This was actually on the low end for almost every jobs I applied/interviewed for.

**Accepted Offer**: Corporate Strategy &amp; Development at a Media &amp; Telecom corporation. $90k base/bonus with a $10k signing bonus on top. 3 days WFH. 5 weeks of PTO/Sick. 9-5 job.

**Searched Positions**: Analyst/Senior Analyst/Associate positions for Strategy, Management Consulting, Corporate Development, Private Equity, Restructuring. Any industry except Healthcare, Oil &amp; Gas, Vices.

**Locations**: SF, NY, LA, Boston, Seattle, Chicago, Austin. In-person/Hybrid. Some Remote although wasn't a priority.

**Experience**: 1YOE Management Development Program from a decent Industrial company.

**Education**: Top-tier school w/ Economics and Psychology double major.

**Internships**: History research fellowship, S&amp;P500 Strategy internship, management consulting internship at good(not great) advertising/consulting agency.


**Why I posted**: I noticed that a lot of people felt discouraged/lost throughout the job search process for one reason or another such as not knowing if resume is formatted correctly, the sheer number of applications submitted, etc... As such, I wanted to provide the result of my job search so people will understand that it's really a number game and grit is very important for job search.

**Reflection**: Surprisingly tough to pivot from a strategy background to something more finance related/heavy. Did succeed at the end but I think my success rate would have been a lot higher if I didn't apply for roles that asked for 2 - 4+ YOE(I only had 1YOE) or required financial/accounting experience/knowledge. I did take two intensive courses on Financial Statement Analysis &amp; Financial Modeling to be more qualified. I think the brand-name education helped although I did not take advantage of my alumni network.

In the case of myself, I'm going from mechanics / construction to more business based acquisitions. One thing I've found, is that BEFORE rehashing me resume on Indeed to explain great detail about my job and abilities, I got job offer after job offer through Gmail  for these terribly low pay production and labor jobs. After redoing my resume and getting it cleared for looking professional and demonstrating my strengths, my resume gets ZERO attention. Emails have gone flat, employers don't seem to want to hire people with expectations they had for themselves and met for their past employers. I've gotten so close to interviews and am even put on file for later hiring dates, but by providing more detail and proof of my past work history has somewhat pulled me out of the ""hiring pool"".  For seasoned professional, this might sound miniscule and to you it might be, but at least in my area, this is becoming a major issue where capable people can't find decent jobs, because employers are taking advantage of the fact people are broke, while others are on a social hierarchy with everything going on, so these ""fair chance employers"" are anything but."

It’s quite ironic to post this on my 1 year work anniversary.

I relocated to California a year ago for my current job, only to find out it’s nothing like my expectation. My SO will be graduating after one year and we both wanted to move out of California, so I know for sure I will only stay one more year here, but I don’t wish to be unhappy at work for another year.

At my current job, I often feel my opinions are not valued or solicited. Team members often have private discussions and only present me with decided action items for me to execute despite my attempts to communicate how uncomfortable it makes me. My boss trusts his tenured employees more than me without reasons. Once a teammate and I calculated results using an algorithm I developed and got different results at a meeting, the teammate says I am wrong when I suggested we confirm closely offline. My boss insists that the teammate should be correct although later we found out he used the wrong dataset for the calculation….it’s things like this that make the work morale sink quickly. I used to be a star employee in my last job and I miss that feeling of accomplishment.

The only reasons I haven’t changed my job are: it pays well, strictly 9-5, I have to pay back 50% of the sign-on bonus if I leave now, and we only have one year left. Sorry that changing teams is not an option, I was hired for a very specific function.

Is it worth it to start looking into a new job? Thank you."

A little background about me I’ve graduated in May with a Bachelors in Finance and I have been searching for a finance/accounting entry position ever since then. After having many phone interviews and many searches I found a job with a location that would be worth while attending for an interview. I go in today for the interview and it goes very well. The company is very behind in their accounting department which needs help immediately as well as someone who is younger in the office who is quick with technology. After discussing the company’s background they seemed very interested with my school credentials and work experience in which we then walk around the office and warehouse they have as well as I meet there entire staff. We say our goodbyes and they say they will call me by the end of the day to discuss salary (I’m guessing they weren’t prepared for that part before I came in). Anyways, that was all this morning now it’s 6:30 and no call so not going to keep my hopes up and now back to more job searching. How fun!"

Manager told me that team is probably hiring someone in January but in the meantime that I can do projects with that team when I have spare capacity.

Enter company Y that is offering me a job with a start date in June 2023. It’s likely less money but better career progression from what I can tell and a good opportunity.

Company X has been very good to me. I’m just confused at what I should do. Do I take that new role at my current company (X) in January knowing I will leave in June or should I stay in my current role so they can hire someone else.


Sorry if that’s confusing!"

* Sometimes the fields use data collected previously and can't be changed
* Other times, I've checked and double checked all the fields to make sure the fields were filled out appropriately, and it still wouldn't let me progress.
* Maybe there are times when there's an arbitrary time limit of like 20 minutes before you're logged out
* Then there's times when you have to fill out your job information three different ways
* They also ask question that should be skippable because they're SUPPOSED to be opt in, not opt out (race, veteran status, gender, and now even sexual orientation) 

And these are applications are from the selfsame companies that says NoBoDy WaNtS tO wOrk AnYmOrE. No, I don't want to work for a company that it takes me 20 minutes to fill out their application and it won't even allow me to submit it.

So he took another week off, and when he came back after that week I asked him if he has the obituary that I can put in file and give to HR. He told me that he don’t have one and he can’t provide any proof for the death of his brother-in-law. When I ask if his sister or his wife can send him a photo of the obituary, he said that he lost their number. The few questions I have is, he says that I’m intruding in his family’s life by asking so many question, what do I do? Or fire him and put a black Mark on him so other companies know about him? Is it too much just to ask for an obituary of the person you’re attending the funeral for?"

Basically, the job was the best in everything out of the 3 job offers I received. It had the best salary, best development opportunities, and most interesting work.  If I took the job, I pretty much set myself up for life and could work at 95% of economic firms around the world.  However, the culture was absolutely dreadful. The interviewer actually told me that the office is ""like a library"" and co-workers hardly ever talk to each other. In her own words, ""everyone is highly introverted, comes in, gets their analysis done, and leaves, with only minor, usually administrative chats throughout the day to improve process flow"". While I'm not exactly 100% extrovert, it seemed like a completely miserable place to work.

I'm wandering if I made a mistake. Culture is the most important thing to me (e.g., making friends, enjoying life at work), but I suppose I could have sacrificed that for a year or two. The job I accepted has an amazing culture, but is slightly to moderately weaker than this one in every other department and may not necessarily open up the same future opportunities.

What do you think of my decision? I suppose this is a common question, but I don't really know how to answer it since I can't really tell what the future would have looked like in either case and lack the experience to make any prediction."

I know that there are some headhunters working on this posting too because I was contacted by one after I applied directly on the company website. 

Round 1 goes well enough - phone interview and then the HR Lady adds me on Linkedin. We have some back and forth about questions of how the bonus structure/overtime/benefits work. HR lady seems really friendly. 

I get to round 2 and have the in person interview with the 2 owners, HR lady and the external accountant who I used to work for (and on good terms with). Owners seem like really nice guys, HR lady seems colder than she was previously. I make a good impression at first (making them laugh a few times) but once one of the owners leave and then I begin to stumble on the 'official' HR interview questions. I will admit I didn't prepare for the interview as much as I should have - only because I have done so many interviews that I felt I had the answers already (apparently I didn't). Near the end of the interview after the other owner leaves, I finish up with the HR lady and she says that there won't be another interview after this and I should hear next week. 

A week goes by and I don't hear anything so I send an email to the HR lady and she said that ""a few things come up but we expect to make a decision soon and you are still being considered for the role"". 

Another week goes by, still don't hear anything. So I call my former employer who are the external accountants for this company and I ask him what's up because I know he was a part of the recruiting process. I tell him that I haven't heard and he said that he knows there were some additional interviews (he wasn't available to do) that they were conducting in order for them to do their due diligence and suggested I call on the Monday (Monday of this week). 

So I leave a voicemail with the HR lady and get an email back saying that they have been busy with year end (corporate tax stuff) and they haven't been able to sit down to make a decision still. I assume that part of this is true but I also know that they had some additional interviews. 

So I don't know what to think. I would like to think that they wouldn't just string everyone along and they are very busy people and also I am a strong candidate for the job (otherwise why say I am still being considered for the role)."

I was getting used to getting the rejection emails, but I was finally able to get a response back and have an interview with them recently. The interview did not seem to lean positive or negative, just standard. I have my fingers crossed, but I’m not getting my hopes up since I’ve had quite a few interviews that ended up going nowhere before. 

My question is, if I don’t end up getting the job I just interviewed for, would I be automatically disqualified if I applied to any future openings at the company? 

I’m sure there’s no formal rule against interviewing the same applicant for a different opening later down the line, but my cynical brain feels like some companies are petty enough that there’s some off the books process to avoid any awkward reunions with an applicant that was previously rejected."

It gives you an opportunity to learn about new cultures, gain independence, and make friends from all over the globe. But with so many universities to choose from, how do you know which one is right for you?

Here are a few things to consider when choosing an international university:

#### Course Ranking

Many worldwide university and course rankings list the best universities for some of the most popular courses. These include the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings.

Check to see if your chosen university and course are highly ranked before making your final decision.

#### Location

Do you want to study in a big city or a smaller town? Do you want to be close to home or experience somewhere completely new? Consider your lifestyle and needs when choosing a location for your international university.

If you are going to join an IT course, you may want to be in a city like San Francisco, New York, London, or Berlin which are known for their cutting-edge tech industries. If you want to study fashion design, Paris, Milan, and London would be better choices for you.

#### Accommodation

Most universities will offer accommodation options for students, but it’s important to check the quality and cost of these before making your decision. Some universities also offer homestay programs, which can be a great way to immerse yourself in the local culture.

#### Cost

Studying abroad can be an expensive endeavor, so it’s important to factor in the cost of tuition, accommodation, and living expenses when choosing a university. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the costs involved before making your decision.

Study abroad education fairs are great resources to compare the cost of different universities.

I did my job even when it became a lot, I showed up on time never extremely late, I conversed with people, came up with ideas and I reported when I needed to. I just don't know what happened...

I do in-house digital marketing for a holidays company in the UK. I've been here for almost 5 months and I really enjoy the work. We use a range of online platforms for our advertising, but I work on the Google and Bing Ads side of things, and we also use SA360. 

I was tasked with some new campaign builds a few weeks ago, and it's come to light now that there were things wrong with these new builds in some of the accounts. Some of the keywords had not been changed, the keyword URL's had not been changed also, and I also hadn't changed some of the bids. 

I'm feeling really anxious, worried, and frustrated with myself for making such a dumb mistake which could make others view me as incompetent. I've spoken with my boss who seems fine and is happy that I've set myself a plan to prevent this from happening again, but I'm still pinching myself for this and I probably will be for a while. I just don't want them to think that they can't trust me and I really want to do well in this company. My probation review is in 6 weeks which is why I'm freaking out a little. 

How do I move past this and regain the trust of my peers? Have you ever been in a situation like this, and if yes, what did you do to make things right?

This friend has worked at his place of employment for 7 plus years, and can't seem to get a promotion or a reasonable explanation as to why not.

He works hard, covers for others when they are sick, knows his job inside out as well as most of the aspects of the managerial roles in store.
He's applied and now been rejected twice for a promotion. Someone younger (I'm not sure if this is relevant but they are paid by the hour and the wage changes with age, so, perhaps it is) with less experience and less time served at the job, got the position over him the first time.
Now, this time, there was a full and part time position up for grabs, and he got neither. 
Feeling extremely devalued and underappreciated, along with just, confused and frustrated as he hasn't gotten a good reason as to why he keeps getting passed over?

What are the next steps?

I previously worked with the lad for a good few years and so gave him my two cents on what I thought could have been holding him back, but those issues were never brought up by management.
He did ask why, and he was told that when he was given tasks to do, he focused on them and completed them instead of prioritising customers - but this was only when there were other employees already tasked with that as their main focus? If he didn't finish the tasks he needed to do, he'd be reprimanded for that, as well as making everyone late to leave for the day, so it's really a rock and a hard place situation.

I can't help but feel that this is a communication / management issue. After 7 years with the company, and his bosses all knowing that he had his heart set on the promotion - this just, doesn't feel fair or professional in the slightest. 
I'm gutted for him and currently trawling the internet for templates to send to HR.

Any advice?

I'm coming from the service and non-commission retail industries so this would be my first real ""adult job"", and I've never worked in an office before.

I struggle with ADHD and I have a feeling that this environment (based on Glassdoor reviews and the fact that it's a larger-than-small accounting firm) will not be able to support my needs in the workplace. I'm also aware that ""coordinator/administrator"" positions are the types of jobs where someone inexperienced like myself can be easily exploited and overworked — I know because I've watched it happen to multiple friends.

If anyone sees this and has any advice for going into a situation like this / questions to ask / green and red flags to watch out for, it would be much appreciated! I'm honestly not fully expecting to get this job, so I'm mostly going in for the experience of interviewing and practicing being more comfortable in these situations, but I remain open to the idea that it could be a good opportunity.

Thank you!"

They got a complaint about a timeline of something I was working on at the end of July and since then, I have to come into the office three days a week, where everyone else is at one day a week. I’ve asked multiple times for the expectations on timelines and what I need to do to go back to one day per week. Crickets. I finally have a meeting scheduled with them on Friday. I really can’t wait. I have a laundry list of issues to discuss. In the meantime, I have applied for a high level position elsewhere and I’m super anxious about hearing back. I really want to leave. The anxiety this situation is causing, on top of some serious stuff in my personal life, is seriously draining!"

Hi, I work as a marketing coordinator for a non profit. I am responsible for sourcing vendors, placing swag orders, submitting invoices for payment, maintain a DAM, scheduling meetings, and overall project management (scoping out projects, timelines, deliverables needed, delegating tasks) via a PM software.

However, I am at a loss for how to show the impact of what I do. Im not responsible for the budget, I don’t know how much time is saved by my PM skills (and i wouldn’t even know how to measure it). The only thing I have, maybe, is that I streamlined the request process by creating a form. I have no idea what time it saves or anything like that. I genuinely don’t know the impact of my role other than the fact I do a bunch of admin work that I hate and feels so pointless. Ordering swag and talking to vendors is a skill I guess, but I don’t know how to say it’s impactful.

I’m very stressed out because I feel like I have no real skills. I send emails, i talk to people, i place orders, i code invoices, i make schedules, aaaaand done. There’s nothing interesting or impactful about anything I do. I’m on the backend of things so I’m not even a part of the record breaking donations we received, all I did was talk to freelancers about schedules for a social media graphic. I cant say i’m a part of any of that, and it’s bumming me out because what do I really do then?"

I had a first round interview, overall it felt fairly positive, but I definitely feel like I didn’t answer well enough to some fairly important questions. I was up almost all night with my sick dog, so my brain just farted out even though I know my field. And now I probably seemed a bit incompetent. 

I won’t be waiting for a call-back from this one…

EDIT: So turns out I would have gotten an invite for the next round but they found an internal hire so they are not moving forward with any other canditate at the moment 🥴 But got really good feedback and they hope to have a need to get more people in in the near-ish future, and in that case they would open the process with me again directly with the second round interview - if I’m still interested then. 

But at least I apparently didn’t fuck it up!"

Iv'e been at my current job for a  little over 3 years now. I'd call it a mix of data entry, customer  service and copyediting. Ultimately, while it's fine overall, theres  very little room to grow and I have no way of really getting new duties.

I'd  like to break into a new field, probably Project Coordinator but  whenever I look up the job descriptions and check them out on job  boards, I never seem to have anywhere near the experience needed, even  though it's an entry level job. So i'm a little unsure on how to  proceed. Iv'e considered just applying for adminsitrative jobs, and once  i'm in, asking to be given more Project Coordinator/Manager duties but  i'm not sure how plausible that is. On the other hand, staying here  isn't really plausible either because i'm not learning or advancing in  anything new.

How should I proceed? How do I break out of this hole I seem to be stuck in?"

It was a promotion and a nice pay increase.  However, it has been pretty overwhelming since day 1.  Alot of reports, micromanaging, and stress all together.  I didn't think this was normal from the get go but now I feel like I'm getting the bigger picture.  Yesterday, our CEO told us about the state of the business and its bad (won't go into details of the business to save myself for now).  We are significantly behind budget for this year,  the local government has partnered with our competitor to build a new business of ours in the town, and recent trends in our state have shown closures of our type of business with reports saying more to follow

Did I get brought in to a company that's failing?  What should I do since I've only been here 2 months"

I was contacted by a recruiter and an interview was scheduled. The interview was to be done via zoom. I received the link and the day/time. When that day/time came (and I checked 2, 3, 100 times it was correct) I was in the zoom call waiting but the interviewer didn't show. I emailed \~10 minutes suggesting that I would be happy to meet another time if the current time was inconvenient. I stayed in the call for \~35 minutes before leaving. Days go by and I hear nothing, so I email one more time (for closure) that I wish to withdraw my application and no longer wish to work at the company.

Two days later the interviewer's boss emails me apologizing for the inconvenience and sends me a new zoom link &amp; tells me that the original interviewer is going to be there in a couple hours.

I need a job ofc since I am unemployed, but I already suggested I no longer wished to work at the company and wanted my application withdrawn.

[I'm not from the US. Moving from EU to Taiwan] 

So I just accepted another position in the same company, but moving from an EU country to Taiwan. 

With this position comes a 10% pay raise if I stayed in the same country. However, now, they gave me my current salary in the new country. But, withiut the raise, or without the automatic inflation indexation that should happen in January in my country. That difference (raise +inflation) is almost 20%.

The position is for a Technical Sourcer and I currently work as a Recruiting Coordinator at a Mortgage company.

I was reached out by one of their recruiters from a tech agency two weeks ago and was told this would be a contract position that would be a year long. The two people from the company I interviewed with told me that after a year, they move you to one of their teams Full-time depending on performance. I recently graduated from college in March and just started working at my full-time position in mid-June. One of the biggest reasons I was somewhat looking for a new job was because I wanted the opportunity to work some days at home given how far I have to drive, the cost of gas, the amount of time it takes, and the fact that my job is fully online, but they want us on site.

My hours currently are M-F from 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM and I make $55k. The Technical Sourcer position would pay $72.8k annually and is fully remote with hybrid work planned for a year from then. The location for the job is also about 30 minutes away with a toll fee. Both positions are non-exempt, but at my current job, I get $5,250 for tuition reimbursement to use on any certificates or courses and three weeks of accrued PTO which I could lose. I've contracted before prior to my full-time job and I'm still under my parent's health insurance as I'm under 26, but I also need to know if that is something that would help me or not help me if I took this job.

I'm still waiting on the new Offer Letter from the other job, but the recruiter did tell me about their Health insurance and Paid sick time which is some of the small perks they offer.

Which job would you take? Would you leave a full-time job if it meant having a pay increase/wfh benefits?

TLDR: Got a 1 year (with possible hire) contract for a Technical Sourcer at a large Tech company, but currently work as Recruiting Coordinator at a Private Mortgage company. The contract job pays $17-18k more and is remote/hybrid. Currently, my job pays $55k and is on-site. Is it worth leaving a full-time job for this contract job?"

I started my first job post college in agency recruiting in June, so I have just over 4 months of experience. I don’t hate my job, but before I get a sizable base pay bump I have to finish my training which is metric driven- and I have about 7-8 more weeks of high intensity work left. 

While long term earning higher commission/ spread will be worth it, the longer required hours and constant rejection/ high KPIs required have lead me to explore briefly options in corporate/ non agency recruiting. I can survive on my current salary, but it’s a tight budget for the work I’m putting in/ I’m feeling a bit burnt out after all the extra hours I’m putting in to hopefully speed up my promotion/ increase income. 

Both roles I applied for would double also my base pay at a minimum (currently making 47.5k in NOVA/ DC area). I should hopefully start earning commission soon once I finish training and be in the mid-60s closer to mid Q2 2023. 

My roommate is going to refer me for one role of the two I applied for (he works at the company), and I believe I have a decent shot. 

If I get an offer would leaving after 4-5 months hurt me in the long term in my reputation as a recruiter?"

I am not in a place financially where I can quit without another job lined up. How do I update my resume accordingly?


For reference, I am an engineer, so jobs are pretty competitive anyway. 

I recently quit my first job after college (not including internships) after about a year and a half, due to the culture changing drastically, feeling incredibly undervalued, and seeing my path for growth diminish. Several coworkers did the same. 

I had a few job offers, and long story short, really regret taking the one I did. I knew it wasn’t my top choice, but the salary was significantly higher, everyone close to me advised me to, and I didn’t think I’d hate it this much. It’s been really hard knowing that I accepted the wrong position when I was already so torn to begin with.

I have been at the company for 5 weeks, and by week 2, I knew it wasn’t right for me. In some ways, it feels very similar to the job that I was trying to get away from. I feel like I was very misled during the interview process. My complaints with the job are not as simple as “getting used to a new job.”

I felt guilty at first for wanting to quit, but have now decided that I need to put myself first because I am miserable. I unfortunately cannot quit without another job lined up, but I also want to get out ASAP as I feel it’s unfair for them to invest more time, money, and training into me. I had initially planned to stick it out for a year before leaving so I wouldn’t have an issue finding a new job, but there’s absolutely no way I’ll make it that long. 

A lot of background, but here’s my real question… From a resume point of view, what do I do?  Do I include the job even though it’s only been about a month? Do I leave it off and have a gap on my resume? I don’t want it to look like I was fired from my last position by having a gap. The job is also on my linked in, so I feel they could find it anyway.  In the future, I know I would remove it. But for purposes of finding my NEXT job, what do I do? 

I know that I can eloquently explain the reasons for leaving if asked in an interview, but my concern is not getting to the interview stage to begin with because they noticed this on my resume, and I can understand it being a red flag. 

Thank you in advance for any tips you have! This has been incredibly stressful and I appreciate any help I can get."

I received a job offer on Monday, countered and received the accepted counter offer today. They’d like a response tomorrow. 

I’m waiting on another potential offer by Monday morning the latest (I have one more interview that I’m confident about). 

Is it acceptable to ask until EOD Monday? Whats the best way to go about asking for this? 

What’s the likelihood they’ll pull the offer? I’d really rather not accept the first offer to be safe only to rescind it. I let the recruiter know early on in the process that I had a couple other conversations going on but the offer came far more quickly than expected so I think she’d be surprised to find out I had/was waiting on another offer. I also let the second recruiter know that if an offer was coming, I needed to know by Monday morning because I had another one in hand and she understood. 

If I don’t get the second offer and/or am not happy with it, I’ll be accepting this one. I just really want to weigh both options and complete these interviews so I’m confident in my decision.

3,2022-10-19,Advice about negative background check info,u/TacoTitsTuesday,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y8iusk/advice_about_negative_background_check_info/,jobs,"Hi everyone. This is a long one.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I (33F) am on deferred probation in the state of Texas for the charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and bodily injury of an elderly person.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently was offered my dream job as a donor technician at a plasma donation center.

&amp;#x200B;

I just sent in my background check.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I was hired at a gas station, where they also did a background check and still gave me the job, even though I had a ""pre-adverse action"" notice for 2 misdemeanors from over 7 years ago, one being an assault 4.

&amp;#x200B;

What I didn't notice at the time was that my recent felony/deferred probation also showed up and had a ""review"" notice on it, though it was not included in the pre-adverse action, I imagine that's because it's not an actual conviction.

&amp;#x200B;

When I had my recent interview for the donor technician job, I was up front about the assault charge and told him that I had just recently had a background check for another job and it showed up, so I explained myself. It didn't seem that would be a problem for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Today when I put in my info for my new background check, I noticed that it was the same company doing it as the last one, they still had my info on file so I pulled it up and looked it over again. That's when I realized that those felony charges showed up on there and I hadn't noticed them before.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted the boss (his preferred method of communicating), and asked if he had time to talk to me on the phone for a couple of minutes, and he replied that I could call him in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, I decided to write down what I wanted to say to him so I was thoroughly prepared. Everything that I'm going to say to him is the absolute truth, and I'm going to paste it below so you guys can give me some advice:

&amp;#x200B;

(Please forgive the lack of capitalization etc., I didn't write it with the intent on sharing it with anyone and don't want to go back and edit the whole thing.)

&amp;#x200B;

hey, i know you're a busy guy so i will make this as quick as possible, so, do you remember me telling you about my concerns with the background check?

well apparently i missed something when i looked at the other one.

you see, the only one that prompts sending me a notice of a pre-adverse action was the misdemeanors i was telling you about.

&amp;#x200B;

however, what i didnt notice before was that i have a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon flagged for review, although i am not convicted of it.

now i know it sounds horrible, but hear me out. the other person involved in this case was my mom, who i have had a traumatic relationship with. she constantly harasses me and is always trying to make me seem like im a bad person when im not, and she is a pathological liar. i try to avoid her at all costs but she literally will not leave me alone. for example, i tied my dog up for 2 hours outside the other day because i was cleaning my house and he kept getting in the way, and she saw him outside and told me she was calling the police on me for animal abuse. which is really rich coming from a woman who had a puppy that i had to take from her because she kept kicking him so i took him and kept him until i found him a new home. she is absolutely insane.

&amp;#x200B;

now to the day in question. the day prior, my best friend had just committed suicide due to health problems she had been dealing with for several years. i was a complete mess. i had a total mental breakdown. i went next door to my grandmothers house, and my mom was there. i was bawling my eyes out and i started screaming at her about every single thing she'd ever done to me. she then throws herself onto the floor amd starts rolling around covering her ears and starts screaming bloody murder saying ""nooo!! stop!!"" and im like why are you screaming im literally just standing here!

i leave, and she then proceeds to call the police and claim that i beat her with a gun that i did not have. the police came and arrested me, they searched my gmas house, they then got a search warrant for my house, no gun. my mom had no injuries but claimed that her ""ribs hurt"", they didnt even ask me for my side of the story, they just took her at her word and i got charged with all of that.

&amp;#x200B;

so fast forward,

the da's office is super busy, they took almost an entire year to even get to dealing with my case.

nobody wanted to go to court, including me, they offered me deferred probation which means that after the allotted time as long as i dont get in any trouble then the case will be dismissed. i said great fine ill take it.

so since they took so long to get around to me, the probationary period started in february of this year, even though the actual charge was a year before that.

&amp;#x200B;

so on the background check you will see it says ""alternate disposition"", whereas in comparison you'll see those misdemeanors from 7 years ago list the disposition as ""convicted"".

it also says 4 years probation on the background check but they are actually going to terminate it in about 15 more months.

&amp;#x200B;

so, i actually didnt know that that would even show up on a background check since im convicted of it, which is why i didnt bring it up in our interview.

&amp;#x200B;

so thats pretty much all i had to say, i really hope you can still give me a chance, i would work really hard for you every day and i'd be really great for this job, if we can just get past this one hurdle. so, thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and i really hope you can still consider giving me a chance.

\- END

&amp;#x200B;

I'm panicking, I've been crying all day, I need some advice on anything I should edit for the phone call, if anyone has been through anything similar please tell me. I have been struggling financially for the last almost 3 years, I spent over a month trying to get this job. It would change my life and if I get turned away because of this I feel like I'm really going to fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

After taking everyone's advice, I rewrote what I'm going to say, so here it is:

 

Hi, I just wanted to give you a heads up that I have a charge on my record that I didn't expect to show up on a background check, it's a felony charge related to a fight with a family member of mine that I'd suffered abuse from for many years, it was an isolated incident that never went to court. 

I'm on deferred probation for it and the charges will be dismissed entirely at the end of the probationary period which will be about 15 months from now, so I didn't think that I needed to disclose them since it's a conviction. 

 All that being said, I'm very excited about this opportunity, I really want to be in a place where I can help and be supportive to other people, and prove that I am capable of being great at this job and can be an asset to your team. 

\-END

Let me know what you all think about this. Thank you so much."

Also - do you provide the name and contact information for each company? For instance several companies I’ve worked for do not have “main” telephone numbers listed and it would be impossible to get in touch with them as many work from home off their cells. Do I provide phone numbers for them to contact ?? Not sure how this works !

I have an opportunity to move to another company where I can network more in my field and gain more hands on knowledge in my field with slightly higher pay. 

The job I would be moving to is the exact same title and role. The work environment I am in right now is very  flexible on dates, still get things done very quickly, and I have a lot of downtime because of my work ethic. I use that downtime to build more knowledge and get more experience with things that would potentially help in building my career. My original plan was to be at my current position for a year and then evaluate where I am at career wise. However, I recently applied for a job on a whim and a bit of an employment scare and I got the position. 

My question is what would someone else do in my position. I like my boss and the company is very employee friendly. However, is it worth considering this offer versus just spending a year building my knowledge and skills and then applying to other higher level corporate positions."

I’ve been a hard worker during my time of employment. I left at one time during quarantine. I tried reapplying after a while. My ex started working at the same place and kept me from reapplying. She lied all she could to keep my away. I’ve been respectful to employees and even toxic ex. She recently got fired. After 2 years of trying to get back at macy’s I tried to reapply after she was gone and now there’s a girl I don’t know about lying to the manager saying I called my ex a b*tch so that he wouldn’t hire me. I found out through my friend about this. They’ve also got someone else fired by accusing him of harassment. They make an unhealthy work environment. My friends (shoe expeditors) don’t talk to the sales associate because of them being toxic. Before my ex left she said a few harsh words to my friends even though they were being friendly. Throughout the break up she did a few disturbing things just to keep me away. I feel constantly targeted by them and I couldn’t stop by to say hi to my friends anymore. The reason my ex got fired was because she was sitting on a chair every day while everyone else was working. I can imagine the awkwardness of no one talking. I haven’t done anything wrong and I would like to reapply. 

How can I convince the manager that I haven’t cursed or done anything wrong? Do I speak to HR about that person I don’t know about? I feel devastated."

A bit of context: Fresh uni graduate, looking to transition from a care role that's now ended, into an office-based charity role. Decided that, in lieu of direct experience in admin (which is a component or desirable skill for the jobs I'm looking for), a qualification would put me in better stead than I am already. 

I've been recommended a level 2 (NVQ, I'm guessing?) online course in business admin for this purpose, but honestly think a 150-point CPD, online, self-paced, admin course (that starts at beginner's level) that's being marketed as 'level 7' would be better for me, as it just seems more advanced and therefore impressive to me. I do realise that the latter is not a formal qualification - even so, was please wondering if you can tell me whether you think I'm right in thinking this?

Thanks."

For the first month they were coming to me so much I thought they were a reskilled fresh graduate. But come to me seeing their LinkedIn that they have been in the industry for 20 years, 5x longer than me, yet I'm constantly answering trivial questions for them, practically doing the work for them (they'll literally sit silent until I walk through code and directly tell them what to type), and generally being distracted from my work very regularly, leading to my own standard slipping. (I get at least 1 hour long call, and multiple other 10-30 minute calls every week) 

I have now been given the chance to review my coworkers officially, and this tech lead is one of them. My dilemma is that my name is attached to the review, so if I say something bad, it could fall right back to me.

At the same time, I loath that this tech lead is earning x0,000 more than me when I've had to help them with so much over the last 3 months, but I'm already stretched so thin from catching up on work that I wouldn't want to deal with follow ups if I have to have them.

I've come to loathe jobs that have a focus on customer service and I want to move on to something that doesn't deal with customers frequently, but I can't ever come up with a career that I feel confident I'd enjoy doing. I haven't had any additional education past high school and I'm worried about investing time and money into further education into something that I might end up hating. I also do not have a lot of free time to be able to take classes on top of having to work full-time, and I can't quit or cut back my hours because I need the health insurance to live with my condition (Type 1 Diabetes).

A job would just give me some stability and a sense of structure/somewhat of an identity. I’m getting real impatient now and have increased the urgency the past 2 months. It’s a 2 way street of me not having any skills for my age and them saying they’re hiring, apply, interview me, and never contacting me back. For a fucking entry level job or close to it.

I'll start with some background information. I graduated college with a CS degree in April 2021. During my senior year I was working at a brewing company as a barback/server. During that time the early stages of COVID were going on and I had contracted the virus before anyone else that I knew did. I told my place of work and quarantined for 2 weeks. After I tested negative and everything was fine my manager called me and warned me that I could not hangout with my friends anymore (even though I lived with 5 of them at the time). I did not listen to her because I no longer had the virus and tested negative. Following me not listening to her, a couple days later her and the two owners called me telling me that I no longer am welcome there because of this. While I felt wrongfully terminated I chose not to pursue it any further because I was able to receive government aid.   


Since then, I have been working at GM as a software developer. I am currently in the process of switching jobs and have a new offer to be a cloud security engineer at a financial company. Right now I am going through a background check and I listed that I was asked to leave from this brewery in the section that said to list the last 10 years of my employment history. I have been reached out to by someone conducting the background check asking me to elaborate on why I was terminated. My question is, are they actually going to care about me getting laid off from a job I had in college despite me working for a reputable company now? I didn't think they would even care about this and now I feel like I have dug myself a hole. Thank you.   
Below is the response that I provided to the person conducting the background check:  


Hello Connor,

I was asked to leave {Name} brewing company after I contracted the Covid-19 virus. This was still in the early stages of Covid and I believe that the management was fearful of bringing me back on even after the 2 weeks of quarantine that I performed because they thought that for whatever reason I could be a carrier for it. Another suspicion that I have is that they didn’t want to let an employee continue to work there who had Covid in order to avoid some sort of “bad reputation” in the case that somehow people in the public found out. For whatever their reason, I did feel wrongfully terminated at that time but chose not to pursue it further as I was busy with my senior year of school and was able to receive aid from the federal government. If you would like to discuss this over the phone I would be happy to. My number is {number}, please give me a call at anytime. I hope this clears up any confusion. "

So first I'd like to mention that I'm pretty new to this subreddit, so if I'm off topic, sorry. I'm writing because I've been actively searching for a job. For some context, I live in Europe, Lithuania to be exact. I'm aiming to work for an international company, that could employ someone from abroad that could work from home, always been my dream. I've managed to find one company, whom I won't name. I found it on a third-party website, where companies list their jobs. The pay was amazing, an American job, considering the Lithuanian wage, and it was in my specialisation, so I thought, that it could be an amazing opportunity. So I applied.A few things were a bit fishy about it. The first being, that there weren't any call interviews made. I'm quite used to them, having worked in my country. So having no one to talk to on the first stage was pretty weird. I've had to do 3 tests, the final being to my core specialisation, which I will work in. Turns out, I've got the job.

The fishiest part was the contract. Well, as it's my first time, I'm a bit sceptical about it, and I've noticed that there were no hourly pay included in the contract. But yet again, I'm employed as a sort of freelancer, basically, work when needed, and minutes are counted with the job type of thing. So now I'm wondering is it safe or not?

I've researched the company, it's quite new, it has some good reviews, some bad, the usual, but definitely not many. I haven't been scammed yet at a workplace, so I'm wondering how can you get scammed, and if I sign a contract and I get essentially, scammed, how bad could it be?

I don't want to miss out on this opportunity because it could be a really great start to my career. Thanks in advance for your intel!

UPDATE: So yesterday, I've emailed the person about me wanting to ask questions in a either video/audio talk, and I was rejected. The person wrote: ''Write questions here, and I'll do my best to answer them''. That's it, nothing more."

He actually said, in an HR meeting, that he has been trying to catch me doing something wrong with the unspoken but fully apparent motive of firing me (that is to say, he and everyone in the room knew if he did catch me, he'd go for termination).

I'm in a strange spot.  What he's trying to get me for is sleeping on the job.  I am willing to go into detail if anyone asks, but to make a long story short I was not and I have work and documentation to back up my claim.  This is the second time he has tried to get me for this, and since then he has requested I keep an hour by hour log of what I do at work.  I've done so, and have kept that log up to date and given a copy to him.  This, of course, was never brought up when he dragged me into HR to fire me.

I'm fairly certain, though I have no way of verifying, that the reason he didn't is because I can fall back on the ADA.  I believe that my avoidance of being terminated, wrongfully or not, is temporary, though.  Tomorrow, my boss wants me to report directly to him instead of my usual work station (I work in IT and our department has two offices).  I'm expecting he is going to try to put ever increasing restrictions on me while I am at work, and I am considering telling him that with him openly admitting he is trying to get me fired and consistently failing to provide proof of his claims beyond hearsay, he's essentially treating me unfairly for something he cannot prove and which I have repeatedly maintained I was not responsible for.  I also intend to go to the union about filing a grievance concerning this.

I know full well that it is a good idea to look for a new job.  Sadly, I cannot use him as a reference and I do not know what coworkers I can trust now.  He has mentioned that my coworkers are supposedly delivering similar reports to him of me sleeping at my desk, but he also failed to provide any sort of proof that reports had been made.  In other words, while this job has given me 1.5 years of work experience (I am relatively new in the industry) I am not sure who I can reliably gather as references, and can expect my boss to provide a bad one.

It's a shot in the dark but I figured I'd share my story here and ask if there's any advice anyone can offer."

This would have been a dream job for me. I asked them if my application was now irredeemable, and they said unfortunately yes there’s nothing I can do.

I feel humiliated and devastated. I don’t think my former employers will ever give me a positive reference now after I have emailed them and explained the reasons why I feel I was underperforming under their employment (lack of support, poor management - this is why I left). I feel deflated. I feel as though I’m a failure.

Edit: I sent this email to the manager who provided me with the negative reference AFTER I have been informed of this.

I did receive confirmation from this manager that they would provide a reference for me (albeit reference quality not specified), but his words were ‘of course I will provide a reference for you!’

I also left this job (I was not dismissed) and gave more than my agreed notice to allow them time to find a replacement."

Hello,

My mother has been a housewife for the past 25+ years where she's done a Bachelor's from India in Medicine, and other certifications (such as an Ultrasound License). She has many skills such as organization skills, finance skills, and much more.

She's around 50 and has expressed interest in trying to get some type of education through which she can get a job. I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for programs that have good prospects for someone who's older? Furthermore, I would love to see if anyone has had a parent/relative who started their career later in life, or know of someone who has done the same? I'd love to pick your brain!

I've been in the casino industry since 2015. I started as an accounts representative which basically is a customer service position, opening and managing new player accounts. I worked that for around 8 months before moving up to a coordinator which almost like a ""host assistant"" job where you manage accounts but also schedule trips, hotels, answer calls, emails, etc. 

Worked that position for around a year then became a Hospitality Host which is sort of like a junior host. It kind of consists of the same thing as the coordinator position except instead of being in one place, we get to walk the floor and issue comps to players if they qualify. 

Then I finally topped out at an Inside Sales Executive Host which is responsible for creating revenue for the casino. We manage a book of players and it's our job to get them in the door and show them a good time. 

I also worked as a slot technician repairing gaming cabinets (slot machines) and installing software. 

Which leads into my current job as a Field Technican for gaming slots. Its the same as the slot tech job but I'm not stuck in one place. I deliever games, install them and repair if needed. I'm responsible for scheduling and just overall customer service being the face of the company. 

I am....tired of working in the gaming industry. My current position (while having some great perks and benefits) is wearing me down and since we're spread thin, a lot of us are overworked. My issue is that I have no clue what I should apply for that will offer decent pay. I can't go backwards in this economy. At the moment, I make around $23-$25 an hour. **I do not have a degree or certs.**

My question is for those who have left the gaming/casino industry where did you go next? What are some job you all think I should look for?"

So my university was organizing a program of 3-months internships last semester. I decided to do my internship for this woman who has her own business. Her business is only one year old so she didn't have any other employees. But it was the best internship I've ever had. I loved the job, I learned so much and what was the best - I had the best boss in the world. I won't go into details but I honestly wish that kind of boss to everyone. 

I was heartbroken when the internship ended. My boss told me that she would want to give me a job at least part-time but because her business is new she doesn't have money to pay me. Instead, she asked me if I would be interested in helping her twice a month with work (of course she would pay me). I told her that we can probably work it out in some way and she said that she will call me at the end of the month (October) to tell me how is she doing and if she still needs help. 

I wasn't expecting to find another job offer that would interest me, especially in a such short time but today I did it. I found a great opportunity - a stable part-time job in a big company and in a field I'm interested in. I'm like 90% sure they're going to give me this job because I already have some experience and I know that they employed someone with less experience. So now I have this dilemma. Should I apply for this job or just wait for the call from the place where I had the internship? 

Here are my two sides. I like the idea of working for that company. It's my last year of university and it would be good to have a place to start my career when I graduate. And like I said this company works in my field of interest. 

On the other hand, I loved working for that woman. And I feel like I kinda own her for taking me in on the internship and teaching me so much. But I know that she won't employ me in the next half a year. And after that time I would get 1/7 of full-time or even less. She was honest with me that she isn't even sure if her business will survive. So this job is not stable at all and after my graduation, I would have a part-time position at best.

But they had me do a drug test at the interview. I don't do anything, don't even drink, not even cigarettes. But I'm on several medications (nothing controlled beyond being prescription only) and I think two of them may have caused a false positive based on googling my meds.

The person who interviewed me said she would talk to her boss. I said I'd contact my doctor, but she didn't want to hear it and cut me off and sent me on my way. It's been since Monday, my doctor said she requires 15 days to write a letter and I haven't heard from the place I had the interview.

I kind of feel like this didn't go right. Like something's wrong with how it got handled. But I've never failed a drug test before and I don't know how these things work.

Now I'm very worried I can't get any job except fast food or warehouse work, because what if this keeps happening? I finally found a med combo that works for me but I'm scared it's limiting opportunities. Not really sure what to do. I may call that company tomorrow and see if the boss said anything yet, but it seemed like they didn't want to consider my prescriptions."

I'm not too picky about pay, I've done manual labor and night shifts, I'm not even looking for remote work. Every job right now seems to be hiring entry level wage work with 0% chance of progression, very senior positions that require 8+ years, or they want 4-5 years of niche experience that is hyper-specific to the exact opening.

There really doesn't seem to employment opportunities relevant to someone with just a little bit of experience. I have bills right now, and can't afford the time commitment of learning a new skill. I honestly need something ASAP and have been trying/failing for a long time now.

Graduated from high school 4 months ago, didnt really do anything significant (no hard classes, ecs, community service, clubs, hobbies, part time jobs), just went to school and came home everyday, did my work, studied for tests. As you might expect, i don't have much to put on my cv. I personally wasn't satisfied with the results I put out during my 4 years so I felt both academically and mentally unqualified to apply for colleges during the application phase in my senior year. I told my counselor that I would be going into work instead.

First 2 months I was applying for jobs everyday (mostly no exp required min wages) heard nothing back and got pretty desperate enough to start applying to fast foods as a last resort since i had to pay off my debt to my mom(1/2 done). Got a call from Popeyes and immediately got the job, worked for about 4 weeks until i got fired. A lot of things felt off about there anyway (my profile for more info on it) despite being a first time job. Still applying to every job posts, walking into places, following up on apps, applying anywhere even if it's over $15/h or not fast food related as ""you miss all the shots you don't take"". If i feel like a job is going smoothly and I'm doing what I'm assigned to do, that alone is enough for me. I'll go through any training employers want me to go through and treat the job like my life depends on it. I want to get into the habit of working 9-5 everyday while supporting myself.

Obviously I don't want to work minimum wage fast food jobs for the rest of my life, I would do literally any job but fast food but those jobs are unobtainable and I feel scared to even apply. I have no family nor friends so i lack the route for connections. I have a high school diploma in my hands but continue to still struggle entering the work force. I was hoping to get a long term job to save money &amp; Invest into stocks while improving my mental health so that later on, I would enter community college after a year of employment.

I've been rejected from fast food jobs despite having the required qualifications, being ghosted, and not receiving any replies from employers. To be quite frank, I feel that I am out of options.

Any advice on approaches I could take would be appreciated."

I'm about to apply for a job at a fast food establishment: along the lines of cashing / food prep, I'm not sure yet since the the ad did not single out the area. However, I do have a 4-year degree and I am currently pursuing a 2 year programme.
I know this may sound odd but at the moment where I live (in a third world country) we are facing really high unemployment rates and along with the fact that nepotism trumps credentials. There are lots of graduates who like me with our degrees, internships and other credentials are struggling to become employed or losing to nepotism.
This leads to why I am about to start sending my resumes to fast food positions. I know that these positions are mainly for people who are either in high school / just out of high school / working and studying but not for university graduates since firstly graduates would be seeking out jobs in their area of study, but it may mean that hr of these fast food companies might have to  pay a wage taking into consideration the degree.

I've decided I would remove my degree from my resume and only leave my high school / current degree that I am pursuing as well as relevant experience. However that would mean I have a 4 year gap. I'm not sure how I would begin to explain this to the employer should I be contacted to interview without letting them know rhat I do have a degree. Does anyone have any sort of advice on this? Additionally, can employers penalize me beyond me not being hired by them if they find out? Or is it that as long as I keep it to myself or deny having a first degree they have no choice but to move along with the information I provided? 
Thank you guys for reading it all if you got this far! :) Thanks for any advice."

He is the son of a guy who has friends in the company, and came from a project management job at his father's company.

So now he runs a department like the employees are all his children. Even if we are months ahead of deadlines, he gets very emotional, passive aggressive, and sarcastic in everything from emails to meetings to teams messages in the middle of the night. 

Abput 9 months ago I moved laterally out of his department and was promoted shortly after by his recommendation- during the pandemic, we were working remote and I'd work late at times. He would also be up late and we'd chat and had a pretty good rapport going. Sometimes he would seem drunk but I didn't give a shit. It was a rough year or so and he was under a lot of pressure. But now things are way more relaxed, he's still doing it, and I found out he sends these messages to several other coworkers and they aren't always as ""friendly"" as they are to me. He would guilt trip me, but it was like a disappointed dad routine. Others, he talks down to, like a mean drunk.

What can we do about this? I don't work directly under him anymore but have to work with him at times; the others (who do work under him) are worried that HR won't do anything, tell him about the reports, and he will stop the whining and passive aggressive attitude and start reporting these ""minor mistakes"" as poor work performance to really hurt their ability to get promotions or pay raises. So far he hasn't crossed any lines, but it makes us all, especially the women, very uncomfortable."

2,2022-10-20,How do y'all travel for interviews without your boss knowing?,u/Jealous-Diamond8750,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y9ia43/how_do_yall_travel_for_interviews_without_your/,jobs,"I'm a software engineer who can work from home, although I have an average of 4 hours of meetings a day. I can telework, but I obviously can't attend meetings while flying or interviewing. 

I currently have 5 1st round interviews, and 3 of them have resulted in 2nd round, waiting to hear back on the other two, (both of which were 1-2 days ago, so I'm optimistic!).

""Worst"" case, I have 5 on-site interviews. That seems excessive. None of these are near my current location. Fwiw, I'm currently located in Albuquerque/Denver and the jobs are located in the Bay area, Seattle, Baltimore, and a couple in Boston.

Ideally, I spend a day traveling, a day interviewing, and a day traveling back. I could interview on Mon/Fri to bring that from 3 days off work to 2. For the West coast trips, I could return in the evening, bringing it down to 1.

This is still a lot of time. 8 days off work minimum, 15 at worst. How am I to stop my coworkers and boss from realizing that I'm interviewing? That's quite a bit of PTO to take with little notice. Do you typically downselect what places you visit on-site during the earlier interviews? 

I've got the opportunity to work at a lot of really cool and very different companies. I was afraid I wouldn't get any interviews, not this....


What do yall do? Do fewer on-site interviews? Just not care and let your current work piece together the hints before you leave? Some secret method I haven't thought of?"

I've really appreciate the stability the jobs have provided me, but I feel like im getting to a breaking point.

Im feeling extremely burnt out, and come home feeling physically, emotionally, and mentally drained. I feel that I've got to a point where I desperately need to move away from this kind of position.

I'm privileged enough at the moment to not need a full time job to survive, so I'm wanting to step into a part time job, but I really want to avoid any sales type positions or customer services roles as much as possible. I understand that part time work falls a lot into these categories, which is why I wanted to seek some advice.

I'm okay working in a position like this, if its something fun to do. Something low stakes, low stress, ect. I've been trying to look around but I know I'm not the most effective at job searching and I'm just not sure what roles exists that could fit this description. 

If anyone has some specific job types in mind that I could do further research into, I think at least having a baseline idea might help me finding something on my own. 

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"

1,2022-10-20,Should I tell my manager??,u/ImpatientDynasty,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y9j1tf/should_i_tell_my_manager/,jobs,"So I just started a new job a few weeks ago and am in a training program with around 40 people. Today we were on a break and were all sitting in a classroom and I was sitting in the middle of my like 10 person friend group. One of the other managers (not my own) came up to our group and said __ I need to talk to you outside and everyone in the room’s heads turned. I had to climb over people to get out of my row and was like am I in trouble and my friends were like wtf is going on and everyone just watched me walk out. We get outside of the room and she goes “So you’re very long and lean and beautiful but you wore a crop top last week.” I was in shock and blacked out for her next paragraph. I asked if it was what I wore last like Tuesday or Wednesday (mind you today is Friday of the following week) and she said yeah and I was like okay well thank you for telling me? I bet you saw but I was like tucking in my shirt all day (also it wasn’t a crop top, I washed it the previous night and it shrunk and kept riding up and then the waistband of my pants stretched out during the day and kept falling and about a half of an inch of my stomach showed when I stood up and walked and I tried clipping it with my badge but just didn’t wear the combo again. Mind you people wear ripped jeans, sweatshirts, cowboy boots, tshirts, backwards hats, etc. around the office) and nobody had said anything. And she kept saying well I know you’re very lean and beautiful but just wanted to tell you coming from a female instead of a male. I was just shocked. And embarrassed. I had to walk back into the room and like walk of shame back to my seat and all of my friends were like wtf was that about and I didn’t want to start spreading things so I was just like oh she was just saying hi… but of course my best friends were like something’s up and everyone was just staring at me.

Here’s why I’m asking this. First of all, my manager (even though he’s a male) could have said this to me and he didn’t I don’t even  know if he asked her to say anything. Plus, this happened over a week ago, if she was so concerned why not say something when I was wearing it or the day after. But what really bothered me was that she pulled me away when we were all on a break in a fairly quiet room all 40 of us plus other managers and speakers and I to climb over people to get out of the row. We take many short breaks throughout the day and walk around the office a lot and she could have easily pulled me aside during the day when we are all walking around or in passing or even messaged me asking to chat. The way she did this felt humiliating and did not feel like a girl to girl thing it felt like a power grab and I cried when I got home because I just felt like I got sent to the principles office and the whole class was like oooooo what did she do.

So I guess my question is, should I bring this up to my manager? I talked with my mom and friends about it and we all agreed that it was super unprofessional and unnecessary to do at that time and if it was really that important for her to say not to wait over a week to embarrass me. I guess what I would tell tell him is that look I’m here to work and make you and the team proud I’m not sure if you asked for her to chat with me but if anything is ever not up to code please just tell me or something like that. Any thoughts would be really appreciated!"
1,2022-10-21,First interview with this company and I wondered if my first impression was bad,u/MoonShapedPool_8,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y9jb50/first_interview_with_this_company_and_i_wondered/,jobs,"I came to the interview 15 minutes early, and immediately met the man interviewing me. With the shortest greeting, he gave me a test and walked off. In front of everyone, I took an exam. Above me was only one light and everything else around me, everyone at their computers- were in dim to no light.

I was taken to a second room for the second part and finally got to speak and answered a few questions before starting on another exam where they could see. The man supervising started to give me the answers, and then later explained his role was to train so he didn’t expect me to know all the jargon with the interview.

We ended the interview with some questions and he turned to me and said “we will be interviewing these next few days” and I replied “thank you so much, it was so nice meeting you.” And his assistant walked me out- not him.

I wasn’t sure if I cut him off or that was that, but I left and I hope to hear from them, but it seems unlikely. This was my first true interview for a professional position. I was truly looking forward to it, now I’m thinking I need to continue the search. Although, I wanted to post my experience to see if others might see it a different way- or advice to take for a next interview."

Have been applying like crazy since. Finally received an offer at the end of September for a one year contract position at a Fortune 100 company (Company A). My start date is supposed to be 10/31. 

Around the same time, an old coworker approached me about a position on her team at another Fortune 100 company (Company B). This would be a full time position that specializes in an area of my field that I love and have been wanting to grow in. So of course I applied! Really connected with the hiring manager during my interview which made me even more excited about the role.

Got the call yesterday that I had received an offer from Company B! I'll be making about $5k more than I would at Company A, and the fact that it's FTE with better benefits, potential for bonuses, etc is obviously a huge plus. 

So, real question is, how do I tell Company A I'm no longer interested? And what's the best timeframe? Ideally, I'd like to make sure my background check and drug test for Company B are complete first. However, I'm receiving my laptop for Company A in the mail today and am supposed to contact the agency I'll be working through to go over set up and first day procedures. I'd hate to waste their time getting everything set up when I know I'm just going to be turning them down soon anyway.

Quick background info:
- I’m 24 years old
- Still living at home with parents saving money
- Looking to move to LA area to live with friends/live away from home for the first time

I’m currently an Assistant Golf Professional at a pretty nice country club. After graduating from college, I was all in on for golf industry but I no longer have interest… money isn’t there and I struggle with working on the weekends.

I probably made around $49,000 my first year ($20/hr + commission + lesson rate)

I’m looking to switch careers into sales and I currently have an offer from Yelp. 

Starting salary is $37,000 (which is low) and OTE year 1 is $55,000.

I understand a lot of people in this community dislike Yelp, but I feel like this is a good opportunity/entry level position to get into sales + it’s 100% remote which allows me to relocate to LA in the near future.

Obviously need to make more money if I wanted to move to LA..

What do you guys think? 

Thanks for the help!"

3,2022-10-21,Being Targeted by Senior Manager,u/rebel_slav,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y9wv02/being_targeted_by_senior_manager/,jobs,"Looking for insight and advice leaning towards helping me keep my current role, if possible.

Basically- I’m really happy with my current role re: what I’m working on, manager, teammates, salary, company benefits, and remote working. 

I started at a role I felt really unfulfilled with and after a while, was able to apply internally for a position that I can really apply my skills and abilities towards about an area I feel passionate about. 

The only problem is my manager’s manager- who over the past year has become increasingly hostile towards me regardless of how hard I work - they always find some way to tear me down in front of others for things that essentially, I would have to be able to read their mind to know. Or, they would make complaints about situations that put all the blame on me, constantly assumes the worst of me before hearing my side, and their complaints often have no basis on what actually happened. 

Especially these past few months I worked the hardest I ever had in my life, sacrificing nights and weekends- directly leading team members through successful events and getting a meeting with a VIP (that went best case scenario)- yet still this person not only doesn’t acknowledge any of that, but tried to go to HR to put me on a PIP but wasn’t able to because my manager defended me.

This senior manager never attends weekly team meetings for our group but will for another team they are also in charge of, and is very disconnected from the rest of the team, where we all get along really well.

I know others would say I should try to join a different team at work or get a different job and those are definitely backup plans but it really sucks that this person is trying to intimidate me out of a job I love and can contribute specific skills and experience for. At my company there is little to no other opportunities to work on this subject and where there are eligible jobs on this topic at other organizations- the salary is a lot lower and not as flexible about being remote.

What can be done to save my position? No one else has a problem with me, and others know how much I work and bring value to the team."

While I can scrape by on the salary, it does not pay much more than my last job in hospitality paid and I definitely won't be able to save much money.

The interview went really well and they hinted at me being a very good candidate.

I then received a job offer of 68k. This includes some extra benefits that equate to about 3k cash. I asked them if they’d be willing to negotiate and asked if they would consider increasing the base salary to 72.5k (I was hoping they may meet at 70k).

I was told they’d ask the hiring manager but they came back to say they aren’t willing to negotiate. 

I would have been happy with 68k base before I applied. But my expectations increased during the process. I also feel deflated by being told they wouldn’t negotiate. 

Did I try to negotiate too high? (I set out why I wanted a higher base salary)

Once at 1 week post interview, 1 month, 2 months and no 2 and a half months post interview. I keep getting the same answer from the HR director that they have not decided the next step of the process and that they will contact with any updates yet here I am almost 3 months later with no update in what’s going on.

I had to prep for a long meeting right after with my boss. During that meeting,  I told my boss that I should have the report done by eod for my supervisor.  After the meeting I had a lunch break, then came back to check the report and realized nothing needed to be modified, and I sent it as is.

I saw that my boss and my supervisor had a meeting shortly after I sent it.

I later saw that it looks like a 3hr gap between when the report was done, and when it was sent (last modified on pc). I'm worried they think I'm just wasting time or being untrustworthy when it was just back to back meeting and my lunch break.

I'm wondering am I overthinking this, if not should I send an email to my boss and supervisor about the timeline of my day?

I've been at the company for almost a year, and the boss seems to like me, but my supervisor is more neutral if that helps."

10,2022-10-21,"Stupidly applied to a terrible company, got an offer, and probably forfeited unemployment?",u/Inquisitive-Cat7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ya6gfj/stupidly_applied_to_a_terrible_company_got_an/,jobs,"I was let go by my company in September- no ethical or performance issues, just not a fit. They told me they wouldn't fight an unemployment claim if I made one. However, I had been getting severance pay through October, so I hadn't applied for unemployment yet.

I had been applying for new roles, and yesterday I accepted an offer for a new job that's only sort of  related to what I was doing before. It starts in a week and a half. But I think I made a big mistake. In my panic of looking for a new job while unemployed, I didn't look at reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. And now I'm seeing a very scary number of extremely negative reviews for this company- saying that employees are constantly fired before the 60 day mark (when the absurdly expensive benefits start) for minor infractions or no real reason at all, bonuses are not paid out, extreme micromanagement, crazy turnover, no holiday pay, etc. 

They also refused to give me a straight answer on PTO, while just saying ""you're eligible for our PTO program"" and not providing details. Online reviews have now told me that there is no vacation time whatsoever until you've been there for a year (then you get a whole 5 days... woo). This is a problem for me because I'm applying to grad schools, and I may need 1 or 2 days off in late winter/ early spring to go interview for programs. No company laptop provided, either, and next to no training. And I have to drive 4 hours one way next week for some kind of onboarding- luckily, they at least say travel expenses are covered. But if I quit or am fired, I wonder if they'll make me drive all that way again to return the company phone, at my own expense.

I should have seen the red flags and done my research throughout the process. That is absolutely on me, and it's my fault. If I go back and decline the offer, I will probably jeopardize my chances of qualifying for unemployment (unfortunately, I told a former coworker at the company who let me go about my new role, and it's very likely he told the owner. It's a tiny company, and they're all close. I don't know if they could deny my claim or report me for declining a job offer so they don't have to pay more for their unemployment insurance if I try to apply for benefits).

Should I just start this new role and keep applying to other places like crazy? Or I could decline the role and apply for unemployment anyway, and claim that I turned this down because it wasn't suitable employment- which is probably true, since it's hardly related to what I was doing in any of my former roles. Like I said, I am more than likely going back to school next fall, so I'll only be in the job market for the next 9 or 10 months. Any advice is welcome!"

My issue is that my job is very intense, high stress, and I often find myself working into the long hours of the night. TMI but I’m sitting so much that I’m starting to get horrible hemorrhoids and am barely eating simply because I just don’t have time.  

I studied retail merchandise at UT (why I’m in Austin) and started off in retail management which I loved but it paid very little (~50K a year). My background is in account management and business development. I also have experience with local non profits and art galleries. 

At this point I’m very open minded to changing career paths. I would love to have a job that pays fairly (at least 65K) and even willing to take a pay cut from my current position to do something where I can find more work life balance.

I would love to do something physical with my hands or creative. Or if I’m stuck at a computer all day (like I am now) it would be nice to do something where I’m working more like 30-36 hours a week instead of like 55-65 a week. 

Do you guys know of any jobs or companies that pay fairly and have decent work life balance?"

Do you think working at Amazon would open new doors for me? Is it valuable to have it on my CV? Maybe FAANG or other companies? 


Basically if I accept their offer, I have to work more by getting the same base salary but I will have Amazon on my CV.

I have a  4 year degree in IT (dated), have been working in management role in a non IT industry since graduating 8 years ago.  Recently I decided to use my degree and move into IT, with my ultimate goal being something in security most likely pen testing.  Recently I obtained my CompTIA A+ certification and and currently working on my network+ with plans to obtain my security+ after that. I must also preface that I got a pup recently that is now 5 months old.

For the past 6 months I have been working at a IT help desk role.  This role encompasses a large array of things from networks, computer, phones.  This role pays $21/h. And am hybrid 4 days a week, 1 day on site.  The job is super easy and allows me to study for my certifications a decent amount while working. I’m also able to get basically unlimited OT.  Currently I am working on average or 45 hours a week meaning I make roughly $52,000 a year.  The cons of this job are that there is little to no room for advancement.  The tier 2 team is tiny and almost all positions above that are contractors. Work hours and days fluctuate weekly in this role.

I was just offered a position at a  large bank.  This position pays 25/h or $53,000 a year.  little to no OT.  The position is remote 2 days, in office 3 days a week.  The role is a tech support role however it will not be as in-depth as my current role.  On top of the higher base pay there is a lot of potential of moving up after the first year. This role also is a set day set hours role which is nice. One down fall is that I’ll also have to board my puppy 2 extra days a week (costing an additional $50 a week, which puts me at making less than I do now.   

Any suggestions?"

Fast forward 2 weeks to today. I get a call and am offered the job. Yay! But then the HR rep says, “The salary is set at $42k.” 

I pause her and say, I was told the salary would be 56k. She tells me that they ran me through their “experience calculator” and found that my experience puts my max salary at $42k. 

I have a masters degree and 3 years of relevant experience.

I ask if this is negotiable. Nope. I tell them I’m sorry, but an experience calculator was never mentioned in my interview, and I was led to believe that $56k was the starting salary and that I would accept no less. She said they “probably won’t budge,” but that she’ll relay that info to the director. 

Am I crazy, or is this ridiculous?? Has anyone had something similar happen to them??

UPDATE: The university has reposted the job opening, so I guess their other candidate also didn’t accept their bullshit offer."

I have experience in siop as a a process owner and a value stream role on the production floor of a airplane company overseeing 26 direct reports. I have about a years worth of experience now including my internship with this company but long story short I hate where I am located and the job I am in. I have one more rotation after this one to complete the program but I can’t see myself completing it with how much I hate this role and miss home. I have been applying for almost 3 months and although I am getting interviews I am not landing anything after hundreds of applications. My goal is to move back to nwa and get a job with walmart or one of the companies in that area but I can’t seem to land anything. It’s frustrating because my current company prizes the role that I am in but I can’t even get an entry level job. Does anyone have any advice?
1,2022-10-21,how to approach two current jobs on resume/at interview,u/RCP1990,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yaaq6s/how_to_approach_two_current_jobs_on_resumeat/,jobs,"Setup: My 1st job went full time remote in early 2020, so I picked up a second, higher paying job last year that is also remote. The second company was bought out by a different company shortly before I started there and it looks like my position will be eliminated. In addition, a handful of the people that hired me no longer work for the company. I want to interview elsewhere with the purpose of replacing the second job (1st job is too easy for me to give up. - work is not difficult and I really enjoy it, I just want more money in order to live a bit more comfortably).

How would you all put these two jobs on a resume? is it /better/ to list both as 'current', or /better/ to list the 1st job as ended when the second job started (i.e lie)? presuming no verification of employment is done. The second job is in the same field but uses quite a bit more skills than the 1st.

likewise, how would it be best to approach explaining the two jobs in an interview? Some companies understandably would shy away from me as a candidate if they thought I would not be 100% applying myself."

I said yes and I’m optimistic, but should I be?  I’m pretty qualified for the role (have experience with most things) but you could argue I don’t have quite the number of years of experience for each of the job/softwares/etc listed.  

I assume they offered to someone else who rejected them?  Or they originally thought my financial ask was out of their range?

I assumed this was another chinese scam call since that's 99% of the calls I receive. So I wasn't exactly in a rush to check it.

Fast forward to right now (Friday night) and I just now checked my voicemail since I remembered it existed.

Low and behold, it was from a potential job employer that I interviewed a week ago...

I called back as soon as I saw that, but obviously no one answers at midnight on a Friday/Saturday. I left a voicemail saying that I was so sorry and to call me back when they were available.

Now I'm freaking out because maybe they'll think I was intentionally ghosting them or they might've already given the job to someone else the next day. Or even worse, it was just a call to tell me that I didn't get the job and I'm potentially stressing out over a ""missed rejection"".

Either way, they probably won't respond until Monday since that's how business days work and now I'll have the rest of the weekend to be anxious about all this.

(even getting an interview).,u/Jednbejwmwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yaf098/how_to_obtain_entry_level_position_at_hospital/,jobs,"I want to get a job in a hospital. I have a bachelors in public health. I have over a year experience being a contact tracer end of 2020 up until the beginning of 2022. I have volunteer experience (6 months each, COVID chatline in 2020  + a remote position where I worked with special need kids in 2020 (position was remote due to COVID)). I know I don't have enough experience to get a great job at a hospital, but it seems like I'm not even getting a chance at entry level positions? I applied for an environmental service / housekeeper position (basically cleaning) and I have not even been reached out for at least an interview yet. My resume has been ""Under review"" for over a week now, but I feel like I might not even get an interview at this point. I also applied as a patient transporter. Same thing, resume under review for over a week but no call for an interview yet. These jobs are entry level and don't have certain requirements, they just have ""housekeeping experience preferred"" or ""Previous radiology or hospital experience preferred"" in the job listing (again, not required just preferred). I'm also applying directly to the company's website, not through Indeed or Linkedin etc.  *To add in, I also have a BLS certification from AHA which I have listed in my resume.* What am I missing here?? Is it that hard to get a job at a hospital? Even if it's janitorial work? 


I had a job interview at another hospital last month for a patient transporter. It seemed like the manager basically chose me for the job, but I ended up not getting it lol. They basically ghosted me. Which sucks because I was really looking forward to it. 


I just need more opportunities for at least an interview? Because I'm usually not making it to that stage. I just get an automated email saying they chose to go with someone else. Thinking of maybe posting this in the resume sub for tips if I'm lacking somewhere there. I feel frustrated. It seriously seems like I got a degree for nothing. I live in a very suburban area...hospitals are limited. I don't have much opportunity."

Ideally I’d like a role that could be done fully remotely or hybrid. I have no ability to draw (like comically bad and my hands shake) at all otherwise I’d of considered some type off digital art/creative career. I wouldn’t mind an office role but would like some agency over my work.

Not sure where to go from here.,u/hayleyelyce,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yamqs9/havent_heard_back_yet_after_final_group_interview/,jobs,"So this job is within the same company I already work for, and I have been very back &amp; forth about staying with my company. Ultimately, as soon as I chose to stay, this position was sent out to current employees in the company as they are looking to promote from within. This position would give me a HUGE salary increase, amazing benefits, a better schedule, and the ability to work remotely. 

Fast forward, I was the first applicant &amp; first interview. I sent my thank-you email and got a response almost instantly complimenting my experience and personality. There were more interviews throughout that week, and ultimately it was narrowed down to three top candidates including myself to do a final group interview. 

That final group interview went well, the interviewer told us we were all great &amp; there were no wrong answers. I have 1.5 years experience in the company, another candidate had 3 years, and another had 6 months. It sounded as if the interviewer was going straight from our call (virtual interview process since it’s a remote position) into a call with their colleagues who were also sitting in to observe the interview and make a decision from there. 

It has now been several days since the last interview and my second thank-you email. I don’t know if they’re busy, having a hard time deciding, made an offer to one of the other candidates that hasn’t been accepted, or what - but I haven’t heard a thing since. 

I know, “always apply to other jobs, the job hunt doesn’t stop until you have an offer” but this is the only job I applied to &amp; have been very hopeful towards getting it. As I said, I’ve been very back &amp; forth about staying with the company. I love the company, but the hours in my current role have been tough on my family, and I’ve been struggling financially so this opportunity literally seemed perfect for me. 

I think that I have realized that if this doesn’t work out, I need to find another higher paying position, preferably remote, but at least day shift hours. I’ve been working for 10 years (I’m only 24) and have never had time or money to enjoy life at all and my mental health is in the gutter. It’s always been paycheck to paycheck, never making beyond $30k in a year. I lost my college scholarships when my mom passed away &amp; I wasn’t able to fully focus on school so I have no degree or ability to go back and get one. I just feel lost and don’t even know where else to go in order to find an opportunity like this again. I’m honestly still trying to hold out hope that I will get this job."

I’m a year away from being a qualified accountant. My current company pay £30k. I’ve been offered a job externally at 45k (qualified salary at current company). 

I handed in my notice last week &amp; my current company have countered with 35k, making me the highest paid person at my level (large company). 

With the extra cost of travel &amp; paying back study fees up to now, I’d be around 200 better off per month if I leave. 

I’m highly valued at my current job and know I’ll always be safe. The new external job would be a step up in responsibility but give me less job security.

Every week they would touch base with me and say ""it's happening"" and to ""be patient."" 

In August, an opportunity with another company came along which sounded interesting so I applied while still waiting each week for this ""promotion."" I now have a job offer from the other company which would be less work, more time at home, and a 10% pay increase.

I told my supervisor that I have another offer and I'm contemplating accepting it. They immediately asked what it would take for me to stay. I gave them a number... the same number they said I would be promoted to. They said they would make it happen. 

Next day, I meet with the boss and they say they ""can't do the 25% like they thought, but they can do a 10% raise immediately"" and if I stay and be patient they will be able to get me promoted to a new role where they can meet that 25% raise. I'm disappointed because this is a role I saw myself making a career out of, but the empty promises mean nothing. I've been patient. 

The thing is... I really love my current job, but it feels like it's time for me to go. Advice???

Since its a small company I do all the production scheduling, purchasing, receiving, quality control, outbound shipment organizing, among other things that I've taken on along the way, so there's a lot on my plate. I've been there 2.5 years and in the hiring contract it stated we would have performance reviews every 6 months and salary adjustments would be discussed at that time. The first review I got was around 8 months in and when salary came up they said at the time it wasn't on the table because ""reasons"". These reasons were small errors that come with training someone for a position without fully explaining the task to them, I saw them more as procedural errors (from a lack of written and referenceable procedures) than poor performance. They didn't cost the company any money but it was more along the lines of ""document X wasn't filled out correctly for record purposes"" but to be fair, it wasn't. The only other review I was given was 3 months ago, which I had to hound my manager about for months in order to get. When salary adjustment came up this time the reason I was given for denial was because ""We don't know how much fair market would be, therefor we don't want to make any changes"". I was taken aback by this notion as it was their job to do the research on this and just saying that there are conflicting results on the average salary so they give up on it seems more like an excuse so they don't have to pay. I would understand no adjustment for the first review because of performance reasons but I haven't even received a cost of living adjustment when the inflation rate is the highest it has been in 40 years. I've only been here 2.5 years but is it time to start looking other places for employment?

I took the offer two whole months ago. All signed and accepted. First day-no laptop, then super old laptop. My medical aid has not been switched over. I interviewed so many times and levels for this role, with assessments - I feel like I am demoted by the time I join. I meet my boss who is 1 month older that me in the company and my age in human years. I bet he knows I was hired for his role and got demoted, as we don’t see eye to eye on most things. I deal with data and I can program to death and he has an MBA, a longer working history and he knows the boss much closely.  Yes I do feel salty. 

I have complained about my dealings with IT personnel where everyone ignores unless you go queue on the IT floor, My medical aid lapsing and fears, French toast being shell toast and feeling like no one was expecting me. The HR lady got unhinged about my complaints, I got 1/3 of the stationery I asked for and my laptop crashes whenever I run any sql query. 


The place demands that I come to work daily, which is the pits in my country. Potholes and entitled taxi drives who ‘own’ the road are at their worst in peak hours.

There seems to be a ‘ don’t complain’ culture ‘ in this place. Maybe only ceo can complain? I did get a 20%+ increase to come here, but the culture shock is too much. Why must I spend my money to do a company’s job? Why must I be silenced? How will there be improvement? From IT to Canteens,no one can take negative feedback. I feel labelled and unwelcome. The financial increase does not cover my emotional wellbeing, plus workers tax just increased. ☹️"

I'm not sure what to do.

Some context:

I'm an undergraduate senior (BS Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences) applying to roles in various functions in multiple industries (primarily biotechnology investment research/operations/strategy as well as direct R&amp;D). I've worked in neuroscience and cognition labs for a couple years now (two summer internships and part-time during the school year ).

For one biotechnology investment firm in particular, I passed a Hirevue screen, worked through a case interview with someone currently in the role for which I applied, and spoke to another employee about my background/career goals/interest in the company/etc. . By this point I was really excited about the opportunity, being that it's in NYC, has nice benefits, the work would be interesting, etc. . I was even invited for the final round, consisting of speed interviews with various employees, as well as a group case interview with other candidates.

The hiring manager (?) indicated that we'd receive an update in a couple weeks as to the final round date; a couple weeks passed with no update, I reached out, and the hm explained that scheduling was still underway and that they'd provide an update asap. It's now been a little over 3 weeks since I received that email with no further correspondence. The application deadline for the role was October 15th, so I'm hoping they're planning a one-batch final round with all candidates and are just working through other applications/second-round interviews before settling on a date.

Should I reach back out and ""restate my interest"" for the role? I don't want a follow-up email to come across as impatient or overbearing.

Thanks for any advice."

About a month and a half-ago, I began casually looking for a new job. Because I was just sending around my resume and seeing what stuck, I was very surprised when a cool hospitality company said that they were interested in meeting with me. We scheduled a time for an interview. On the day of the interview, I woke up feeling extremely ill. Took a COVID test and it was immediately positive. I called the manager and apologized profusely, but she was super kind about the whole thing and assured me that finding the correct candidate wasn't a race for her and she was more than happy to reschedule instead of doing the interview over the phone or ZOOM.

Once I was fully recovered, I ended up meeting with her and one other financial officer in the company. The interview went over the allotted time, was very conversational, and actually fun! I didn't even need to ask what the next steps were, as the two of them asked me to meet with them and the owner of the company (who was traveling across the country!) the following week.

I had that interview last night and I left it not knowing how to feel. While I still feel like I had good chemistry with the two interviewers from the last time (one of which would be my direct superior if I were to get the role), the owner of the company was EXTREMELY hard for me to read. Again, the interview went over the allotted time (probably because I asked so many questions at the end) and was partially conversational, but I find myself now overanalyzing my behavior. At the end of the interview, the owner told me that they were planning on making a decision on either Monday or Tuesday next week.

It's just funny to me that a casual job search turned into me actually REALLY wanting this one. I'm just feeling so much anxiety right now. Idek, I know that I just have to wait to see what their answer is, but waiting is so hard lol!!!! How do you all deal with the anxiety that follows an interview???? If you read this far, thank you!"

Out of college a few months ago (UK), been looking for a general retail job to fund driving lessons and what not before proper job searching in my industry.

I had an interview today at Specsavers (glasses/optician retailer) for an 'optical retailer' role, essentially doing preliminary eye checks, ordering glasses, selling them etc.

Obviously I'm younger and about £3 per hour below average rate for an adult minimum wage. The interview goes well and they say ""we have a few applicants we are interviewing next week so once we sought them all out, we will get around to messaging you all around the week after with our result"" yet within two hours of the interview I'm instantly offered the job.

Screw the people next week then?.

When I was younger I had a similar scenario at a summer job where I am 15/16, no experience and I'm offered a job in Poundland on the spot, bit weird but ok, and it goes awful, no help, no shadowing, just left to myself and I crumble. Perhaps im basing this job offer on that without logical reasoning?

They said I was great in the interview, but I cant tell if I'm overthinking things and it's all dandy, or if they are just extorting me for my low pay rate and age in the hope I will be agreeable. 

I understand that all retail jobs are likely to be shitty and unenjoyable and for someone my age all I care about is earning a living and not being sitting inside all day, but given this is my first job and I'm an anxious person, I cant help but feel I'm putting myself in an position that is going to go sour.

For the level of training it is going to require to learn all this optical stuff and the entire process of checks etc of understanding someone's eyes, I'm thinking I just turn the offer down and continue interviewing at general shop retailers which I have one lined up to interview. At least I'm just scanning items and stacking shelves.

Any thoughts?"

I applied for that job in late July but they took roughly 5 weeks to contact me for an interview and in that time I moved cross country. The interview was virtual at the end of August and they offered me the job in mid September. Since I was unemployed at the time, I did accept the position but was told the background check would take \~2 weeks to complete and the start date wouldn't be until early-mid October.

While waiting for that, I decided to keep looking to see what was out there and saw a job I thought I was qualified for with Company D in a different industry and applied, this is around late September. I had a pre-screen call a few days later and said I had an offer that I didn't accept yet (a lie, because I didn't want them to count me out at the time). I received a call in early October from Company D about scheduling an interview for the position and that is this Wednesday.

For Company P, the background check and settling in took longer than expected so I didn't start until this past week. But I'm not sure what to tell Company D in the interview if they ask me my current employment. If I lie and say I'm still unemployed, won't they see that on a background check (assuming they'd run it since it's a big corporation)? If I tell them I just started a new job, will it come off as ""flaky"" if I say I'm willing to leave my current job to work for them if offered the position?

 Now with that out of the way. What job do I need to sit in those chairs on a regular basis and how do I get one of those jobs?

 Also, yes I could just buy a similar chair but there's no sense of accomplishment to that, no sense of satisfaction it'd feel hollow, bad even, considering those chairs are probably kind of expensive. Thanks!

I am 22 years old and have been working for a large corporation in online advertising managing campaigns. I started in July so am coming up on 4 months. I know that’s not very long but I am so stressed all the time. It’s all I think about. I feel like I can never relax. Within the last few weeks I think about quitting daily. The benefits are good for my age: 60k + 20k sign on, medical, dental, 401k, stock options. But I can’t see myself doing this for years. How long should I give myself before it starts the improve? I feel so isolated working remotely but that’s the team culture. This is not a field I studied but through an internship in undergrad came to have a job offer right out of college. It made sense at the time to take a sure thing. Now I can’t help but feel I made a mistake. At the beginning it was okay but now that I’m fully in role I feel so overwhelmed. I’m planning to talk to my manager this week about my bandwidth but I’m also worried how that will look for me. My team is helpful in answering questions but the fully virtual environment feels so isolating. I can’t help but feel that a job where I could deal with people more 1:1 and not be so beholden to client wishes and deadlines would be better for me. 

Is it normal to feel this way? I feel like I need to stay for a year, if at least to not have to pay back the bonus they gave me, but most days I can’t imagine staying that long. Any advice is welcome."

Unfortunately management was really poor at the new job and the CFO quit (she was the one that hired me). I felt so out of place so I literally returned to my old firm a little after a month of quitting. A year later, I make the decision to move again. After almost 5 years of experience under my belt I was seeking a senior role. I didn’t get it, so I took up a new job in the city which is ok but the costs outweigh the actual compensation jump I thought I made.

My old supervisor calls me and says we will match your salary and promote you to the senior role if you return. On paper it’s a no brainer because of the title promotion and higher comp (removing the city travel costs and taxes). But going back to a job twice doesn’t look right to me. I’ve only been at the new job for two months. How should I tell them I want out?"

How likely is it that 2-3 years of local LE experience will help me get a federal “agent” position or any alike?

I know landing fed jobs out of college is difficult, i’ve been trying but no luck, I had a couple internships with local PD’s but I know that doesn’t really make me stick out.

My current career path plan is to work for a local PD, gain some law enforcement experience &amp; then apply to CBP Office of Operations sector and become a federal law enforcement officer. Beyond that I feel like my chances will broaden to higher federal positions with all of that experience. Does that sound ridiculous or like a solid plan?"

They also forgot to take out one small detail so I know it’s my company. 

Backstory, I was hired through recommendations from multiple people. I negotiated a high salary, but level with my experience. I then had the worst onboarding of my life. It was “ok, go figure it all out” kinda thing. And this is a high level role with multiple departments. 

6 months in, the COO is fired. Our Director of sales quits. So I’m left to support my teams and the rest of the company. 

DOS isn’t hired for 4 months and COO isn’t even filled after 6 months. I basically hold things together with duct tape and burn myself out. Do I get lazy? No, but we have turnover in department leadership due to me not being able to be the leader I should be with all this added responsibility. 

I pleaded for help. And none was given. The President of the company oversees multiple companies and was in about 1 time a week. I tell them I need feedback, but none is ever given. 

I was told “we don’t need these roles, the teams should be able to handle this” which is BS. Those are two huge roles in my world. 

So, I become despondent, I fight back. I challenge. 

Now, I see my job posted confidentially online. Not on the company site. 

Not sure how to proceed. But it’s just funny. I was not given a fighting chance to succeed (although we have been) and now I see this. Ugh.

EDIT: I did apply for COO and interviewed per the request of my boss when it became available. I wasn’t going to apply. But they provided me with learning pathways and showed investment about 2 months ago. 

Also it’s posted at like 50k less than I make."

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I'm 23 and I've been working on my field for 3 and a half years now.

I'm currently working at a very small company (one boss and two employees: my colleague and me). I started two years ago. At the beggining I was fine and really enjoyed it, but with time my boss put more and more responsability on me. Too much for my age and (lack of) experience, I think.

I wasn't really aware of the responsability I had until four months ago I made three big mistakes in a row that cost a couple thousands and a little bit of a bad reputation. My boss didn't supervise my work  because ""he doesn't have enough time"". It was a mess. My boss yelled at me several times, I felt terrible.

(My boss has a very short temper and he usually gets angry and raises his voice, which makes me feel scared and anxious.)

Since then I'm kinda traumatized and now I get really, really anxious for every single task I have to do, even if it's the smallest and easiest thing. I can't help thinking I'm going to fail again if I don't pay close attention and look over things at least three times.

Although *rationally* I know I can do my job and I can do it pretty good. But I can't *feel* it...

This crippling anxiety is taking over me and I can't control it. It's scary to see what your mind can do to your body... I take too long to do things, I've been wanting to cry almost every day in the last two weeks, I get shaky hands, headaches, a feeling of a big hole in my chest.

I'm starting to look for other jobs. I want to join a bigger company because I need some training before having so much responsability, and I think that's what bigger companies do. Am I right?

Any advice for dealing with the anxiety while I stay at my current job?

Thank you very much and sorry for such a long post. Be well you all."

My question is, do you guys think the 2nd round interview be more of a personality check or will it be more technical questions or a mix of both? What are your experiences like in help desk interviews?

Also if you can share any tips I would greatly appreciate it, this is my first help desk interview and I honestly did pretty bad in the phone interview since my nervousness got to the best of me a couple times but it got better throughout the interview."

I'm an English-Polish translator. I offered to send them a resume and wrote that we could establish pay rate together. They replied saying they'd like to see my resume and asking what pay rate I'm thinking about. I answered with my resume and a pay rate, adding that the price is negotiable because I know the usual payrate for translation varies from country to country. They didn't answer for 5 days so I wrote them another email asking if they got my resume because my emails often get stuck and don't reach the recipient (that's true by the way). They replied a day later that yes, they recieved the resume and thanking me. But nothing else in the message. That was yesterday. Should I wait for another response or is that it and they don't want me to work for them? Maybe the payrate was too high? I have no idea what I'm doing. Help?"

I'm happy to work at our home office, but I've got too much going on during the next couple weeks and am unavailable to work out of town for the remainder of my time here. ""*

What do you think about saying something like this? Or do you think I should I just suck it up, grit my teeth, and travel as necessary knowing I will be gone in a couple weeks?

As summary background, my work/life balance is a flaming dumpster fire and I am absolutely miserable while I'm working at the project I'm traveling for.

now i’ve always been interested in being a librarian, but to become one you have to either do a specific bachelors in library sciences or a 3 year education program, which is full time with barely any pay. i already moved out, so that’s not an option as i couldn’t finance my life that way, and i really don’t want to move back home.
the most obvious, but also only jobs i can think of that only require a bachelor of history and not some specific education is the museum sector. while that is interesting to me, it’s specific to a point where i have to think of other options as well. 
so that’s my question - what kind of jobs can i expect to apply for or think of once i finish my education?"

I am 35, have 2 small children and will be returning to my horrible job in a few months when my maternity leave is up (I'm in Ontario,  Canada). My job is SO stressful,  i hate my boss, the environment is toxic and the pace is burnout level 1000. I don't have many options in terms of other jobs i can do to stay at my current salary (just under 70k/year) and continue to have benefits, pension, etc. I no longer want to work in the field I went to school for (Recreation- Gerontology) and would like a higher paying job that has benefits, pension and a Monday-Friday schedule. I don't want to sit at a desk all day anymore either. Lol I know, I'm asking for a lot!

I have been doing lots of research and did a bunch of career tests. I feel like Dental Hygiene could be a good fit for me. I love helping people, the salary options and hours look good. I'm looking at the course at George Brown College.

How do you find your job? How is your stress level? What is it like raising a family while being a RDH? If there is anyone out there who did the program at George Brown, how was it?

She told my that my manager required me to have a sick note, and when I asked to speak to my manager to ask her about it she refused to speak to me? The last time I called in I was only asked to find someone to cover and this was a different manager, and when I'm working I've had a few people call in sick and never be told they needed a sick note. I also couldn't find any information in my contract about calling in sick or what our policies are. Am I required to provide a doctor's note? I feel like that would be unreasonable because 1. I just have a common cold, 2. My doctor charges around 30$ for a note and 3. I've never been asked to provide one and can't find in our policy if it is or isn't required. Oh and the manager refused to speak to me on the phone or call me back at a more convenient time for her. I also have work tomorrow and I'm torn.

61,2022-10-23,Am I making a huge mistake if I don’t accept this job offer?,u/caffeineate-me,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ybk1u5/am_i_making_a_huge_mistake_if_i_dont_accept_this/,jobs,"I’m a 30-year old female with a humanities Master’s (I originally wanted to pursue a PhD/academia, but I no longer feel that is a viable path for me). I’ve primarily worked in museums and libraries, and I’ve never even hit $30k a year in my ~6 years of working. 

A few months ago, I applied for a position with a nonprofit. The nonprofit itself is right up my alley, as far as my personal and professional goals are concerned. And the company culture seems really healthy as far as coworker relations and work/life balance. 
I feel like the position could potentially open up doors for future possibilities with the same or similar organizations. 

After a very rigorous interview process (probably the most detailed and intensive I’ve ever gone through before), I was offered the job with a salary that initially made me swoon, as well as a modest relocation package, as the job is in a different state. 

Here’s where my hesitancy comes in. Upon receiving the offer, I immediately began researching places to live in the area. I didn’t realize how drastically different the cost of living would be from where I live now. I’d basically be in a very similar financial situation to the one I’m currently in (unable to save), plus I’d be in a big city that I’m totally unfamiliar with (the largest city I’ve ever lived in had a population of 650,000 – this one is 2.6 million) 

I have always wanted to work for an organization like this one (although perhaps not in this specific role - it’s fine, just not a dream or anything). But I’m not sure it’s worth the massive move to live in a much smaller space and still not be able to, for instance, save for a house of my own one day. But I worked so hard to get this offer, and I’m also afraid of missing out on potential future opportunities if I don’t take it."

Now this is a position for a construction company and during the interview process, I was clear I have no experience in construction and they said it was not an issue and they would train me. I was really excited to get started since project management is the career switch I wanted to make. 

I started three weeks ago and frankly, there isn’t any formal training going on.
I really love my coworkers. They are all overworked but really trying to help me. On my first day, my coworker asked how I dealt with being yelled at. As I spent more time at work, other coworkers mentioned that our boss will yell at you if you get something wrong. This is just for an overall idea of the environment.


Now, let’s skip to last Friday, my boss asked me to order some items. I order the items specified in the documents we had on record. He tells me it’s wrong and how did I think that was going to work and telling me he showed me something showing me how it should look so I should have known. I try to explain my side so that I do not repeat this mistake. He tells me that he doesn’t want to hear excuses. I start crying out of frustration.  It turns out that I didn’t even make a mistake but as I got stressed I didn’t communicate effectively which led to this useless misunderstanding. My boss was nice to me and mentioned he had high expectations and implied that he questioned my intelligence when he thought I had made a mistake. It is upsetting that he didn’t question the potential lack of training or if maybe I needed to be trained differently. 

I currently feel that I don’t have the tools to be successful in this position and I really want to do well and be better with stress management and communication. I have never cried in any of my past positions and I really want to gain better control of myself and situations.

Do you guys have any tips on how to deal with that type of environment? What can I do to be successful in this position? Any resources to learn more on my own? What can I do better?"

I’m looking for a career change and not really sure what my next steps are but had a look at some of the in demand careers and digital marketing seemed like something I could possibly see myself doing. I’ve found some free government skills boot camps I’m thinking of applying for. I’ve tried several career quizzes and jobs in different industries from childcare to animal care but was a dead end. 

The course I’ve seen for digital marketing covers the following topics:

* Identify and apply the core principles of marketing theory
* Understand the importance of collaboration in delivering successful marketing campaigns
* Recognise and apply the different stages of the customer lifecycle
* Recognise the benefits, limits, risks and constraints of customer relationship marketing
* Understand how digital marketing and social media can form part of an inclusive marketing strategy
* Google Analytics and Principles of Coding
* Hardware and software components
* Marketing/Social Media Content
* Cyber Security
* Design, build and implement a campaign
* Know how to manage and market their own skills and services

I wanted to know how relevant this course would be to a career in digital marketing. 

As I currently work retail and have a background in customer service/sales. It makes me hesitant as when I hear marketing I think sales which I associate with the pressure to get upsell customers in store. I hate it. I’m not bad at it in fact I’m generally one of the top performers at my current job but I hate feeling like putting pressure on people to spend their money especially when there’s essentially no bonus for me. 

I’m very interested in the aspect of social media marketing, putting together campaigns and connecting with other people. I’m someone who enjoys putting together presentations. I have a small online hobby business so I enjoy things like making listings, managing social media, curating product images etc. I like the creative aspect of it. 

A little background on myself. I’ve worked mostly retail/hospitality for luxury/health brands. My highest level of education is my Level 3 BTEC. I did attended university for Human resource management and psychology but dropped out before my final year due to personal issues. 

If anyone could share their experience of the difference roles and day to day experiences working in this sector I’d greatly appreciate it."

Advice?,u/tsubasanobaai,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yc01a7/managing_a_new_store_new_staff_both_need_work/,jobs,"I am in the process of being hired on as store manager for a store that was left to rot by previous management. I'm sure there is more to the story and I'll learn eventually but that is the basics of this situation. Store is in a bad place and I am trying to plan my approach.

The staff is unmotivated and I've been told their lack of discipline has made them lazy. Inventory is off by a mile and price changes might as well be a myth. The owner is making minimal profit and even with an unmotivated and lazy staff, if costs were updated and inventory correct, this wouldn't be the case. Although the profit would be very little, it would still be there.

I believe that the staff of any business makes or breaks it. If they're not willing to back me up and work to improve things then I'm going to be fighting a brick wall my whole trial period. Which is where a lot of my concerns are...

I am looking for some ideas here. What can I do for the staff to earn their trust and what should be tackled first? I was told that the profit margins were off as well due to inventory costs not being updated. Basically, we are selling the product for the same price we are buying it at.

Does anyone have experience with this? Is there a pretty straight forward way to go about this? I am a workaholic so I'd love to stay hours after everyday to address these issues but I do not want my new team to see that part of me yet. I want to gain their trust and give them the opportunity to revive their store themselves with my support instead of depending entirely on my worth ethic. Some of them have been there for many years and have watched the store crumble without any say and I'd love to give them a say.

Looking for any advice regarding any part of this! I am in the middle of writing up a battle plan to present to the store owner and staff but I know there needs to be a balance. I don't want to go in too hard but I do not want to come in with a 'we will get there someday 😌' mentality either.

I am intimidated because this is my first time walking into an entirely new place of work at a high level of management. I have only ever worked my way up. I do not want to come off as incompetent and I certainly don't want to come off as a hardass.

I'd love advice from managers and employees alike! How would you do this and what would you appreciate from a new manager? Thanks in advance!"

I have been here a week, I have done all the HR courses, and spoke to 2 people (team lead and a co-worker) for a combined total of may be 1 hour. I was told to shadow a co-worker, but shadowed them for like 10 minutes before they dropped off to do something else. 

I am not going to complain for being paid to do nothing, but I just want to make sure that it doesn't hurt me in the future. My team lead knows that I am not doing anything (she acknowledged that they are busier than usual right now) and she hasn't scheduled anything in terms of training. So should I just hang on the sidelines until she reaches out to me and gives me something to do or should I be more proactive and ask for things? I don't want to find myself in a position where a manager comes to me and says 'if you didn't have anything to do why didn't you reach out to someone'. What should I do?"

The pressure and work environment doesn’t work well for my mental health.

I realized I’m into minds and people, but most things appear to require experience or education. I don’t mind going back for more school, if necessary, but I’m also hoping to finish a certificate or program within less than two years with experiential learning or a high guarantee for a position.

Things I’m considering:
-Masters in Organizational Psychology (opens options like consulting &amp; HR)
-A certificate for something in HR
-Masters in Education 
-Social Work

I’m not sure if going back for more school is a good choice either. I’m just a bit at loss and uncertain if there’s anything in Business for me, if I should get a different degree so I can get into another industry that is better suited for me and allows me to work more closely with individuals and minds

I don’t have much work experience currently.

Is this legal? Technically if I clock back in at the 30 min mark, I would be working 30 min of overtime everyday. 

I have worked other jobs where it is 8-4:30, and you get 1 hour of lunch but only clock out for 30 minutes because they also add 2 paid 15 minute breaks to your lunch hour. This example includes the required paid breaks which is more in line with what I expect. 

Any feedback on this new schedule and if I should discuss this with my employer?

Edit: 
In California.
Work contract states 2 paid 10 minute breaks.
The job requires direct contact with people (patient care) on the non lunch time so I couldn’t just leave while I’m with them to take my break."

165,2022-10-24,I work for an extremely dysfunctional nonprofit. I’ve been singled out and will be receiving a 90 day review next week. No one else in my office was evaluated until 6 months in. I’m pretty sure I’m getting fired.,u/MuddlingZombies,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ycfgtz/i_work_for_an_extremely_dysfunctional_nonprofit/,jobs,"I just don’t know what to do. Things here are really bad overall, and my ED and I do not see eye to eye. I document everything, because she treats me poorly and there’s no feedback, but I have no one to bring it to. Our ED is also our founder, our HR, and she also sits on the board that she handpicked. She’s also 70 and potentially is struggling with some cognitive decline. 

Here’s a summary of my last week: Founder/ED left a slew of nasty, printed email correspondences with one of our case managers chilling on top of the copy machine that all staff uses.

Definitely everyone saw them and read them. I believe this printout was sent to that machine by mistake, as she has her own printer/copier in her office. 

The email correspondences were nasty and uncomfortable. Not in a sexual way or anything, but there is blatant disdain and disrespect for her employee displayed in the correspondence. It made us all uncomfortable.

In addition to this, I worked on transcribing her case notes for a grant about 3 weeks ago.I was unable to read several sections of her handwriting. I chose to mark each section I was unable to transcribe, and asked for time to go over them together, as she was very busy with grants and very upset over me popping in to have her clarify certain words, etc. She also barred me from asking others for help on this task, stating that if I “continue spreading her information around the office, I will never be a successful exec admin for her.” She made me cry with this statement, then told me to “knock it off.” 

Anyway, first Wednesday, this binder was handed back to me. “I need you to go back and finish this. It’s due Monday.” I told her I couldn’t read everything that’s flagged and had hoped to meet with her 3 weeks ago to discuss it. She told me I needed to just figure it out, it’s due Monday, she doesn’t have time, she’s too busy with fundraising and grants. 

By Friday, I had managed to catch the cold that’s been going around the office. I came into work to finish the binder. I told her I needed to go home when I was finished with it, as I was sick. She proceeds to freak out and tell me I can’t go, she needs this done, it’s due Monday. Did…I not make it clear enough that I fully intended to finish it prior to going home? 

I finish the binder, I bring it to her. I apologize and iterate once more that I am sick and am going home. She adds more work to my plate that I am expected to finish before I leave.

I wrote the introduction to out BBB report and received no feedback on it. The social media and GD person received that feedback and credit. 

This morning, she took work away from me. Later, she came in to let me know that I’ll be getting reviewed next week. I’m pretty sure I am getting fired. I don’t know how to stand up for myself or voice my concerns when this meeting comes. I also cannot afford a job loss right now."

I currently work as a substitute teacher for my local district, a food delievery person (DoorDash), and a small time freelance artist. These jobs are great since I can sign myself up whenver I feel like working. 

Some other jobs I've been considering is my uni's tech support positions and working as a data entry clerk for [insert random name] company. 

I know some redditors will say that I should be studying for some certifications and doing projects out of school, which I do time to time. However, to take the certs tests along with paying my tuition, I need money. It's pretty rough. 

All part-time job ideas are welcome, and I hope this thread will help other college students too. 


P.s, For those who are wondering why I'm working a bunch- I don't qualify for grants and scholarships are hard to come by."

I have another interview with the same company tomorrow and I expect the question to come up again. 

Last interview I started saying that I couldn’t think of any specific situation in the past off hand but that I think in that situation I would discuss the issue with coworker and management to try to find a resolution. They stopped me to say that wasn’t what they were looking for. But didn’t really give me any hints as to what they were looking for, they just made it clear I was not giving them what they wanted in that answer.

It has been bothering me for months wondering what they wanted me to say. And I am nervous anticipating the same question tomorrow and failing it again. 

Anyone have an ideas for how I should answer this?

I’ve dropped out of 2 degrees so far stupidly both in the 2nd year (Business Management/ Veterinary school) due to poor mental health as I was living in an abusive (physical/emotional) home situation till the end of last year. 


I’ve been offered a chance to complete a gov funded skills bootcamp (digital marketing/content creation)and get some accredited qualifications covering the Principles of online/ offline marketing,Google Analytics and Principles of Coding. Completing this program would allow for me to get into an advanced/higher education apprenticeship. 

They offer a range of subjects and the main 3 I considered was digital marketing, full stack web development and software dev. I likely will continue to pursue web development on the side independently learning to build a portfolio/ use those skills to develop the online business I plan on launching soon. It’s a passion project I hope takes off. I’ve previously had a successful small side eBay business when I was a student and really regret quitting as I made sometimes more then I do now working full-time. 

I did make another post enquiring about pursuing a career in digital marketing but didn’t get much feedback but one commenter mentioned the marketing department is the first to get axed. I’m a bit hesitant to pursue it now and I’m not sure how fragile the industry is currently. I currently work retail so honestly it can’t get much worse or more unstable in terms of pay or career progression. 

Is it worth getting into or should I not bother?"
1,2022-10-24,Need help deciding what to do,u/bigrealshin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yclf6l/need_help_deciding_what_to_do/,jobs,"Hi everyone. I (24F) am currently in a fully remote job that I have had for a year and a half. I got this job straight out of college thinking this is what I wanted to do with my life. Once I got the job, I realized very quickly this was not what I wanted to do. I am struggling with putting my two weeks in because I feel guilty about leaving the company and my team behind. I am writing this in hopes to receive advice/help on what I should do. 

Quick back story: I was asked to take over a higher position (no title change or pay increase) within the first few months since one of our team members, who I will call Sue, was retiring. When asked by my manager to take Sue’s position, I was eager to demonstrate my work ethic and take on a new challenge. I had asked what her job responsibilities would entail and received a vague answer. I shrugged and thought it couldn’t be that bad…I was wrong. I spent 2 months “training” for the position and got an understanding of what my daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and year-end responsibilities would be. I quickly realized that I had made a mistake to accept the new position but it was already too late since there was no one else to fill Sue’s job. To make matters worse, I am the only person within our team that has certain access to complete these job tasks. This means it is very hard to take any days off since I am the only person “trained” for this position. On top of learning how to navigate in a corporate setting, I had to learn all of my responsibilities remotely on a zoom call with Sue for 4-5 hours a day for 2 months. Sue was very helpful and transparent with me during these 2 months. She told me multiple times that she could not cover all of the responsibilities within 2 months but to reach out to my manger with help when it comes to certain tasks. Since I have been in this job, I have been miserable. I tried telling myself it was just because I am starting a new job and there will be stress since it is all new to me but it is starting to effect my mental health. I have always been a hard-worker and I take pride in my work ethic but it is becoming harder and harder to complete my responsibilities. I feel like I am letting my team and myself down which causes me to spiral out of control even more. I have expressed these concerns with my husband and my family and they have all told me I should leave the job. My husband has been very supportive for this year and a half and has expressed he will help out financially until I am able to find another job, but I have an overwhelming sense of guilt and a disappointment that I am failing myself and everyone around me. I have had a resignation letter written up for a few months now but I cannot bring myself to press send. I stay up every single night until about 3 am worrying and stressing about all of my responsibilities that I am not trained on and if I am a terrible person for considering quitting. I have reached out to both of my managers and have expressed multiple times that this job has been causing me a lot of emotional distress and that this is not the job or environment I want to be in. They basically told me it was because I was learning a new job and there were no other positions I could move into. As we come to the end of 2022, my job will become more stressful and will require more weekends to complete all of my work. I have already missed out on a lot of family vacations, graduations, and events to try and stay afloat in this job. It is getting closer to the holidays and I know if I stay with this job I will miss out on more family gatherings, events, etc. Is it wrong of me to put my two weeks notice in and leave my team behind or should I stick with the job until I get through the year-end process?"

I used to believe because of the brand name, the bosses and culture would be supportive. But that's not the case or may be it's just my team.
Tbh i came from a super toxic place before joining this (Used to work for 12+ hours, unrealistic deadlines, treated like shit for example managers used to curse, no bonus and was told I should be grateful for the job). I had mental issues (anxiety and panic attacks) because of work. Never experienced anxiety before starting to work.

I wanted to escape so i joined this place as work culture was supposed to be good. I don't have much experience. This is my second company in terms of numbers of companies but I have started feeling bad about this place already because of my manager. I don't enjoy my work in particular as it seems low level for my skill sets. I am confident about my skillsets (worked really hard). I talked to manager about project change (4 times) but he shut me down saying everyone is doing this work so i should do this only. This is literally the excel work and i am more of a coding person. I don't like copy and pasting tables and checking the values manually. My work involves one time coding and rest is excel. In my old company atleast i used to work on good and challenging project but i can never think about going back there as it was a horrible place. We were paid peanuts and were treated horribly. I feel staying here will eventually result in me loosing my skills or knowledge.

Issues:
1. Manager openly tells us that he has right to stop our appraisal for a small stuff like replying late to his email. For him my exceptional work (work is super easy) is nothing because I have more potential than my seniors or peers so my judgment benchmark is higher when it comes to deciding my performance or annual rating. For some work that i can do in a week they can get higher rating while taking a month to finish. That pissed me off. I am being given extra work (this work is not intresting just copy pasting.

2. Doesn't care about my personal development.  Trying to force his idea of personal development on me and asked me to focus on what he believes is good (I am doing that now)
3. He seems to have god complex and try to undermine our confidence (e.g. told my team that he is not good enough for work when in reality that person constantly get appreciation from stakeholders). Too many Gaslighting incidents 
4. He has different rules for different people (currently we have work from home set up. He asked some folks to come to office while to the other group he said work till end of the year from home. I am in the second group thankfully for now)

It's not i don't like or dislike him ( never had any issues with leaves or work with him). I just feel he is very manipulative and i don't get good vibes from him. I am very cautious of this place because of my past experience. I can't tell if this is toxic behaviour or just me assuming things.

Edit: Don't have anything against the company. Seems like a heaven compared my previous company.  I like the fact we have diversity here."

I’ve been here for 2.5 years. I make 74k and I only have a BS in chemistry. But I did internships while an undergrad at other large pharmaceutical companies so altogether I have \~4 years of experience.

Last year, my review was great. I got a “exceeds expectations” Which is the highest ranking at my company. I was disappointed because I only received a 3.4% raise. My manager and his boss are all impressed with my work and performance.

I asked my manager in July if I was on track for a promotion and what I need to do to stay on track. He said I’m on track and that I’m doing great and that we’ll try to shoot for a promotion in the fall.

Fast forward to now, I was told a few weeks ago that I will not be getting a promotion and that I will have to wait until spring for the next cycle. Obviously, I was disappointed. Since July I would ask my manager for updates on my performance and he would also reply with positive feedback.

I asked where can I improve on and I was told that I’m doing great and that leadership is impressed with my work. But it came down to not having enough spots. come to find out they just promoted two principal scientists to director, so sounds like they just didn’t have the budget to promote me.

Spoke with my manager’s boss( he was promoted to director) and he just told me how great I’m doing and that he’s “ confident that next cycle they can make it right” and that I should tell him if I ever start to look for new opportunities.

I enjoy what I do, and I like my co-workers, project, etc. but I’m not feeling valued here. They keep telling me I’m doing great and that they value me here. But I want bigger raise and a promotion. is it time to find a new job?"

It’s the second time I’ll be interviewing with this person, who is both the hiring manager and my hopefully future boss. This round will be slightly shorter than the last (30 minutes vs 45 minutes previously).

I’ve had two other interviews since our first: one with a potential coworker that went incredibly well, and another with a Director-level employee that I think could have gone better. (Jury’s still out on whether I’m being harder on myself than need be.)

Is there any general reason a company might have you interview twice with the same person? I’ve read that often, the first interview is more about personality while the second is more technical—but I feel like the first round with this person was relatively technical already. I’m studying up on the things I believe the Director-level interviewee may have had questions about in case I’m asked to follow up on those, but is there anything else I should expect?

I started at 20 working as a counselor in a mental health program and it was great because I was still going to school and living with my parents and didn’t have a lot of bills to pay. 

I’m 27 now and all of my learned skills are in this field. I suddenly (and I guess kinda stupidly) stopped showing up to a previous job of mine because it was disorganized and I was tired of working in social services but that led to nearly 7 months of zero income and me living off my savings. I took a government job for the money and benefits obviously but it’s the same kind of work and I thought the 7 month break would have allowed me to realign myself but nope, I hate it just as much as I ever have, if not more. 

Obviously I’m applying to jobs like crazy and trying to tailor my current skills to other job categories (my communication is stellar given all the training I’ve had, and I have experience in interviewing, being on panels, doing paperwork, working computers, all the good stuff) but I mean the world is hella competitive! And at this point just a simple interaction with a “client” or a question from a coworker raises my anxiety and probably my blood pressure and as much as I’ll miss these benefits I just can’t take it anymore.

I am unsure what to do and I would love all your inputs.

So I work as UPS as an Engineer. However UPS has laid off multiple departments nationwide , starting with HR, industrial engineering, a finance and finally my group which is building engineers. My final date in the company is October 31st. However, I have until October 26 to find a job internally in UPS. 

Now If I do not find a position before October 26, I will receive a separation package which is 26k before tax. Which is not too bad. 
I have been interviewing internal and external, I have been offered a position with UPS as a supply chain solutions Supervisor in the UPS healthcare side of things which deals with supply chain of pharmaceuticals.
I have also was offered a position on Home Depot as a supply chain Engineer.

Now both positions are different in a sense

Home Depot : Hybrid , 25-50% travel, 25 minute commute ,92K base before bonuses and stocks, 3 weeks vacation 

UPS: Remote fully, will become Hybrid in near future, 0% travel, 0 commute , 77k before bonus, 3 weeks vacation 

Now I hear Home Depot is better on culture than UPS, I hated UPS culture in the engineering side because it’s so negative but I’m not afraid to pursue Home Depot because it’s a new change for me. I’ve been in UPS for 5 years, so I’ll lose seniority. But I can come back after a year if I take the severance.

Has anyone had similar issues in their job findings any insight in corporate Home Depot. Not sure what to do. I’m at a roadblock at the moment.

Thank you!"

I put in a job application last Tuesday and the department director emailed me Wednesday at 8 PM asking if I could hop on a phone call the following day so she could give me some more information about the facility and the position. Not sure if this counts as a formal interview or not. Unfortunately, I had a busy couple of days dealing with some family issues and just wasn't checking my email and I didn't see the email until this morning. That's 5 days! I'm trying to be kind to myself because I'm a new grad and applying for jobs in my career for the first time but mannnnnn.... I honestly feel like such an idiot for not being on top of this one especially because it's in a setting that I really like. I'm definitely going to be more on top of my emails for this job hunt moving forward.

Due to lack of proper response from the populace, the place shut down. 

I had initially didn't mind the job. It was a few bucks in my pocket. However, as I did the job, more and more I ended up having continually bad experiences. I was constantly being stopped by the police, with them trying to determine if I belonged in the neighborhood or not. My last day before it closed was the final straw. I got drenched. And people threatened that if I didn't leave the neighborhood, they would call the police and if the police didn't show up fast enough, they would hurt me to force me to leave. I'm simply doing my job here. Not trying to cause problems. 

A few weeks ago, I was called up over a few days and asked if I wanted to rejoin each time. I told them I wasn't comfortable doing so and informed them as to why.

Fast forward to today. I was called and asked if I was going to show up for my shift. This was literally the 1st time I knew anything about a shift. I had never confirmed that I wanted to work for them again, nor was I in any way prepared to work. I told them no, and what happened. Five more times from the same company I was called up about the same position. Each time I calmly told them that I don't want because I don't feel safe doing it. 

I don't want to give out the name of the candidate as I don't want backlash, but because of all the nonsense surrounding this company not taking no for an answer, the experience of being threatened, this candidate lost my vote. 

But in my shoes, what would you do regarding this company?"

At the end of the interview, the manager said they would make a decision by the end of the next week. That was Friday, and I still haven’t heard back. The interview went very well, I have almost 10 years experience in this role and I’m looking to get back into the field. During the interview I did ask for the high end of the pay scale, and specialized office hours with a defined reason for requesting the adjustment. I mention this because it could lengthen the determination time. I am aware they were interviewing 2 other candidates. I reached out the day after the interview and thanked the manager for the opportunity to meet her and discuss my qualifications. Should I reach out again since the time has passed when she said I should have heard back? I don’t want to sound desperate but I would really like to get back into the industry."

1,2022-10-25,A beer distributor dilemma,u/redmanfuntime,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ycwb6t/a_beer_distributor_dilemma/,jobs,"So I have worked for a beer and wine distributor for a combined 2 years now. I started back in the end of 2020 and my first job there was in the beer warehouse. 

 I tend to be very good at most jobs I do and often times surprise people at how easily I pick things up and nothing was different at this job. My first roadblock came with the beer supervisor and his best friend who also worked there. Some of the things they would do is threaten to beat me or other coworkers up outside of work to get us to do what they wanted. Mind you they are pretty big guys and I'm not a fighter so that's just not an option for me. Constant verbal abuse, I'm not a snowflake by any means but I've seen people quit over just what these 2 said. They would sit in the office and watch us work, leave and take lunches without clocking out, lie about extra work they did and get more money under the table from the company, sleep on the job, take hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of product from the warehouse. All and all just annoying people.

  These 2 led me to leave after working there right about a year. I was only gone for about 3 months however and found myself back because my new job shut down. After being back a year quite a bit is different but some the same. The manager of beer got fired for saying the N word to our black employee. Pouring a beer over the new guys head and refusing to do work as I said a bad fit. But the other one who was just as bad got promoted to manager of the entire warehouse not just beer, over wine too and that is my department. 

  The promotion of that individual was upsetting to say the least I apply for almost any position at my job that would be considered moving up I have My mind set on bigger and better things, but they just decided to put him in that position with no interview at all, after all this I was told by the hiring supervisor that the GM and owner of the company didn't want this guy in charge for the very reasons I had stated at the beginning of this rant , but the hiring supervisor fought for this guy he knew nothing about and now this jack off is in charge of everyone.

  Now my main dilemma is they have dropped quite a few manager duties on my shoulders as well, training, designating tasks to the other workers, making sure everyone's orders are in the right area, receive calls from salesman and managers about account or order changes. Inform and correct mispicked items and so on. I asked for a 1$ an hour raise because I feel with all of those duties I am deserving of at lease 1 more than the other guys there. But I was told they could not do that and the company cannot put anymore money in the warehouse.


  I'm at the point where I will continue to do the work I need to in my wine department but the guy who has been just nasty to everyone if he asks me to do something or tells me to do something else I just won't listen anymore I know I'm getting my work done well and that I'm doing all that I can and more to help out my guys but when we are done and I have to be around that individual I can't even think because all he knows is violence and it puts me on edge. So I won't be around it.

I'm just not sure whether I should wait it out and hopefully move up in this company, find a new job in a new field, I don't know. Any thought on this matter would be greatly appreciated."

I have found a course online that is self paced and want to balance both this and work however I don't really know what to say in the interview since I don't intend to have a long term career there and need to pay for the course. I genuinely do want this job because I have the social skills of a rock and have poor time management skills. I need a lot of improvement and don't want to come across like I am only there to treat them like a stepping stone.

1,2022-10-25,New job or promotion?,u/Aggravating-Mango-54,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ycxa0b/new_job_or_promotion/,jobs,"Hi Reddit,

I’m in a very fortunate scenario where I am given a promotion at my current job due to my manager being pregnant, but I was also offered a job today. 

My promotion will be a program manager, and the new job will be in consulting. The thing is, my promotion will be combining my current role and the new role. Honestly, looking at the job description, it looks like I’ve been doing 70% of the manager tasks already. While I’m worried there isn’t enough growth, I’m also worried it’ll be stressful combining 2 roles. I mostly like where I work, but compensation is pretty low. I’ve been with the company for almost 2 years and might be time for change. Would manager experience be beneficial in the future? Compensation: 50k, 3 weeks vacation, benefits and hybrid 

My new job is in consulting and I’ve never worked in consulting before. It’ll be new, I’ll be learning lots, but it also sounds like it will be a lot more work and more stressful than at my current job. Compensation: 55-60k, 2 weeks vacation + paid 2 weeks off during Christmas, benefits and hybrid 

Is there one option that would be better on my resume than another? 

For more context, I’m 25F and still early in my career."

I was hugely disappointed and let the recruiter know that I felt discriminated against, to which she said the company is trying to maintain a certain diversity inclusion quota. She assured me I wasn’t rejected because of my qualification. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Pretty sure there isn’t anything I can do but just hoping to get some words of advice.

Edit: 
1. I’d like to clarify I was not interviewed. I just had a phone screen with the recruiter and provided my resume with a cover letter via a LinkedIn message. I followed up multiple times over two weeks and finally got this response. 
2. I suspect she divulged this information because she is early in her career and because I established a friendly rapport with her through our conversations. 
3. People asking if I have this in writing; yes, I do. She advised this via a LinkedIn message and subsequently over a phone call.
4. Another interesting information she provided was that they currently have no other applicant for this role, so she has been asked to keep searching (for female candidates). I’m not sure what to make of this. It seems there is no urgency to fill the role, or they are firm on hiring a female.
5. I'm based in Australia, and this role is with a large super fund. The role is a managerial position within their IT department."

A few weeks ago I took a interview and they ended up liking me. They said they would hire me for a data entry position after a background check and all that. Fast forward to last week I get a call for a IT job so we can schedule a interview and once that came around the person interviewing me wanted to hire me on the spot i did accept it but explained i would need to figure stuff out on my end like giving my current employer 2 weeks and that stuff and return my work stuff (its a fully remote job). 

Now I'm effectively in a position where I can leave my current job for a better one (cash and benefits wise) but idk if I should wait on the IT one, which has a better salary than the data entry position I'm considering, to fill me in on the onboarding process or if I should go ahead and take the data entry position and if it goes well with the IT one just jump ship cuz I prefer doing IT work over data entry. I just wanna try to burn the least amount of bridges if possible.

It's the 1st time something like this happens to me so I'm kinda just in shock and am not sure what to do with all this and would like suggestions on how to manage this."

I'm worried if I draw attention to this to my boss, that they may realize that there is no need for this position and ""let me go."" My mental health is also taking a hit as I'm not wired to just sit and nothing all day.  I get joy in being productive and working towards goals.  

Any feedback or tips on this situation would be greatly appreciated."

Since I’m not his boss, I can’t give him direct work requests. He’s also a bit older than me, so he doesn’t respect me either. Has anyone also had similar experiences?

I should probably preface this by saying I had to quit my previous job because I ended up on sick leave due to a burnout. So I decided I'd change fields. Three weeks later, yesterday actually, I cried (at home), because I understand very little at this new job.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have an entire work diary filled with notes, I have met at least a dozen of high level and senior directors to learn the different processes in place as well as the different specialties within the company. I take note, I ask questions, many dumb ones, and I still feel at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's still early because it's only been three weeks but this is starting to weigh heavily on my mental health. My therapist thinks I'm having some sort of PTSD from my previous job. It also doesn't help that I was fired from my very first adult job, less than three years ago, because I was deemed too inefficient and not progressing fast enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, let's not even talk about making friends. I'm eating at my desk, alone, every day i'm at the office. 

It would really help for me to start working asap rather than being left alone with no tasks. My manager is extremely busy, I know it's up to me to build a relationship with him, but I feel shittier with every passing day 

Any help and support would be great and useful for I'm really feeling alienated at this job where everyone understands what they're doing and I don't."

I heard that they are typing up my resignation letter and want me to sign it. What should I do? I do all my work and I feel like this is all coming from the fact that I expressed safety concerns over new policies."

I’m a nurse manager who has experience in the area (northeast) so I have an idea of what people make. I was just excluded from a job for the same position by putting $5,000 more than what I was making before. Got an email saying that, while my experience is very impressive, my salary requirements were too high. So you don’t even want to speak to me? Don’t want to give me a salary range to see if it might be something I’d consider? 

I know I’ve been passed over several times through this process because the application requires me to enter a minimum salary requirement. Do I just start putting a ridiculously low number and then ask for more if the job is offered to me?

For the fact that “nurses are in high demand” I can’t believe that, with almost a decade of experience in my specialty, I’m not even getting interviews."

They explained that they had to make some changes within the company and my position would be terminated right after the meeting. I was upset to hear the news but they did offer me a severance package for 3 months. In this meeting I kept it cordial and asked them two questions. The first was” Am I being laid off for productive reasons or for company changes?” They explained they weren’t allowed to go into detail about that. The second question I asked was “ Am I open to apply for a job with within this company still or am I blacklisted?” They then said that they encouraged me to look for open positions within the company. After the fact I heard from three other of my coworkers who I’m friends with and have their numbers, and they were also let go.
I’m upset as anyone would be but I have already updated my resume and I’m ready to job search. But back to the original question, was I fired or laid off? Just so I can have a perspective for future interviews. Thanks for any advice!"

1,2022-10-25,What Other Creative Marketing Career Options Are Available in the Job Market?,u/calelikethevegetable,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ydei63/what_other_creative_marketing_career_options_are/,jobs,"I need some career development advice here.

I didn't know how to phrase this question exactly, so I tried my best.

Here is some context behind my question: I am a recent college graduate who has been working full-time since May of last year. My college years started at my local community college where I was enrolled in a film program. I completed this associate's degree but noticed that finding a solid reliable career in this space is difficult due to the nature of the industry - TV and film work is off and on, especially in my location of Hawaii.

After I realized the uncertainty of this industry, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's in business. I pivoted my career to apply my self-taught knowledge in design and graphics combined with my video production savviness in the world of business as a marketer.

Now I am working as an in-house marketer for an insurance company (as you know, marketers wear multiple hats, with my company I am a video producer, graphic designer, CRM systems manager, client portal experience manager, digital marketer, corporate trainer, customer support, etc. all in one).

Since my background is more in the creative space, I'm naturally not too thrilled about the administrative side of marketing like CRM, SEO, client portal experience, digital, etc. The issue is when I compare my creative work to real creatives, I feel like my work isn't as good. Especially with still and motion graphics projects, I feel like my work isn't good unless I have access to an Envato Elements template for reference. When it comes to video I thrive more as a producer, director, or post-production editor since I feel like my eye for camera composition and lighting is lacking. Don't get me wrong, I have an eye for knowing what looks good - I'm not completely garbage but let's say I'm not the best either. I'm confident in saying my work is good enough and gets the job done.

Both creative and marketing work is extremely undervalued in the job market where I live. I always hear professionals tell me all the time to move to LA or NYC so I can finally get paid my worth.. the only issue is I am tied down to my family here as they need my financial assistance around the house. So, moving to one of these areas for a job must be for a higher paying job so I can deal with the high cost of living in that area in addition to continuing to send money back home. The thing is it's not possible for someone who just graduated from undergrad to find a $100K+ a year job, especially with my circumstances. Because of this, I am thinking a potential option for me is to find a remote job for a company that is located in a city that values my work... but I don't even know where to start.

I know without a doubt that my work ethic paired with my diverse skillset is rare in Hawaii but I'm still being severely underpaid. I'm having a hard time thinking about how I would go about talking to my manager about a significant pay bump to match my worth knowing that college graduates coming out of the same marketing program I came out of are making significantly less than me even though my current pay is low too. For example, one of the hats I wear in my line of work is CRM system management. There are people whose only job at other companies is just CRM system management and they are making $60K... while I do CRM system management alongside many other additional tasks but my job offer was originally only $45K.

So, knowing my true passions and limitations, are there any creative marketing or marketing roles that would be great for me? I'm thinking consulting for creative projects is my only route but is this even a real thing? Are there any specific job titles and descriptions that would be right up my alley? Are any of these jobs remote-friendly?"
14,2022-10-25,Declined interview with job but now wanting to go back,u/DishDesigner128,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ydeid0/declined_interview_with_job_but_now_wanting_to_go/,jobs,"So I applied for job A and job B. Job A gave me an interview which I then accepted. Right after I accepted, Job B also gave me an interview. I was interested in Job B more because it aligned to what I wanted to do as far as my career goes, so I told Job A I was no longer interested. A month and half into interviewing with Job B, I got rejected. Sad case of interviewing and job hunting tbh, now I'm applying to more jobs and see that Job A is still recruiting. Job hunting is hard and I've been applying to jobs for over 2 months and I'm kind of desperate at this point. Would it be a back look to email the recruiter again asking to reapply for the position? I have both contacts of the hiring manager and the recruiter. So my question is, is it a good idea to just move on from Job A or email them again about the position even after telling them you weren't interested?

TLDR: Told a company I wasn't interested because I was interviewing with another company. Got rejected, now wanting to go back to interview with first company. Desperate, what to do"

I have worked in 3 different programs, changed programs last school year, and loved it (my program consists of 2 buildings with the same admin; different populations). This year, due to staffing shortages and not being tenured/having less seniority, I got moved to the other building, and it has been a nightmare of a transition. One of my AP's came to observe me 2 weeks ago, and despite being rated ""effective"" overall, the observation wasn't my strongest (due to extenuating variables, as well as my lack of experience with this new population), and I had some concerns about the write-up comments. 

Last week, I found out another coworker at my other/original school gave notice to leave, so I e-mailed my principal the next day to request consideration to be transferred back full-time to my original building. My principal e-mailed me back that she would take my request into consideration, and thanked me for giving a lot of notice. Today, I met with my AP (who observed me 2 weeks ago) to discuss some of my observation write-up concerns. My AP revealed that she knew it was not my best observation, and that she contemplated not even writing it up/counting it as an observation.

After further discussing my observation concerns, she agreed to remove some of the constructive feedback she originally wrote, after I explained my rationale for different observation components, which I felt more satisfied with. She then told me the principal informed her of my request to transfer back to the other school, but then said that it's possible I may not receive a transfer back, despite administration knowing I'm not happy at my current school (&amp; directly observing it), because administration also feels that I should work with a population I'm not familiar with to experience more professional growth. They also insist that people tend to move around a lot before tenure, which is not the case for many of my colleagues (many who have worked in the same program with minimal movement). 

I'm feeling very conflicted and mixed-administration is aware that I'm not happy and as experienced with this population, but may not potentially move me back, despite my increased success last school year. I'm given passing observations, but administration is conflicted with how to evaluate me too.

I'm looking at other school jobs, and will leave, if I find the right opportunity (I've gone on some different interviews already), but does anyone have advice on how to handle this situation? I believe if I don't get a transfer back to my original school, I will probably ask to transfer to a different program in the district, as having effective observations is not enough to entice me to stay working in a school with a population I'm not as experienced with (my Lead SLP is aware of the situation too)."

I've talked to several people in my general circles that say they do this, and see people joke about it online pretty frequently. Obviously its going to be more common during this pandemic. But I just talked to someone the other day that said they've basically done this for 3 years, their job is super easy and they make 60k... I don't understand."

There were many changes to this staffing agency when we first started in 2019.  I spoke with 3 other people on the team and it appears the staffing agency has cut off all ties with the team.  Officially we were laid off because of no work and changes at the client company, but we are beginning to believe we may have been let go for negative reasons.  Our hope is that this staffing company is also  down to the barebones and that is the reason they no longer reach out to anyone on the former team.  

It was my first time with a staffing/temp agency.  I have applied to 2 other agencies, but they also have never gotten back to me.  We were wondering if this is just normal and due to a slow down in the US economy?"

3,2022-10-25,Im overthinking and now I cant figure out if I wanna make a career out of my passions/hobbies or if I'm forcing passions/hobbies out of a career,u/ZeBlackPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ydjor6/im_overthinking_and_now_i_cant_figure_out_if_i/,jobs,"I am struggling to differentiate between careers and passions. 

My entire life I wanted to make money and be recognized for filmmaking. This isn't a recent thing with social media has blown up and every other 12 yr old becoming a millionaire, this was a childhood dream that mostly sparked after watching people like Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Steve martin, and Jackie Chan as a child. 

I always had a thing for entertainment and for some reason it had to be film. I've dabbled in music and writing but it never hung around like video did. I've taken video/film classes and did good while also enjoying them, I've made my own little video which were always fun but somethings always felt like it was missing. 

I know this a common issue where people wanna make money off their passions but I started like overthinking and im just confused. 

If I really had to pick a career I would do video editing. Its one of those things that I never really ""enjoyed"" since its just staring at a computer screen for hours at a time while intricately moving and timing frames around but its something I never had any problem doing. Its one of those thing I could sit down and do just because it needed to get done. I think its called the flow state, but it always happens when im editing. 

I wouldn't want editing to be my passion/hobby but I'd have no problem if it became my career.

When I think about things that truly bring me happiness just to do them I cant help but feel as if they're a waste of time if they aren't making me money or any type of notoriety. 

It almost hurts to say this but I dont think making films is a passion or hobby of mine, its more of a dream career. But the things I truly do enjoy like riding bikes, longboards, rollerblades, or exploring new places, or experimenting with chemicals and food aren't super career based. 

Now obviously there are plenty of videos and films based around cooking, experiments, and exploring. But it feels like im trying to force a career out of a passion. If a passion cant bring money it feels like a waste. but at the same time forcing a passion to make money feels wrong and like im picking a passion for the money. It feels like I cant do my true passions because they wont make me money, so im forcing myself to pick a passion that I can make money off of, but that hurts me cuz im like cherry picking things I want to do not because I want to do them but only because they have a chance of making money...

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe im just confusing myself with way too much overthinking. But my entire life I wanted to do film and I believed it would be the most fun thing while also making me a living.

But now I don't even know if I Really wanna do film and if I was just lying to myself because of the career potential."

On top of that I have always been high achiever and have imposter syndrome. Anyways I have noticed a pattern where I will join a company, where I will excel and go beyond expectation. But then I will make a minor mistake, which my supervisor will bring it up and from that point on I will just go super “can’t-fuck-this-up-you-stupid-piece-of-shit-why-are-you-so-dumb” mode and end up making more mistakes.

This happened recently and I noticed the pattern. And the thing is most of the time supervisors when they bring up the initial problem, they are super nice. But for some reason my head travel to when I was young getting punished for the smallest mistakes. Yes, I had tough Asian parents who were very demanding to put it lightly. The best way I can explain the situation is I feel like I’m being watched by everyone and I cannot make a simple mistake and then I try to rush things and end up losing my shit like I’m about to have a breakdown and start making more mistakes. Also I’m so stressed out I’m not even sure it’s good for me. 

Anyways this has been happening for awhile. I was wondering if anyone else experienced something similar and how have they overcome it?"

I then proceeded to complete the IB, another A-level equivalent. 

Since then I've done an undergrad, post-grad and have just completed a Masters. 

I'm filling out application forms and they are asking for my UCAS total and grades, I've put down both sets of A-level equivalent grades I've obtained. My reasoning being that I've sat both and achieved both why would I only use one set when I've done both? 

I was just hoping to get anyone's thoughts on this. Is this an issue or would employers understand my reasoning and likely not have any issue with it? I have even highlighted it to a potential employer just for clarity."

Yes that's annoying, but it probably wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me if I hadn't moved elsewhere during the pandemic. (Five hours away, different state, where much of my family lives.)

My supervisors know my scenario but I've always referenced moving back to the town someday. Now, I have to admit that I actually have no intention of coming back.

I accept this means I need to find another job, but I'm realistic. The job search will take a while and I want to find the right fit. I really don't want to be forced into a worse job just to escape from my current position by January. 

The ideal solution for me would be to continue working remotely for my firm until I find a satisfactory new role somewhere else. I know this is tricky, and I can't just say ""Hey, can you make an exception for me and let me stay remote until I figure out how to leave this place? No clue how long that will take! Months?""

But is there some similar proposal I could make with the same intent while using different words? How could I sell this to my employer in a way that frames it as a mutual benefit? My work is steady and reliable and I have a feeling they wouldn't want to lose me abruptly, though I could be wrong."

I have 3 autoimmune diagnoses and bc what I do is mostly admin/finance, I felt like them wanting me there in person was just a power play so we did a separation of employment. It just didn’t feel safe for me plus there was some micromanaging misogyny that I had been uncomfortable with from the start so it felt like it was time.

From there I worked for a few months with a previous employer bc someone was out on leave. Super grateful the timing worked out there and it looks good that I returned to a previous employer. All good things.

Then found an awesome contract job that I loved that I only worked for about 8 months until I learned that some of the owner’s behavior within the business wasn’t exactly legal. As part of my job there was addressing legal concerns, I tried talking to her for months about it until I finally decided I needed to get out of there.

Now I’ve been without a job since December 2021, have been focusing on getting my health to a good place, and have taken a few courses to keep my skills up. I’ve been searching for a few months now and am barely getting any calls back. 

Is the issue my short term stints at the last two jobs or is it just that competitive right now? I’m even wondering if I should just remove the last role from my resume entirely… thoughts?"

During Annual enrollment they want us to work 2 mandatory hours of OT a day because of all the calls. That means I have been working 12 hour shifts. This has really messed with my mental health as I am feeling extremely depressed and anxious and absolutely dread having to take calls. I am the only one in my team that got stuck with a 4x10 schedule out of 35 people, why? I have no idea, but I knew I would hate it.

HOWEVER, in this role I also process all the applications, meaning not only do I recruit the students, I have to evaluate their applications, schedule interviews, send out acceptance packages and ensure they are staying interested in the program until the start date. It is a lot to take on for 8 programs. 

I have been in the job now for a little over a year and I am feeling a bit burnt out. But don't want to throw in the towel because I have been prompted to develop a recruitment team (which right now is me and one other remote recruiter). I am excited to take on the responsibility but I am meet with push back when I have suggestions about the structure of the team or resources we need (for example we are still using paper files to process applications and I have worked at other places that utilize tech to automate some processes that would alleviate some the work). I do not want to just leave because it is a tough situation, but I have been feeling absolutely unmotivated and uninspired everyday I come to work. 

Any thoughts?"

Anyone here working (or have worked) in a steel mill?  I'm considering applying for a job nearby because I could use an income boost to help my family...but the mill operates on swing shifts (12-hour days, followed by 4 days off, followed by 12-hour nights), which I think I might struggle to adjust to...also, I applied for a manufacturing position elsewhere about 4 years ago, and one of the hiring managers straight up told me that with my background in libraries and the interests I'd shared with him, he feared I'd grow bored of my job soon after I'd finished training...and I worry that I'd experience that boredom in a steel mill environment.  So if anyone has any experience or thoughts to share, I'd really appreciate hearing them!  Thanks in advance!"

During summer, I am a wildland firefighter and fire warden. During winter I am on a fuels reduction crew. This year, they made me the winter crew foreman with no pay increase or anything, and without asking me first. This rubbed me the wrong way but wasn't a huge deal so I never brought it up. 

The winter work sucks. It's slaughtering my mental health. I've made up my mind that I want to quit the full time part and just be seasonal. But now I'm trapped in this crew foreman position and I'm scared I'll be burning bridges if I quit. There's no one else to take over the foreman spot. 

So how do I approach my boss with this information? I feel like I'll be letting everyone down if I quit and that I won't be looked at the same come summer time."

Also when I have my input in a conversation people would act irrationally and awkward. 

I honestly don't like crossing path my colleagues because they purposely wall pass and look another direction.

Due to all of this, I've began to mirror how they treat me and tend to avoid them and even sit by myself when it comes to lunch.

There are a few people that I'm fine with and I went to lunch with one of them. However, another group decided to sit NEXT TO ME only to disregard anything I had to say. I honestly dislike them with a passion and just ignore them whenever we cross paths now.

The worst part is that my desk is literally at the entrance where people walk in or leave. And people just constantly stare at me as the pass through and it honestly irritates me!

There's a section to sign at the end of the contract as expected but then there's one more page for the 48 hour opt out option which I can also sign.

Firstly i'm pretty sure that part of the document is optional right? As in if I didn't want to work more than 48 hours I can simply not sign it and it won't affect the job offer. 

My question is about if I did sign it. Say I did sign it because I potentially may want to work on a Saturday (The job is Mon-Fri) on the rare occasion. If I do sign it, does the employer then have the right to force me to work 48 hours whenever they want? Or can I still refuse to do any more than what my initial contract entails? 

Thanks"

I was offered a job as a Cisco instructor for $44,000 at a local school that brings in underprivileged from throughout the US and other counties. 

I love development, I've been doing it in some form since I learned html back when I was 13 (Now 29).  I've been working as a developer for 3 years now (1 with official Software Developer title).

Development is my passion. It's it wrong for me to feel like accepting this position is a mistake despite the past increase? I'm currently working on my Bachelors in Computer Science which will be finished in about a year. Once I finish my degree, I plan on finding a new job that I can utilize the degree with. 

I guess I'm just not sure if the loss of a year of experience in my passion field is worth the $6,000 when I can go somewhere with a much higher salary after finishing my Bachelors degree. 

The new job is a government job, but not the kind that you would necessarily stay at and make a career. 

Any advice?"

I am a manager in a large corporate office who has been with the company for nearly 7 years. During this time, I’ve never really taken time off, and I work many more hours that is expected for the position. My reviews and performance reports have been top tier throughout my entire tenure, and my team is mostly autonomous. My wife and I had our first child back in early September. We struggled for years with infertility and have spent thousands of dollars and untold amounts of emotional currency to bring our daughter into the world. 

My wife is currently on leave with our child until after Thanksgiving. I have nearly 16 weeks of vacation time as, previously stated, I don’t really take time off. I was planning on taking off to take care of the baby from after thanksgiving until we put her into day care in early Feb. HR obviously has no problem with this as it’s covered by FMLA, but my boss was taken aback by the amount of time I’m taking off and wants to meet about it.

I know this is covered by FMLA, so his feelings on the matter are irrelevant, but is the amount of time I’m taking off excessive? I know it was traditionally believed that men don’t need to take as much time off to be with a newborn, but I love my daughter more than anything and know how important this time is. I will obviously not leave the team hanging, but how should I go into this meeting? I’m not planning on being at this company after next year, but I do not want to burn bridges. Any advice or validation for me wanting to take this amount of time off?"

It's becasue of this anxity he constantly either keeps doing work that I've already done, or jumps like a bunny at everything little issue instead of just letting me handel it. And it's because of this behavior, I sometimes find it hard when to just take the lead or not (by nature i'm someone who thinks ahead and does task without having being asked, ths behavior has changed that) - not only that, I feel like he dosen't listen to me when I enact any new way of doing something, but if our department boss says it its fine.

A few examples of this behavior

\- We have a new virtual interview system, we may need updated account. Legit in the same room I made an account, tested it, found the system was booting us back to login despite the login being corrext. Told him this, showed him this (he was in the same room). I come in the next day, and he's making accounts and legit doing WAHT I JUST DID, I told him this and that it wasn't working. He pretty much brushed me off and contrinued on only to tell me an hour later I was right (no shit)

\- I set up the lights for out production studio class, he basically comes back in immeditly after and redoes it.

\- In the past (like months ago) I created new color schemes for students to choose from for their production, becasue the colors were flat. Showed him, and that was that. NOW all of a sudden we have to redo he color! (which I ALREADY DID)

\- Using our new control system, I creted a shortcut to automatilly close and open the studio. He was against it, untill our department boss came in and started talkig about exactly waht I just eplained, and suddendly he liked the idea.

t's basiclly a bucnh of little isntances like this, and then in an effort to ""delegate"" he askes me to do whcih seems like minsulare securatial task ....and then will hover holder my should like I don't already know how. And honesty, this makes me not want to do a thing. 

Currently, we're preping for a live political polling show - something I have lot of experience setting up for. And already it seems like he's ingoring any of my effots to help and setup and do it all himself. Heck in out meeting, he used ""I"" and ""me"" and basicllly the only thing he ""delegated"" to me was the social media steam....

&amp;#x200B;

Honesty thinking of applying to a job opening in another department...  any suggestions how I can navigate this behavior better?"

Hello, 

Hope your Wednesday is going well! I am a recent health studies graduate who is interested in pursuing further education. I am interested (without doing too much reflection) in mental health, health and social justice (women's rights, children's rights, etc). With just a BSc (minor in sociology), what job recommendations do you have for me currently to be able to gain some knowledge and experience? For instance, mental health program support. I know that I need to have qualifications, such as social worker, psychotherapist, etc. to be able to do the work I want to do. What kind of work/what organizations do you recommend currently? What steps should I be taking? Currently, recovering from depression, as a formerly very ambitious student, I have been working as a screener and it is very unfulfiling and is effecting my mental health. I am based around Toronto, Canada.

Thanks 
Have a good rest of your week 
Feel free to PM"

* There are perks. The job itself sounds great, a slower pace than my current job which I need desperately, a lateral salary move and the policy is because the company is based on tourism and in-person foot traffic. It's a two mile drive from my home, so it's a very easy commute and in a great part of the city. It would also be nice to be in-person somewhat to make sure I don't turn feral and socialize.
* The cons would be having to go in ***every*** day. There's no ongoing hybrid flexibility at all, just here and there if you have to stay home for a repairman or if you're sick. I'm also concerned about going from working in my pajamas right now to having to wear more professional attire (closed toed shoes, no tank tops, they may not allow jeans unless it's casual friday, idk) which is a step above what I wore for my current job when I was in-office (jeans, sandals, plain top).

SOS - looking for thoughts on how to decide what to do. Anyone who's done a similar 180-degree switch and totally regret it? Anyone think we're going to go back to 100% in-person anyway at some point, so I should just bite the bullet now?"

Overall I’m managing my emotions a lot better but I still feel drained by the end of the day which sucks because I want to focus on getting a job/certificate in cybersecurity. I’m still on the fence about leaving due to money goals and vacations and what not, so I made this post in hopes that the replies will help me sort some things out. 

Some pros are that I have about 11k in savings rn and live with my parents so I should be fine financially for a while. The smart think to do would be to plan for the next step while also working, but at the same time I might be able to reach my goals faster by leaving now while also getting a needed a break.

0,2022-10-26,Working outside usual hours,u/kelleirb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yea6ah/working_outside_usual_hours/,jobs,"Hi all.

I am a remote, salaried employee and usually work from 9 am to 5 pm. We have an on site work event that an employee above me (not my manager) is asking me to arrive by 8 am each day and stay until 5-5:30 pm. This event is 3 days long and the commute is about 45 minutes to an hour from my home.

Is it wrong to say that I am a 9-5 employee and that if I need to be there at 8 I am leaving by 4? Also wanted to add in that there is not much need for me be there the full day. I’ve been at these events in the past with no set arrival time and did my own work on my laptop, not anything that needed me to be there on site.

However, I have no problem being there as long as it’s still the same amount of hours I usually work in a day. I would ask my manager but I’m worried they will agree with this other employee anyway since my manager is not directly involved in these events and I’d rather discuss it with the employee who is asking me to attend first. 

I appreciate any advice/responses. Thank you."

I have been a SAHM for 3.5 years. I recently got my AA in accounting. Daycare options are absolutely non existent in our area and we have no family or friends available to watch our kids. Hiring a stranger makes us uncomfortable and is out of our budget anyway.


My husband works at the post office. His work hours are dependent on the mail level. He could be home at 11 am or he could be home at 6 pm. We never know when it will be until the day of. He typically works every day except Sunday. This makes working opposite shifts difficult. Also, our infant is very very dependent on me starting about 6 pm. She goes to sleep around 8-9, so I considered something that starts at 10 pm or so, but I need time to sleep and can't drive at night due to medical reasons. 

My mom would be willing to help with our infant only on days my other kids are in school, but finding something that is flexible has been impossible, and she is stretched thin watching 3 of my nieces/nephews already.

Found out during the orientation my position qualifies for a signing bonus i can't turn down. Signing bonus is given after 90 days and if an applicant doesn't complete a year commitment they have to pay back the signing bonus. This feels like a red flag 

They didn't put in writing I'd be certified after a certain period of time. They've just said verbally after 6 months the Company would put me through certification programs. I originally applied for a position that the company does pay training for. I couldn't provide a Valid DL for the state i live in so they offered me a position that didn't require a DL under the pretense once i could provide it they'd offer me the other position in which i was given a 6 month timespan. 

The position I'm starting has a commitment of one year or a signing bonus reimbursement. The position I originally applied for has a two year commitment or a signing bonus reimbursement. Neither position has the option to turn down the signing bonus as I've come to find out."

I took the position with a pay cut thinking just to challenge myself and didn’t comprehend the scope of work I was to do. 

Fast forward and I struggled the first 4 months but then improved tremendously so much the company wants to keep him. And have extended my contract another year. However, the contract was extended with the third party company. They didn’t say much until recently when I reached them and asked what was going on and they sheepishly mentioned they will be sending my an addendum to sign. They’ve literally  not been communicating with me through out my assignment and when I needed their support they weren’t there - haven’t had any time off in a year. I made a request and was told no paid time off. In addition, I feel the are trying to have me sign the-same pay amount as last year with no salary increase.

So earlier this month I handed out applications to various places in person, and yesterday I got a call from one of those places wanting me to come in tomorrow for an interview.

For context; The last year (third year) I had at school I was placed at a company to work there for 1 year to get the necessary training to get a certificate of apprenticeship. I did that and passed the test (the employer where I'm going for am interview wanted someone with a certificate of apprenticeship, so I'm good).

So I have the necessary training and do have that certificate alongside with 1 year of work in a very similar business.

Is there some ""do's and don'ts"" to job interviews?
What questions should I be ready for?

I am extremely awkward with new people, though I've met this employer once when I handed out applications. We had a little chat then and he showed me briefly around where I'd work (if I got the job of course) and what I'd be doing."

I finally landed a great job - work from home, pulling somewhat from my established skillset, good salary. It’s my second week and I’m thankful every day.

I’ve been in intensive training as this is a high-touch position that requires critical thinking and doesn’t really have any down-time. I’m learning our system(s) and today I job shadowed with a senior employee for a few hours.

I broke down after work because I already feel like I’m not getting it. Without getting into detail, I’ve been through some significant trauma, which was the reason for my pre-pandemic inability to work, and as I couldn’t work through the pandemic I just sat and stewed. For the better part of two years I stopped taking care of myself. I barely ate and had constant panic attacks. I stayed in bed for days at a time and cried every night. I spaced out constantly to escape the state I was in. I literally feel like my brain doesn’t work like it used to. I’ve read that this can be a trauma response and I’m scared it will never go away. I feel fucking dumb. I was watching the senior employee complete her tasks and she was so quick and the wording was so perfect. I had a few sample tasks to do after work today and it took me 15 minutes to complete each one. The senior employee took 2 minutes max. I know that I won’t be starting at a senior level and that they’ll gradually introduce me, but I’ve gone from being terrified that I’ll never find a job to being terrified that I won’t succeed in the one that I have.

My trainer is so kind and is assuring us that we’ll get used to the work through exposure after training. The idea that I might not and that I might feel inferior and stupid forever is tearing me up. I’m also terrified by the idea of being so bad at this job that they don’t want me anymore and having to go through an employment search again. I straight up don’t think I could handle that.

Just wanted to vent.



EDIT: I should probably add that I had the same job fresh out of college for ten years pre-pandemic. This is my first job outside of that one. This is only the second ‘real’ job I’ve ever had outside of part-time highschool gigs, which is terrifying by itself because I haven’t been thrown into a new profession in a decade."

Kind of tricky situation.,u/geegol,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yeiorl/how_long_would_you_wait_to_apply_for_a_job_again/,jobs,"So me and my friend both work in IT. I was working an internship while he was working a help desk job at a different company. While I was working the internship I was debating on jumping ship but I decided to stay because I saw a post saying “be careful about jumping ship”. But in the details what he did was he recommended me and they sent an email to me I never responded. They sent another one that I did not respond to. About 2 months down the road after this had happened my manager fired me for being late (even though I was showing up to work doing nothing. But yes I should have been there on time lesson learned in a previous post) so I applied for that job my friend was working at. 

My friend told me his boss came up to him and said “your buddy applied I have his application up should I give him another chance?” My friend said “it’s up to you” to the manager. 

Manager never ended up contacting me back. I’m currently working a different IT job. But I asked him today if I did apply would they give me another chance and he said probably not. 

So what I was thinking was stay at my current job and work there for at least 6 months then reapply to the company my friend is working at. Any advice would be helpful. 

The company I got fired from the internship I would go back to but they require 2 years of experience to get a permanent position and I’m coming up to around a year of experience."
2,2022-10-27,Fast Food Vs Retail?,u/Finesta_01,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yeip6n/fast_food_vs_retail/,jobs,"I hear and read that these 2 industries are very similar but overall most people seem to agree that retail is just better than fast food in different ways.

All my job experience is Fast foods and my recent job which is a Dunkin where you get no hours and barely any pay, no benefits besides free nasty food. 

I want to switch to a different industry but I don't know which.

Retail? 

Warehouse worker?

My ideal job would be IT related as I have years and decades of personal experience with my own and my families computers and softwares. But I don't feel that optimistic about my ods of landing a job like that with no certificate or bachelor's.

I recently moved out of my parents home to live by myself in a completely different country, and I feel lost, lost in what to work and do for a living. I absolutely hate fast food and restaurants services and will never return to them. 

I have rent and other responsibilities to pay by myself all of a sudden when I didn't do before, so this is a big change for me, and fast food definitely doesn't pay me enough for this.

I'm sorry if it got too personal, I've been going through a mental crisis on everything that has been happening and just wanted to share my struggles.

Anyways. Back to the questions, which industry seems best for a more lax workplace , I enjoy doing duties and cleaning and other responsibilities in fast foods but I despise making orders. So that's why I thought retail would be better. But idk since I've heard such mixed opinions. Generally better than fast foods though.

Any ideas on jobs and industries I would really appreciate it so much!"

3,2022-10-27,Haven't heard back after 5 interviews,u/fakegranny,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yeosh6/havent_heard_back_after_5_interviews/,jobs,"Hi everyone. I was hoping someone here could help me understand the situation a little better and perhaps advise on what to do next.

A month ago, I came across a job advert that a recruiting agency had just posted for a position in my sector. The sector is very young and small, meaning recruiting people experienced within it isn't easy. My experience and background matched the listing well, so I applied.

The next day I got a call from the recruiter and spent 30 minutes on the phone answering his questions about my CV, my current role and my plans. It was a screening interview. The recruiter seemed very positive on the phone and was very happy to hear about my extensive experience in the sector. He passed on my CV to the Hiring Manager, who got back to the recruiter within an hour, wanting to book a call with me.

Within three working days of my application, I had a one-hour-long video call with the Hiring Manager. He was also very positive about my application. He also gave very positive feedback to the recruiter. 

After one week, I had another 30-minute video call with the Hiring Manager, as he wanted to ask more questions. During this call, he said that I ""feel like a very good fit"" and that he wanted me to meet more of his team members. 

I then met with a C-level executive for a 45-minute video call. He didn't have any specific questions for me, but we still had a natural and pleasant discussion. According to the recruiter, this call also resulted in very good feedback about my candidacy.

Within two working days, I met with the company's CEO and had a 1-hour and 15-minute video call. She was quite intense and forensic and asked a lot of difficult sector-specific questions. It was clear that her interview technique was purposefully stress-inducing to check that I could handle high-pressure situations. I think I did well on that call and gave good answers. She also responded to my ""Thank you for your time"" email, saying that she would give good feedback to the Hiring Manager, but ultimately it is his decision. I didn't really expect a reply, it was just a courtesy email!

After that interview, I had a long call with the recruiter where we discussed my call with the CEO, my salary expectations (I know they match the company's budget) and my feelings about the position. He also requested an extensive list of references, which I provided. The recruiter and the CEO said that ""the turnaround should be quick.""

It has now been two weeks since my last interview, and I still haven't heard anything from the company or the recruiter. I called the recruiter and left a short voicemail asking whether I could get a rough timeline for the next steps. However, I have still not heard back from him, and he sent my second call straight to voicemail today. Also, to my knowledge, they have not contacted any of my references yet.

It all feels quite awkward, and I'm not really sure what to do next. I would love for them to just tell me where I stand, especially considering how much effort I put into the process and how many calls I had about this. I wonder if anyone has an insight into what might be going on. Should I email the Hiring Manager directly asking for an update? Why would the recruiter just ignore me when he was very quick and responsive in the past?

Sorry for such a long post!

TL;DR had 5 interviews (including screening with an agency recruiter), all resulted in positive feedback, but I still haven't heard back 2 weeks later and the recruiter might be ghosting me."

I was placed on PIP and they restarted my training (which is just them giving me a roadmap of things to do honestly). I now meet the whole team once a week so they can go over that plan, and they even send me their notes afterwards - as if I didn't write any. I feel pretty humiliated. I swear I am trying, and every email reply is crushing.

I really liked the HR person who recruited me, they seemed very up-to-speed on current work issues and super responsive. They also checked up on m 2 weeks in to see how the onboarding was. I sorta want to tell her my feedback (if she hasn't heard already), but I worry it would come back to bite me in the ass since I am doing so poorly.

Edit: Thank you for your time everyone. No HR will be notified, and as it's been written, I think I need a friend right now. The ADHD hypothesis is interesting, and has come up before, something to look into although it's completely terrifying. All in all I think me being fired would work best for all, and this has been an interesting experience in management if anything. I'll try my best until that day comes! 

Some of you have suggested I was a nepotism hire, which is not true - I interview very well, and interview for jobs below my on-paper qualifications. A lot of you also have mentioned my supposedly bad English: this is mean-spirited and false; my degrees were done in English, and I am fluent although mistakes pop up here and there. I have always worked in my native language which is French. Finally, few of you have had kind words, and I wanted to let you know that I read you and appreciate you for remembering I am a person having a tough time. Take care everyone!"

I have a good one and I mostly like the people I work with/for, but I don't want to do this work for the next 20-30+ years.  The problem is, I don't know what else I'd do.  I'm a federal employee and an admin.  I apply to a ton of jobs, mostly admin, and get some referrals, a couple of interviews, but no offers.  Other people my age I know are successful attorneys, doctors, CEOs, VPs, etc... and I feel like I'm just useless. 

I never wanted to be anything specific growing up.  In high school/college I wanted to join the Foreign Service and then thought about that and decided it was not for me and then became kind of lost.  I've tried applying to intelligence positions because I think that would be very interesting, but I don't have the background, or desire, to do something like accounting, engineering, computer stuff, etc... I don't really want to go back to school -  I have a few degrees already, just in the wrong things - unless I wanted to be a teacher, which I don't.   I don't know what to do at this point in my life.

Has anyone had any success with a career counselor or anything like that?  I feel like I've kind of failed at a career/adulting because I don't know what I want to do/be."

We also have an employer-paid pension and the new company does not. 4% 401K matching, though, which is pretty common for companies. 

The insurance for the new company, though, is lacking. I currently don’t have a deductible and pay less than $150 for any specialty, ER visit, PCP visit, etc… the new company’s insurance policy is a 750 deductible and 15% copay of all costs that are not preventative care and that’s with a $130 cost per check. 

Any advice that I could negotiate into my benefits package to help offset this cost? Health insurance is not something I actively need at the moment but there is a recurring condition I have that can arise out of nowhere. I just want to have reliable insurance for piece of mind."

In the last year, I’ve switched from being in Healthcare for 8 years to IT, Helpdesk Specialist, specifically. 

I’ve been with my current company for 8 months, small IT HQ for a bigger company, we have about 6 of us in office. 

I have picked up the job very quick and am extremely efficient. After a team member was promoted to Networking, I have taken over their responsibilities as well. 

Recently we hired a new team member. I did NOT know I would be the one training her. This was no problem as I was thrilled they put trust in me to teach and train the new hire. 

I also have talked to the department head about expensing the Comptia A+ certification which was approved! So it’s very clear I am dedicated and want to do and be the best I can in my current and future roles in IT.

I was also approved for 11 hours of OT every month to bring in some extra month for myself. 

However, with all this newfound responsibility and only being with the company for 8 months, should I be asking for a raise?

Me and my manager are on pretty friendly terms, she lets me know I am greatly appreciated for all the extra work I do, the OT I put in, etc. 

I have never had to formally ask for a raise before, for when I was in healthcare and moved “up” that came with a pay increase. 

What do you think? I currently make 24/hr. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)"

Mind you, I obsessively check my emails and messages from the job listing sites, so I didn’t have any other messages. Finally, after calling me at 730pm yesterday that I let go to voicemail, I got a message on Indeed from someone in response to one of my applications and wanted to have a phone call with me.

It’s been 6-7years since I’ve been back on the looking for a job train, and I’m not even that old of a person, but I’m completely horrified by the lengths in which companies today make people go through just to get a second or third interview then to make them take tests (written or personality) before finally (maybe) giving an offer?

When I graduated college in 2012, I was usually hired after 1-2 interviews. Now I’m being asked to write essays, go through multiple rounds of interviews, have my references be throughly questioned, take skills or personality tests, and I’m at the point where I’m almost fed up but I don’t have a choice because if I don’t find a job in the next few months I will have to leave my home and figure out some place to live.

The owner of my company I currently work for just came to me today and said that without me here he thinks he’s just going to close the shop. Main reason being is that he hasn’t ever had a manager here since he’s retired that he could trust as they all have stolen 10’s of thousands of dollars every year until I came along. He did tell me that he considered selling last year but couldn’t do it because he was thinking about me and the techs not having a job. I run an automotive repair shop which even being a little slow right now still does decently. We’ll long story short he offered to sell it to me for next to nothing and I just cover lease payments on the property (which he owns). All of the equipment ect stays which most is new or recently repaired. The shops been around over 50 years and is very well known in the area it’s in. I just don’t know what to do. Do I take the chance and buy it from him with it being established already or just walk away to GM a shop that’s fairly new but in a part of town that isn’t as great?  I just don’t want to miss an opportunity to have something that is mine but I also am a big what if person and sometimes worry too much about things.

I recently joined a company and I am working from home. The coworker who was supposed to train me is constantly asking me to work faster and take up more and more work. She is trying to dump her workload on me too. Also, she’s been constantly micromanaging me and calling me every few minutes telling me to speed up, and take more responsibility. I am by no means a lazy worker but she has completely unrealistic expectations. I was able to handle it till now, but this week she started shouting at me on call telling me do the work faster, when I had already been working at the fastest speed possible. I had a breakdown and was having panic attacks, hardly making it through the day. By the end of the day I have had enough and told the manager about it. He said he would look into the situation, but I fear since she has been at the company for a long time, and handles a lot of work, there is hardly going to be any action against her, besides she might try to turn the whole situation against me, because she is a manipulative person. Another thing I have noticed is that is she is always nice on email or chat but on call she goes complete psycho and starts threatening me to take up more work. She is trying to keep it off the books and make me take an unreasonable amount of workload. My mental health has been severely affected due to all this. Due to the layoffs going on, getting a job is pretty hard, I need the money and I’m trying my best to make it work somehow. Please advise me what I should do next."

On the other hand, I got an email from a hiring manager from another company I had interviewed previously telling me that he wants to hire me once a new position gets approved next month. This job would be closer to $45/hour, fully remote, and not contract. 

The question I have is: 

Should I let the hiring manager know I have accepted the contract offer ($27/hour) with the other company but that I am willing and ready to apply with him and work with him ($45/hour)? 

I do have him on LinkedIn and he would most likely see any posts made if I do post about my contract role I have accepted. 

Please help me with any advice. Thanks!!"

I started seriously searching again in August. I apply to countless positions daily, I’ve had interviews, I’ve had my resume reviewed, I’ve gone to recruiters, used apps for contract positions, applied to companies who have hired connections/previous coworkers with similar experience as me and still nothing. The unemployment has run out and my resume clearly shows a gap that’s only getting bigger without a current title. My now husband has been supporting us and financially we are fine, however I still have my own bills, student loans, personal purchases, etc. that I refuse to let him pay for. 

I don’t know if I should get a part time job for the meantime, try another recruiter or what? But I’m just feeling hopeless and restless, I love working and have always been fairly successful in my previous roles. I’ve tried keeping my standards, but I’m beginning to feel like they’re too high? I’ve had some pretty bad experiences at some companies and have been underpaid before, so I’m trying to avoid that happening again. I just don’t know what more to do and looking for some sort of advice."

I even have a brief stint of warehouse experience under my belt (the only job I could find at the start of the pandemic). I think my resume is pretty impressive as I always manage to hold a leadership/mentor position within months of being employed which shows that I learn quickly.

I am finally making an agreeable wage above 20 dollars an hour and am not willing to take a 5-6 dollar pay cut just because I want to move away from my current job.

My manager has been impressed with my work and I have been meeting or exceeding completion of the tasks assigned to me.

I have been working as a pediatric Occupational therapist for 5 years (I have BS in exercise sci and MS in OT). but no longer find it fulfilling. I do not want to do direct service anymore with any population. Not interested in insurance, and I can’t see being a manager or teacher. I know assistive tech is a field but I’m honestly horrible with tech and advanced math (failed calculus, and it took me an embarrassing amount of time to design 1 3d printer thing on tinkercad and making switch accessible toys was not that enjoyable).  But I’ll keep looking in it just bc I don’t want to waste my degree. 

My goal in college was to be in a helping field that made enough money for me to live by myself. Now I find I don’t want to help people face to face at all. And this has nothing to do with burnout/compassion fatigue. I got a great boss and work life balance. I just fantasize of being fired and not helping people. And when I ask myself ‘what is my “why” I go blank. I also fear becoming a Dunder-Mifflin kind of office worker doing something meaningless. Trades seem interesting bc of fixing things not people, but I’ve no math skills and slightly intimidated by them in general as a woman. And am concerned about repeat use injuries. I don’t have passions (other than non revenue hobbies like crochet and reading, I’m not a creative) 
For anyone who has left OT, what field did you get in that paid similarly (40-50k) and wasn’t a direct service/helping job?

Just had a fourth round interview where the senior manager literally: 

- was 15 min late for a 30 min interview, didn’t even apologize/explain why. he also left 3 min early. 
- asked me to introduce myself, only to interrupt me every single sentence with irrelevant technical questions
- didn’t even read my resume, as he mistook my work experience for someone else’s (i had to correct him) 
- had a super heavy accent, i had trouble understanding him
- gaslighted and straight up accused me of applying to the job “as a passport to the us” (for context, i’m a us citizen living abroad looking to relocate back in us, and i made this very clear.)

upon hearing this question, i teared up and immediately wanted to fake an internet disconnection and leave the interview. i felt very offended. but out of human courtesy i decided to stay til the end. 

he then said he wants to add *more rounds* to existing 5 rounds of interviews so he can test my “technical skills” in microsoft suite. 

jesus fucking christ, what the actual fuck? i’m beyond disgusted and i feel utterly disrespected. this interview destroyed my intention of wanting to work there. 

big yikes, walking red flags…, feel free to share thoughts/relevant experiences.

*update: the following day, i received an email from the recruiter who asked me to complete a six part “excel aptitude test”. wow. fuck. this. shit.. srsly thinking abt withdrawing from the interview process at this point."

The interview was so great and I made great connections with both interviewers. Unfortunately, I didn’t get it but when they called they were very kind and said it was an extremely close call between me and the one who got it. They also mentioned some other sections that I should keep an eye out for where I would excel. 

A couple weeks ago, the same interviewer from before reached out via email to let me know that another position with the team was coming up and if I’m interested, to feel free to apply. I thanked him and said I would. 

Well today the position was just announced and I plan on applying when I get back to work on Saturday. I’m just wondering, nothing has really changed in terms of experience for myself so how much should I change in my cover letter/CV if at all? Should I also reach out to the interviewer after I apply thanking him again for letting me know about it and that I had applied?

I am somewhat concerned about a potential discrepancy in an upcoming verification of employment history.

From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a research assistant at a lab on campus. In middle to late September 2021, I took a leave of absence from the lab because of medical issues, and I was promised that I would be able to return. Around November, I talked to my former manager about coming, and she let me know that she took on too many more RAs, and couldn’t accommodate me at the lab. This is when I considered my employment ended, and that is what I mark on my resume.

I am worried that this manager might tell the company that I only worked until September, since that is the last time I had worked on a project for the lab, and she might have forgotten about promising me a spot to return to. Just for the record, there was no “official” employment, so there would be no records of this information anywhere.

So if you delve into post history, that's most of what you'll find.*  


*Somehow... this seems appropriate. Not really taking a break in the same sense now.*   
*I'm gainfully employed, working in tech (help desk), remotely from my house. But...*

  
I'm in a weird place. I feel scattered and want a million different things, but feel stuck also. I'm living with my girlfriend in a pretty nice place, feel the need to search for jobs and try to pick a direction, but I've done too many jobs that ended with no growth. 

Sound familiar? Yeah... it gets us at all ages, genders, stages in our lives apparently.

  
I definitely feel like I don't have a clear sense of where I want to go. Not even where I want to live (currently live in NE Florida, but kind of just landed here... back in the south after escaping it to spend a decade in Denver - where I got a degree in Computer Science.) I don't want to stay where I am, physically or professionally. But I'm having trouble finding direction.

I've held jobs in a wide range throughout the... decades, since my first foray at college.  
I'm smart, capable, and have plenty of talents. At this point, I kind of feel like a generalist though. A ""jack of all trades"" when I see those around me succeeding by specializing.   


I just don't want to pigeonhole myself. If I stick with tech sector, I'm currently thinking certifications in ITIL methodologies might lead me in the direction that interests me. But then I get bored after a while.  
My current jobs, as with my last job is for an MSP (Managed Services Provider) in the tech realm. I felt the need to move on from the last after a year, and now it's been just over a year and I feel the same need.   


I just don't want to keep making lateral moves. I want growth, but lack direction. Open to discuss further, or take any input as provided.

The interviewer didn’t ask why I was leaving my current position they just asked for notice period I needed. 

Should I just own up to the fact that I was laid off a few weeks ago and was nervous on the phone call? Or should I say I just heard about the layoffs? I’m worried they could look up dates and figure out that I was actually let go a few weeks ago. What would you do?"
2,2022-10-27,Can I ask for more pay after agreeing to work full hours?,u/takethisawayfromme,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yf5kv4/can_i_ask_for_more_pay_after_agreeing_to_work/,jobs,"I hope this is the right place and tag to ask and use. TL;DR is below.

About 3 months ago, I applied to a local small business for a full time pharm tech position (with good hourly pay). During the interview, they told me they were looking for someone more permanent after I told them I was thinking about going to pharm school and wanted to get some experience and see if that's the path I want to go down (I thought that would sound good in the interview- whoops). They liked my work experience though and still wanted me to work there, so they offered a part time position (30-35 hours) to get that experience and see if I liked it (with less pay). I agreed. Last week, during an evaluation, my manager asked if I felt like I could stay for a while and I said yes (it is fun and the people are cool). Today, my manager asked if I wanted to work more hours (40 hours) starting next week and I said yes. She asked this sort of in the open, so I didn't feel comfortable bringing up pay at that moment. 

Now I'm wondering if I should, or even could, ask for more pay now that I'm basically a full time employee now, right? She didn't explicitly say full time; just working more hours. They fired the person they hired to work the full time position I applied for a month ago and haven't found anyone since then. Can I ask for more pay after agreeing to work full time hours (or even ask for the pay they offered in the job position)? Does the pay automatically increase once you start working full time (or does that depend on the job)? Sorry if this post is all over the place. I've never dealt with this type of situation (and have never worked full time before), so I don't know the next steps (if there are any).

TL;DR:  I am starting to work full time hours next week after being hired as a part timer; can I ask for more pay?"

I've been offered a full time position and not sure if I should take it.

The salary is or will be $1150 a week. I'm aware of all the full time benefits like sick and annual leave.

As a casual I'm taking home $1400 for 38hours and $1800 for a weekend shift.

The issue I'm having that's putting me off is the hoops I need to jump through to increase my pay as a full time.

The job description states as a new entrant I'll be on 85% of salary.
After 3 months going to 88% then 92.4% after 12 months.

It's unrewarding when you do consistent good work, and incredibly shit when dealing with customers who are assholes.   
Honestly ranting a bit here without much pre-thought but for the last few months I've been trying to figure out what kind of work someone can do who don't want to deal with a lot of people directly?   
I'm anxious, anti-social, and straight up just a grump since getting a bit older. I'm okay to work in a team of people of course but as long as the work is pretty autonomous.

The role is in supply chain and the initial offer is for $95k a year. 

This is what I'm looking to change:

* **Location** \- currently they have me tied to an office, however the hiring manager mentioned he didn't really care where I worked from. So, I want them to put me in as a permanent remote worker. 
* **Start Date** \- currently they have the start date at the end of November. I've got a vacation in early December that has already been booked. Looking to change the start date until after I get back. 
* **Vacation Time** \- need to know how many pro-rated days of vacation I'd have this year. 
* **Adjusted Date of Hire** \- will previous time at the company be considered for other benefits (401k match, etc). 
* **Salary** \- I want to see if they'd raise it to $100k due to previous experience/master's degree I recently earned

For me, this is listed in order of importance...while I really am hoping for all of these things, being able to officially work remotely is the one point that could be a dealbreaker. 

When reaching out to the recruiter to negotiate, do you think I could send all these points or is this too much? Would asking for a small salary adjustment overshadow the remote work piece? 

This is the first time I've really negotiated a job offer and am hoping this community can point me in the right direction! Thanks!"

Is this normal?,u/christinangelika,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yfe5pv/signed_job_offer_and_havent_heard_anything_since/,jobs,"I accepted a job offer Monday, October 17. The original offer was made the previous Friday, and on the following Monday I negotiated salary with my hiring manager/new boss and got a new offer letter. After signing, I emailed the my new boss to let her know I had signed and was looking forward to joining her team. After signing, I received an automated response from their system saying welcome to the team, keep an eye out for a background check request and onboarding information.

I haven’t heard anything since then. My last direct communication with my new boss was the phone call where she offered my new salary. I was starting to get a little worried at the beginning of this week, so I emailed again on Tuesday to check in about the background check request and let her know I hadn’t received it. No response to that email either.

I’m starting to get worried. I put in my two weeks at my current job the Tuesday after I signed, assuming that everything was okay, and now my boss has found my replacement and my last day is this coming week. Is this normal, or do I have reason to be worried? And what should I do?

Edit: I got in contact with my manager and she was traveling and hadn’t had a chance to reach out. Everything is all good and I’ll be receiving my onboarding soon.

Thank you all for your advice! I’m glad I called and got peace of mind."

They are offering me 100% covered premiums on medical, dental, and vision at $20/hr, with employer 7% 401k. I just got an offer for another job that is offering me more pay at $23/hr but worse benefits with a premium of $119 per paycheck (bi-weekly) and 4% employer 401k. 

I did some math and calculated that my current job is overall lower in compensation than the one I got the offer for. 

Thing is the job I’m at has good security and the research I did on the new offer is they had layoffs during Covid, which is concerning to me. Also the dilemma comes with that the new job is in the field I want to pursue, but it is known to have grueling hours, while the job I have now has set hours. They sent me an offer letter that expires on Halloween. 

AND it gets more complex. I just had a recruiter reach out to me for ANOTHER job that is honestly a dream job. The pay for this isn’t provided but appears it may be similar to the job I got the offer for. 

I’m stuck in a triangle. Stay at current job with good security and benefits. Go to new job with better pay in desired field but layoff history, and worse benefits. Or stay at current job and chance opportunity to land dream job. 

Advice would be appreciated."
1,2022-10-28,What should I do? Changing jobs within a large organisation.,u/KittyKatWombat,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yfgso1/what_should_i_do_changing_jobs_within_a_large/,jobs,"First post here so please excuse any errors or missing info. 

I work in a large organisation ( a university), and it's the only workplace I've ever known (besides from a short gig working in retail just around the time I graduate high schools. The organisation has over 4,500 staff members, spread across multiple locations in one city. There are levels in work, which corresponds with responsibilities and pay. 

I'm currently on my second full-time permanent role at the organisation, having worked in this role for just over three years. I'm a Level 5 worker, and work as a secretary for a university executive. It's time for a slight change for me, for a variety of reasons: I've had 4 bosses in the past three years, the latest one is really stressing me out, my team has had immense pressure, and three mid-high level staff members have left the team and organisation within a 2 month span, and the role/tasks have changed to something I don't quite enjoy (each boss had a different vibe). 

I started looking for roles that's available, and only internal staff members can apply (if they don't find anyone, they have to advertise externally). There's a few positions I'm interested in:

Position 1: Same level as I, so no change in salary. Role is events support, not the secretarial role I've done previously (though many tasks overlap). I previously worked in this team 4.5 years ago as a casual (when I was still starting out in the workforce) - love the team, though it's undergone some staffing changes and restructure. A good friend I worked with then is still in the team, but different role to mine. This team is younger in age (colleagues are more my age) compared to previous/current departments I've worked for.

The catch is this role is a secondment until March 2023 (a fixed term contract), which means this is an opportunity for me to ""change scenery"", before deciding in March to return to my current role, or to find a different ongoing role. 

Option 2: A promotion, one level higher than what I work as currently. The role is secretarial support for a higher executive than whom I'm working for now. I've met briefly with this executive before I found out about the job opening, and this person seems like someone I can work with well (an important factor for me as secretary). But, it's in HR, and I know very little about this team (I did work here as a casual, but only for two weeks, and only data entry), and it's undergone some dramatic changes in the past 18 months. 

Both roles have it's benefits and drawbacks. Option one is a place I'm relatively familiar with, and have connections there. It doesn't seem to be as stressful compared to what I've had to deal with in recent months. There's also a good team connection, as being a secretary is often a siloed role. Option two means I get to advance my career (I can see career progression here as I can climb to be the top secretary in the organisation, but not in option 1), and I get a higher salary. 

I interviewed for Job/Option 1 today, and I'm confident I will get it. They will announce it around Friday 4th November. Job/Option 2 is still recruiting, and submission deadlines isn't until 6th November, which means interviews is after, and then I have to wait for results (I assume this will be around 25th November based on recruitment practices of the organisation). If both had been open/interviewed at the same time, and I got both, I would choose Option 2. But, as Option 2 is like a promotion, there's a higher chance I will not get the role, and I don't want to lose Option 1 whilst waiting for Option 2. 

What should I do? Wait around for Option 2 (or similar roles in the future, whilst staying in my current position), reject option 1 outright (if I get it) OR take option 1 outright if it gets offered, and then figure out what's available in March 2023? Either way, I do want to get out of my current role as soon as possible. 

TDLR: I want to change jobs within one organisation, applied for a number of jobs, some is a promotion, some is the same level/salary. They have different interview dates, how do I go about choosing what's best for me."

I went to dental assisting school and this office took me on as an intern, then hired me once I graduated. Ive been here for about 10 months now and I've been the perfect employee. I say yes everytime they as me to pick up time, I'm respectful, I go above and beyond with my work. For awhile now they've been sending me every once in awhile to a certain location with a certain doctor. This doctor treats me like crap and all the other employees see it happening and agree she treats me different. I've been putting up with it up until lately where my mental health has started to rapidly decline due to how much work the company is putting on me as well as sending me to work with this doctor that disrespects me. I was so stressed out last time I worked with her that I got an asthma attack at work. After a particularly hectic and horrible day at this office with this doctor, I told my manager that if I get sent to this office again there's a possibility I'll quit. She told the higher ups about what I said and they are not happy. Am I in the wrong for threatening to quit?

Heres a little more background, it takes over a year to fully train a dental assistant because there is so much that goes into it. They recently relocated me without my permission and I graciously agreed to stay at this location eventhough it's an hour commute me. They've been giving me the duties of a head assistant because we are short staffed but I do not receive head assistant pay.

Recently we had a majority of our assistants quit and I'm one of the ones who stayed. Because they were so desperate for assistants they hired a bunch of people with no experience, no training, and no school background. They are scheduling me alone with these employees leaving me to do all the heavy lifting knowing that I am still not fully trained get."

My boss is the owner. I'm a regular employee as a designer with benefits, health, dental, pto, and all the other stuff. The past 7 years, this company had downsized every year. Employees get mad and quit and they don't get replaced. A few have gotten fired. This is a very small company, we have 10 employees now, including my boss (owner) and his wife is HR. So side subject, his wife being HR pretty much nothing can be said about anything. I haven't had a raise in a while, longer than I'd like to admit.

They want to take me off as a regular employee and make me a contractor. So they would pay me $1500 a month to answer a cell phone they provide about technical questions. And every new design they would pay me per design.

My question is, is this legal? If I don't accept it, they are going to fire me. They have been trying to push me out for over a year. They HATE to pay unemployment. I feel like what they're doing is to get rid of me without having to pay unemployment, because I haven't quit yet. I feel like the amount they want to pay for the contract is dismal. To answer the tech questions, you need a certain amount of experience. There is no one else here that can answer the questions I get, including the owner. Salesman, customer service, and the material buyer all come to me for answers.

We scheduled a call for the next day, had the call. She was transparent about pay, the contract length, the work and team and even said she had wiggle room to offer a rate at higher than my asking price. It went as  well as it could have and , she ended it saying she’d be in touch soon. 

She then called later that day and asked for two past references And then we said our goodbyes and she re confirmed that she would be in touch soon. But I totally forgot to get a ball park estimate for when “soon” might be (if ever lol) 

I know recruiters tend to just do this sort of stuff so they can meet their quota and they often ghost low hanging fruit but I have 6 years industry experience and was a direct match for the position. So my hopes are up a little lol

When is a good time to follow up? If I do follow up, what should I say? Or should I just leave it in her court, expect nothing and be pleasantly surprised if she does reach back out.

Not only that but I gave this individual my High School Diploma, in which they reluctantly stated....my diploma did not seem 'valid'...????

As of yesterday it’s been a week since my interview so I followed up with HR and haven’t gotten a response as of today. 

Just for the hell of it, I checked my application status in the portal even though it had never been updated (including past applications from a year or two ago). Suddenly today three applications have been moved to the “inactive” tab and all say “review complete”. Including the job I just went through the final round for.

I am assuming that I did not get the job, but I would love anyone else’s thoughts / insights as I know workday can vary from company to company and be quite fickle.

I’ve been applying to roles for a few months now and my experience has been eye opening personally. Here are some of the things that have been happening:

1. I get contacted unsolicited via LinkedIn by a recruiter for a role relevant to my experience. I get a phone interview set up, have a great conversation during that interview, then complete radio silence. I’ll send a follow up email to the recruiter asking for status update or feedback, still no response.

2. I had a phone interview for a role I definitely knew was above my past experience in responsibility and pay grade (I took the interview anyway because hey, you never know). Ended up having a great convo. Recruiter says “I’m going to pass you to the next stage of the process.” A few days later I get a denial email. Also, I did not apply to this role, I was contacted again via LinkedIn. Why waste our time?

3. I applied for a role about a month ago and finally get a link to schedule a phone interview, but the recruiter never calls at the scheduled time.

I just want to know is this type of stuff common now and should I expect this type of job market. I’ve hired for and built teams in the past and I have never wasted people’s time like this. I’m not upset as I’m “ok” with my current role. I just wanted to see if other folks are running into this as I haven’t looked for any new roles since the pandemic started. Just seems like a waste of time for all parties and I’m getting a little annoyed preparing for and blocking off time for these sham interviews. I appreciate all the input!"

Every job I had so far is sales. I like where I work, I don't particularly enjoy it but at least I don't hate it (I've had the feeling of hating my job before). All I'm trying to say is, I'm neutral about it, I don't go to work jumping up and down in excitement. Here's my question, I'm being offered a management position, in the same industry but a different company. The job itself sucks, the company sucks, the culture sucks. Everything about it sucks. I know I will hate every second of it. But the way I think about it is I'll just take the job for a year or two just so I have experience as a manager and then I can apply to become a manager somewhere else. Because I'm much more likely to be accepted as a manager if I have managerial experience as opposed to being a salesperson my entire working life. I would be earning more money in the position I'm being offered. But where I work, we get a raise in our hourly wage every X number of hours we work, up to a certain point. But even though raises are guaranteed, it still ultimately depends on how many hours we're given, and right now, I'm averaging about 25 hours, so not very optimistic about future earning potential. Regardless, I still don't hate the place, but I hate the place I'd be working at as a manager. The place I work at currently has very little chance for movement or promotions because there's a seniority system in place, and I'm relatively new to the company so my opportunities are practically zero unless I get a degree (which I am in the process of getting anyway, but I thought the seniority system is worth mentioning)

TLDR should I leave a job I don't hate for another job that sucks in every way just to get some managerial experience?"

H-E-B is paying 17.50 with part-time no more than 30 hours. I get to choose my days to work Sunday.

I want to note- the job seems supportive enough of employees and I am grateful to even hear back from them, but loss of my own autonomy in creativity and learning freaks me out.

I fear my work as a volunteer at a club of a similar industry, but at a much smaller scale, in my hometown will be denied. Moreover, I find it frustrating that I may not be able to upkeep an online creative portfolio I shared with friends as it may be seen as personal branding. The process further suggests that anything I discover thay may be profitable to the company should be reported to them. I want to continue learning on my own and pursuing my own projects without worrying about whether or not my company could rip it from me or demand I stop, especially when those projects might not be relevant to the company's proceedings.

How do I move forward on this? Has anyone else dealt with this? I've only really worked with smaller companies that didn't have approvals like this, so I don't even know what to expect."

My family too, has incredibly disconnected and unrealistic expectations of the kind of money I'll be making. I was also under the impression that it was a lucrative industry to work and my family is under the impression I'll be able to work anywhere I want because everyone will be practically begging to hire me and make really good pay. Like 60-70K a year starting out. How am I supposed to explain this to them? That putting me through college was basically a waste at this point if that's what their expectations are as soon as I'm finished here in a month or so? What should I even do in terms of looking for a job? There's just nothing. I don't understand why it's like this. Entry level ought to mean you get on the job training and the position is open to everyone, and you can't offer entry level pay for 4+ years of formal education and also require experience. It's ridiculous, but my family just insists it's because I'm not looking hard enough and that's not how it was in their day. They just don't understand the reality of the way the job market is now."

To note, I genuinely enjoy my job - it just doesn't pay enough, despite the awesome benefits. I know I'm in a space of privilege, but between my spouse wanting to move to a more expensive city to be closer to family, federal student loan payments coming back in January, and just life over all getting more expensive, I started looking for a new role back in early August.  At one point I had over 50 open applications for my company and in the last 48 hours, 20 of them have been closed due to a hiring freeze and I'm really starting to feel the pressure and stress around job hunting.

An eventual happy moment happened last week where an interview was scheduled after chatting with the hiring manager and it was going well, but now I'm waiting for the conversation to turn to, ""We aren't going to be filling this role until potentially 2023,"" which is what is happening across the company.

Everyone says apply externally for a higher pay bump, but for what I do, my company is an awesome fit - plus I can't express how awesome my benefits are lol I just wish I didn't feel like I was on a deadline for financial decisions, spouse obligations, and professional development goals. 

Anyways, cheers to those dealing with the same struggle, sending everyone the best of vibes and encouraging words.

I've done PC tooling to support board bring-up, some documentation stuff, and the past 6 months have been me doing mostly small bug fixes on the application layer and maybe a small handful of VERY small application layer features. Actually, I was suppose to get more feature implementation tasks (my lead literally gave me the jira tasks) but these were taken up by the 3rd party engineering consultants. And then a good chunk of my time is running tests that a very significant time to execute among other tasks that non-code related (tasks that no else wants to do). Its frustrating because I really want to work on the low-level layer (hardware registers) but I don't think anyone is giving me that opportunity anymore and probably no one trusts me to do it. My manager has not done a 1-on-1 with me in months, making me think that he doesn't care. I think I'm probably not respected and well-liked but I still have my job because the department is struggling to hire people.

It feels like the other engineers who are same level as me are getting bigger responsibilities and even the guy who joined only 1 year ago gets to work on huge firmware updates. I feel bitter and jealous honestly. So I decided to just focus on learning the parts of the firmware I'm interested in our codebase and afterwards, I'm leaving this company. Its clear that not even my boss is advocating for me. I'm the guy who helps other people but I see now thats hurt me.

To close, I know I've made mistakes in my time here that definitely impacted my opportunities but do you guys have any advice?

I applied to this one job about 3 months ago. The process was very long (4 interviews total, 5 if we count HR screening, and a lot of delay in between), but I have finally reach the last interview stage.

The previous interviews were technical, especially the last one where I had to present a case study. I just had a call with HR and apparently it went ""great, very great even"". We scheduled the interview, but with the heat of the moment, I didn't really ask about what it would be about.

HR told me it would be with the hiring manager N+1 (so my potential N+2), and that it was more of a ""touchpoint"" (not sure what it means, I am not an English native speaker, nor is HR) rather than a technical interview, and that the N+2 wanted to meet people before they join the team. The interview is scheduled to last 30 minutes.

Do you guys have any idea of what to expect, and how I should prepare ?"

2.5 months in and after a lot of feedback of how I'm not performing up to standard and not doing as much as I should be all the way to this week where my boss again, expressed that:
-I am still no where near where I should be 2.5 months in
-How she shouldn't have to baby me or do this much hand holding
-Someone who is at my level shouldn't be performing like this
-She can't give me more interesting work because I'm still stuck trying to do well at my current work
-I should reassess if I should even be in accounting in the first place

and at this point she is willing to give me a week to see if I have a ""lightbulb"" moment and can turn things around. if not, I give my two weeks in. but honestl, i just want to leave immediately at this point.

ive attempted to take all her feedback as constructive and ive tried to correct the places where I was falling short, scheduling checkins, taking more notes, being more thorough, taking my time, etc. but with each and every effort I make, there is just more feedback of all the other things I'm doing poorly. she has emphasized from the start that she wants questions, is willing to take out time to show me things again if I need it, being a guide for me, etc. as she knew I was starting from scratch and didn't have experience, but liked my personality.

But It's difficult to even want to ask her for help at this point because when I have tried asking, I would be told ""I should know this already because we did this together"" or ""I'll let you figure it out first"", or if she did answer she would emphasize how ""obvious"" this should have been to me that I shouldn't have had to ask her, or that she's just swamped with work (this is a small company of 10 people and she is the vp - I work directly under her as the only property accountant). 

there was even a moment where she was unhappy that I was not asking more questions, so I tried to rectify that by asking more questions, and was told that she found her self feeling disappointed in my questions because they were too ""basic"". 

i know I have been falling short and have been trying, but it's been more and more discouraging each time to keep hearing how poorly im doing, and is really messing with my mental health and confidence. 
im ready to throw the towel in - my recruiter is aware too, but of course she wants me to stay there as long as possible.
im just thinking that I was not ready for a position like this, and need a slower paced environment to really learn and take everything in. 

is it just a poor fit, or am I truly doing so poorly that I should really reconsider my path? what went wrong? was I just not ready for the responsibilities this job entailed? do I keep trying?"

However, its weakness is that this software makes it harder to transfer files into a VM, unlike the other software I used during college. I went on to say how it wasn't as easy as the other software when transferring files from the host machine to a VM but I'd still learn something. What do you guys think of this answer?"

1. Every entry level job I’ve seen requires relevant experience. I have none. I did food service for a while. Never again. I could only do it for five months before quitting (had multiple meltdowns on the clock and could never do my job properly).
2. I have ASD, ADHD, GED, and Dysthymia. I have a hard time doing basic stuff— I go to a class for college and I’m pretty much done for the day. It makes it hard to job search because, nine times out of ten, entry level job has some variation of “Dynamic work environment”, “candidate must be flexible, no schedules” or “must have a customer service mindset”. Ugh.
3. I don’t really care about work. I think it’s unrealistic for corporations to expect everyone to be looking for a job for fun and not for money. They’re always looking for a candidate who apparently doesn’t have to eat, pay rent, or use water. I just need money so I can get out of my parents’ house and pay for therapy, man. 
4. I have no special training or skills that would make me valuable to an employee, really.
5. I’m kind of the disappointment in my family, so nobody really expects me to get a job, I just need one because my parents stopped paying for my therapy.

What kind of job could I get, this considered?

Edit for more information: 
As far as aptitudes, I have been drawing and digitally painting for my whole life and I’m pretty good. I am a writer and finished my second screenplay last week (a college professor wanted me to do a spec for her because she was interested in developing a story I submitted for a creative writing class I took with her). 
I have decent spelling and grammar. Good attention to detail, visual memory, pattern recognition, and verbal memory, as well. I’ve been making EDM (dubstep) since I was twelve and have a very keen ear. 
I exercise frequently and I’m pretty strong, so warehouse work is always on the table. 
I’m a quick learner, so long as I have a decent teacher.
I’m very creative. An exceptional student, too."

Long story short. I saw an internal opening at my current company the other day and I submitted my application. While filing the internal application form from HR, it says if we haven’t, we should notify our current manger before submitting the application. 
I wonder why they asked that, especially before knowing if I would even get an interview. *If I’ve gotten the offer already, that request would have made sense. 
I don’t want my current manager to think that I am looking to move to another department, without actually getting an interview yet, let alone the job. 
Anyway, because the deadline is coming, I emailed and let my manager know. He said he would get back to me later the same day. He didn’t get back to me and it’s been the next day. I’m not sure if he’s forgot about it.

Anyone had this experience before? Why HR asks employees to notify their manager for just an internal application? Is it common? I’d just like to know what’s the purpose of this since it won’t make sense for just submitting an application, it’s not like I received an interview or the offer. 
Any input is appreciated."

I've been at this one role for two months and I work in IT but the members of the project management team never talk to me at all. Also, I haven't had any tasks really to do except for basic tickets. The other admin I work at has been on leave, so I haven't had anyone really train me. 

But, what would you do in my situation? I'm not sure if I should just start applying for other jobs and leave this one off my resume? I recently moved here and got a 15 month lease though, so would it be possible to cancel it and look for jobs in other locations, or go back and live with family and work remote? I have a had a few recrutiers message me for remote roles that are contract to hire, but I ignored them because I don't trust contract to hire jobs. The benefits are also fairly good in my current role, but it does have a 6 month probation period so I'm not sure whether to stay because maybe it's an onboarding process that got slowed down because the other employee is out or keep looking?

The current job I have so far has been fairly good, it's just weird that the project management team doesn't really say much. And the office layout has it where the project management team is further down the aisle and most of the people talk at the end of the aisle. Whereas, my desk is a single cubicle closer to the front. Sometimes I just study certs to pass the time or practice some coding languages . But do you think this is weird or just people getting busy and this is normal idk?"

Granted I did receivee a few offers but didn't move forward with any of them because the offers didn't seem all too attractive to make the switch. 

I'm currently getting really tired of my job and am questioning the feasibility of landing a new role in the current job market. Inflation is high and big companies, including tech, are tightening their belts by freezing hiring and eliminating redundancies. Statistics show there are MORE job openings than there are workers. 

Should I just buckle down for a few more years until this recession blows over, or should I still be vigilant in my job hunt. It's just so exhausting, and I want to know my efforts will be worthwhile. Any tips/advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciate. Thanks in advance."

Does it hinder the chances of being hired again or if it makes the hiring manager to not hire you when he sees a lot of jobs in your CV?

2,2022-10-29,(England) In the process of applying for jobs after qutting my old job but have no idea what to do in terms of references.,u/_Bluestar_Bus_Soton_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yguaxd/england_in_the_process_of_applying_for_jobs_after/,jobs,"I will try and keep this short and simple: a week ago, I had left my role as a team-member with immediate effect due to a falling out I had with the manager over a minor relatively minor thing the night before. He shouted at me quite loudly to ""clock off"", ""go home"" and that he will ""call me tomorrow"". A little over an hour later, I shouted back into my workplace for him to not contact me again and called him a (verbally) abusive c word. I didn't see him, which could of meant he was in his office (which was out of view from the position I was standing in) or he was on a delivery, but there were people in front of me who could of told him if he was off site at the time. I know this is absolutley not the best way to handle the situation but because I was understandbly upset and angry, I had just completley lost it and didn't have enough time to calm down. 

There are also other incidents which involve him getting unnessecarily angry at me and my team mambers and us also suspecting he may talk behind our backs in his language so the incident mentioned above is not a one-of event.

My nan said I deserve a reference from my manager for my qualities and dedication I gave to them, this includes:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Reliability

\-  Communication

\- Time-keeping

 \- Working under pressure whilst not getting stressed

\- Working overtime

\- Covering shifts for absent staff members

\- Offering to help out when not asked.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, my potential new employer approaching him for a reference is never going to be easy. I know you can appeal against bad references but the chance of me successfuly doing that is already shot. Do I say on applications/in interviews that I never had a job before or will they find out that I am lying or will they not hire me as they think I have no experience? Do I say I have been in a job before and explain the situation?"

I did 2 years at university for Human Resource management. I did 2 years towards an animal management and zoology degree. I dropped out both times due to poor mental health and family issues. I don’t think I’m incapable I’m someone who loves learning. 

I also did a level 2 childcare qualification (early years education) and was an early years educator for a bit but quit due to some personal issues (legal issues and bereavement). I’ve been an animal technician and done odd gigs such as social media management/personal shopper. 

All that effort yet I’m still making peanuts working in retail a job I probably could have gotten without any experience. I feel like I have so much to offer and just want the opportunity to grow in a career field. I found out today my co worker is a full-time web developer for a digital marketing firm which is a career path I’m interested in yet shes still working retail like me. 

Which makes me question how poorly the field must pay for her to need/want a 2nd job on top of it. The thought that someone could do everything eg. University, internships and land a job in their desired field but it still it be not enough to sustain them worries me. She told me about how competitive it is and now I feel like I’ve got no chance."

2,2022-10-29,Am I being dishonest?,u/DannyHufflepuff1998x,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ygy58d/am_i_being_dishonest/,jobs,"Hi! I create this post because there is something that is bugging me wether I'm being dishonest or not.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm someone who is looking for a job in a country where unfortunately the unemployment rate is pretty high so it means that one must really do an effort to ""highlight"" themselves among the other candidates.

&amp;#x200B;

It's about my job experience, the only experience I have is of my internship (I studied Business Administration) which was 4 months. It was as an Administrative Assistant in my university.

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is in my resume I don't specify it was actually my internship, I just say it was an Administrative Assistant with my functions there (I'm also adding my achievements from now on!) and well even the contract said that the job title was an Administrative Assistant, just that the type of contract was not a normal labour one, it was an internship one (it's called voluntary agreement and in other cases learning contract).

&amp;#x200B;

I just put it as a normal job, and well at the end of the day here is totally legal to put the internships as work experience.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is is that unfortunately many recruiters don't take serious the internships so it would mean that as soon as they see this word on my resume it's an instant reject without even giving me the chance to introduce myself to them in the interview, and I'm not even applying to like CEO roles or things like that. I'm applying to other entry job like that one, so it would be pretty absurd to ask for a candidate to have like a decade of experience and at the same time being just graduated (it happens a lot here unfortunately). 

&amp;#x200B;

However in the interviews I clarify it was the internship, for example there have been times I have been asked ""So why did you quit that job?"" and I just said calmly ""Oh cause it was my internship and unfortunately there was no way to renew my contract"". Or other times I tell them that it was my internship and the reason why I didn't specified it on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to lie or hide information, it's just that I want that the recruiters at least get to know to me in person and see what other qualities do I have for the job despite that my internship ""doesn't count"" for them. I totally believe one can also do a great job despite not having an amount time of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

And as I was saying, my job name was that even in the contract, my functions are the same I'm saying and ofc I'm willing to show them the certificate despite it says it was an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

So was I dishonest here? I should say it was my internship? I didn't put when I worked there (just for how long). 

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe they assumed right away 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading and please let me know with all your honesty if this is a dishonest practice or if it's just fine, I really don't have much experience regarding to job searching."

This new job is 5 minutes from my house compared to the seasonal being 25 minutes, and would save me a lot of money on gas.

Im just wondering if its wise to quit this seasonal, since midway they ask people if they want to be hired full time, and work with your schedule to see if any department would accept it. However, the full time increase is only a 1.25, so it'd only add up to 13.25 a hour if I go for it.

For context I work 9-5 Monday to Friday managing social media accounts and he will message me on a Saturday at 11pm or on a Sunday early morning saying things like hey can you put this up on the story for this account or can you respond to the dm, etc. I don’t get paid for this so I don’t get why there’s the expectation that I have to be active on these social accounts when I’m not working. What makes it more frustrating is that my boss has no clue what goes into managing these accounts, is not logged in on any of them so he can’t even help with responding to dms and he demands unreasonable goals. I’m frustrated because I thought I escaped from this toxic work culture at my last job but it seems I’ve run into another bad working environment. I should note that I’ve tried the obvious of not responding to his messages or replying after awhile and he literally just keeps texting me or has even called me multiple times. I’ve also told him that I’m not interested in working weekends as I have other commitments yet he still continues to contact me.

Most of the people focus on the technical skills like coding, project management , designs , admin task .  
But people at higher level also possess theses technical skills then why are they more successful ?  
The answer is , They are different from you. They not only possess technical skills but they also have better communication skills , people management skills and better soft skills than you , That's why they are at the Top.

➡️Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's good for you.

As a professional we always chase data, numbers, statistics to decide whether we are going towards the right direction or not.  
But what if you are measuring the wrong thing, then all your research is going nowhere.  
For example measuring competitors data when you need to improve your product, measuring your peer performance when he you need to improve on your own performance and measuring number of hours you are working instead of focusing on your skills.

➡️Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you.

Don't get busy in your day to day office routine, always level up your skills to become better at your field. That's the only way to accelerate in your career and your life.  
So always level up your skills and never take a day of from upskilling yourself.

Hope these Ideas will help you in your professional career.  
What are your unconventional ideas that can accelerate one's career ?"

I’ve been in customer service for 10 years 7 of them as a Bartender. When I was a young teen my grandma would always tell me to ‘please not end up in the service industry’ well sorry grams! Like many other women in the fam that’s the path I’ve started on. 
I’ve mostly done pub and touristy ma and pa restaurants. I love the quaint homey atmosphere. I’ve had some of the most uplifting, honest conversations with complete strangers. I’ve meet people who have stayed in touch over the years who genuinely care about my well being. My ability to read the room and the environmental awareness this kind of work has given me I will always be appreciative of.  The hours are a plus seeing as you can work part time and make as much a full time worker if not more.(hard to give that up) I know not everyone appreciates a service industry worker but it does require a specific set of skills and it can be extremely taxing on your body and your mind.  That’s where I find myself lately, drained. I myself like a genuine interaction I realize they can’t all be this way but it’s what keeps me going and I take pride in taking care of my guests. 
I’ve been having some mental struggles as of late and finding it hard to go to work everyday and interact and wait on people.  It’s to the point where I’m having break downs on my way and sometimes when I’m there.(crying in the bathroom in a packed restaurant isn’t fun) Honestly sometimes people just suck and for the most part I don’t take it personally but for whatever reasons I am fragile right now and I need a break to heal up and reevaluate.
So my question to you if you made it this far is what are some jobs where I can work independently, entry level and/or willing to train, good pay for someone who’s burnt out on human interaction. Driving, remote work, etc.
I’m interested in what’s out there."

Currently looking for job and internship opportunities in investment banking ,Financial services and Banks etc.
I am very much interested in financial services and stock market and would love to start working in a established company or startup as a equity advisor/Finance analyst. 
Have been also interested in IB due to the enormous pay and opportunities. 
So my first priority would be to start my career with a investment bank or else join a small finance bank.
I already have a offer from a small finance bank based in Bangalore but looking for something better.
Currently i also came across graduate programs offered by a few investment banks and companies. 
It would be great if i get  selected .
I live in India but as i have also lived  for a decade in dubai i am also looking for a job/internship in Dubai.
My uncle in a Finance officer in a finance consulting company and i am thinking of asking him a entry level  job .
In case i get a chance at his company i could probably learn a bit from his experience and network.
In case i get a opportunity in India i desire to work in MUMBAI / BANGALORE .
Actually as i am just starting my career i want to take huge risks and also learn,explore etc.
I also have been thinking of Working in a startup but not quite sure .
Would prefer to work in a big corporate due to better pay but as i said i like to take risks and if i come across a cute  startup i might as well join it .
Recently a relative of mine graduated from a tier 3 college and has still not received a job offer even after applying to 100 of companies.
I recently went to a job fair and it was embarrassing to see that even mba graduates were offered same starting salary like B.com graduates. 
I would love to join a good college but couldn't pay the fees due to my financial situation. 
Also i tried looking at options abroad but due to the expenses involved it wouldn't be possible for me .
Taking  a loan also wouldn't be a option for  my family as they wouldn't bet on me lol.
Thanks for reading and would appreciate any leads or advise."
2,2022-10-30,I want to leave I am unhappy,u/Altruistic_Bottle_66,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yhdpbc/i_want_to_leave_i_am_unhappy/,jobs,I started a job mid September in the defense insurance field. I was previously in the nonprofit law sector where I offered free legal advice to low income peooke to curb evictions. The job was so satisfying and the people were too. I left because of the low pay. This job pays me 12k more than the previous but the onboarding was poor and I feel like I have been thrown to the wolves with no base as to how to do my job properly. I absolutely hate the job. It's fully remote which I wanted but it's hard when you need help. At my previous job at a month and a half I was already working independently. This job I have to call my coworkers every day to have a mini training session after having brought the issue to my boss of me feeling like training was poor. Anyways I have never dreaded going to work at my previous job and this I do. I ABSOLUTELY HATE working here. I contacted my former boss to ask her if they would still welcome me as I left properly with 3 weeks notice and friendly. She responded saying that they had just filled my position but that they  missed me and she was gonna aal if the budget was there to bring me back. I would be taking a payout and I know happiness has no price but also I don't want to be unhappy with the pay but love helping people. Before I left they got a new CEO who apparently is more friendly to salary increases and employee input. Their benefits were UNMATCHED . While the benefits at this company suck . High deductible insurance and you cant use vacation says until you're past the 3 months. Anyways I really came for the money. The recruiter was super vague with the description and I got the job literally in 1 week from the time I heard from recruiter to the time I was offered the job. I am so confused and don't know what to do. :(

I’ve been working for this company for about a year and six months. I have tried to leave once during the first 7 months, was counter-offered and accepted, then got a another raise after I took additional responsibilities to not replace a previous employee. 

Fast forward last month I got a promotion and now make 80k. When I started i was making 50k. 

While I am grateful that this company has gone above and beyond to keep me here, I am not happy. I requested the promotion because I need more money and the position will open more doors in the future, but it’s not the career path I want to go or company I want to stay in. I feel so miserable going everyday. 

Will I be a complete jerk if I start looking for something else although i just transitioned to this role about a month ago? I feel I owe this company loyalty but should I prioritize what I truly want? I want a remote job that pays the same and that I feel more passionate about.

When he's read my message, he announces on the team group that I will be on a leave for so and so reason. Now I don't really have a problem with it, nor does it affect me in any way (sometimes I do wish he doesn't announce the reason, but it still is okay).

However, he never does this for any other team member when they go on leave. Never even for himself in fact. Just for me, and I am struggling to understand why. If this is a protocol to be followed, shouldn't it be followed for everyone? Why only me? Again, doesn't affect me in any way, just seems weird. Maybe any of you have experienced this and know why he does this? My co-worker said it is a way of making me feel guilty for taking a leave, so can it be that? Is it just some way of intimidating me?

EDIT: I wanted to take a leave for personal reasons, so i did. Didn't give him any reason. He called me, i didn't pick up. He then messaged me asking 'what happened?' basically wanting to know the reason behind me taking a leave. I didn't reply to his message and did not pick up his call. 

This is not the first time. Whenever i take a leave, even if i tell him the reason, he calls (or gets one of my co-workers to call) and enquire as if to verify if i am actually sick or actually in need of a leave etc."

I am 40 and a Mechanical Engineer. I relocated to Phoenix for a Position and a fresh start at life after some shitty life decisions. Six weeks into my new position here the company went bankrupt and closed the doors Just after I had moved here and spent thousands relocating.

I found a small manufacturer to employ me almost immediately upon the company closing. The owner was up front and told me that "" I can't pay what the big boys pay"".... but we have bonuses every 90 day and unlimited overtime. At the same time, I was interview there was another company in the mix. I interviewed at that company also and weeks later they came back with an offer. I accepted the offer. While just in my first few weeks at the smaller manufacturer.
Fast forward I got cold feet and never started the position and decided to stay. Needless to say, they were not happy.

Just recently this company reached out and we put our differences aside and decided once more to move forward with an offer after interviewing again. 80k and was told there was no hard feelings of what happened last year.

My current employer says he can only pay me 60k. He doesn't know I have an offer and I am 100% sure he would try to counter with something.
I don't want to stiff this company who offered me the position again though. I like the people I work with. I am the only M.E. on staff, and I pretty much run the place. It would hurt bad if I left.

Side notes it's been over a year, and I have only got one bonus $500 and now we are slow so the O.T. has been nixed.
I believe that my current employer can pay me more and at least match my current offer. I am just really torn about what to do....Reddit Please help!!!"

I work for a coffee farm where I do landscaping. I work 2 jobs while going through school full-time. I'm upset because I asked the owner for a raise because he's paying $20-$22 an hour. The other new hire makes $22 an hour while I was making $20. The new worker is lazy and is happy about being lazy. He's made it clear that he's an hourly worker and he will try to coast by as easily as possible, which is okay. My problem is that the managers and owners know I work very hard and I only got a raise of $1. I was nervous when asking for a raise, but made it clear I wanted at least $22. My managers also know I work much harder than the new landscaper and that I'm much more aware of the tasks and responsibilities. I guess what really upsets me is that I worked very hard for the business and the owner only raised me by $1 and not even $2 which would match the new hire.

I'm hurt because dam, I really put my heart into working hard. Now I am upset. I should talk to him and express my frustration. But I may do that while just coasting by and doing the bare minimum as well. I don't know what to do. Doing the bare minimum sounds like the best option now and coasting by. The owner of the coffee farm has made it clear what they think of me through their wage increase. I may just treat the job like I don't care and make money until they either lay me off or I leave. Either way, I hurt because I didn't feel like I was asking for too much, I felt like I was asking for what was right. I hate this because I give it my all anywhere I work and I always get shafted, this is why I want to be financially independent. What should I do? Just coast by? Express my concerns and coast by? Any other advice moving forward? I don't think I'll find a job that will treat me right and pay me as hard as I work for them, it's a never-ending trend.

Who am I kidding I don't feel just a little hurt, I am very hurt. I feel disrespected and unappreciated. I feel like everything I did meant nothing."

It felt....and I can't stress this enough, it FELT \*\*\*\*ING HORRIBLE. I Got peppered for two hours about how shitty of a person I am. It was devastating. I felt absolutely defeated and ashamed. I dropped into a hard depression. I  felt like quitting.

Keep in mind I drove 2 hours for this in person interview.

Everything seemed normal at first. I walked in and the front desk person introduced himself and asked if I wanted a water and all the considerations. I declined, and he had me wait in this room for a little while, til two guys walked in.

I got up and said, “hi my name is ****”, to who I presumed was the hiring manager and he just looked at me and said hey without introducing himself. 

Anyway, 5 min into the interview he started criticizing me about what I was wearing. To give you an idea of what I had on, it was a white button down, slacks, and a blazer. I found this odd since we just met.

A couple moments later he asks me an interview question and I gave him my response. My response was pretty generic to how you would answer a question like that and he goes, “that’s a terrible fu****** answer.” I was kinda confused. Like this guy is treating me like we’ve been knowing each other for months. 

Then we go to lunch and he brings a fellow co worker. I try to start numerous conversations with him but he doesn’t show any interest in speaking with me. He barely spoke to me the whole time. He just spoke with the other guy with us and even showed him a picture on his phone of something funny and didn’t show me. 

I was so confused as to why he was so rude. I was thinking to myself, maybe he just wants to see if I can handle criticism. But no, that’s not it. He wanted to see if he could treat me like S**t and have me put up with it. He was testing me. I visited the glass door for this job and it confirmed my suspicions. They were sayin things like, “they treat you like crap.”  So I called him today and told him I was not interested. I wish I would’ve caught on during the interview.. I would’ve walked out so fast"

then in june, the hiring manager that i interviewed with messaged me on LinkedIn and told me he really liked what i have to convey in our interview and that they’re planning to add another analyst to his team and he will let me know when it opens. i asked if he had any idea when this position will be opening and he said no idea but he’s hoping to get 1-2 job approvals before end of the year. i said okay cool def loop me back in cos im super interested and he said he def will.

I would, of course, have to miss 3-4 of my shifts if I did go home, which is out-of-state from school/work. 

Is it worth it to ask for that month off? Or should I just quit? Either way, how should I go about asking for that time off/resigning? I do like working there, but I'm not sure it would be fair to ask to leave for so long when I'm so new. I'm also not sure I'm willing to stay in-state weeks longer for a job I only do once a week.

i think that the actuarial career offers more stability such as income increases with each exam passed. i also love math and the idea of working in insurance as well as the potential to be credentialed (ASA, FSA, MAAA, etc.). computer science seems nice but ive heard that boot camps can teach you much more in a short amount of time, and the technology, languages, skills, etc. are constantly changing. i think that im not confident in competing against lifelong programmers and students who were passionate about computers and programming from a young age. actuarial seems like it might take more time to get a job, but i feel like the wait is worth it because of the stability beyond 3-4 exams passed. at the same time, i do understand how actuarial science is too specific of a degree, but im worried that comp sci would be too demanding and take much time away from studying for exams as well as the fact that the classes wont be relevant to actuarial exams. i would be taking a few programming courses in the act sci major as well as business / economics courses, and actuarial courses."

I've worked in the politi-sphere for 3 years, but I am potentially going to make the jump to leg. aide work. I'm not sure if there is anyone out there who has experience in this field, but if you do, could you please give me some pointers on how to answer these? I don't know if this is something I should have prior knowledge of, or if I will have to build my relationships with agencies in order to do this work. The mock emails are below:

(I) *I'm writing this email to express my desire that Ranked choice voting be adopted by all Oregon elections. This voting system is simple and intuitive, nullifies the issue of political spoilers, allows for representation of a wider range of ideas, reduces the hegemony of the two big political parties, and gives everyone a better chance at getting what they want and need.*

*Thank you for your time,*

*Constituent*

(II) *I received a notice on May 17th, letting me know that I overpaid my state taxes for 2021. The notice was totally incomprehensible, so I called the Oregon Department of Revenue to ask for an explanation. I spoke to an employee, John, who told me that I was due a refund of $2117. I asked him when I would receive the money back. He said he had no idea. This is not a satisfactory answer, especially since my husband and I are senior citizens, living primarily on social security. We also have to pay estimated taxes for 2022, and it seems a bit inequitable that we have to pay Oregon while the state continues to withhold money that is due to us.* 

*Could you please look into this and see if we can get our refund? Thank you.*

*Sincerely,*

*Constituent*"

Would really appreciate your perspective and advice here. 

So I switched careers a little while back and landed a decent, if entry level job in this new field. It’s with a small firm who have had a lot of issues in the past, and was poorly run, but survived because they provide a niche service in a very affluent area. 

Since being hired on I’ve been told that not only am I the only person who has stuck around for more than six months in the role for the last three years, I’m also one of the most promising and have become the right hand man of my team leader. 

However the pay is pretty bad - I can just barely afford the necessities with nothing left over for savings much less enjoyment. The company at hire talked a good game about good benefits, regular pay reviews and most importantly the option to cross train to develop new skills, responsibilities and grow my career. 

None of these have manifested. And instead it’s been constant work in my field with zero options for any kind of advancement or side training. The leadership regularly makes big mistakes - in large part due to poor structuring and the inability to hire more people - and these affect us a lot. 

I’ve done the research and the average pay offered by our (generally much larger) competitors is 15-25% above what I’m making now. They are also a lot more professional, have better equipment, management and actual career paths for their staff. They also offer benefits and PTO - neither of which are offered by my current employer beyond the barest legal minimums. 

For the last two weeks I have been in talks and preliminary interviews with their biggest and most established competitor, and have a final interview this afternoon. They have been aggressively pursuing me and made it clear they are desperate for bodies to fill the role. Almost all other firms are also screaming for people at similar rates. 

Here’s the situation. Unless I totally botch this interview Im expecting to get an offer. Ideally though I want to use it to get leverage from my current company to meet their offer. 

I’ve thought many times about how. And it would likely just be a letter saying essentially: “I went and found out what im worth, it’s $X, beat it or don’t.”

My current company has mentioned many times how hard it is for them to get and keep quality people - but they never address the many reasons why. A big reason was the former owner who was a legit psychopath but who has now fortunately retired. The new owner is the one who talks a good game about change and renewal but when it comes to salaries he’s content to keep the old, penny wise pound foolish approach. 

There’s a good chance they may just tell me No - even if it will reduce their revenue generation by like 50% if I leave. 

I could take the competitors offer but it would be a much longer commute and I have personal and logistics reasons for preferring my current company - at least until I can develop sufficient experience and seniority to jump to the next level of employment (approx 1-2 years). 

Ultimately my plan is to job hop my way to better and better positions and pay/benefits on that schedule. 

Hope I’ve detailed this enough for it to be understandable. Any help or suggestions people have as to how to move forward would be appreciated. Thanks"

Long story short - I broke my ankle outside of work and I am out a period of time. I reside in Massachusetts and have worked for a world-wide medical diagnostic facility. I qualified for FMLA and subsequently, I am getting monetary benefits from the state of Massachusetts instead of my employer’s insurance company. 

FMLA/PFMLA clearly states that residents in Massachusetts have job-protection for at least 12 weeks. I have no been out 12 weeks as of yet. 

My employer, as well as their insurance is telling me my job is NOT protected. 

Is this true? Can I have job protection under FMLA but NOT my employer regarding the same claim?

ANY help would be appreciated. I’m at wits end. My employers insurance has been nothing but annoying. They’ve made SEVERAL mistakes with this case thus far and I’m just looking to be educated at a higher level than I am now with this."

1,2022-10-31,Agonizing Over A Job Offer (Input please!),u/HEBV5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yigk2e/agonizing_over_a_job_offer_input_please/,jobs,"Hi all, I have the fortunate dilemma of debating a job offer. I've been unemployed since mid June and currently have three options in the air:

* Option 1: Current job offer with letter in hand for $60k/yr remote work with limited benefits (health, generous PTO). Job sits squarely in my previous experience and seems a better fit than my last gig in this industry. The pay is a bit on the low side for my life in Chicago (I've already negotiated them up), though should be doable with decent budgeting. I've been able to stall for about two weeks by asking clarifying questions, but they want a response today/tomorrow .
* Option 2: A tentative federal offer of ~$73/yr with better benefits, pending the passing of a background/suitability check. Work is a bit outside of my previous experience, but would be working with some people that I have previously known for some years. My clearance is still pending after nearly a month, though my friend that is joining in the same role got his cleared the next day, which gives me pause for whether I'll get cleared.
* Option 3: Just did final round interviews with a company that would be excellent fit for my interests and skills, starting at ~$80k. Supposed to hearing back in the next 36 hrs. Assuming it goes through, also anxious about the reference check; I was let go from my past job for performance reasons and while my supervisor was supportive and I *believe* she would vouch positively on my behalf, she's been unresponsive.

The quality of work experience seems that it would be different, but roughly equal for each option. On its face, it seems that I should pass on the current offer for what should be better options for pay and benefits. That said, I'm not super confident in making that call, given that I have only a few months left in my savings and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Been thinking about this for a while, but having trouble deciding which option is optimal. 

tl;dr: I have better job prospects potentially lined up, but feeling super anxious about giving up something in hand and I don't want to double back on a decision.

Edit 1: Clarifying that I've already negotiated the pay on the first gig, using the $73k federal offer."

I’m 22, just got out of college in the summer. Having some trouble getting into graduate schemes. I am applying for a lot of admin and marketing roles. This question about where I see myself in five years and how I see my career progressing always stumps me . 

It’s not as if I haven’t thought about it and I vaguely know what I want to get into. I’m planning on doing a masters in the next few years. But of course I’m not going to tell them that and the career field I want to get into have nothing to do with admin roles so I never tell them much. I know if I tell them my true goals they probably wouldn’t hire me as they’d think I wouldn’t be there for long. So how do I answer this?

Hi everyone should i accept a remote job with the same salary or hybrid job with extra 18%

I now have 3 options:

1. stay in the company and wait until the January to see if i will get and extra 10% i have asked for it  
salary increase 2 and half months now the manager said ok but i haven't received any confirmation for HR / it's a small company there is not place to grow as they already assigned a team lead.
2. i have a remote offer with 6% salary increase but the it's a big company and maybe i can be a team lead in the future .
3. I have also an other offer a hybrid offer with extra 18% in a startup with a possibility to move into a freelance contract in the future."

I went to the location to use their services, and I was so inspired and wanted to be part of their mission. I returned to speak to the main partner there inquire about part-time help. She told me to shoot her an email with my resume. 

**In July,** I send the resume but don't get a reply, and follow up using another employee's email just in case my email went to spam (as I heard it had been doing that.) I get a reply from her to check back in September when they begin opening positions, and she lets me know she's shared my information with the director of the department I'm interested in. 

I never receive any notification from the director, so **I follow up in September** asking about part time positions. When I don't receive a reply **I follow up one week later**, still no reply. 

One of my friends tells me my email has been sending out spam, and I wonder if this has hindered my communication with the company. 

From a different email, I just send **one more follow up in October**, and decide to back off after that. 

Last week I check and they have opened three positions, all applicable through Indeed. I'm so excited and ready to apply to one, but I don't have the ""years of experience"" requirement so I write a thoughtful cover letter.

I check back within an hour and see my application has been ""not selected by employer,"" and wonder if it's because of the years of requirement piece and it's automatic, or if they recognized my name and find me annoying and too eager. 

I don't want to be a weirdo and overwhelm them, but I also know people are busy especially when it comes to hiring. I wonder if my eagerness is coming off as excitement for the company's position, or just entitled. Any advice?"

The choices were for ""Are you willing to relocate?"" were 1) Yes, 2)Yes, and I need assistance, or 3)Not willing to relocate. 

I am emphatically Yes, I am also not going to turn down assistance so I chose the second option. There wasn't a ""yes, willing to relocate and negotiate assistance should it be offered"" option. 

Anyone have an opinion on whether it is appropriate to reach out to the organization to explain that? I of course don't know that that was the rationale for not being selected, but it could well be."

The company says they don’t accept any time off requests longer than 5 consecutive days. The vacation is a 2 week cruise that was planned and paid for long before he worked for the company. It’s for my father’s 70th birthday and we are planning on going no matter what, because it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Does he have any options here? Just work until the trip and then be fired for taking a vacation? This is really disheartening because he has only ever been on one vacation in his entire life (he’s in his forties) and he had issues with that one too. It’s a large company so this isn’t an issue of getting the shifts covered. They are just telling him he isn’t “allowed” to take this vacation. How can employers dictate our lives like this? What’s even the point of working if we can’t take a week or two every few years to live our lives? Any advice is greatly appreciated."

Hey Everyone,

I actually have two questions pertaining to my current role. 

1) Is it normal to be mentally and physically drained from an office role? 
2) Would you leave your current role to focus on your mental and physical health?

I do not enjoy my current role or am even remotely interested in it. Technically, I’m considered a Business Analyst, and if the role is the same everywhere, I’m truly fucked. This job is my “first” pertaining to my degree, however, I worked as a Logistics Coordinator for 7 years. 

Regarding my mental and physical health, I’m 26 years old, have 2 herniated discs, currently going to PT for other issues, and just am at my lowest lows. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. I want to please everyone but always end up suffering. Please provide some guidance or opinions."

I understand that the application site will likely be using ATS to narrow down candidates but I want to confirm that I'm not incorrect in thinking that simply pasting my resume into the manually entered job description is the correct tactic.

The thing is all the jobs I am interested in are higher paying therefore are in high demand (very competitive) so it will more than likely take waaaay more time to achieve such (I do t have any work experience really) and a lot of jobs anyway within the major don’t  pay as well starting off 

This might be cold feet I’m experiencing but if I were to actually get this job I need to change my attitude as far as how I look at it to perform better and stay long term (at least a year) 
A part of me is a job is better than no job because I’m not really doing anything productive with spare time but that bit of shame creeps in thinking if this is a sort of cop out ?… mixed feelings to say the least  

Any advice ?"

Afraid to Tell Boss",u/JustDickered420,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yiscml/gave_notice_left_after_4_days_afraid_to_tell_boss/,jobs,"TL:DR  walked out of job after 4 days of giving notice after 8 years of trying to please a bit of a dick head boss who never bothered to replace leaving employees leaving me alone to do everything. Now I don't know how to tell him/ how to man up and tell him since he doesn't know I left forever. How do I stop making his problems mine?

Back story:

So I've worked at a small scrap yard for 8 years untill today when I started my new job. When I first started 8 years ago we had a staff of 7 people. After a couple of years we eventually lose the other 2 yard guys leaving me and the delivery/inventory guy helping when he could. Come COVID one sales person quits, and the boss lays the delivery/inventory guy off per his request again due to covid. All the while the boss is quick to point out your mistakes, but never praises your good work. 

Come February of this year the boss tells us he's putting the business up for sale, and that he'll do his best to make sure if anyone does buy the place that they'll keep the last salesman and I. The salesman was worried he would get screwed and ended up leaving in June of this year leaving just me and the boss. So for the  last 5 months I've been the only one doing everything with not alot of help from the boss especially the last 2 months or so since there's been a buyer lined up. He wouldn't come in to work untill 11, take a few phone calls and instead of finishing the sale write it down and give it to me to finish. Then go for lunch at 12 12:30 and not come back untill after 3 alot of times. Which leaves me alone to answer phones, order in parts for customers, deal with walk-ins and pull parts and deal with shipping and receiving of parts. All the while he's still being a bit of a douche like usual telling me that he's doing this so that I can stay employed like he's doing me some favour.

So fast forward to 3 weeks ago I get offered a job at a shop getting my license. Now after 8 years of trying to keep this guy happy and not lose my job because I have responsibilities, I found myself unable to give him notice until Tuesday of last week when I had to start my new job the following Monday. When I gave him notice he was quick to say I better be giving him 2 weeks so of course I back down and say yeah I should be able to even tho I couldn't. So the week goes by and of course Friday comes and goes and I didn't tell him I wasn't coming back for whatever stupid reason my mind had at the time. On Sunday I went to work and packed up all my tools and box and everything and I didn't end up seeing him the whole time I was there, which I was hoping for so he'd get upset and I'd get mad and grow the balls to tell him. 

So  I'm sitting here unsure of what to tell him/ how to man up and tell him. He called me a few times this morning and left me a voicemail asking me what's going on and to call him. I did end up sending him a text at like 9:30pm on Sunday but he's not tech savvy so I'm assuming he didn't get it. I know that I never plan to return and I've wanted to get the hell out for the last 6 months, but now that I have I can't figure out why I've made myself stupid with stress and anxiety over something that should be simple. It's not my fault hes in this position, it was his choices that got him here. But yet I feel responsible somehow?"

At that point he was too tired and did not want to fight the company to get his job back. And the job itself wasn’t the most to be desired.

Now, we’ve been trying to find him something along the same lines or better. The majority of his experience relates to merch stock management, order fulfillment, and some office work. While he is trying to find something that leans heavier on office work, he’s still open to work with stock, and has found part time employment in fulfilling online grocery orders at Whole Foods.

I have a decent job, and I’ve tried to apply all of the things that helped me find my employment, to his resume, LinkedIn, and indeed. But he’s not getting many interviews aside from one in a blue moon. 

Any advice in this situation? I’d like to reach out to recruiters but I’m not sure how. I’m also running out of advice for his resume and online representation. 

We are in Orlando, FL at the moment if anyone has advice related to our location specifically too."
