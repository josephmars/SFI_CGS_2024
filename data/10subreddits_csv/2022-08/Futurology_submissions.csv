Rules and regulations are needed to allow people to travel safely by car – this is the same for travel by air. [Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)](https://www.nasa.gov/aam) is working to develop a new, autonomous transportation system in the sky. This new system will move people and packages in both urban and rural areas, forever changing how people around the world benefit from aviation. The addition of Advanced Air Mobility will benefit the public in several ways including: easier access for travelers between rural, suburban, and urban communities; rapid package delivery; [reduced commute times](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/features/aam-aims-to-shorten-travel-time.html); [disaster response](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/features/aam-for-emergencies.html), and new solutions for [medical transport of passengers and supplies](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/features/aam-for-healthcare.html).

Safety is paramount for this new air transportation system.

NASA’s vision for Advanced Air Mobility is to develop a safe, accessible, automated, and affordable air transportation system allowing passengers and cargo to travel on-demand in innovative aircraft across town, between neighboring cities, or to other locations typically accessed by car today.

We're celebrating National Aviation Day today, so we're here to talk about the future of autonomous aircraft!

**We are**:

* Nancy Mendonca, NASA Deputy Mission Integration Manager for the Advanced Air Mobility Mission (NASA Headquarters)
* Ken Goodrich, NASA Deputy Project Manager for Technology of the Advanced Air Mobility Mission (NASA Langley Research Center)
* Laura Mitchell, NASA Public Affairs Officer (NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center)
* Beau Holder, NASA Public Affairs Officer (NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center)
* Jessica Arreola, NASA Aeronautics Program Specialist (NASA Headquarters)

**Ask us anything about**:

* What it is like to contribute to the future of aviation
* How we’re working to ensure a future of autonomous aircraft is safe
* Where vertiports, the specialized facilities for the arrival, departure, and parking/storage of AAM vehicles, may work into existing infrastructure
* How we began our NASA careers

**We'll be online from 12-1:30 p.m. EDT (1600-1730 UTC)** to answer your questions. Participants will initial their responses. See you soon!

Submission statement:

This submission is not just about stupid AI's, but about how many services, critical to our lives, detect user abuse through automated systems with no customer facing human centered appeals process.

I think the Internet is missing basic consumer protections that would demand that companies in certain industries, or running social media accounts who have such automated abuse detection, punishment systems have to have some soft of timely, open, transparent, human focused appeals process

So telecom companies, email companies, cloud storage companies, payment processors and banks, and even social media companies must support a phone number and email address where people can discuss and appeal their punishments including bannings with a human, and that the appeals and their resolution must be recorded and made available to the user"

A test with r/futurology,u/natematias,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/x0p5lx/do_sticky_notes_improve_newcomer_behavior_a_test/,Futurology,"Can clear community policies against harassment reduce its prevalence in a community? And what side effect (if any) do they have on freedom of expression?

In 2020, our team worked with moderators and community members of r/futurology to test the effect on newcomers of sticky comments that list community rules. This study was a replication of a 2016 study with r/science [(you can read it here in PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1813486116)). We now have results for r/futurology, as well as two other communities who tested the ideas in parallel.

In this thread, we're sharing the results to discuss the preliminary analysis. This is a space for you to ask questions, interpret the results, and  discuss how (or if) these results should influence what the community does next.

I'll be available all day to field questions. We will compile what we learn from this conversation when writing up and submitting the results for peer review with an academic publication. Thanks!

## What we did with r/futurology

Starting in January 2020, our software observed when new posts were made and assigned discussions to receive either a sticky comment with the rules or no sticky comment at all. We then measured how many newcomer accounts commented and whether the first comment from newcomers was removed by moderators or not.

In r/futurology the message read:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Welcome to /r/Futurology! To maintain a healthy, vibrant community, comments will be removed if they are disrespectful, off-topic, or spread misinformation ([rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/rules/#wiki_6._comments_must_be_on_topic.2C_contribute_to_the_discussion_and_be_of_sufficient_length._comments_that_dismiss_well-established_science_without_compelling_evidence_are_a_distraction_to_discussion_of_futurology_and_may_be_removed.)). While thousands of people comment daily and follow the rules, mods do remove a few hundred comments per day. Replies to this announcement are auto-removed.

## What we learned

In r/futurology, we did not observe an effect of rule posting on newcomer behavior.

Chart: [https://citizensandtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-08-22-newcomer-norm-compliance-replication-576x576.png](https://citizensandtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-08-22-newcomer-norm-compliance-replication-576x576.png)

Across all subreddits on average, posting the rules increased the chance that first-time commenters would follow the rules. However, r/science was the only community with a statistically-significant effect both times. With r/ffxiv, we think the reason is that rule violations are fairly rare. With r/futurology, the cause might be the sample size issue or something else. We are eager to hear your ideas in the thread.

What effect did the sticky comment have on newcomer participation? While newcomer comments increased in the first r/science study in 2016, we did not find an affect on levels of newcomer participation in the follow-up studies. We discuss possible reasons for this in the post.

Finally, we found that the effect on moderator workload depended largely on whether the intervention increased newcomer participation or not.

## Caveats to discuss

Due to a software glitch, the study didn't have as large a sample size in r/futurology as our projections indicated we needed—we had to remove 3,600 posts (26%) of the posts from the study. We're working to see if we can gain access to historical mod logs to fill in this gap.

## Note on Ethics

Note: The study was reviewed by the moderators of the subreddit and approved by the Princeton and then the Cornell University ethics boards (Cornell protocol #1909009059). If you have any concern, we encourage you to ask it below or reach out to us directly. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, you can contact the Cornell Institutional Review Board [here](https://compliance.cornell.edu/reporting-concern).

## Please Share Your Questions, Reactions, and Ideas

MANY THANKS to everyone in the subreddit who supported this research, and for your patience as we worked to set it up and write up the results during COVID!

I'll be here all day to field questions and discuss the results, so do please share any reactions and ideas."
