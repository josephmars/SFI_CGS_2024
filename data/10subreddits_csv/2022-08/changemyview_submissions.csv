They're a symptom of the overall educational problem.,u/Prestigious_Fun_3495,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wd48ug/cmv_general_ed_courses_in_the_us_college_system/,changemyview,"If we take a look at the rest of the world, their education systems are better standarized than our hodgepodge one. So that every High School student receives a high quality liberal arts foundation. Including kids that go to trade school. 

And so it's why these kids in ( well everywhere else other than the US) enter their profession faster. It's streamlined. 

Let's look at Italy for example. If one wants to enter the University of Bologna for example to study Law. You enter a specific high school tailored towards the Humanities. You learn Latin, Greek, Italian LIterature, English, History, Philosophy, Mathematics, the Sciences, Geography, History of Art. 

If you wanted to study computer science, you enter a technical high school that focuses more on science, math, technology,

But all in all, they have a very strong liberal arts backbone. 

&amp;#x200B;

To compare; we do not. Many of our high schools are often low quality. Kids don't get the liberal foundation that they need to enter College, hence the general ed courses."

i really, really, really think recent trends in mental health awareness, specifically suggesting that, for example, very normal and mundane things could be adhd or depression. while i understand that it’s important to bring awareness, i also think it’s a dangerous line where young people (i’ve fallen into this) can literally think their way into having depression or those who are on the line will fall to the depression side if they are unable/unwilling to get professional help to have a diagnosis (also because i believe self-diagnosing is not great either)

i also think they’re normalizing depression to the extent where young people sometimes believe that it’s desirable and will get you attention to be mentally ill, when it’s not. it sucks. it’s really hard to see people pretending to have mental health issues just for attention (for example, tik tokers pretending to have tourette’s) and i really think it invalidates people who are actively suffering. 

i think these trends are very, very dangerous and actually counterintuitive to what they’re trying to accomplish."

First: Men, as far as i know, simply have more muscle power and endurance in every single way possible and in every muscle possible, basically men have more strenght no matter the exercise (not including birth obviously). This means men are faster and stronger. 

Second: Men react faster, think faster and are smarter. Meaning that men are more strategical than women, can react to fast things faster than women (vision, sound, etc) and can think of many complex things faster than women. 

Third: Men have, by evidence, absolutely dominated every sport whenever matched up against women. 
The famous match of the 15 year old boys beating the Australian Women Soccer team. You may argue they weren't really trying, I argue not, they were trying as hard as they could and breaking a real sweat while the boys were chilling.

Edit: I ignored birth on purpose men don't have the same reproductive parts of a woman. But I left what women and man have in common."
0,2022-07-31,CMV: It's dumb that you can't yell and scream when watching golf in person,u/tumblrsgone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wd6rnl/cmv_its_dumb_that_you_cant_yell_and_scream_when/,changemyview,"Hopefully this will be a short CMV because I'm sure there has to be some legitimate reason for this but

PROFESSIONAL golfer shouldn't need it to be absolutely quiet to hit a golf ball well. 

We are allowed and even encouraged to yell at players and make noise during important moments of any other professional sports game except ones where the sound of a ball being hit is important to the game (ie tennis or ping pong). You scream at LeBron when the game is on the line and he's shooting a free throw. You scream during the world cup even if it's a shoot out. You even have air horns to distract a kicker trying to make a game winning field goal. 

The fact that you can't yell or even just talk normally when a golfer is trying to hit is ridiculous. If you're a pro, fight the pressure and learn to focus despite the distractions like a real athlete. 

BTW, The prestige of golf or the club wanting things to be a ""certain way"" are not going to be convincing arguments for me. There's no good reason to advocate to being a stuck up so please don't."

It's highly addictive and can have a lot of negative side effects.

 My MIL who takes it has terrible kidney issues (one of them literally doesn't work), stomach issues, and blood pressure problems. She claims she isn't addicted yet she's taking something that worsens almost all of the health problems she deals with. You wouldn't put your health in jeopardy to use a substance that you aren't addicted to .

Most people I know, tend to agree with me on this though. 

It really doesnt matter what it is;Train to Busan, Kingdom, All of Us are Dead, or really any other Korean zombie show/movie for that matter.. they just do it the best. Nothing really compares in terms of zombies for me, there's just something about the way they do their zombies that makes them so much better.

From the way they show the transformation, to the way they show hordes, to the effects they use.. it's all just a million times better than anything coming out of any other country. 

The only thing that could even come close would be the Walking Dead and that is purely due to the gore factor that TWD has. And then World War Z, due to the fast hordes of zombies. Other than that, nothing else can even come close. 

90% of what makes it great is of course due to the people they have playing the zombies. I feel like there must be some zombie acting school because in almost everything I watch the zombies are on par with one another. The ones that come to mind are what I've already said; Train to Busan, Kingdom, and All of Us are Dead. The people playing the zombies in these are absolutely incredible. Hands down the best zombie performances I've ever seen."

*Centrists, what?* Centrists are people who subscribe to an ideology that treats all conflicts as between moral equals. Centrism relies upon the idea that all parties are ~~operating in good faith and that all parties want good outcomes.~~ morally equivalent. Furthermore, it often is accompanied by appeals to [""the marketplace of ideas""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas) in conjunction with social Darwinian logic that the best ideas, or even the truth, will win out over bad ideas or falsehoods. Centrists often have a superficial understanding of politics: treating it as something they are above (insecurity), express the wish that both sides would just stop arguing and compromise (false equivalence), or using tone rather than content to judge the quality of an idea or argument (tone policing).

*Mistaken, at best.* At best, a centrist is operating in good faith and sincerely believes in their ideas. In such a case, a centrist is merely mistaken: the popularity or rhetorical strength of an argument is not a sufficient measure of the quality or truthfulness of an idea, yet it is the former qualities that determine its success in the so-called ""marketplace of ideas.""

*Malicious, at worst.* At worst, a centrist is operating in bad faith, and may not even be a sincere follower of centrism. In such a case, a centrist is using centrism to rehabilitate and include morally repugnant ideas and bad faith actors in discourse.

*Centrist, example.* Broadly speaking, centrist positions are often expressed to the effect of ""both sides are bad"" without actually evaluating the moral content of the position:

&gt;Centrist POV: ""Both sides are bad! You have feminists on the one hand and incels on the other. Both are radicalizing people and making real conversation impossible. Why can't both sides just talk it out and compromise?""

For more examples (and memes), see /r/enlightenedcentrism.

*View Change, Why?* I am posting this CMV because I would like to learn more about centrism and centrists, what they think, why they think it, how they feel about these common criticisms, and what their response to them are. Of course, one does not need to personally be a centrist to weigh in, but I assume it would help.

Edit (Delta 1, 2, 3): I should not have said that ""Centrism relies upon the idea that all parties are operating in good faith and that all parties want good outcomes."" This is false and I have changed the OP text to reflect this.

This includes wearing the colour white, but also wearing bright colours like red, wearing daring/unique cuts of dresses, having a poofy skirt, having a lot of bling, etc. 

and IF the bride is someone who enjoys simple, quiet clothing, then shouldn't she be perfectly fine with someone else wearing something flashy? because her preference is simple and she's being true to herself. 

Specifically i'm gonna focus on western/american weddings, because a lot of american weddings guest outfits look incredibly bland, boring, and everyday from what I have seen. I can only assume that this is because of general fears of ""upstaging"" the bride/groom with an outfit, when it should really be on the bride/groom to make sure they don't get upstaged.

i want this view changed because I usually go along with what these dresscodes are, but i'd like to understand them better."

This usually involves foisting culture, suppressing native inhabitants, and exploiting local resources.

Queen Elizabeth II has reigned during the twilight and dismantling of the British Empire. She has overseen more acts of decolonisation than she has acts of colonisation.

During her reign no new territories have been claimed by Britain, and she has been actively voted for and accepted as the Head of the Commonwealth. In the future we may see people choose to leave this structure as there is nothing preventing them aside from democratic process same as any other vote.

QEII is not responsible for the actions of her ancestors. Their sins and actions do not weigh on her, only her own sins and actions.

In the same way, the current heads of state of Germany are not responsible for the acts of their predecessors, including some of the worst atrocious imaginable. The country is the same country but their actions and behaviour is now different and while some may not forgive it feels like the world does not look at them unfavourably.

The Queen may be looked at unfavourably, and perhaps could do more in her actions to help her people. However the label of coloniser simply does not apply to her.

To change my view I would want to see examples of the Queen behaving as a coloniser in seeking to settle British people in a land in order to exert influence over them."

Before you fake biologist come on, that also proves my point. Down to the biology women been shoved with all the negative traits and is not taken seriously because of it. Also Logical isnt even the opposite of emotions and stop saying yin and yang that proves my point.

* do not say ""theyre caring :)))"" or anything like that. It is good but not better/ can come close to half the shit men are descibed to have.

my edivence/ wherec i get these notions are is parents, religion, gender roles, reddit itself, exc

* ""thats nuianced"" isnt gonna cut it anymore, i understand that it is.
BUT I'm saying the qualities men have really can do more/ is more useful to the advancement of society.(in nearly all situations, where as women traits only help in spefic situations)

* I'M SPEAKING OVERALL for god sake i do not care about ""how you was raised""

* just stating a (different) feminine quality that is good or better that women have, will do. Alright now i'm gonna show a list of what i've gathered from online/offline things.

* Men are more logical,smarter,stronger,""cooler"", funnier, more independent than women. Whereas women are: emotional and caring, Thats it.(and fast, i guess)

i'm gonna be blunt, those things are better then what women have, its more useful to society and would further it more then emotional and caring ever would. This world can care less if youre kind or caring, you need strength and power and women are taught/told they dont have/need that.

I WANT YOU to tell or show me that either neither gender is better than the other Or tell why i should be ok with this reality OR just tell me ONE just ONE other trait that is feminine and actual good/useful.(different from caring)

Now i dont care how, just please change my mind. I dont want to believe this anymore but i havent seen or heard anything otherwise; i only care because really this devaules and hurts women or the female image. 

* Be honest with yourself if people were allowed to pick genders at birth everyone would be male, why would you want to be the ""bad choice"".

EDIT: to explain what i meant by biology: the notion that men are stronger than women naturally. Which means naturally they have a point on whos ""better""

And also please source everything you say, i do wanna look into things.

for those who are asking: i care because these thought do affect society; how we vote, who we trust, and culturally which gender you'd want as a kid: Many parents hate or dislike girls as they believe guys are easier. (I fully disagree with this one as its just baseless and already been disproven to me)

EDIT 2: for thoses asking + indirectly asking: Many if not near all women traits can be put into these groups: negative (manipultive or cunning), not useful:(artsy) or just eh(not truly better or super worse): [they can give birth :)]

EDIT 3: thank you to those who are actually just answering/changing my veiw and not just going ""just dont believe those thing lol"" it means alot! :) you all really did change my veiw on things

EDIT 4 (HOPEFULLY MY LAST): i cannot believe i have to add this BUT if youre going to say ""sure there are plenty of good things about being a women"" you have to actually LIST THEM do not just say that and then fall off the face of the earth, you wont be taken seriously..."

Now, I believe that the narrative you tell about your experience/credentials, and to whom you tell it, has far more of an effect.

This is the basis for marketing/advertising -- finding the people that value something more, and telling them the right story to capture the highest value possible.

For instance, you may have heard the story of the father who gives his son a watch and tells him to go to the pawn shop and ask them to give a valuation (the pawn shop tells the boy they’ll give him $50 for the watch). Then, the father says to go to a watch shop (where they offer $500), then the father tells the son to go to a luxury watch dealer/collector, who realizes that the watch is actually a rare antique that’s almost priceless.

In this example, polishing the watch or doing some minor repairs may have increased the value for the pawn shop a few bucks, but a far larger increase in value comes from going to the right person with the right narrative.

Similarly, I think working on credentials/experience has \*some\* small effect on opportunities/salary, but I think a much larger effect comes from changing the narrative people tell about you/me, and making sure the right people hear that narrative."
21,2022-08-01,CMV: Deshaun Watson's suspension is about right,u/Twofingersthreerocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wdlqtg/cmv_deshaun_watsons_suspension_is_about_right/,changemyview,"For those who don't know: Deshaun Watson is a (good, highly paid) player in the NFL who has been accused of sexual assault by over 20 women. Watson has settled with nearly all of the accusers. A former federal judge (Sue Robinson) was appointed by the NFL and the players' union to review the cases and render discipline. She issued Watson a 6 game suspension.

The reaction to this suspension has been outrage. Journalists calling the suspension a slap on the wrist. Comparisons are made to players caught gambling, taking PEDs or making dangerous plays on the field who have received harsher suspensions (including full year+).

Is it fair for us to judge someone based on an accusation? No. Should that change if many people accuse that individual of the same thing? I still don't think so. While multiple accusers might increase the likelihood of guilt, it does not mean there is guilt. The burden of proof must still be addressed by the accuser(s). So I believe that if we start with the premise that Watson is innocent, has just associated with 25 unscrupulous women, and take each accusation individually... The suspension is probably close to right.

To note.. I am not writing this in defense of Watson (the man's probably guilty of all accusations), but more on how I am trying to reconcile this suspension within our system of justice. 

How off am I?"
5,2022-08-01,"CMV: In public men's and coed restrooms, it is better to leave the toilet seat up.",u/Saxper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wdlvaz/cmv_in_public_mens_and_coed_restrooms_it_is/,changemyview,"In public men’s, gender neutral, and coed restrooms, I believe it is better to leave the toilet seat in the up position by default.

My reasoning is based around cleanliness. Let’s face it, there are many people who, for whatever reason, are going to pee on the seat. Most of those people are men, though some women can and will do it too. We can reduce the likelihood of leaving a dirty, wet seat for the next person by leaving the seat up by default. That way, a person must actively choose to put the seat down in order to sit on it, and for most of the time the top of the seat is out of the main splash zone.

Why does this not extend to women’s restrooms? Because women sit down most of the time to use the toilet, meaning leaving the seat up doesn’t end up providing any real benefit. 

Why does this only apply to public restrooms? In private settings, a person familiar with their own restroom may expect the toilet seat to be down and sit without looking. That’s not an issue in public restrooms. Additionally, for private restrooms if someone pees on the seat there is a decent expectation that the culprit can be identified and dealt with. It’s ultimately up to the toilet’s owner to decide how they’d like their seat configured in these situations."

Every single one of the Judas Priest band members was on top form for this song and I don't think anyone could match the effort put into it

The guitar work of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton is phenomenal. Those guitar solos, having to change notes very rapidly to keep up with the song and making it unique 

Ian Hill's bass is on point with everything. Without the bass, you don't have the rhythm. Hill's timing was impeccable and kept everyone in line

Rob Halford's singing. Some of the best singing I've ever heard on a metal song. The way he glides between the notes and how, for most of the song, he keeps a high voice pitch throughout the song and yet still has enough energy to pull off that 20 second note hold right at the end

Scott Travis' drumming. I don't think I've ever heard better drums on a song, let alone metal. What a way to introduce yourself. The amount of talent, discipline and how fast you have to be and the technical skill you'd have to have to do what Travis did with the drumming in Painkiller is almost impossible for all but a few word class drummers

With all of these factors coming into play and the fact that Priest were on the decline at the time, this has to be the greatest and best example of a metal song ever put together and heard

Probably most of what I said will not have done justice for what they did for this song

Someone with a bachelor's degree would get the two years. And then; they get a masters of divinity degree which includes Latin, Greek, Systematic theology, Moral theology, Church History, Biblical Studies. Often times, students would choose to do a thesis statement as well.

The top of the list students would often be sent by their bishop to do studies in whatever they need to do like for example, theology, canon law, philosophy, a Bishop in the US got a Masters in Social Work from Columbia, the new Cardinal from the US that Pope Francis appointed, has a PHD in Political Science from Stanford.

And of course the Jesuits are the most brainy group of all. Doctorates in Chemistry, English, you name it.

It’s like passing your pain onto someone else in hopes of feeling better. And yes that person may have been hurting for years before committing suicide. But it’s up to them to seek help. And it’s not that easy but everyone has their own problems if a suicidal person doesn’t go out of their way to seek the help they need then they can’t expect people to notice their “hints” and blame the person for not noticing like the world doesn’t revolve around that person. So they can’t expect someone to notice then guilt the person for not noticing after they kill themselves. I know it’s harsh for some people but it needs to be said."

And I admit it has cult-like elements. Sure it is not like Waren Jeff\`s FLDS (a true cult) but it has certain cult clements.

At the same time, Islam has more of these cult elements; but no one calls it a cult. Keep in mind I am referring to mainstream Islam, not Taliban, etc.

Here are some characteristics of a cult

**Reverance to a leader**

* Well both faiths revere God. But the leader here is their founding prophet. Mormons reverse Joseph Smith, but Muslims almost worship Muhammed by attesting to his prophethood in prayers, adding a title to his name, etc.
* While Muslims do not have a living prophet, Mormons do so in this area I would say Mormons are more culty. On the other hand, they are not more uniquely culty than Catholics and their Pope

**Strict Rules**

* Both religions are strict, but Islam is stricter.
* **Diet:** Both prohibit alcohol. Mormons prohibit tea and coffe which is strict. But then Muslims prohibit pork, and require meat to be blessed and slaughtered in a certain way which is strict and also seems to lack basis (ie cult)
* **Sex:** I mean, both follow conservative ethics. No different from any other religion - no sex outside marriage, no LGBTQ, etc.. However, with mosques and many muslim gatherins being gender segreated, in a way no other faith is, I\`d argue Islam is more culty. Also Islam still allows polygamy while Mormonism abolished it 100 years ago.
* **Dress:** Mormons dress conservatively yes. But I mean nothing is as bad as the hijab.
* **Conformity:** I mean Muslim women many are all dressed covered up, with a black robe. Can\`t tell one from the other.

**Moral Depravity of the founder:**

* Muhammed married a 6-year old and raped a 9 year old at 56. Smith married a 15 year old at 38. Both are wrong but one is a lot worse, incomprably so.
* Muhammed broke his own rules by having 9 wives. Smith did not break his own rules, sure he had like 30 wives but everyone was allowed that. Specifial privilges for leader --&gt; cult

**Gaslighting**

* Both have plenty of that. Mormons about thier past actions re: Black Men and the priesthood. Muslims about Muhammed\`s actions

**Difficulty of exiting**

* Both faiths it is extremely hard to leave. r/exmuslim and r/ExMormon both attest to this. You get shunned, disowned, gaslit, fear coming out, parents break down if you leave, etc.
* But in Islam, it is a lot harder simply because in Muslim majority countries apostates are killed ( [Apostasy laws world map - Apostasy in Islam - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam#/media/File:Apostasy_laws_world_map.svg) ) and many Muslims today maintain this belief ( [Muslim beliefs on death penalty for leaving Islam (Pew Research Center 2013) - Apostasy in Islam - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam#/media/File:Muslim_beliefs_on_death_penalty_for_leaving_Islam_(Pew_Research_Center_2013).svg) ). Not taliban or ISIS, just mainstream muslim nations

&amp;#x200B;

While both religions are strict and hard to leave, I see Islam as more of a cult because of the death penalty on Muslims leaving and the very strict laws in Islam when it comes to gender, etc."

There is nothing wrong with any US Speaker of the House visiting a foreign country on a diplomatic mission. Or for the legislative head of ANY government making a peaceful diplomatic visit to ANY place on Earth. The only one guilty of ""inciting tension"" over it is China. No one in the US is threatening China with military action. Only China is threatening outright violent hostility over this ""incident.""

Now, before you bring up all the times the US or other western democracies HAVE been hostile or aggressive, I fully acknowledge that has happened at many points in history. I was 100 percent opposed to the invasion of Iraq because it was unprovoked, unjustified and unnecessary military action against another sovereign nation that was not threatening military action against anyone else. Any nation who opposed it would have been right to do so. And any nation sending a diplomatic mission to Iraq in the run up to war would have been perfectly in the right.

But in the current situation, if any violence happens China will be 100 percent at fault. Or 99.999 percent since I don't like absolutes. For more than 70 years Taiwan has been a de facto independent nation. They do not wish to submit themselves to the Chinese communist party. They don't have to. China's desire to force them to do is an act of blatant imperialistic aggression. Opposing that is a GOOD thing. In the 21st century it should be unthinkable for ANY modern, civilized nation that cares about the survival of the human species (not to mention other species) to consider invading, subjugating and annexing any new territory. The weapons of modern war are too dangerous to be unleashed in full scale war and full scale war is what it takes to accomplish such a goal.

Taiwan is not threatening to invade China. Nor is the US. Or anyone else. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine is the fault of Putin and Putin alone--and those Russians who empowered him and submit to him willingly and knowingly. He violated the 1991 agreement that guaranteed Ukrainian independence. He invaded a sovereign nation with the goal of annexing its territory and originally with the goal of replacing a legitimately elected sovereign government. Tens of thousands have already died for a 19th century geopolitical goal. The US and other western nations are right to resist such an action. It is unthinkable in the 21st century to simply allow such things to occur. 

And while the Iraq war was morally egregious, it at least did not have the goal of making Iraq into US territory as Russia and China seem to have now. The only real comparison would be if the USA were considering invading Mexico or Canada and annexing some or all of their territory. That was bad enough in the 19th century. It should be completely unthinkable in the 21st.

Now the reason I want to allow my view to be changed is that I am usually more of a ""dove"" than a ""hawk"" on foreign policy. But I realize when I see authoritarian leaders seeking to impose their will on smaller neighbors, that seems to change. I'm not a pacifist. I think the one justifiable use of force is to DEFEND against the use of force by others. I feel that the US entrance into Korea was justified as defense of a country that didn't want to be invaded and conquered. Vietnam was unjustified--it was a civil war and none of our business. First Gulf War possibly justified in that the limited goal was liberating Kuwait (yes, I get there were motives of oil that were probably more important). Second Gulf war not justified at all.

There is no defense of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and there would be no justification of China invading Taiwan, especially not over a foreign legislator simply choosing to VISIT the country. If we were placing offensive missiles there and threatening to wipe Beijing off the face of the planet that would be another matter.

China's reaction right now looks like the petulant temper tantrum of a three year old. No one, and I mean no one, ever, will ever invade Russia or China. They are huge nations with large militaries and nuclear weapons. There is no reason for either to feel threatened by the US, NATO or anyone else. The only ""threat"" is that those democratic nations will not submit to authoritarian rule. That's a good thing.

No one should curtail speech or peaceful protest against China or Russia. Peaceful actions are NEVER a justification for physical violence.

Change my view? Is there something I'm missing here?"

The thing that bothers me is that if you sub to any topic you like, most of the time you'll be inundated with people hating on that subject. I'm a teacher right now, and [r/teachers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teachers/) is mostly comprised of teachers who hate teaching and what to quit. At least they're the most vocal ones. I was in the Peace Corps, which while problematic for many reasons, was still a life changing experience. Many people who follow [r/peacecorps](https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/) and [r/teachforamerica](https://www.reddit.com/r/teachforamerica/) are people who have nothing to do with those organizations, and are there specifically to attack people. Some criticism of these is fine and even good, but when it's monitored by a little gang of sad detractors, it's exhausting. [r/zen](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/) has been monopolized by a bizarre group of cultish weirdos, so much so that people with actual knowledge of zen have all congregated in the much less popular [r/zenbuddhism](https://www.reddit.com/r/zenbuddhism/). [r/punk](https://www.reddit.com/r/punk/) is notorious for its obnoxious, gatekeeping teens.

When I was younger, I have to admit, I spent some time posting on 4chan. There you have to grow a little bit of a thick skin because of all the bigotry. However, in my experience Reddit is often worse, because here there are people who make it their online career to obsessively hate whatever their decided topics are. People get oddly intolerant and militant about positions on the most trivial things, from philosophies to old TV shows. Sometimes it can affect the enthusiasm for something you like or are exploring, if only temporarily, when someone deranged decides to attack anyone who disagrees with them on that subject.

I'm back because it can sometimes be interesting to see what people have to say about niche topics. But the negatives are so extreme that I keep on bailing."

6,2022-08-02,CMV: I’m not ungrateful or spoiled for saying I prefer regular/basic meals over the 5star meals my dad used to make.,u/BadArtistTime,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/we2lhr/cmv_im_not_ungrateful_or_spoiled_for_saying_i/,changemyview,"My parents would cook average stuff (spaghetti, burgers/hot dogs, steaks, chilli, stew/soup, chicken cordon bleu, etc) but once they split, my dad started cooking me more “fancy” meals. He also fell to the lower end of the middle class (at one point we relied on a local food bank but he wasn’t doing fancy cooking at that point).

Both of my parents are good cooks, but my dad is like an American Gordon Ramsey. People would ask him to cater for events because they liked his cooking so much. He was always trying new things and experimenting (though he seemed like he’d done it a million times before). Instead of making me basic spaghetti and meat sauce, he’d add a bunch of different things and make it seem like it came out of a 5 star restaurant. He’d spend hours in the kitchen prepping steaks/ribs/brisket/whatever. We often wouldn’t even eat till around midnight, and it didn’t help that he’d start cooking late as well.

Don’t get me wrong, the food tastes amazing and I prefer his cooking over any one else’s, but at the end of the day, and I mean *end of the day*, I just wanted to eat my dinner and have time to relax. Sometimes he’d make me take pics (his phone camera was broken) of the food so he could post it on FB. “I don’t like that one, take another. Angle it differently. Fix the lighting.” I’m not a damn photographer.

I’ve gotten in multiple arguments with my dad over this. We also argued about how he’d go grocery shopping and buy things he thought I liked, and then he’d get mad when I wouldn’t eat it. “But you asked me to get it!” Yeah, I asked **five grocery runs ago** and you said no. And the excuse of him wanting to surprise me with it later or changing his mind won’t work because I would specifically tell him that I only wanted it in that instance because I was craving it. Or I wouldn’t even ask for it and he’d buy it anyways assuming I wanted it. For a while he kept buying deli meats/cheeses and get mad when I didn’t eat them. “But you liked it at the old house!” Yep, because that was before I had to take ham &amp; cheese to school every single day for 3mo bc we were too broke to afford school lunch and we didn’t cook enough food to have leftovers for my lunches AND later dinners.

I came to this sub because when I told this to my coworker, I received a blank stare for a few seconds before a “You know that’s extremely privileged of you to say that. You sound spoiled and unappreciative.”


TLDR; My dad is extra when he cooks and bought groceries he claimed I liked and got mad when I didn’t eat it. Coworker called me ungrateful and spoiled for it. CMV by telling me how I’m ungrateful for this other than “but he cooked and paid for things.”


Edit: This is all YEARS ago. Thus the past tense. My coworker and I were talking about our childhoods and I mentioned how I ~~liked~~ **preferred** simple meals over what my dad chose to cook. Never said I didn’t like my dad’s cooking though."
0,2022-08-02,CMV: Breaking Bad is Just an Ok Show,u/WaffleCakeKitty,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/we3ef5/cmv_breaking_bad_is_just_an_ok_show/,changemyview,"I don't think it's a bad show. I just find it to be massively overhyped and the community around it to be...problematic. I didn't watch it back when it first aired. I'm watching it now because I've been watching Better Call Saul, which I thoroughly enjoy actually. And I suspect the ultimate reason why I enjoy it more is it gives screen time to all the characters in Breaking Bad I actually like.

So, I think my main issue with my enjoyment of the show is the two leads. I find them both extremely unlikeable, and while I understand that is the show's intent, I just don't feel the chemistry between them. I don't feel they bounce off each other well. They do have a kind of interesting parallel as the unlikely pair: Walt is an asshole that becomes an even bigger monstrous asshole and further loses himself, and Jesse is just a guy that starts off as an bumbling idiot ripe for abuse, but ends up gaining ""wisdom"" as the series goes on. The thing is though, I really just don't get Walt's obsession with Jesse. I suppose the implication is that Walt feels Jesse is like his son or successor because for whatever reason he's disappointed in his actual son (yay ableism, I guess?), but I honestly feel that Jesse and Walt don't really have enough touching emotional moments to really make me feel the connection between the two. And I also understand the important aspect about Walt in that he tries to put up a front in that he makes decisions based on logic rather than emotion and is actually illogical just like Jesse, I still just can't find myself getting hooked to these characters or plot. Jesse and or Walt fuck something up, Walt is an asshole to Jesse about it, hijinks ensue to correct it. I don't dislike them because they are bad people and do bad things (I love Lalo!), I dislike them because personally I find them both obnoxious and overall just frustrating to watch, to the point where I'm not rooting for Walt's downfall, I'm just impatiently awaiting it. I would say the episode I actually began to feel something for the characters which is also the episode I enjoyed most/is my favorite was the fly episode, and that was written when the actual writers were on strike. 

Just so we're clear, I don't have a problem with Skyler. Don't really understand the massive hate she gets, if anything she puts up with way too much and I felt frustrated FOR her. But even though she is outspoken, which is great, I still somehow don't find her very interesting to watch. Hank and Marie are also in general, not very enjoyable to watch, just more unlikeable assholes that aren't even fun to hate and are just kind of there as this show doesn't really like to make the side characters interact with anyone other than Wessie. Another issue I have with the show is the portrayal of Mexico in general. It's portrayed as sort of a fantastical, mysterious place where drug dealers and cult-like people live rather than a normal place where regular people live. I don't think it's malicious, but still problematic.

Anyways, the things I appreciate about Breaking Bad is mainly the good acting, attention to detail and consistency, sometimes the interesting cinematography, and really interesting and fun side characters such as Gus, Huell, and Mike, Saul, and Tuco. That's about it."

So the Q is meaningless, since it's already mentioned, and that irritates me.

LGBT is so much more efficient and less stupid than LGBTQ. I mean unless your preference is writing out LGBTQPFKPoCNWP (lesbian gay bisexual trans queer pansexual furry kinky, people of color, non white people) and as long as you don't work for any editorials I read, then have at it. 

Also I never got why lesbians can't just fall under gay, categorically I mean they do, so that's stupid. 

We're at GBT now which we're not quite as used to, but it's better, efficiency wise.

Also bisexual people can have straight sex or homosexual sex, therefore they can be inclusive to just ""G"" like you don't really need to say ""straight and gay and bisexual"" to really include bi people, which, just being real here, pansexual works better, but it's not necessary. You have gay sex, and you're fighting for equality. If gay people had equal rights to straight people, bisexual people wouldn't miss out.

Now we're at GT, and we can stop using acronyms, gay and trans rights. It's even less efficient than LGBT, unless you just type GT, which isn't nearly as distinguished in news and social media, *because we made it that way*.

It's like everyone is in a rat race online and it's certainly damaging to me, considering my social status. I'm kinda poor and being sucked into a virtual reality is easier than trying to fix my life, so typically I procrastinate and become unable to do the things I want to do, in turn bringing me to this vicious cycle.

4,2022-08-02,CMV: In the event of a severe American economic collapse in the future: extreme deflation would be preferable to extreme hyperinflation,u/Fire-Watch,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/weda5x/cmv_in_the_event_of_a_severe_american_economic/,changemyview,"My prediction/opinion is that in the event of an american economic collapse, Great Depression (1929 collapse) style extreme deflation would be preferable to Weimar Germany (1923 collapse) style extreme hyperinflation.

1. Part of my thinking that the deflation scenerio would be less destructive to the american way of life:

In mass hyperinflation, the people generally loose all faith in their country's currency. In mass deflation, there is still faith in the currency despite things being worth almost nothing. My grandparents memoir describes their living through the great depression and at one point they had to sell their house for 44 cents (no joke, thats what their memoir says) and went to live in the shed in the backyard. If they had lived through Weimar Germany's hyperinflation, they wouldn't have bothered with trying to sell their house (would have been impossible for them to anyways... how many wheelbarrels of reichmarks would the buyer have had to bring to buy their house?). My grandparents still had faith in the US Dollar even during the deflation of the great depression... people in Germany were litterally burning reichmarks to heat their homes. My grandparents could still at least use Us Currency to buy and sell... In weimar germany they largely resorted to bartering. The economy seems to at least somewhat still function with deflation.

2. Another part of my reasoning that deflation would be preferable is that i fear history would be more likely to repeat itself with hyperinflation:

In weimar germany, the economic collapse helped allow a certain evil man with the mustache to take advantage of how hard things were to help him seize power. He even meationed in a famous speech at one point about how it took entire wheelbarrows of reichmarks to even buy a single loaf of bread. I think that extreme hyperinflation in america could help allow history to repeat itself in a similarly horrible way allowing possibly a future oppressive regime to seize power. I cant speculate on exactly what that could look like (hitler 2.0?!), but I think that a hyperinflation sceniario could quite possibly make it much more likely. I think the american way of life could still march onward with mass deflation but with mass hyperinflation... regime change unfortunately seems more likely in the hyperinflation scenario.

3. The third part of my thinking is that hyperinflation would be overall more destructive to the US economy:

In the deflation scenario everything loses most of its value (which is worse for sellers than buyers) but in the hyperinflation scenario everything costs too much for anyone to be able to purchase anything at all (which is extremely bad for both buyers and sellers). Both collapse scenerios seem like they'd be very bad for the economy but to me the deflation scenerio seems like it would be at least somewhat less bad overall.

Also, i recognize that there are people on both sides of this, on which scenario would be worse. It may or may not undermine my view a little bit but: some would argue that two of the hyperinflation scenarios of the past only happened because of uncommon circumstances. Some argue that weimar germany was only in its incredibly precarious/unusual economic position because its administration's predesessors had tried to take over the world in WW1. And in the case of zimbabwe: some say that their uncommon situation only occured (and is still somewhat occuring) because they were hit as a country by a reasource shock. But then again couldn't this country conceivably be hit by a reasource shock and thereby throw us into hyperinflation?

Hard to predict the future sometimes and i suppose it is best for us to hope as a nation that neither of these situations happen anytime soon."
3,2022-08-02,"CMV: the ultimate purpose of any society with nuclear weapons must be securing, maintaining and eventually decommissioning them. Nearly everything else has to be in service to this goal.",u/neat-stuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wedkj1/cmv_the_ultimate_purpose_of_any_society_with/,changemyview,"Let me start by clarifying that I don't think *any* of this is a good thing, and I'm not any kind of scientist or engineer myself. But since 1949, most societal or economic discussions seem pretty superfluous compared to the issue of nuclear weapons. Without going on and on about the destructive power, etc., let me start by saying it's fundamentally true now that the decisions of one or two people can immediately kill everyone everywhere. And that once we've gotten to this stage, we can never go back. Nobody will ever get rid of nuclear weapons. Why would they? Surely someone else would keep them in secret. But it's worse than that: we can't really even get sloppy with them.

It's like we've chained ourselves to this terrible task that we cannot stop for even a moment, and now this reality has faded into abstract, distant memory as most people barely consider it. While we may not think about it much, on a purely a practical level the importance of things like education, human rights, and quality of life really comes down to how many physicists a society can produce. Democracy's other qualities seem sadly inconsequential next to the fact that scientists and engineers want to live in one. Equity and access for women, people of colour and other marginalized groups is wonderful... because it means more mathematicians and chemists. Let me stress that *this is a shame*. These things are also morally righteous, but that's rendered almost irrelevant by this grim priority. The cost of backsliding for a nuclear power is simply too massive. We need to continue to create an environment where educated people have access to the resources they need to keep holding the tiger by the ears. Every economic/political/social paradigm, whether right or left, must accommodate this.

It's one of the key reasons why the west should never wish total calamity on states like Russia or China (economic and humane impacts aside). And why it's so terrifying to see anything other than sober, evidence-based governance from any of the powers.   


TL;DR: When we hope for human progress or advancement, we're really doing it for the nukes. Everything else is just gravy."

2416,2022-08-02,"CMV: If you believe there should be a minimum income to adopt children, you should also believe that there should be a minimum income to have biological children.",u/Pangolinsftw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/weic3u/cmv_if_you_believe_there_should_be_a_minimum/,changemyview,"I know this is a confusing topic because we have a special connotation for people who have biological children. They're *their* children. But I think the logical inconsistency here is too glaring to ignore: we require people be above the poverty line in order to adopt children...

&gt;According to the USCIS, **adoptive parents must have a household income equal to or higher than 125% of the US poverty level** for your household size. Your household size includes you, your dependents, any relatives living with you, and the child you wish to adopt.

No such requirement exists for biological parents. But we have this requirement for adoptive parents. Is it because we acknowledge that if you can't take care of yourself and can't earn an income, you shouldn't be raising kids? Yes, right? So to me it's very strange that nobody bats an eye when this is the case with people who have biological children.

I understand that the alternative is draconian and troubling to think about - but we have CPS for a reason, right? If a child is in an unsafe environment and situation, CPS will take them away. But for adults who have their own biological children despite having no income and no prospect of having an income, they're just given money by the government through welfare/WIC/SNAP/etc. So this creates a perverse incentive for otherwise non-productive members of society to have children in order to live a viable life.

So what's to be done about this? I don't know, but at least in sort of philosophical terms, you should acknowledge the stark cognitive dissonance between believing that penniless people should be allowed to have biological children while also agreeing that adoptive parents should have a minimum income.

For at least some of the people who are only able to care for their children thanks to social programs, if not for these welfare-based income streams, wouldn't their child be in an unsafe situation and therefore be taken away by CPS?

I don't know, I feel conflicted about this topic. On the one hand, I guess if you're an adequate parent even if you're reliant on unearned income, having kids is...*okay?* But on the other hand, if this system fell apart or was otherwise discontinued, many of these kids would be taken away by CPS which would then burden the system even more. If for some reason this massive social support system for penniless parents vanished, it's likely that the government wouldn't have the funds to support these kids through other means. That would result in widespread death and suffering of these kids, or if not, it would come at the expense of some other group who would then experience suffering and death.

It's a house of cards system which is reliant on taxes from the very wealthy ([the top 20% are responsible for 80% of income tax revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/61percent-of-americans-paid-no-federal-income-taxes-in-2020-tax-policy-center-says.html)) in order to support parents who would otherwise be deemed unfit. It's just a very strange system and I don't think it's sustainable or organic in any way.

And not to mention the fact that for these parents who are reliant on welfare to raise their children, these children are still in environments of poverty, which is well-documented to have adverse effects on children who grow up and live in those environments - these children will often grow up and be non-contributing members of society or even actively hurt society. One might even argue that this welfare system of enabling otherwise unfit parents is a big reason why we have so much crime/violence/drug addiction in many parts of the country.

0,2022-08-02,CMV: It’s ok to let your pet get fat,u/bdvbekiejns,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/weicky/cmv_its_ok_to_let_your_pet_get_fat/,changemyview,"*First, a disclaimer, I’ve never had an obese or overweight pet because I’ve mostly had cats that were picky eaters and if anything needed to put on weight. So if you think this is animal abuse, rest assured that I’m not doing this to any pets. I really love animals and I’d research this thoroughly before I let an animal get obese. This is just my opinion for now.*

However… I know that a lot of people think that it’s unethical to let pets get fat. I see why it’s unethical if a dog is so severely obese that it can’t walk and its joints hurt too bad to move, because it would then have a horrible quality of life. So I’m not talking about severely obese pets. 

But in cases where the pet is moderately overweight to mildly obese and might have some health effects (like a few years shorter lifespan), why is this unethical? That pet wants to eat a lot. I would probably be obese too if I didn’t care about how I look, and I only care about that because I’m a human.

11,2022-08-02,CMV: Lack of children and an increasing number of elderly citizens is the single largest threat to western democracy,u/TheGoldenHordeee,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/weipp9/cmv_lack_of_children_and_an_increasing_number_of/,changemyview,"So as most people are aware, pretty much every country in the western world has an increasingly large percentage of elderly citizens, due to better living conditions increasing lifespan and the post-ww2 baby boom. Meanwhile the number of newborn babies is far below the number required for a sustainable population, because young adults, frankly, aren't willing to become parents.

My belief and fear is, that this will come back in many different ways to bite our collective society in the ass in a few decades, and that the inherent model of democracy prevents these issues from being fixed.

See, one of the reasons why baby boomers have had so much luck in accumulating wealth and success, is strength in numbers. At every stage in their life they had the numbers to vote for changes that benefited them, because they've pretty much always been the largest group in society. Education reform when they were young, laxer taxing when they were working and now better treatment for retirees now that they are old.

But current and future generations won't have that same advantage. Fixing decaying education systems, or keeping power hungry companies in check cannot be done, when the older citizens benefitting from those systems can outvote the younger through numbers. 

Adding to that problem, as the number of elderlies increases, and the number of working citizens falls, suddenly taking care of elder citizens becomes downright impossible for the state, because we don't have enough workers to pay for housing, catering and healthcare for those who have retired and are a net drain on society. 

Babies and children are a net drain too. The difference is that investing in better treatment of retirees fixes nothing except for the lives of elderlies, as they are done working and die soon. Whereas children benefit from a better society for the rest of their lives, which in turn benefits from them.

It seems like a self-reinforcing circle. Elderlies vote and divert funds away from social services that benefits new families and children and unto better retiree treatment, which makes people want to have fewer kids, which over time increases the percentage of elderly citizens in contrast to younger people, which allows them to further benefit themselves... etc. etc.

 “A society grows great when old men plant trees **in whose shade they know they shall never sit**.” 

Except in a democracy, on average every demographic votes for what benefits themselves the most. And old men seek nok to plant new trees when they can just water those they already sit under for their twillight years instead, and leave the young out to dry."
27,2022-08-02,CMV: I think posting selfies / nudes for empowerment is pathetic and people should gain confidence from hard work and becoming valuable members of society,u/Nyx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/weixrx/cmv_i_think_posting_selfies_nudes_for_empowerment/,changemyview,"First off I'd like to preface in saying I'd really rather not think this way, I'm friends with some great girls that have large followings on social media, but I can't help but feel totally disgusted with these actions at times. I understand that these girls lack confidence (their words not mine) and these methods to boost it but they often make them even more manic in the long run.

I've had very strong issues with my personal image, from being chubby, to having cystic acne, to having an underdeveloped jaw and hooked nose. But my reaction to these problems is to spend the effort to directly fix them, to work out, get on Accutane, and get major orthodontic surgery. Further more I've spent thousands of hours practicing music, illustrating, and working on a degree in Math and Physics, these are the things that really make me a confident person.

More so it furthers the negative stereotype that women don't do anything of value and focus on surface level appreciation, why do they go for cheap likes when I as a man actually had to put effort into my work to gain respect? It feels demeaning to the work I've put in to better myself, but also hating on girls like this makes me feel like a shitty vile person.

Edit: I'm talking about girls posting sexually explicit images not just looking pretty sorry I should have made that more clear"

0,2022-08-02,CMV: We should get rid of most language-specific build and package management systems.,u/RationallyDense,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wek7tg/cmv_we_should_get_rid_of_most_languagespecific/,changemyview,"A lot of more modern programming languages come with build and package management systems. I'm thinking for instance of Stack and Cabal for Haskell, Cargo for Rust, gopkg for Go, pip for Python, Maven for Java, etc, etc... All of those can make things a bit easier if you're working exclusively in that language. However, the downsides outweigh that minor upside.

1. It requires learning a whole bunch of packaging and build systems which takes up time and energy better spent on other stuff. They all come with their own manifests, ways to declare dependencies, tools to download and install, preferred/mandated repository layout and other weird quirks.

2. It makes some best practices much harder. For instance, I really value hermetic builds to the extent possible. Making your build hermetic is always hard. But figuring out how to make it happen in each of these build systems means I'm signing up for more pain and suffering every time I want to use a new language. How can I make sure Stack won't download a package I don't know about as part of my build or use a package installed on my system? I dunno, I guess I'll just have to figure that out. Then repeat for Cargo, Cabal, go, etc, etc...

3. They really don't play nice with other languages. To me, this is the main issue. Projects I work on mix languages very frequently. It might be foreign function calls, or it might be different programs using different languages. And if you have code-generation tools in the mix, forget about it. There is often no easy way to express dependencies on the output of other build tools.

Now, a reasonable rebuttal might be: ""If you don't like it, don't use it. Go write Makefiles or whatever it is you dinosaurs love."" And that's not entirely unreasonable. The problem is that those tools become The Way To Do Things (TM). It's what the docs talk about. It's what tutorials teach. It's what library maintainers assume you will do. And that makes stepping off that well-trodden path extremely painful, if not quasi-impossible.

We should drop all of the above. Instead, people should use general-purpose build systems. I have my own preferences, but that's not super important. The main advantage of those is that people frequently run into situations where they need to make them play nice with each other and so there is a lot of information out there on how to do that. Also, there are not that many of them. 

(None of the above applies to languages that are primarily meant for educational settings. A language like Racket for instance has the primary goal of getting all the annoying stuff out of the way so you can learn programming. It doesn't really matter if it doesn't play nice with other languages.)"

Further, it seems that these policies favor pretty much everyone except for white men.   Is that not the definition of a racist agenda?   Why should, say, a poor white 18 year old man who comes from a family where nobody has ever gone to college, have less of an advantage in the college admissions process than a wealthy black 18 year old, whose family consists of many college educated people, including doctors, engineers, etc?  I make this example, as university affirmative action policies would ensure that in a scenario such as this (if both students had a similar academic background, extracurricular record, etc.) that the black student would have an upper hand.   Further, in corporate America, it appears to be acceptable to create programs and policies that make it easier for basically anyone who is not a white man to get interviews, get hired, start diversity groups, etc.  However, no such programs, groups, or support exist for white men, regardless of their economic or family background.   Even suggesting to one’s employer, or to a group, that it is not fair that hiring decisions are being made on the basis of race or sex is likely to cause commotion in this day and age.  In an era where the United States is becoming increasingly diverse, and where in some areas white men are the minority, how is it still acceptable for these programs to exist which clearly are in place to benefit pretty much everyone but white males?  I believe these policies create division, and at their core are unfair."

For example, an individual who is caught with a few tabs of LSD shouldn't be given a felony. I personally believe this because of two main reasons.


1) We already have laws that include most destructive or violent acts that commonly are associated with drugs, i.e Driving under the influence, supplying minors, homicide and theft, etc. It makes no sense to prosecute someone simply because of the belief that doing drugs could POTENTIALLY lead to those acts.

2) Another reason I see is that it is potentially harmful/lethal to the individual to do those drugs. I don't disagree that current illegal drugs are harmful, but I also don't believe self harm is a criminal act. We can encourage individuals to seek help for their possible addictions, but we can't force them and slapping a criminal record on them wouldn't solve the problem to begin with.


With all that said, I still believe in prosecuting illegal manufacturers and distributors. If anything I feel as those every drug should be decriminalized and regulated in order to reduce the amount of potentially lethal batches of drugs that are made and distributed, reduce the black market on these drugs, and hold those who do so accountable."

I understand that the main objective of acquiring a manager is to find the person who will unify and organise a team to the best of their abilities and the person capable of that may not be of the same national origins as the team, but to me that kind of defeats the purpose of being an “international” tournament. Surely if you’re a respective Portuguese soccer manager, you would want to represent Portugal in a tournament even if you know another nation may be better overall for instance?

Especially men seem to do this and it has awful consequences for their offspring. The children have a much higher chance of being born disabled or being orphaned. 

But women aren't innocent either, there is an increasing number of women who choose to have babies after 50 and they are at higher risk of miscarrying which is dangerous to the baby as well.

A 73 year old woman recently gave birth to twins but tragically she is now raising them alone as her husband died at age 84. Those children will have to grow up without a father because of their parents' choices.

If you want to have children, you really should do so before you are 50 and preferably before you are 45. If you are old enough to reasonably be a grandparent then you're too old to have a baby."

I'm a progressive leftist who openly believes socialism is far superior to capitalism. But I'll also say I do believe this is an objectively evil stance.

In order to make that argument you must also then agree with the statement ""I believe poor people are undeserving of life"" and that's objectively evil. There's no way to spin ""minimum wage should not be livable"" that doesn't imply ""poor people deserve to die."" I've heard people say ""those jobs are for high schoolers, not adults!"" Ok, but I've been to Starbucks every day this week and if only high schoolers worked there I'd not have been able to get coffee 5/7 days (come August, currently it's summer).

But as well.... so you're saying poor high schoolers don't deserve to live?

Not everybody is born into the luxury of not needing to work in high school. Where I live, 24% of all homelessness is made of youths aged 24 and under. And 17% of all homelessness is children under 18. So they don't deserve to be able to comfortably afford the necessities of life?

There's literally no variation to being against a livable minimum that isn't saying you believe poor people should die and that's evil. That makes you an evil person for thinking that.

Suffice to say when you reply with an argument that the OP addressed without responding to the OP, I'm not going to have much faith in your ability to be informed

***Arguments against*** (Hopefully this will cut down on repeat comments)

***People don't vote because they don't care about politics***  
I wish I could say that this claim hasn't been made unilaterally so much because there are plenty of counter examples, but here we are. Other reasons people don't vote despite being informed: 

* government makes it difficult to vote, requiring it on a work day, with long lines, and in distant places
* people live in a place where the race is not competitive and thus their vote has little value to them (but neither does jury duty; it's just essential to functioning justice system anyway)

***People who don't vote aren't informed***  
See above reasons for why an informed person may still not find the cost of voting worth the personal value of voting. 

Also, people who vote aren't necessarily informed. Red or blue, look at own your opinions of the people protesting on the other side. Guaranteed those people are voters, but I would bet your rationale for the rioters on the other side are that they aren't informed, just manipulated (and the protesters on your side are awesome, of course).

***Don't tread on me***  
First off, no version of mandatory voting requires a person to provide an answer for every race. That would be dumb. Nobody is taking away your right to say ""no comment"". The point of mandatory voting is that neither you nor the government can completely ignore the full citizenship's role in the selection of representatives

Also, sorry folks. People have responsibilities and complaining about filling in some bubbles on a piece of paper is really pathetic. Jury duty is way more involved, and if you skip it, you can be fined or jailed. In Australia, you have the day off. The government guarantees that you have easy access whether you are elderly or disabled. Fulfilling it is as simple as showing up to get ticked off the voter roll without providing any responses at all. If you skip it, you can be fined, but it's easy to provide an excuse, and it takes poverty into account

***Arguments For***

***The government wants you to stay home***  
The government has an incentive to appeal to as few voters as possible, so it will try to keep you from voting by making it difficult to vote. This has played out in history with poll taxes, subjective exams, and of course straight banning women and black people. It continues to play out with gerrymandering, long lines and limited precinct locations, and scheduling elections at times when responsible people have responsibilities.

Mandatory voting keeps the government from blaming people for poor turnout. It keeps the government from claiming ""what the people want"" when only 66% of the electorate voted. The more people holding the government accountable, the more accountable it has to be

***The most enthusiastic people are biased***  
By definition, enthusiastic people do not vote at the same rate as the rest of the country. Being enthusiastic does not make a person informed or even conscionable. However, a portion of enthusiastic people have been made enthusiastic by manipulations of the media. Media with an agenda works to both stir up enthusiasm and bias voters. It is not likely that a person is unenthusiastic but still manipulated by media because that person is not consuming political media to the point of adopting its agenda.

And as stated above, people do not have to be uninformed in order to choose not to vote

***More people makes the result more accurate***  
Read the book ""Noise"" by Daniel Kahneman. There are two components of Error: Bias and Noise. Bias we are all aware of. It promotes extremist views and enables political warfare. Noise tends to average to an accurate answer. It's often referred to as The Wisdom Of The Crowds. Even the dumbest person in one direction, will be countered by the dumbest person in the other direction. And there are plenty of smart people in there too.

Our elections are biased by the self selection of enthusiasm. Much of the voting populace is biased in coordination with one political arm or the other. We need more independent voters.

Now, the child benefits system has a controversial problem: child benefits increase the birth rate among lower income levels, because it's quite literally giving an especific sum of money for people to have children, one can say this isn't really a problem and that it's really elitist to think that poor people having children is a problem, and I can completely see why someone would argue this, but I personally disagree with the thought of increased birth rates among lower income levels and less among higher income levels not being a problem, because if the families of the next generations are poorer than the previous generations, every problem associated with poverty will be increased in the next generations, including criminality and malnutrition for example, being poor and having a child isn't wrong and being a child from a poor family also isn't wrong, poor people have the ultimate right to have as many children as they wish, and if you are responsible with your children and treat them kindly, your family much better than the richest families in the world, but it would be better if the majority of children came from richer backgrounds, not poorer ones, because, besides the factors already cited, the poorest are exactly the ones who shouldn't receive incentives to have children in their current social status, that's because, in order to stop being poor, you have to work, invest in your career, education, save money, but children prevent all of that, which makes it more difficult for them to have a better standard of living, the richer are the ones who should be having more children as they already have a well-established career, it isn't about hating poor people, it's actually about making the rich ""pay their fair share"" in the birth rate matter.

But how do I think we should replace it? My ideal proposal is to just not replace it, completely voluntary child bearing is the ideal way for a society to increase birth rates, no financial incentives to have children, no use of force to make people have children, no accidental births, only births completely based on people love and desire to have children, but I believe people perceive more and more over the decades that taking care of children kinda sucks, because you are investing a whole lot of money and time without receiving anything in return, and we can't force people to think otherwhise as it's just basic logic, that's why, eventually, we will need to have an efficient system to encourage people to have children, perhaps we can hold down negative population growth for quite a while, and perhaps it even have temporary positive effects, but eventually the population will be so low that we will be forced to accept the creation of a system that encourages people to have birth, so, when that times comes, I believe that the most efficient system would be one who have a chance to be much more efficient at increasing fertility at a lower cost: a tax on childlessness among the well-off.

Before explaining the benefits, I'll clear a couple questions: Once the ones taxed have children, there's no need for them to be taxed anymore, perhaps 90% of the money taxed can be given back to them on a 21 year period, logically, adoptions should be included on the category of ""having a child"" and those who adopt should receive more money than those who don't, so 100% of the money back on a 21 year period, for genetic diversity reasons, I believe it's more effective if we don't tax an individual both times neither give them more money/less taxes if he adopts or creates 2 children, 1 child is just enough in the system I'm describing, the income tax rate of this system should be flat, I'm not sure what the perfect rate would be, but perhaps 10-20% could work well if we could cut other taxes as well, we should make so that both the rich families who invest and that work reproduce, we need both doctors/lawyers and entrepreneurs, thus, when I say ""well-off"", I mean a group of individuals with more than 100 thousand that may or may not be taxed depending on the circumstances, I would argue somewhere between 100.000 to 10.000.000 per year is a good line for ensuring both investors and rich workers like doctors and lawyers continue to reproduce, anyone who earns beyond that line don't necessarily need to be taxed, because if we taxed everyone from 100.000 to Elon Musk, we would just have too many children and an unnecessary number of investors, so, in order for the childlessness tax system to work, I don't believe we should tax every single rich person, we should just tax some of them and ensure there are both rich workers and rich entrepreneurs, that's it.

Now, with this explained, the main benefit of my system is it's proven effectiveness on the fertility matter, Soviet Union once tried a childlessness tax system, it's completely different from mine, as it was applied to everyone, but, even with these differences, it was actually working, birth rates were extremely high back then, but, when the Soviet Union fell, new Russia abolished the tax and tried to replace it with a child benefits system, soon after, birth rates fell steadily, showing a big difference in effectiveness of both policies, besides, it's basically the only policy I know that can encourage the rich to have more children, more rich children means both more rich workers and investors under the system I described, which means more investment, productivity, competition and innovation, and, as a means to have enough manual workers, we could put down restrictions on immigration, thus creating a much more efficient system both for the economy and the fertility situation of the United States."

Let's be real now.

Most recent example being Rockstar making a female protagonist for GTA 6. It's hard for me to believe people would be upset with that. They mostly think it's annoying how it's paraded as a move in the name of progress. Some of the most beloved characters in video games have been female, Samus Aran, Lara Croft, Bayonetta,  Jill Valentine, Faith. And also in games where you can pick your character or create your own, fighting games have a great range of female fighters, most MMO players prance about as chicks.

I'm pretty sure the backlash over protagonists being female/lgbt/poc is coming from the fact that the media and the developers are trying to pretend like they came up with this original idea.

Same goes for POC characters, Carl Johnson, Marcus Holloway, Lee Everett, Adéwalé, Rico Rodriguez, Vaas Montenegro (not the protagonist but he stole the spotlight in Far Cry 3).

Now LGBT characters are a bit more rare but that's pretty much because the sexuality of a character is not that important, but the way it balances out is through a bunch of games that let you have all kinds of relationships, Mass Effect lets you play as Shepherd however you want, be a dude and bang dudes, be a girl and bang girls, etc. etc. actually most Bioware games let you. I have not seen backlash about that, or even if backlash happens recently, nobody bashed Cyberpunk 2077 for LGBT representation for the exact same reason this post is made for.

It's the journalists assassinating the image of games by parading small details like they're a big deal, flooding forums and social media platforms with their attempts at virtue signaling. Shoving an agenda down people's throats, offering special treatment to groups that ask for equal treatment."

Making students pay for school lunch is exploitation of the students and their families.

Kids are required to go to school by law. (The age and number of years differs from state to state) So why should we be forced to pay for school lunches if we HAVE to be in attendance?

People are so quick to say “Well just pack your own lunch” or something along those lines. But that’s a rather privileged way of looking at this issue. Some students aren’t able to afford to bring their own lunches. Some do bring their lunches and are still hungry afterwards. 

While schools are required to provide free lunch to students who’s household income is at 130% or lower of the (federal) poverty line that only accounts for 4.7% of families according the the Census Bureau OR if the family is on food stamps which accounts for 25 Million families out of 123.6 Million recorded house holds. Families are only allowed to receive a price reduction is they are between 130% - 185% of the poverty line. Do you know how insulting that is? “You’re poor enough to get a price reduction but not enough to where it’s free”.

Why should we be forced to pay for shitty, undercooked, spoiled, moldy food?

And if a child can’t afford to buy or bring lunch do they just deserve to starve?

Either the state or school should provide free lunch to all of its students.

It’s like the expectation is for the average person to be poor and if they aren’t then they must be doing something illegal. If you get stopped by police and are deemed to have too much cash on you they can confiscate it until they verify it’s legitimate...I get the reasoning is to combat organized crime and money laundering but it does more to hurt the every day Joe than it does to deter some drug lord. If I already pay my taxes, have no criminal record or suspicious connections theres absolutely no reason that I should need to go through the extra hassle and declare over $10k for any reason. If I mess up a form or you decide my answers aren’t good enough now I’m out of that money. $10k isn’t at all a lot of money and this amount hasn’t been adjusted for inflations. This is maybe 3-4 months of expenses for a family of 4. Meanwhile El Chapo is sending money on submarines, trading Bitcoin and buying and selling “art” and “high end fashion”

The IRS has not adjusted with the times and it’s impacting the everyday person in a negative way. At the very least the $10k limit should be raised, otherwise in 5 years taking a months worth of living expenses out the bank is going to be major hassle

Edit: The best way to change my view would be to give a good reason on why the limit shouldn’t increase. $10000 in 2000 is not the same as $10000 in 2022."

While affirmative action has great intentions, allowing it to be based on any of the categories protected by law effectively creates a loophole in the various equal opportunity/civil rights acts that have been ratified over time and will ultimately increase systemic discrimination in the long run. Affirmative action as it is currently implemented creates a system that can easily be abused by officials in power. 

To fix this we should reevaluate what it is affirmative action is trying to accomplish. According to [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action):

&gt;Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.

Ultimately, affirmative action is trying to solve the issue of socioeconomic inequality. Income, economic class, and education level **are not** protected categories under law, yet these are the very things we are trying to solve with affirmative action.

You can find incredibly successful as well as impoverished persons in every classification of people under the EEOC protected categories.

Therefore, I believe that for affirmative action to be successful in what it’s trying to accomplish without any unintended consequences, it must be based purely on socioeconomic status and/or other metrics that are not protected under civil rights law.

**EDIT#1**: I should have clarified, my mistake.

In regards to educational institutions/universities/trade schools, I believe any form of affirmative action that is implemented should be based off things such as socioeconomic background and **not** minority affiliation (race, ethnicity, gender, etc.).

In regards to the workplace, I believe there should be no form of affirmative action at all. Employers should absolutely face repercussions for discrimination though. I absolutely support putting more systems in place to prevent discrimination, such as public audits of the hiring/promotion process. However, I don’t believe affirmative action is the way.

**EDIT#2**: Okay, hear me out..

Racism is why minorities are underprivileged, but race is not what makes them underprivileged.

Addressing their race by doing things like AA is reenforcing the notion that “you are a minority and therefore underprivileged and need help”, which some argue is harmful psychologically. It also creates animosity between different groups of people (i.e., X was hired for the job over Y because X has a less represented demographic, now X is mad and human psychology says X will blame the demographic of Y). This fosters things like racism and sexism on a fundamental level.

So, what makes some group of people less privileged than another group of people? Here are some examples:

* growing up in poverty
* not being able to afford education
* not having the time for education because you need to work 3 jobs just to sustain yourself
* getting rejected from a job due to lack of experience/education
* getting rejected from an apartment in a nice area because you have bad credit due to poverty
* being forced to live in a high crime area due to never having the means to afford a nicer home

In my opinion, these are the things we should be addressing. This addresses minorities, because [minorities disproportionately make up a majority of the population in poverty](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html). This also has the side effect of decreasing poverty, which is a huge problem."

Most times down votes are because someone doesn't want to hear the truth.

I signed up to Reddit because I liked visiting. I thought it would be a fun place to offer advice, share views with diverse audiences about hot topics that interested me, and gain connections. I love good mature conversations. I also like giving advice. I like hearing the viewpoints and experiences of others.

I've only been here 15 days posting randomly in different forums I'm interested in here and there, giving advice, etc. It hasn't been as fun as I thought. In fact I find the platform problematic. 

Not even 5 days in, I got a ton of down votes. This guy, a male teacher, made a post about one of his students wanting a class change because a girl student said he was making her uncomfortable and had been staring at her breasts. This guy's post said that he had no issues with the student before this. He didn't get in trouble. I wrote why this situation may have happened based on my own experiences. I didn't accuse the guy or anything. I didn't call him names. I later find my profile is negative after I couldn't make a comment in a community I liked to visit. I found that I  got down votes like crazy on that dumb post. The problem is reddit doesn't have the heart to alert these down votes or comments made. I get alerts about everything else. Now all of my posts are getting hidden. I can't make posts in certain communities. My posts are not showing up. All because of those assholes who didn't want to hear the truth. So my time here is doomed anyway. I can't post things, people can't see and I'm not seeing eye to eye with reddit and their politics. I already hate the idea of being policed.

I used to like getting information here but I'm torn because I have a problem with how this platform is operated. It highlights the biggest issues we face in society: group think, be a puppet, follow the crowd even though it's wrong, punish those who go against the grain. Take their voice away. Keep those at top there and silence the underdogs. 

I never believed in group think or the power hierarchy. Noone should run a platform this way. First, it's no fun. It's tyrannical, insane, problematic. I'm probably going to delete my account and go back to Reddit oblivion. I may settle with browsing for information I like or I may even delete the app entirely. 

I also feel this way about tik tok. I like seeing some information on there and I watch videos that friends share with me, but I hate how their platform is operated. It just feels wrong.

16,2022-08-03,CMV: Britain's pre-decimal currency system was actually pretty great,u/badass_panda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wfer6c/cmv_britains_predecimal_currency_system_was/,changemyview,"I recently watched a lindybeige video about UK's pre-decimalization currency system. As always, it was wildly informative and super fun, and it made me realize that I had no idea how that system worked, why it worked that way, and I why I thought it sucked.

At the moment, I think I was wrong to have doubted it, and I now think it was just about the best system for physical currency I've come across -- that is, for the purpose it was designed for, it was better than the American system.

**Goals for a currency system:**

1. Provide a stable store of value
2. Provide a consistent medium of exchange
3. While doing so, added points for:
   1. Being easy to account for in large quantities
   2. Being easy to use for day-to-day purposes

Now, I'm not here to argue that moving off of the gold standard wasn't a good thing, or that largely electronic currency isn't a positive and doesn't work better for our modern needs. What I want to talk about is this: I think if you lived in the type of economy the UK's currency system was designed for, it beat decimalized currency hands down.

**The factors at play:**

* The currency provides a stable store of value by directly linking its value to specific weights of silver and gold, which are finite.
* The currency provides a consistent medium of exchange by standardizing coinage to weight and material (you know how much precious metal is in each coin, so if any other coins show up from a foreign country, you have an exchange rate right there).
* With that in mind, accounting for large quantities of the currency is going to be more readily accomplished via weight (we don't measure grain in kernels, we count it in tons)
* For day-to-day purposes, you want it to be easy to divide, easy to add and multiply, easy to make change, etc ... you don't want to run into too many fractions, because you can't give someone a fraction of a coin in change.

**The UK system, briefly explained:**

* The currency was based on literal pounds of sterling silver (the 'pound' was 1 lb).
* Each pound was split into 240 pennies (ie, a penny was 1 / 240 of a lb of silver).
* From there, each major factor for a pound had its own coin, and any common fraction you could come up with came out to a round amount of change:

|Pennies|Fractions of a lb|Coinage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|1/240|Penny|
|2|1/120|Tuppence|
|3|1/80|Thruppence|
|6|1/40|Sixpence|
|12|1/20|Shilling|
|24|1/10|Florin|
|30|1/8|Half Crown|
|60|1/4|Crown|
|120|1/2|10S Note|

If this seems like a lot of names to keep track of, then forget the names and just call ‘x-pennies’… but I’ll point out, most Americans I know don’t have much trouble with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, fifty cent pieces, Washingtons, Lincolns, Hamiltons, Benjamins or “two-dollar bills”.

But versus the American system (and one grouped around 100 instead of 240), there's a lot of real-world issues that the British system alleviates:

* **It's all based on weight. Have a lot of loose change to count?** Stick the coins on a scale ... if it reads ""1.34 lbs"", then you've got  £ 1.34.
* **Want to figure out if your currency's been debased** (if it's been clipped or shaved or had less valuable metals snuck in)? Stick it on a scale ... if your crown doesn't weigh 1/4 lb, it's been debased.
* **Want to convert your coin for someone else's coin?** OK, if their pile of foreign coinage is 1/10 of a lb of silver, give them a florin.
* **Want to split the bill three ways?** well, because the UK system is based around [highly composite numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number), it's easier to split any of the above units. (Highly composite numbers are numbers that have more divisors than any lower number). Let's try it out, head to head vs. the US system:
   * A nickel is 5/100 of a dollar. Split that three ways? Nope
   * A dime is 10/100 of a dollar. Split that three ways? Nope
   * A quarter is 25/100 of a dollar. Split that three ways? Nope
   * A half-dollar, a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars, 20 dollars, 50 dollars, 100 dollars ... nopety nope.
   * Whereas, in the UK system...
      * Thruppence? A penny each. Sixpence? Two each, a shilling? Four apiece.
      * A florin? Sixpence + tuppence apiece. Half a crown? Ten pennies
      * A crown? 20 pennies (or a shilling, sixpence and tuppence if you're feeling like saving on counting).
      * A pound? A crown, a shilling and eight pennies.
* Want to make it easy to give exact change **with as few coins as possible?** Look at this comparison!

|Split  £ / $ in x fractions|Minimal change ($)|Minimal change (£)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1/2|(2) 2 quarters|(2) Two 10s notes|
|1/3|(na): Quarter | Nickel | 3 pennies | 1 infinitely recurring fraction|(4) Crown | shilling | sixpence | tuppence|
|1/4|(1) Quarter|(1) Crown|
|1/5|(2) 2 Dimes|(2) 2 Florins|
|1/6|(na) 3 Nickels | Penny | fraction|(4) Florin | Shilling | Thruppence | Penny|
|1/7|(na) 2 Nickels | 4 pennies | fraction|(na) Florin | Sixpence | Thruppence | Penny | fraction|
|1/8|(na) 1 Dime | 2 pennies | half a penny (can't do it)|(1) Half Crown|
|1/9|(na) Dime | Penny | fraction|(na) Florin | Tuppence | fraction|
|1/10|(1) Dime|(1) Florin|
|1/11|(na) Nickel | 4 pennies | fraction|(na) Shilling | Sixpence | Thruppence | fraction|
|1/12|(na) Nickel | 3 Pennies | fraction|(3) Shilling | Sixpence | Tuppence|

* With dollars, you 7 instances where you can't make exact change (vs 3 for the UK version)
   * When the dollar *can* make exact change, it's coin ratio is 1.5 coins per change. Exactly the same as the pre-decimal pound system (for the same fractions... 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, 1/10). 
   * If you assume folks'll eat the infinitely recurring fraction (""Steve gets an extra penny"") or whatever, then:
      * In those instances the dollar gives you 5.1 coins in change on average
      * And the UK system gives you 3.4 coins in change, on average... that's 33% better!

OK, this has run VERY long, so I'll wind it up here ... anyway, to change my view, lay out for me:

* A compelling everyday situation where you're using physical coinage, and benefit from decimalization rather than easy fractionalization.
* A scenario in which there is some other significant use case that makes it being easier to get / give exact change irrelevant (that involves *physical currency*).

**What won't work (because it's not relevant to the** ***purpose*** **of the old system):**

* I recognize we don't really need to deal with coinage much anymore, because inflation has rendered sub-dollar / sub-pound amounts only nominally meaningful. 
* I recognize that digital currency is even easier... type in an amount and hit send! And I recognize decimalization is easier in that context.
* I recognize that conversion to precious metals isn't relevant anymore, because we're cool with fiat currency and don't need to back it with precious metals."

pretty much everything in your life is determined things out of your control, genetics and environment. e.g. intelligence, looks, personality, interests, knowledge, ""street smarts"" etc.

Every single bit of adversity they face is largely self inflicted or easily squashed they build up charecters just to have them randomly taken out or written off off screen. Instead of giving Tony a rival or someone who could give him any real conflict they give him Mathew Balivique or Jackie Jr people who are immidietly run over. People like Furio are written off off screen plot threads many times over go no where like the russian mafia that came up constantly and never went any where.

Gandolfini gave an incredible performance but Tony has no reason to be respected other then just inheriting the spot. He gets his ass kicked, he can't control his emotions, he back stabs his own people, he's a spoiled brat and has everything handed to him. Compare that to Vernon Schillinger or Walter White other villainesk charecters who had arcs and went through periods of lows highs and faced serious rivals sometimes without the backing of others. The most adversity Tony faced was getting shot in the Tummy by his elderly uncle and having to walk through the snow for quite awhile after another boss's house was raided.

It takes all that's intersting about the Mafia genre and makes it mundane. Half the show is Tony dealing with his shit head kids and wife. Compare that to shows that preceded it like Oz which was none stop violence and a super thic atmospher or Twin Peaks before it which had a cool surreal atmospher or even the Simpsons which had all the fat tony mafia scenes and a much more intersting take on family life. It feels like the whole show is an effort to make the mafia hyper realistic and boring. It feels like everye charecter's goal is to ""do schemes that will ultimately backfire on us""

Also the profound ending was silly. I get that they ""had a bunch of clues leading up to it"" but even the creator said originally that wasn't supposed to be the ending and he even said about changing it ""why I don't know""

It just hammers you so much with ""things aren't so black and white"" that it refuses to ever do anything or go anywhere to the bitter end

Edit: Some of the points made about how it flipped the gangster genre on its head are really cool. I get that it takes aim at the genre and tries to deglamorize and knock it down in some way it just didn't resonate with me like it did some of you but I can see how that would be entertaining."

Why is it fair to deny people who simply want to be able to freely move to another country? Why are people so cruel to immigrants?

Again, why are many people so cruel in their heart to immigrants and foreigners?  I've had an overall great experience being friends with immigrants. My one friend, a lady who moved here from a country in Asia, is someone I could easily consider to be one of the nicest ladies i've ever known.  She even spent a ton of money on her own birthday party recently, so everyone at the party could have amazing food.  I'd say the majority of immigrants are selfless amazing people like that, at least from my own personal overall experiences.

In her case, she and her husband had to go to the us embassy and be put on a waiting list for people who want to emmigrate to america. It took her 19 years to finally be given the okay for her to emmigrate! How on earth is that fair? She is a free woman who deserves the right to travel and live in any country that she wants to.  Bureaucratic, cruel laws should not limit her inherrant right as a free human being to live where she chooses.

The majority of immigrants are just like you and me. They want to live their lives the best they can for them (and their children). They might even want to move to a place that gives them more opportunities: why should a nasty border get in the way of that?  If a man was born in mexico and wanted to come to america: how is it fair for them to be told no because some heartless selfish racist right-wingers told them that their dream cannot come true.  Why should they then have to go on some stupid waiting list and wait 20 years to finally be able to emmigrate legally?  Many of these right-winger's grandparents didn't have to go through any of this bs, they just took a boat straight to ellis island so them (and their eventual evidentally ungrateful right-wing grandkids) could live the american dream.

The only exception i was talking about is: No pedophiles, rapists, murderers or other nasty criminals. I'm sure that every good and moral person could agree that we do not want people like that.

The only immigrants i've known personally who i despised are ones who are pedophiles. I've had the displeasure of personally being around two.  One of them used to try to molest me when i was a kid, so i strongly hate that particular one.  Those pedos should have never been allowed into this country, i'm sure both democrats and republicans would agree with me on that one.

So basically i think that the only thing that you have to do before coming in is submit to a background check. Then as long as you arent some sort of horrible criminal, its time to start living in America!

Of course, there could unfortunately be criminals who somehow cheat the background check, hard to say... But overall my view is that they should be open."
127,2022-08-03,"CMV: Alex Jones - ""Conspiracy Entrepreneur"" is a better descriptor than ""Conspiracy Theorist.""",u/gray_clouds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wfhpex/cmv_alex_jones_conspiracy_entrepreneur_is_a/,changemyview,"This view is meant to refer to how we talk about Alex Jones (and others) in the news media.

In media, we refer Elon Musk as ""Tesla CEO,"" not ""Electric Car Believer"". The former makes it very clear that the things he says / does should be viewed in the context of his financial interest.

Calling Alex Jones a 'Conspiracy Theorist,' as most news media does, makes it sound like the most important attribute about him is his intellectual beliefs. I don't think anyone knows for sure what he believes or does not believe. We do know, with factual evidence, that he has made huge sums of money from his businesses, which are primarily focused on media about Conspiracy Theories. I think Conspiracy *Entrepreneur* would be an efficient way to say this, and that this term would be more effective than *Theorist* at conveying the most salient and relevant aspect of who Alex Jones is to the average reader.

1. I'm open to using other terms for clarity, like Conspiracy Theory Entrepreneur, or Conspiracy Media Mogul, though if it has a similar meaning - though adding more words would make it harder to use in a headline.
2. Perhaps I am missing something about why it is important to refer to AJ with a different standard than other business people. If someone can help me understand why it serves a purpose, I'm willing to listen.

Edit - Okay, let's nip something in the bud (as I'm reading some initial comments).   Calling someone an 'entrepreneur' does not mean I support them or like their business model. If you don't like what someone can legally do as a business in the US, then you should seek to change business law, not to change the meaning of 'entrepeneur' to mean: ""runs a business that I like.""

Edit 2 - It seems like I am yelling into the void. When using the term ""Snakeoil Salesman"" the word Salesman (describing a business term) does not imbue the subject with unearned legitimacy.  I am pairing the word ""Entrepeneur"" with ""Conspiracy"" in the same way. I just don't really think that people will confuse Alex Jones with say, Steve Jobs, because we used the E word in this context."

They just say it doesn't work like that. 

From what I understand the electoral college are the handful of people who represent each state, and that they vote after we do, and can vote differently than the popular vote. I think that the only repercussion for not voting with the population is a fine, which means it's really not an issue for them to do it.  If that's the case, wouldn't our votes be totally meaningless? I feel like there's got to be something I'm missing here. I genuinely want to be wrong here. I want to know that my vote means something. It just doesn't seem like it. 

To clarify, this is only regarding the Presidential vote. I don't think there's a college vote for any other seat, I could be wrong though. I'm just putting out the information I've got so far."

Evolution seemed to be pretty settled. Even if a person didn't understand it, I still didn't used to hear things like ""Where are the transition fossils? No those ones aren't good enough. There is ZERO evidence for evolution"". And when I respond, COVID is evolving right now, they say ""That's not evolution. That's adaptation"". One would think that person imagined himself a biologist. 

But even religious people used to reconcile pretty well established scientific consensus with a belief in God. They'd say God created the Big Bang. And I'd say, ""Can't disprove that. Totally a possibility""

Did anyone see that anti-abortion woman in the Congressional hearing say that a 10 year old rape victim who had to terminate her pregnancy out of state was not actually getting an abortion? Her explanation was that it would ""probably impact her life and therefore it would fall under any exception and would not be an abortion"". I mean, of course 10 years old can certainly give birth to children. All pregnancies have an inherent amount of threat to a woman's life. 

But the amazing thing was her redefinition of the word ""abortion"". That is super audacious in my mind, but the woman knew that abortion could never be the right thing to do, and so in an obviously egregious situation, she chose to redefine a word rather than admit that abortion should be acceptable in that instance

I had a recent conversation with someone who called the Jan 6th riots, ""meandering in a public building"". She claimed that the election was fraudulent, but that the conspiracy theorists who brought cases to court where actually planted by the CIA to discredit real evidence. ""The greatest intelligence operation of all time"" she called it. Also, nothing, including investigations or show hearings, could contain any facts unless there was a trial in an adversarial situation like a courtroom. She considered herself something of law expert.

Someone I worked with for a short time claimed that atomic weapons and energy don't exist. And he pointed to a picture of Hiroshima and said ""I'm a visual media professional. I can tell that that is two explosions. Not one"" And I had to tell him not to talk to me about anything non-work related.

My point is that people are being taught that anything they want to think is correct. A lot of theories and arguments are thrown at them, many of them completely false, and they get to pick whatever they want to justify their beliefs. Also very effective is to merely ""ask questions"". It has the benefit of not explicitly lying, but still giving permission to fill in the blank with whatever a person wants to believe. It also seems to be self reinforcing in that the more false information they believe, the more others call them stupid, the more effective pandering to them is.

0,2022-08-03,CMV: We should strive for a post-gender society without gender-identity,u/MtnDewTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wfj6wv/cmv_we_should_strive_for_a_postgender_society/,changemyview,"I am a moderate liberal and have always fully supported the LGBT+ community in my personal life. Within day-to-day life, I will call anyone by the pronouns that they prefer, I don't see any problem just treating people with respect, and believe individuals should have the right to have their own identity. I never want to make people feel lesser-than and someone's identity has no effect on me. However, when it comes to my overall political/societal worldview and understanding, the current topic surrounding gender identity and transgender, gender neutral, agender, etc. individuals just really confuses me and seems almost paradoxical. To me, both the conservative and liberal sides of this ""debate"" are contradictory against themselves in one way or another, I feel like the basic idea of gender is truly meaningless (or at least should be) in our society.

The Conservative/Anti-gender ideology arguments I have heard, often stem from the idea above that gender is meaningless, or that gender doesn't exist at all. Take for example Matt Walsh who has seemingly dedicated his entire life to ""debunking"" gender ideology, and who made the ""What is a Woman"" documentary. Throughout videos I have seen of him, he constantly claims that gender doesn't exist or that the idea of gender as a social construct is insane. However, then he makes statements that boys can't wear dresses.  Why would that be the case? He, and other popular internet conservatives, claim that men or boys wearing dresses isn't right/ok and that it goes against their role in society. It is contradictory to claim that there is no social construct of gender to later defend and uphold the social construct of gender. Clothes have nothing to do with biological sex, males aren't born wearing suits, and females aren't born wearing dresses. Clothing is created by society and the ""roles"" or ""labels"" we give them are created by society too, ie. a social construct. This is a common view among conservatives it seems, and extends beyond just clothing, think of phrases like ""be a man"" or ""make men masculine again."" I often hear these remarks from conservatives who then claim there is no social construct of gender, or that gender doesn't exist. It just makes no sense to me. 

Now to the liberal side, the fact is there has always been a traditional view of gender and gender roles. Masculine vs feminine traits, actions, clothing, roles, etc. However growing up I was taught we were trying to rid these ideas from society, and that a woman could do anything a man could do and vice versa. These concepts of gender roles were outdated and I agree with this idea. But it seems like the newer emergence of gender identity and transgender ideology kinda reinforces these old concepts. It's like liberals are trying to tear down gender stereotypes while possibly reinforcing them at the same time? Maybe it's because I'm cisgender but I have never felt an emotional attachment to my sex, and it's not really something I think about often or use/think about in my social interactions. I just don't understand what gender really means if a woman can do everything men can do and men can do everything a woman can do. Why can't there just be ""traditionally feminine"" males and ""masculine"" females? Actually this doesn't seem to be a problem, at least for liberals, but then what exactly does gender refer to nowadays? I feel like creating more labels just divides people more into smaller categories. I apologize, as I am having a hard time really explaining my point well here, and this might sound confusing, but it seems like liberals want to get rid of the old social construct of gender and create a new one but there seems to be lacking any real meaning behind it. The meaning behind social constructs by definition and their value is only based on the value and acceptance society gives to them. While I think the question of ""what is a woman"" is kinda dumb and often used by people with ill-intent it does kind of raise a fair point, as if there is no definition for society to accept then there can't be a social construct with any real value. If the definition of a woman is different for each person then it becomes obsolete within society. Social constructs are real and can have value, for example, currency. But currency is only valuable to us as a society because a vast majority of us have a common and constant view as to what a currency's value is. If everyone viewed a $5 bill as having a different value then it wouldn't be of any real value to society as a whole. 

Finally, it seems like a lot of debate now goes into sex divisions within society. And I mean certain areas that have divided individuals based on biological sex, ie Bathrooms, and sports. 

As far as bathrooms go, I really don't care, and I wish we just had gender-neutral bathrooms everywhere because I personally enjoy doing my business in peace. However with sports, the reason for separate competition among sexes is purely for biological reasons IMO, and if you believe otherwise, and that it is rather a gender division based on social constructs then why would we have separate categories in sports at all? Why not just have both men and women compete against each other?

At the end of the day, gender seems to add nothing to our society and I just don't understand the point of it. I think we would be much better off in a world that is post-gender where the idea of men and women are basically meaningless, only important in terms of their biological differences."

You may disagree about the cause, fine (even though it’s most definitely human emissions). That’s not the point I’m arguing here. The point is, our planet is changing rapidly and if we fail to adapt, mass social unrest and collapse of society will be inevitable.

Yet, Elon Musk’s effort to build a Martian colony is the most important project humanity has undertaken to stave off and adapt to the effects of climate change. Yes, it is unlikely that we will see a human landed on Mars within Elon’s lifetime, but that’s beside the point. The technology which must be developed to keep a Martian colony alive and operational will inevitably be critical to keeping our society functioning here on Earth.

Water is essential for human life. Areas of the US and other parts of the world are rapidly drying up, which will inevitably cause shortages in critical water supplies. Through the technology which would be utilized on Mars, we will be able to recycle what limited water we do have on an extremely efficient scale along with perhaps producing water in places where it may not be readily available.

Food is equally as important. As parts of the planet dry up, food shortages will inevitably impact our society’s function. As much as 20% of the dollar value of US agricultural exports come from California. Once the water dries up, these crops will be lost. Farming technology developed for Mars will allow us to efficiently grow food at scale in an environment which is otherwise inhospitable to agriculture production. We’re already seeing this some here on Earth with large scale vertical farms. Mass implementation of high-tech farming solutions will be critical to food security and the technology developed for Mars will help streamline this process further.

Housing will also be important. In a Martian society, housing will need to be scalable, affordable, efficient, and highly protected from the environment outside. This will be increasingly relevant here on Earth where we will need to build new forms of housing which are resistant to heatwaves and all sorts of increasingly dangerous natural disasters.

In conjunction with housing, there will need to be a method to keep humans alive outside when the outside environment is inhospitable, whether that be due to extreme heat or other issues. The Martian environment is significantly worse than the environment Earth will see in generations to come (although Earth will likely become mostly inhospitable outdoors in our generation or the next few generations). Affordable and mass scale temperature regulation systems (like spacesuits) are the most effective solution to this problem.

So, in conclusion, while traveling to Mars may appear to be a useless pipe dream, it’s actually a critical project for humans to undertake if we assume that climate change cannot be effectively managed within the next few years or decades."

Reddit should be a place where everyone feels welcome to express their views (civilly) that leads to respectful debates and discussions.

I thought this was a conspiracy theory and that the general understanding was that your phone is not listening to you and your conversations. 

One argument they made was that the listening enabled corporations to better market their products and services to you the consumer. I argued with them that most marketing is AI and/or algorithm based on your demographic and internet data/history. They also mentioned how Alexa and Siri have to be listening if you allow your phone or device to be activated by your voice. 

However, after having the same conversation with other colleagues they agreed with the first colleague that phones, Alexas, and other devices are actively listening. I’ve seen John Oliver’s episode on data brokers selling information and glossed over several blogs and articles regarding this topic and I don’t see any information to indicate that your phone or other devices are actively listening to you and it appears to be a conspiracy that they would be doing so to better market to you. 

I had no idea this was so generally accepted. I really hope the results here are that there is no evidence or acknowledgement that this is occurring, so hopefully you all strike out. Especially since if your phone is listening to you it’s almost certain your camera is on too and I’m on the toilet right now.

Now I'm not saying the employee in said video is right for flipping out obviously but I understand if their boss gives them a hard time about having to check receipts.

Really its the bosses problem, im not getting into fights to check fucking receipts for 9 dollars an hour or w/e the wage is rofl.

But then a lot of people commented like a bunch keyboard warriors saying how ""damn right im not waiting like a sheep to show my receipt im not legally required to blah blah blah coporate trying to impose authority blah blah""

Regardless these are probably the same people that complain about shoplifters getting away with shit but apparantly connecting the dots is too much for them.

Anyways,
I dont get the problem. Sure I try to walk out the door without stopping. But if the greeter asks for the receipt I show it, they only ever want a little small talk cause maybe theyre bored and look at the receipt for 2 seconds max rofl.

Im not going to risk making a fucking scene over it and possibly getting in trouble over it and instead just let people do what they were told to do and I'm especially not trying to give them a hard time cause I know customer service is rough and I feel for them rofl.

Then the commentors were talking about their legal rights about how they dont have to show it but like, really? Thats the hill you wanna die on? How is showing your reciept a problem?"
44,2022-08-04,CMV: Calling out Taylor Swift and other celebrities for using private jets is a waste of public outrage,u/DarthCharizard,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wfrjz2/cmv_calling_out_taylor_swift_and_other/,changemyview,"Global CO2 emissions were [31.5 Gt](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/co2-emissions)

That's 31500000000 tons. Taylor generated 
[8,293.54 tons](https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-private-plane-carbon-emissions).

So Taylor's contribution to yearly climate change? 

2.63287E-05% of yearly climate change was due to her private jet usage. That's infinitesimal. While I do believe that ridiculous wealth is gross and all for lots of reasons, celebrity use of private planes is a not statistically meaningful driver of climate change. 

Even if you consider all private planes- the global aviator sector as a *whole* contributes about [2%](https://www.c2es.org/content/reducing-carbon-dioxide-emissions-from-aircraft/) of CO2 emissions. And at least in 2016, all private planes were [4%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020307779#!) of the 2% total. And that includes [22,295 jets, 14,241 turboprops, and 19,291 turbine helicopters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020307779#!).

I believe that spending so much attention on celebrity private jet usage is actually harmful to addressing climate change. We spend so much social energy calling out something that isn't actually a meaningful part of the problem and the big polluters get to continue operations as normal having distracted us with their ""look there, not here"" tactics. 

I believe that people have a limited outrage budget- nobody has the time or energy to devote to caring about every cause on the planet. So it's important for us to meaningfully prioritize where we spend that energy so that we accomplish real change, and this focus on celebrities gets in the way of that."

Edit; one last edit because people can't seem to read. I already said you would have fucked them had they not told you. 
Which means you've already seen their genitals. So don't talk to me about genital preference. You've already seen it. 

People can't seem to read. I'm not talking about marriage. I'm talking about one night stands. the hypothetical is you would've fucked them had they not told you. 

I don't want to view people negatively, but I just can't see a way out. 
I just want to preface though that I don't advocate for trans people to sleep with people they think would only sleep with them if they hid the fact that 

One of the arguments people say this isn't bigotry is stuff like, ""well you wouldn't sleep with a Nazi would you are you bigoted to a murderer"". And I don't see it as immoral do disassociate yourself from someone who may hurt you, for one. Among other things. 

There are I suppose, legit arguments about not wanting to date people who are trans if you want children, which falls under fertility issues. However, I fail to see where fertility would factor in a one night stand.

another argument that is the most common to me is ""I'm not gay"". I fail to see how that's a problem. You thought you weren't attracted to black/white men etc, now you are. Same thing with gender

""Its traumatic"" again I get it can be, but the reason is why exactly? If the reason is they were raped by someone with x chromome, its still just as bad as saying you'll never have sex with black men. You can have trauma, but doesn't mean its right to generalize 

Again, let me repeat, I'm not talking about forcing them and u think you should tell them, however their reasoning for refusal is not because of lack of attraction but some bad ideology."

Recently during the trial to determine damages in the Alex Jones defamation case, it was revealed that his lawyers had on accident sent a clone copy of his phone to the plaintiffs lawyers. He was ambushed on the stand with that information, pointing out he had previously lied.

The internet proceeded to have a celebratory meltdown over it. Saying how this is a massive thing, how this means Alex Jones perjured himself, how he is looking at criminal charges after this, how this might blow the lid on Jan 6th etc.

Don't get me wrong, the phone this was an incredible fuck up on the part of the lawyers. But I am pretty sure nothing will come of it outside of this specific trial. For the following reasons 

1) Alex going to prison on perjury charges is a long shot. It would first demand another trial (a criminal one). This one had already dragged on forever and only got to this point this fast because there was a default judgement. Jones has money and connections, the moment there is any chance of actual jail time he will be long gone. Just like most rich men charged in America. He has already turned this one trial into a show and martyred himself, a criminal one would be even more of a show.

2)It contributing to Jan 6th investigation. Right now the people on trial and getting sent to jail are the rioters. Political nobodies, while the real masterminds are insulated from the consequences. I don't know what magical smoking gun they expect to find in the texts to drag down the worst of the GOP into the limelight.

Change my view that there is some hope for consequences from the texts."

And when Marco Polo visited China in the late 1200s, he was astonished by how rich they were.

But as time progressed, a little damp island on the corner of Europe would have its language be the dominant language of the globe. Continents that never knew these Latin letters I'm typing with, finally became acquainted with them and the western world has reigned supreme.

This starts to fall apart more or less in the 1950s when Europe gets tired and can no longer afford to maintain its colonies, so we see a great decrease in territorial holdings.

France loses Indochina and Algeria, Britain loses the Trucial States and they become the Emirates and Qatar, Portugal loses Angola, Mozambique, and Goa. The Dutch, those savvy innovators of the 1600s, finally lose Suriname and their east indies holding, which become Indonesia.

And in our own lifetime, we saw Hong Kong and Macao fall to Jiang Zemin.

Pelosi, the House Speaker of the Americans, is maintaining what the western world fought for during those tough hard centuries. The Taiwanese people depend on us, not Japan, not India, not Iran, to protect them.

So essentially you have someone going to school for a decade just to write prescriptions for Xanax and thorium all day.

It seems like it would be much more efficient to just include pharmacology in the psychology doctorate curriculum and allow PsyD’s to prescribe medication. 5 states have already done this (Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho.)

Very often over my career I've heard that ""older"" people can't be expected to know how to use Microsoft Word, email, Google, or other websites or technology.  I find this to be a pretty poor excuse.  Frankly I think it is mostly laziness and entitlement that causes this demographic to avoid use of these technologies.

Let's say that an employee is 60 years old, and started working in an office setting at the age of 25.  That is **35 years** of experience in office settings and, to my mind, 35 years of experience with the exact technologies that these people complain about.

Google debuted in 1998, **24 years ago**.

Lotus Notes email software came out in 1989, **33 years ago**.

Microsoft Word was introduced in 1983, **39 years ago**.

These employees have literally had 2-3 decades to get used to this technology and yet they act as though they came up in an era when all you could do was write with a quill and ink by candlelight.

""But just because a technology *debuted* decades ago doesn't mean everyone immediately learned how to use it.  Adaptation takes time.""  Correct, and it's been decades of time for that to happen.

""Even if someone knew how to use Word in the 80's or 90's, there's been a lot of updates to the technology since then.""  In my experience as someone who started using Word at the age of 7 or 8, no update has been so huge that it completely changed how to use it.  It takes a few days to get used to and is doable by any reasonably intelligent person.

""People late in their careers don't want to bother with sending emails and writing documents, that's grunt work for newbies and assistants.""  Sure, and for this reason I'm always happy to help.  I honestly find it much more respectable to be told, ""I don't have time to write this email, you do it for me,"" then ""I just don't know how to use email cause I'm too old.""  EDIT: Getting a lot of arguments to the effect of this but saying that this sort of thing is my job as an assistant, not the senior's job.  My point here is that a) idk what age has to do with it, you can just tell me what you need done and I'll handle, but perhaps more importantly b) sometimes (not always but sometimes) the high-billing, no free time, VIP lawyer folks would save loads of time by knowing how to do certain things than spending the time to tell me what they need, check it over, ask questions, and then finally have it be done.  It is not more efficient to ask me \*every time\* you need to make text bold, for example.

""This is a strawman argument, everyone knows that older people love technology and use it all the time.""  Ok.

EDIT: Your hypothetical white-collar exec who grew up in a coal mine and never saw a computer until the age of 50, who never learned to read, and who has relied on secretaries to feed him prime rib by hand ever since he started as a junior in the field yesterday, does not apply to this topic. 

EDIT #2: seeing a lot of the same answers which I address in the main post, so I’m going to stop replying at this point unless your comment is especially smart or especially dumb.

I am in favor of adoption and have no issue with fertility drugs.

Why? Well, first off because there’s a lot of children up for adoption. Just in the US there are more than 100.000 children that desire and deserve to have a family(I’m not from the US personally but I thought it would be the most relevant piece of data for most readers).

Second, to go through a medical procedure because you MUST have a child that is biologically yours seems obsessive and unhealthy. Makes even less sense if a couple decided to go through surrogacy, because if the child is not a product of both of you then why not just adopt?

Third because surrogate motherhood is almost always exploitative of people who must sell their body and health for money.

I do realize that in some places gay couples cannot adopt and their only chance at parenthood is to have a baby through IVF or other means in a different country. I have no issue with that since they have no choice.

Overall I just don’t get the fixation with “I must have a baby that is biologically mine”. Children don’t care. Bio kids don’t care about blood if you’re a crappy parent.

Parenthood is a relationship first and foremost and effort matters much more than blood relations.

But maybe I don’t see all sides of it.

- - - - -

EDIT: I have since changed my view on the matter and am no longer against IVF etc.

What changed my mind:

- adoption is crazy expensive in some places. It's not where I live, so I wasn't aware. OTOH IVF can be free. I can't fault people for wanting to choose an option at parenthood that is economincally more feasible.

- there's more people willing to adopt that there are kids waiting to be adopted. I assumed this wasn't the case and I was wrong. My bad.

- there are causes of infertility that can be medically treated and solve the issue. I am of course not against that, so to be in favor of a medical procedure that fixes infertility and not IVF etc seems hypocritical.

- my stance comes from my experience as a parent that being a father or a mother is way more tied to the act of parenting on a daily basis than the fact that you gave birth to a kid. But it's unfair for me to expect other people to have this kind of mentality expecially if they haven't had a chance at being parents yet.

- overall this quote from an article resonated with me:

&gt; Every human being has a right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Individuals and couples have the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of their children. Infertility can negate the realisation of these essential human rights. Addressing infertility is therefore an important part of realizing the right of individuals and couples to found a family.

As of now, I still think the process of adoption should still be made fairer and cheaper. I've seen people suffer their whole lives because they never got adopted, and I've seen adopted kids absolutely thrive in life. Even those who had ongoing issues with the fact that their biological parents rejected them still had chances at a decent life and overall ended up better for it.

But I don't think banning (which I wasn't advocating for to be clear) or limiting IVF is a way to improve things.

I still think that adoptive parents are full-fledged parents and that it's a shitty thing to do to say to someone that she isnt' a mother if she didn't conceive a kid herself. Really fucked up.

I still don't think that ""it's either my bio kid or forget about it"" is a totally reasonable stance.

And I still have issues with renting a woman's uterus because she needs money.

But banning these procedures would not solve the issues with adoption. And of course will just created a black market for them (which I knew beforehand, hence why I never advocated for straight up banning of them).

1711,2022-08-04,CMV: you can’t be against the power and influence the wealthy or famous have within the criminal justice system in America and support the release of Britney Griner,u/huggles7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wg6eck/cmv_you_cant_be_against_the_power_and_influence/,changemyview,"As you may or may not know she was detained and arrested in Russia for “drug smuggling charges” for having cannabis oil cartridges in her carry on at a Moscow airport. The charges include a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years. She received 9.5 years.

She has never once denied being in possession of said cartridges, has never said they were planted on her by the Russians. She has conceded she use them for medical purposes. Russia does not allow for medical or recreational marijuana use. 

She was arrested for breaking a law, found guilty and thus far has been sentenced within their normal guidelines. This isn’t an uncommon law, for instance only 19 out of 50 states allow for recreational marijuana use in the US. It is still illegal federally. For example: she cannot take marijuana legally purchases in her home state of Arizona and transport it to the neighboring state of California (where it’s also legal) as that violates federal law.

Her crime is not the crime of the century and in all likelihood an oversight. That being said, if you are petitioning for her release it is solely due to her fame and status as a professional athlete. She (in my opinion) is not worth trading a Russian arms dealer for. She is not illegally detained, she did not break an uncommon law. 

It would be an inherent contradiction to believe that she should be free while also railing against cases in the US where people of money and power get lighter sentences. This isn’t a nuanced argument, if you believe that money and status shouldn’t be a consideration in criminal sentencing, but believe Mrs. griner should be released then you’re just cherry picking.


Edit: for those saying “this is entirely political because she got the maximum sentence! It has to be!”

Mark Fogel, an American citizen who worked in the American embassy in Moscow, received a 14 year prison sentence for marijuana possession that was “medically prescribed” to him in a very similar situation to Mrs. Griner, he was arrested and charged in June 2021, 10 months prior to the invasion of Ukraine, and yes he was arrested in Russia

https://www.rferl.org/amp/russia-american-medical-marijuana-prison/31902563.html


Edit 2: 

https://reason.com/2019/10/11/russia-sentences-israeli-american-traveler-to-7-5-years-in-prison-for-nine-grams-of-pot/?amp

Naama Issachar 7.5 year sentence for 9 grams of marijuana, sentenced in October 2019

Edit 3:

The contradiction is in believing that Griner should be returned home over others as a result of her money and status, no one talked about prisoner exchanges with Russia before her so allowing her to be a political tool is solely due to her status, you may not have known about other political prisoners specifically but you know that Americans were being held there prior to griners arrest

Firebombing was a horrible aspect of ww2 and having one of the “Good Nations” take advantage of this tactic should be talked about more, I understand that bombing war producing factories is lawful, and that the Japanese military did way worse things, but this shouldn’t excuse the fact that the US was incinerating children and babies who would have no effect on the war effort. I also understand the Japanese production was mixed in with residential living so it would be difficult to differentiate between military vs civilian but there were several cities that were bombed that did not produce military related materials. I see a lot of comments on other posts that brush these events off and say “Well they started it” yes the top leaders did not the random people trying to survive life and get by during war. The fact that japan doesn’t even have a lot of memorials to the people and their cities say a lot by itself as well, they would rather just forget it completely then to learn their history."

More specifically, I was watching the video about Chris Watts. Quick recap, this man killed his wife and two children, was acting suspicious and was brought in for interrogation voluntarily, consented to a polygraph, and then was pressured into a total confession.

Don’t get me wrong, Chris was a terrible man and deserved absolutely everything coming to him, but the numbers of false confessions in the US are pretty high ( [stats from falseconfessions.org](https://falseconfessions.org/fact-sheet/) ), and it leads me to believe the system is unfair to the accused.

Chris went in voluntarily, but the way it was worded to him, he essentially had to come or he would look guilty. Of course, this isn’t how our court system works, and refusing to come in for an interview would be inadmissible evidence, but many people probably don’t know that. On top of that, they employ as many tricks as they can to get him to consent to the polygraph (lie detector), a completely inadmissible piece of evidence in the US, but he had no way of knowing that. Finally, they tell him that they “have everything they need” and that he just needs to come clean or it will eat at him forever. They offer a bunch of fake but lighter options and imply that those are better and make him a good person (if his wife killed the kids first, and he killed her in response, they tell him that would be okay), and then they bring his dad in, while he doesn’t know he’s being recorded, and he partially confesses. Finally, after one more round of intense questions, he breaks. JCS mentions how the goal the entire time is to mentally weaken him until he finally makes a dumb decision and confesses.

It’s shocking that he didn’t get a lawyer, but if he did, his advice would’ve been to walk out, say nothing, refuse the polygraph, and answer to no one, but he was pressured and tricked into believing that he had to do everything, answer to them, and eventually he broke. I’m glad he got the justice he deserved, but if 25% of confessions are false confessions (see above), then this feels unfair to me.

I’m willing to change my mind with some convincing arguments."

I do think defunding police is at least partially attributable for the crime increases in the country.

Despite this, I think Republicans overall are worse.

When comparing states, blue states are better than red:

[https://appliedsentience.com/2020/07/28/crime-are-red-or-blue-states-better/](https://appliedsentience.com/2020/07/28/crime-are-red-or-blue-states-better/)

[https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-red-state-murder-problem](https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-red-state-murder-problem)

States like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, etc have extraordinarily high murder rates fueled by tons of gun crime.

Now one might say, it's not the states, but those Dem controlled big cities which are driving all the crime. I think states are a much bigger indicator of the effects of policies because big cities are much more vastly different than the rest of the country than the respective differences between states. Furthermore, the effects of state policies are also felt onto the cities in that state.

Regardless this claim doesn't make sense because the blue states have more urban areas, so if it were solely driven by urban areas, the blue states should be out-criming the red ones and significantly. But this isn't the case, so the non urban areas of red states clearly have more crime than the non urban areas of blue states.

That being said, urban areas do have more crime than non urban areas (but not enough to the point that it's driving much of it). But I'm not convinced that Democrats are responsible for it because the few Republican run cities aren't better at handling crime. Urban crime is likely mostly due to much higher population density, inequality, and poverty."

Men are told not to not ask a woman's weight. 

A woman would get canceled, if caught saying ""I'm not attracted to guys under Xft Yin"", and same goes for men saying ""I'm not attracted to women my age""

On the inside, we all know that, **assuming all else is same**, ~~99% of the population~~  the mainstream/ majority prefer:

* (men) 6ft over 5ft
* (women) age 25 over 45
* $500k/yr over $35k/yr
* (men) muscular over scrawny
* (women) fit over fat
* (men) above average penis over micro-penis
* (women) fewer previous partners over many partners

I can go on and on about preferences that we all know exist, but are demonized/criticized when said in public.

It's absolutely natural to want a man that can physically protect you and provide for you financially. It's absolutely natural to want a woman that will be fertile for more years, and is physically healthy to raise your child.

Yes, **these desires are absolutely vapid and superficial** - but I argue that without accepting that these desires exist in the first place, we cannot move onto look for more important things that truly matter. Without such acceptance, we're building our romantic life on false foundations.

Now, there is a legitimate counter-argument to all of this:
&gt; but this would hurt those who can't/choose not to comply to these standards.

But, I'd argue that demonizing such desires, to the point where we are effectively pressuring everyone to *lie* about their preferences is far more harmful and toxic. And if my feelings were hurt by such standards, I'd rather be hurt by the truth, and look for ways to improve myself, rather than be lulled into false hope with sweet lies.

Here’s my reasoning, I understand sex is determined by XX and XY chromosomes but gender is a social construct because its just words but not a physical thing. So if your a female your gender can still be “Man” because but your sex is the same. I feel because of this if someone is trans you can still call them by there sex and shouldn’t get flak for it because it’s not misgendering them. No matter how much hormone therapy you go through or what you wear your chromosomes won’t change from XX to XY or vise-versa. 

Also because gender is a social construct and you can change it at will, other things that are social constructs such as, race and nationality should be acceptable to change at will and should receive the same support as Transgender people. Since the only difference is WHAT social construct I feel like exiling or any perceived negativity or bigotry would be hypocritical from anyone supporting the LGBTQIA+ community. 

If you support transgender people you should support transracial people too. 
And it’s not wrong to call a Transwoman a male.

0,2022-08-05,CMV: Gender is based off of the representation (or lack thereof) of a sex,u/Rahzek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wgmlxu/cmv_gender_is_based_off_of_the_representation_or/,changemyview,"We are divided, for the most part, into two groups: males and females. Culturally (and partially naturally), there have been several roles and behaviors that we two groups have been suggested to exhibit, based on said group we belong to.

The mind has an idea of what men and women are. This is what allows us to assume the genders of people on the street, in cartoons, and even people we talk to on reddit. Our brains categorize people like this, often subconsciously. This categorization is the medium for dysphoria. How a person looks, sounds, and acts - these matter differently to everyone trying to achieve a certain gender expression, dysphoric or not.

I typically will not browse photos of men in hentai, but I will of women. Yet, I have no scientific proof that any of these people are genetically female. Sure, they are representing females, but my brain seeks not females, but the suggestions of something being female. After all, hentai is literally ink, and ink is neither male nor female.

The 'raw' brain cannot determine someone's sex. It tries to make that distinction using clues, but those clues wind up being the end rather than the means. These clues are gender.

So when someone identifies as a woman, but was born male, it is because their brains want them to represent a female. The clues they use to do so are subjective.

EDIT: to title, Gender is based off of the representation (or lack thereof) of a sex **or sexes**

EDIT 2: I'd like to add that, if gender is separate from sex completely, then it is solely personality"

Lagers use ""bottom-fermenting"" yeast that is fermented at lower temperatures and generally conditioned at low temperatures for several weeks. Ales use ""top-fermenting"" yeast and is usually fermented at more or less room temperature and usually doesn't get conditioned for more than a few days.  
   
Advantages of ales:  
1. More variety - they can be made to be crisp and clean similar to lagers and also fruity and estery, spicy, dry, sweet ect.  
2. More environmentally friendly - they can be fermented at much higher temperatures requiring less energy for cooling.  
3. Faster turnaround - due to these higher temperatures they can be produced much faster.   
 
Advantages of Lagers: 
1. A somewhat unique taste that cannot always be 100% replicated with ales. 

Still the vast majority of beers today is made of the lager variety and I don't understand why. Am I missing something?"

In short, if people and companies are made to pay the true cost of their activities (by, in effect, removing the direct and indirect subsidies), then a trend for a much healthier and better society and lifestyle would naturally emerge. In this case if people had to fund the true cost of car ownership, I believe less car usage would occur, with people opting for public transports far more often, which has a whole list of positive externalities.

A few typical rebutals:

*1) but there is no/poor public transports* 

See ""Note""

*2) but public transports are unpleasant*

Since the state will no longer be massively subsidizing car-driving, that money can go towards public transports. There are countries where public-transport qualities is excellent. 

*3) but I like cars and driving*

So do I. But I just want to pay the fair cost of that

*4) but I can't afford public transports, yet I can afford a car.*

Cars (very) rarely are end-user cheaper, but if they somehow are, that'll stop being the case with my policy proposal. At this point you can perfectly consider free public transports for students and/or underaged people, discounts for lower incomes, etc. 

*5) but I have special physical needs*

Public transports can, and have been, adapted to that effectively. The biggest hindrance to wheelchair access in many places I've went to was actually sidewalk space taken-up by cars, damaged sidewalks from cars, cars on cross-walks, etc.

*6) but I like the confort of a car.*

And that's fine, but just pay a fair price for that. 

*7) but freedom???*

You're free to drive, all I ask is for you to pay a fair price."
2,2022-08-05,CMV: Negative comments are more valid,u/-oddo-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wgsgxf/cmv_negative_comments_are_more_valid/,changemyview,"If a comment is something positive or at least neutral, it can be deemed as the person sugarcoating it because regardless of the truth, there are some innate obligation to try not hurting someone else's feelings, or if it's not innate in them, addressing an issue in a harsh way can be seen as unacceptable, regardless of the truth, so they also can be avoiding punishments.

But if those restrictions are lifted, there can be a far harsher evaluation deep down from someone that they held back. Either inherently, like higher, more respected position or anonymity (like the internet), or purposely, like disliking or hating something. Those can leave more scathing comments with less consequences, or less caring about the consequences, and a handful would take advantage of this to leave meaner comments.

This seems as if, those who give more negative comments are being more real, due to not conforming into inherent or societal restrictions. Those are more eager to unravel as many cons or flaws they can find in something or someone. And often, something or someone had both positive/neutral and negative comments, and this can mean the negative comments are the ones that should be addressed first.

Other than that, even if a comment isn't positive or neutral, a comment that points out a flaw in something like constructive criticism also can make the problem seem smaller than it actually is. The more someone hates something or someone, the more nasty and brutal their negative comments can be, and while it's not something pretty, it can give a wake-up call that something really needs to be addressed/fixed. Even if the haters only mock something and not giving good enough reason, it's still a wake-up call that there's something wrong that needs to be addressed.

Not 100% the case, but many times, even though it's said that opinions coming from family or friends are more valid due to them knowing you better, those people can also have inherent filter dealing with those they're close to, and people'd likely to try being their best self around them. While other than how, people who know you less would be more honest regarding others, they can be the one to spot your weakness or unappealing side, and point out that, or make it up as a bigger issue if they hate you. Those people may know you less, but they still seem to be more valid at evaluating you, for your exposed pathetic side for you to address on.

While haters can deny your developments or growths, they can still be the ones that has higher standards, and there are no limits of improving yourself. Even if the haters didn't meant to improve you or giving a good reason in their nasty comments, it still indicates there are big problems you must address.

So it seems that, the more people hate someone or something, the more valid their comments and evaluations regarding that someone or something, due to them not restricting themselves and being more real. And the more hate people had on something, less restrictions they have to not minimize something. And the more valid source of opinions you can get are from the people who likely treats you the worst, like the bullies, haters, trolls, anyone ruder, the authority figures who view you as the black sheep, the snob that looks down on you, etc. who while aren't aiming to improve you, it's a wake-up call."

While Swift's use of private planes seems excessive to say the least, the fact that is a touring musician who has to go from tour venue to tour venue with very little time in between means that booking a ticket on a public plane is not always an option and also some smaller venues don't have direct flights meaning that the singer would have to go to an out-of-the-way hub in order to go to that music venue.

Therefore singers with private planes have a massive advantage over those who do not, considering that singers without private planes would need to use a car/bus or try to get on a public plane where it would take at least a few hours extra and at worst a few days extra to get to a venue compared to ignoring your environmental consciousness and jumping on a private plane.

Most musicians don't have the luxury of missing many venues in a row, considering that tour venues are the most important way to increase one's fanbase and to make money. So while many musicians simiply cannot afford private planes and therefore just take the hits from missed venues or excusively do venues in driving distance from their homes, any musician who has the cash for a private plane would take a private plane to get to their tour venues since it means being able to supercharge their career. 

Is this fair? No. But besides banning private planes, there is no way that any well-to-do musician will ever take a massive hit to their career just to take the moral high road when no one else will."

These kids are essentially born into a job they never agreed to, and since it was the parent who put them in that role, they will feel less inclined to quit even if they want to, once they realize what the cameras actually mean. Whether the point of realization sets in at age 2 or 5, it will come with the feeling of ""I've been doing this forever, and mommy/daddy obviously wants me to keep doing it or they wouldn't keep taking me to sets"", which is a type of (likely) unintended pressure the parent puts on them, even if they ask their kid if they want to opt out. Kids that age will be more likely to comply in their quest to stay ""good boys/girls"" for the parents. 

And if they decide to quit, they are likely bound by their contract to the series for a definite amount of time, but let's look at the best case scenario and say they are free to go immediatelly: 

They still spent X years gaining fame publicly already without their consent, often among their own peers, which might affect their social life, possibly all the way into adulthood, depending on the popularity and nature of the show.

There's also the concern of arranging a child's life around filming schedules, which might make them miss social events with their own peers due to working hours and/or remote filming locations. Giving small chores to a 3 year old that teaches them to keep their surroundings tidy is one thing, as that's a skill that will benefit them in life. Giving them a full/part time job before they even learn what that means (and before they learn the word ""no"") however, is only beneficial to the parent's wallet."

I have seen both the good and bad sides of tracking systems for product release.

When researching for a potential very small marijuana grow business, I stumbled into seed to sale tracking. I understand it's a legal requirement, but what is the best reason for it? In my estimation it's an extra burden on the supply chain and only benefits the database company and the manufacturer of the consumables to support it; frequently if not always the same business.

I think, in a free market, businesses should be able to buy whatever tracking database they deem necessary. It's the legal requirement that baffles me. I don't see how it benefits the consumer at all. 

I see it benefitting legislators only in feel-good manners. Tracking is not protecting the public, it only shows the public that legislators are ""doing something"".

Is my opinion shared by anyone else? Or is there a good argument for this tracking being mandated?"

What do I mean that every landlord agrees? Well, it’s standard rule that if you want to rent an apartment, you need to make 3x the rent otherwise you’re not qualified to rent. Aka, if you don’t make 3x the rent of the area you want to live in, you’re homeless.

So the answer is simple. A living wage is 3x the average rent of said area. Anything lower is poverty wage."

Therefore, it would be a good idea to be seen doing something positive. Therefore, America should grant statehood to Puerto Rico. Chaneg my view.

That was an argument ""for"". Now, below are some arguments against. These are based on a post I recently made on [reddit.com/r/puertorico](https://reddit.com/r/puertorico). CMV. Please tell me why America should not grant statehood to Puerto Rico.

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Some issues with America granting statehood to Puerto Rico**

After having viewed the recent videos and posts on reddit.com/[r/exmuslim](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/)/, I still believe that there are many problems with Islam. But this brings up a new issue. Literally, the only thing these people on this reddit know about me is that I am American, and they immediately go to town loudly decrying Americans and the problems these other people who have no link to me are creating. I was open minded about granting Puerto Rico statehood but, frankly, this is giving me second thoughts. First of all, it would seem that these people feel like they want statehood as a matter of right - for some past transgressions or mistakes that America supposedly made. I am not saying that America is perfect, but we have always stood for freedom and democracy for the most part, including when Puerto Rico was under colonial rule. I know that our recent record is not so great. Secondly, it looks like Puerto Rico has a history of colonialism by the Spanish and so, if we grant them statehood, we, in America, are presumably also taking into consideration the fact that we are importing wholesale all these issues. Now, we will have to deal with not only black-versus-white issues and prolife-versus-abortion issues, but also now the issues of how Muslims were treated in Puerto Rico in ages past and how Native Puerto Ricans were treated in ages past. (These very issues are hotly debated in states in the United States from Hawaii to Florida.) Thirdly, I never said anything to target Muslims, but if these people in Puerto Rico need to grow up. Obviously, a few people on reddit cannot be said to speak for everyone in Puerto Rico, but is it a representative set? If they cannot acknowledge that the two largest monotheistic religions in the world, Islam and Christianity, have historically had many issues and these two communities have found it hard to get along with each other, then that is them refusing to acknowledge the problems of the mainlanders. I don't think America has an agenda against Muslims, as many Presidents in the past have made clear. I honestly don't think so. But we cannot ignore the fact that uslims and Christians have doctrinal differences and any time you put a lot of Muslims right next to a lot of Christians, there have been problems. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that ever since Mo appropriated a lot of the ideas of Christianity and even adopted wholesale a bunch of their prophets into the religion he was forming, that whole issue became a tricky one. Nobody is talking about disenfranchising Muslim-Americans or Muslim-Christians. Fourth, what exactly are Puerto Ricans' positions on the various issues facing America today and what solutions are they offering? I have no doubt that Puerto Ricans are well meaning people, but they need to seriously give these considerations some thought. I don't think America is screwing up your island. Anyway, these are just some of the issues that come to mind. I don't know if they are all of them, or even the most important ones to consider. 

&amp;#x200B;

**First update:** I am not saying here that Puerto Rico is a Muslim territory. What I am arguing here is that, if there is any prima facie evidence of abridgement of fundamental constitutional rights, then that is an issue.

336,2022-08-06,"CMV: It is inhumane to leave homeless people on the streets. They should be given housing, and those with mental illness or addiction should be given residential treatment whether they want it or not",u/OutdoorzExplorerz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whhldp/cmv_it_is_inhumane_to_leave_homeless_people_on/,changemyview,"I don’t understand how we reached a point in society where many states feel the right thing to do is leave homeless people on the streets. 

I’ve read that 25-40% of our homeless population are addicted to alcohol or drugs. I’ve read that up to 20% are schizophrenic. Finally, I’ve read that 45% have some type of mental illness. 

I watched Pete Santanello’s videos on the homeless in California. It was clear that leaving them on the street is not only harmful to them, but also everyone else living in the area. For example, the one woman said she needs to steal $150 worth of goods daily to feed her habit, and discussed how there are networks of thieves working the area. Here is one of his videos…

https://youtu.be/jzdHQUKYS3Q

Here is another about the fentanyl crisis in the state, which also affects the homeless population…

https://youtu.be/H6PcxY_JUTU

The crazy thing is that many ultimately end up in a state sponsored facility, but not the one they need. They end up in JAIL.

There are shelters for those who will accept them, but many do not accept it, often due to mental illness and/or addiction. I don’t understand why we give them a choice. If a guy is running around waving a gun, we’d detain him. If he was actively slicing his wrists, we’d detain him. But if he is slowly killing himself with drugs, pooping on the sidewalk, blocking the entrance to businesses, and stealing from those businesses, we conclude “He’s living life on his terms.”  That’s nuts. 

My Suggestion: We should create a nationwide network of government-sponsored therapeutic facilities where they can receive the help they need. 

It is my understanding that we had a greater network of mental facilities in the USA in the past, but most psychiatric hospitals were closed due to mismanagement and shady practices. Let’s do it right this time…
1. There should be a building on the property for people in crisis. It would be staffed by doctors, nurses, mental health professionals and security guards. If you are brought here, you can’t leave until given clearance from a doctor. 

2. There should be a less “locked down” section for people who are making progress and can handle more freedom to walk the grounds and interact freely with other residents. There would still be intense therapy and support. Some people would stay here temporarily while others might require this level of support indefinitely. 

3. Finally, there should be a transition housing area. This is where people would live in their own apartments, perhaps with roommates, and receive the therapy and support required to reenter society. 

Why is it more humane to leave these people on the street? If it was my family member out there, I’d pray for this level of support.  

I work in a hospital. If a patient is a danger to themselves or others, we are allowed to hold them, even if they don’t want to stay. But our ability to be this proactive with support is limited to current patients. We cannot find people in crisis and bring them to the hospital.  Why not?"

Yes, the United States has done it since the 20s, however can it be as successful as other countries? Absolutely Not. The US only managed because freedom and federalism was inshrined in its belief, but now, with its population of 300 Million we are slowly seeing Freedom and Federalism Shatter. 

Meanwhile for countries like China, they has had one election in its ENTIRE HISTORY that MIGHT be considered fair in 1911-12, and right after they fucked it (Granted it was mainly because Yuan a Shikai was a power Hungry Warlord, especially since he controlled the Beiyang Army) and haven’t had a fair election since. A Large Population leads to extremism, it leads to strain in the economy in tough times, it leads a potentially devastating Impact betwen two Groups because there aren’t 2 Million Voters, there’s 200 Million. Out of that 200 Million let’s say even 00.1 percent are extremist, that still means there are now 20 000 Extremist for one group, who could turn to radical Terrorism or Warfare, and kills Thousands.

Furthermore they never Last. USA managed to remain politically stable past the 100 Million Population threshold in 1920, but a century later is now crumbling, with Left and Right Wing Groups Rioting in Streets (and thus leading to looting and destruction), forming their own Militias, Storming Key Government Buildings and effectively turning to Central American Democracy.

Meanwhile India, its slowly turning into a One Party State under Modi and the BJP. While the opposition still controls half of the governmemt, it’s almost completly splintered and useless, with the LARGEST opposition only having a mere 53 seats compared to the BJPs +300 seats, and even before this has had insurgencies (most notably the Northeastern Indian Insurgencies led by Anti-Government Splinter Groups aswell as the Communist Naxalite Party in Central India) aswell as deadly Foreign Wars, conflicts and even Genocides and Invasions.

Then there’s Russia, which I don’t even need to explain. While their elections have remained Semi-Free since 1991, that’s rapidly changing furthermore they have been led by the Iconic KGB Strongman Dictator for the past Two Decades.

I just don’t believe Democracy can survive in Countries like this, which is why I think people having a Fuss about “This \*Massive Country\* is getting so Authoritarian! They are restricting Peoples Freedoms” is just silly because they have tried Democracy, and it has gotten them nowhere."
0,2022-08-06,CMV: It is hypocritical to be either for incest or polyamory but against the other because they’re both basically the same in terms of ramifications.,u/FireMiko,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whl2s0/cmv_it_is_hypocritical_to_be_either_for_incest_or/,changemyview,"I never understood how the majority of Leftists can be so pro-poly all the while decrying incest and putting it in the same depraved category as pedophilia, could someone please explain the logic here?

Because when you really think about it, both relationship types are *extremely* similar with how they’re perceived by the Outside World, and it makes no sense to call yourself a Leftist and say you’re for full marriage equality if you support either one but not the other. Let me make an outline and go down the list on how they’re similar…

* **Both are the current last frontiers for marriage equality that involve consenting adults**

* **Both unfortunately get a bad rep due to the existence of some unfortunate side-effects and skeevy power dynamics that can only exist in these forms.** For incest it’s any opposite-sex incest which can lead to inbreeding as well as the fact that the term can also encompass intergenerational incest such as parent/child and the like. With Poly it’s because the definition also applies to toxic one-sided poly like misogynistic religious cult Polygyny. (One man + many women, basically a harem.)

But here’s the thing, these structures aren’t inherent to either *all* incest or *all* Poly. Incest can also just as mean a pair of gay brothers or cousins who have a 1-5 year age difference and likewise Poly also equally applies to egalitarian structures such as two straight couples shacking it up as a Quad, a Lesbian Triad, and/or both the husband and a wife in a marriage dating whoever they want separately from each other. Why should these equal and non-harmful arrangements be punished and judged just because of the few bad incestuous and poly apples? Don’t you think it’s unfair?

In fact the Poly community actually does quite the good job in cracking down and policing bad behavior so that the poly arrangements remain fully consensual and equitable - anyone who’s spent anytime in the Poly community should know how hard they come down on stuff like OPP, (Short for One Penis Policy, basically Polygynous Harem Builders) Unicorn Hunting (OPP wearing a Bi mask) and Poly Under Duress. If you happen to practice any of these forms of *unethical* poly you will be mocked and shamed right out of the community.

So why can’t it be the same for incest? There should be a community dedicated to Consanguinity Rights but only for same-sex couples and couples within the same generation (siblings or cousins) while naming and shaming any Hetero or Intergenerational (especially if the latter started when one party was a minor) Incest. Why can’t the government legalize Incest &amp; Poly Marriage but only keep it to *some* forms of Poly &amp; Incest? For instance only same sex siblings or cousins should be allowed marriage rights while keeping it illegal for hetero and/or intergenerational couples like parent/child. Polygamy should also be legalized but only kept to the egalitarian arrangements like Group Marriages while dismissing &amp; arresting any Polycules that even have a whiff of the one man + multiple women arrangement. This is how you prevent abuse while not denying behaving parties their rights, simply grant the rights to the ethical relationships while cracking down and outlawing the unethical ones.

And for those of you who are in favor of poly but not incest (or the other way around) even in the scenarios I explained above mind explaining your reasoning for it? How do you justify not being hypocritical by supporting one thing yet decrying the other that’s based on very similar parameters?"

I have 150,000 hours in coding, design, gaming non stop since 3 years old in 1980 proof: [https://www.crystalfighter.com/a.html](https://www.crystalfighter.com/a.html).   I've been #1 world in many difficult video games that are harder than chess, yet got none of the respect a chess master would get.  In some countries chess masters are even elected as officials because people know their intellect is refined.  Video games however get no respect, despite being very very difficult to make at a high level.  People think video games are for kids, executive bean counters disrespect the craft and are out to exploit people for money which when they produce shoddy product people disrespect video games even more.  I'm going to give my take:

&amp;#x200B;

I started making video games because I wanted to make money and play a game no one ever made before.  When the money didn't come, I found out the pursuit of the art form itself was better than anything money could buy me.  Video games are the ultimate art form, using all artistic endeavors man has ever devised and coalescences them into an ultimate symphony.  You need painting, drawings, sculpting, music composed, musical notes, writing plots, gripping emotion, architectural alignment, societies with government, presented in a way to impact the audience.  On top of the classical respected arts, you have to know how the brain works to reward it cerebrally, animation, action paced reflex situations, puzzles, and more.  No other art form demands of all the other art forms and then still needs more.  One could say video games are the ultimate art form, case in point: Flappy Bird.

&amp;#x200B;

;)

&amp;#x200B;

I mused about my art form because it's totally disrespected, yet is deeper than all that came before...  This prompt came from my search from the one composer who said a quote I was looking for akin to,""I'm thrusting a spear into the void no one's entered, not looking this way or that for inspiration.""  If anyone knows that composer or quote, I'd be happy.  I wanted to make a secondary quote off it something like,""I'm analyzing the thrown spears of all composers, feeling how close to the target I believe they got, and then averaging their finding where the target is."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up finding a inspirational quote list from famous composers and saw I have much in common with them just because I pour my heart and soul into my art: [https://racheltaylorgeier.org/2017/04/15/75-inspirational-composer-quotes/](https://racheltaylorgeier.org/2017/04/15/75-inspirational-composer-quotes/)

&amp;#x200B;

Quotes that resonated with me:

&amp;#x200B;

  Georg Frideric Handel: “I should be sorry if I only entertained them. I wish to make them better.”

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: Shows like Rawhide/Rifleman/Cheyanne were not just cowboy shows, they taught a moral to do the right thing at the right time... So people who watched em were better.  Today's shows teach selfishness and exploitation of your fellow man so are trash.

&amp;#x200B;

Bela Bartok: “Competitions are for horses, not artists.”

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: Get by and get art done.  The rat race is for rats.

&amp;#x200B;

Franz Liszt: “Mournful and yet grand is the destiny of the artist.”

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: This really should be the destiny of all, but many pursuing the wrong thing catch it.

&amp;#x200B;

George Gershwin: “I frequently hear music in the heart of noise.”

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: In this bustling life, you can get see things you wouldn't if not pressed into it.

&amp;#x200B;

Gustav Holst: “Music, being identical with heaven, isn’t a thing of momentary thrills, or even hourly ones. It’s a condition of eternity.”

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: An artist mind is always creating, everywhere they go, they're there, but their mind is not always also there.

&amp;#x200B;

Joseph Haydn: “There was no one near to confuse me, so I was forced to become original.”   

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: The hivemind is a terrible thing to mind. Do your own thing, and if you draw too much inspiration, you'll end up tracing someone else's work which leads us to the one everyone heard before:  Igor Stravinsky: “Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Frederick Delius: “There is only one real happiness in life and that is the happiness of creating.”

&amp;#x200B;

Musing: I explained this in my opener. I wanted to make video games for money.  Now I make them for the sake of making them, money does come, but I've been ripped off by giant corporations more often than not.  Doesn't Google, Apple, Kongregate, MTV, Amazon, Twitch have enough money yet? Do they need to rip off small developers too?

&amp;#x200B;

""Well I didn't get rich by writing a bunch of checks"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H27rfr59RiE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H27rfr59RiE)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start to close with two quotes that basically say I should get back to crafting my art:

&amp;#x200B;

J.S. Bach: “I was obliged to be industrious. Whoever is equally industrious will succeed equally well.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Johannes Brahms: “Without craftsmanship, inspiration is a mere reed shaken in the wind.” (And with this, I'll be industriously pushing my craft forward today)

&amp;#x200B;

And close with:

&amp;#x200B;

 Toru Takemitsu: “Music is a form of prayer.”

&amp;#x200B;

Please pray for me. God bless, I'm gonna start my day,

I think many of you may already know this, but it took me years to realize it. I'd been eating up all of their videos and listening to them only through these pieces, one song at a time, and only the ones with visual pieces attached to them, on YouTube. 

Once I became obsessed enough and started looking for/at older videos, and came across some less engaging/distracting videos, like the one for for Skyscrapers (which is a great video, but visually more trance-inducing than awe provoking and attention hoarding, as other newer videos have been), that actually left some room in my attention capacity to really listen to the music, I said ""FUCK! They sound great!"" and decided to listen to a whole album. And then another. And then the rest of them. 

And they are great. I mean they're tight, and can sound poppy, and groovy, and noisy, and sexy, and melancholy, and so much more throughout the years, with never less than outstanding lyrics. But had I not obsessed that much about their music videos, and just stayed in the ""they're the band with the crazy complicated one shot music videos! the one that started with the treadmills one, right?"", which is where I think most people stay.

Bottom line is: I absolutely adore how even having more than 20 years together, they're still championing the taking a band beyond the basics, and making of their work (partially at least) a whole AV experience. But making such great videos, with such outrageously complex and detail-ridden ideas and executions, ends up somehow preventing newcomers from actually realizing how great of a band they are."
0,2022-08-06,CMV: Incest is morally and genetically okay in most cases,u/MemeLordPatricia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whoha3/cmv_incest_is_morally_and_genetically_okay_in/,changemyview,"This does not include, sibling x sibling, parentxchild, and uncle/aunt x niece/nephew. Those are disgusting and should stay illegal as they have a significantly higher chance of resulting in birth defect. 


However, 


In most cases, children that are the product of incest are perfectly healthy. For example, the offspring of second cousins, (their parents are cousins) has around a 3.5% chance of birth defect. Unrelated couple have 2-3% chance. Couples can also go through genetic testing to ensure they have low risks.  As long as there’s no weird dynamic (like an uncle, aunt, authority figure, etc.) it’s psychologically fine too. Couples that were childhood best friends are often considered cute, so why the double standard?

P.S. I have not engaged in any form of incest, and I don’t plan to.

For example my ideal would be:
Pale to medium skin
Black straight long hair
Big coloured eyes (which colour doesn’t matter just not brown)
Small and straight or slightly upturned nose
Full dsl lips
Arched eyebrows 
Medium boobs
Small waist flat stomach no abs
Medium wide hips that are round no hip dips 
Medium-big round ass 
No body hair 

Maybe men don’t have it down to every detail cuz they don’t care about certain details but they have it down to what’s important for them. And that ideal doesn’t change. 

And whoever they consider going out with or being with, they know how she differs from the ideal in their mind and how she doesn’t measure up 

And this secretly bothers them at some level even if they don’t admit it. Their woman’s flaws and how she is not ideal ideal is something they don’t like and they secretly wish she had bigger boobs or small waist or bigger ass or fuller lips. They may not say it because they love her but they may look at other females or just be dissatisfied with how their woman looks in certain details 

And when she gets old or fat or has babies that ruin her body, the man notices and wishes her body was how it was before."

0,2022-08-06,CMV: It makes more sense to base a livable wage argument around what is an acceptable amount of profit to make by being a landlord,u/VesaAwesaka,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whu8pc/cmv_it_makes_more_sense_to_base_a_livable_wage/,changemyview,"Livable wage will basically make everything more expensive. It starts at the minimum wage jobs but people making above the livable wage wont be willing to accept a decline in their quality of life to help to lowest paid people and will ask for higher wages. This will lead to everything else increasing in price. Making a once livable wage no longer livable. On top of that there are tons of people who don't need a livable wage as they do not live alone and don't necessarily want to. This factor will purely lead to price increases. In my mind that's not really a large factor but a factor nonetheless.

Because everything is increasing in price this will make things more costly for landlords and they will want to increase rent to cover their increased costs or keep their quality of life. Beyond that, realistically this would also increase the cost of building too. This factor is relevant but not as important.

Variables that should be factored into our calculations about what is acceptable profit include but may not be limited to costs(taxes, upkeep, interest rates, montages, staff), risk taken with investment, cost of living, alternative sectors for investment and their return, and risk taken with tenants. We also have to factor in that the cost of the landlords can change from year to year. Some years a building might require major repairs.

One might argue that we should just set caps on rent without factoring in any of this but that will lead to some decline in supply as certain units become unprofitable or arent worth the risk for a low profit in a world where prices are increasing.

A livable wage needs to assume that there is a net profit to cut into and that the net profit is still going to be worth taking risks with the lower purchasing power of money.

Now this may seem really simple but rarely do i ever see any livable wage post mention anything about what is an acceptable amount of landlord profit. I think people who post about livable wage(but don't call for state control) avoid this because every single landlords situation is going to be different. We need to be assuming there's a chunk of profit we can cut into and still make real-estate investment worthwhile.

Increase to a livable wage-&gt;increased prices for everything-&gt;landlords now need to charge more rent to break even or keep profit margin/quality of life/attract investment-&gt;leading to the livable wage no longer being livable. If we dont allow them to increase rent then they will stop building unprofitable apartments leading to less supply.

The key piece of info that matters on all this is how much you feel is acceptable profit for a landlord to make and there are a lot of variables that go into that. Different landlords have different costs and have to take different levels of risks.

487,2022-08-06,cmv: K-12 Educators push a false narrative that all college degrees are good investments,u/Suitable-Ad-8598,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whuw50/cmv_k12_educators_push_a_false_narrative_that_all/,changemyview,"Students in high school are bombarded with pressure to go to college by educators, with high emphasis on the ranking of the schools they are accepted into and no emphasis on the majors that they choose.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their lives—I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

One alternative view to this view that I think holds a lot of weight is that the reason the US allows the cartels to exist, is that if the US actively went after the cartels, the cartels would all band together overnight and start waging an insurgency war on the US across the border, and that would get very ugly, very fast. With that said.

The US has a 10 million dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of ""El Mencho"", the leader the CJNG cartel. With that kind of money for the reward, if the US actually truly wanted him captured or killed, Delta Force/DEVGRU/CIA SOG would be in and out of Mexico with the job done before you have enough time to watch the 11 clock news, roll in the sack with your spouse, and wake up to see the crack of dawn.

With the technology our intelligence community has, they know where every single one of those b*****ds are, at all times. They know where they are. So, clearly, that reward is just for show, to placate the public. They dont need anyone's help finding them.

So, then, the question is, why? My view is that the US allows them to operate because the money from drugs sold in the US that the cartels moved into the US, go to funding the US black budget."
47,2022-08-06,"CMV: physical violence is never an acceptable response to non-physical actions, no exceptions.",u/drnnvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whvbtd/cmv_physical_violence_is_never_an_acceptable/,changemyview,"I've been having this discussion with some friends and we couldn't agree so I'm giving this topic to reddit: 

When is it acceptable to use physical violence? 

My take: there is no verbal/emotional/mental offense that would give you the right to respond physically. If someone offends your mother, you should stay on their level in your response, which is to say, verbal. 

If someone threatens you with violence or even death but only does so verbally, that doesn't give you the right to hit them in order to deter them, as long as calling the police is an option, which you should be doing instead of playing vigilante. 

If your husband cheats on you, that doesn't give you the right to slap them during a heated argument, as their offense was emotional, not physical. 

If your ex keyed your car yesterday, that's not an excuse for hitting/attacking them now. Staying on their level (which was damage to your property) would mean e.g. slashing their tires in response, although that response would be both childish and illegal, and again, you should let the police deal with them instead. 

If someone is not an active physical threat to you or to someone else, then I don't care if they killed your mother years ago - if they went to jail then they got their punishment from the right authorities, if they didn't, then the most (and least) you should be doing is calling said authorities on them. 

When I believe it's acceptable to use physical violence: 

Someone is an active physical threat to you, to someone else, or to your property. By this I mean they are physically assaulting you, or pointing a weapon at you, or blocking your way and not allowing you to leave (shoving your way past them is fine in this case). 
Physically protecting your property is fair game with non-lethal means. Everything else is unacceptable, as you should never be the one to take a fight to physical levels. 

I know the justice system is not perfect, but that doesn't give anyone the right to deal out physical punishment if it's not done in self-defense. That includes slapping your SO even if you're a woman, or spanking your child. 

Change my view, I know there are lots of counter arguments here but we couldn't really organize them with my friends, so I'm curious to see how this will go. :)

Edit: I thought this was implied, but police officers on duty are acting as part of the justice system, and it is their job to deal with threats, sometimes by violence, so people wouldn't have to resort to vigilantism. Off-duty however, they are not an exception as individuals."

I’m part of the “entitled millennial” generation. (That owes a mortgage.) If you make a legal agreement to buy a plot of land, believing a house will be built on that land, you still owe payments towards that plot of land.

The Chinese who made the legal agreement to buy what they said they will buy need to do so. Or at least they need to make mortgage payments until they can find a clause that frees them.

If they don’t? Then that’s 100% their free will to go against the mortgage agreement they signed and they should get nothing.

Edit:

FYI: this is about the current event where a massive number of Chinese people congregated outside banks, demanding the money that they have paid towards mortgages back, saying they will stop paying them. 

They are doing this due to the company that was building the buildings (evergreen) stopped being able to make its payments and it snowballed."

All the problems, relationships, worries, and memories you have are so insignificant when comparing it to the scale of the universe and the fact that one day we are all going to die. We are so small that fascinates me how people take life so seriously.

When I faced this truth for the first time I had a massive existential crisis, I would often question myself ""What's the point?"" or ""Why am I here?"". I would question everything around me trying to answer these questions, but after some thinking I concluded that everything is about perspective and how you embrace this reality that life has no meaning.

Therefore, people have different views on life based on their background (how and where they were raised), such as:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Religion:

People for centuries used religion to give meaning to life and still use religion to this day. I'm not saying having a religion is wrong or false, but an interpretation of life and extremely beneficial to society regarding morals and ethics.

\- Social:

Other people often associates the meaning of life with their personal relationships. Making their close partners, parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and family their reason to keep going.

\- Curiosity &amp; Work:

There are also those who dedicate their lives for their work. They achieve this by making their work more meaningful and often associating this meaning with an impact to society. For instance, doctors, researchers, engineers that work hard to improve our lives. If you want a specific example, Elon Musk illustrates that.

\- Pleasure:

Others just work for money with no real meaning or impact, they simply replace pleasure/entertainment with meaning.

\- No meaning:

There are also the ones that just wake up, go to work, sleep, and repeat without questioning why they do what they do.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end of the day, you choose your meaning/purpose in life. Something you think it's worth living for. After such choice, you can come to the conclusion that you now have a purpose and you will probably feel fulfilled.

However, in the long run, life has no meaning because you had to give it meaning in the first place."

I will list everyway I have identified in which fat people harm others by doing so.

* Obesity causes many illnesses, even if it isn't the direct cause being obese is likely to make almost any health situation worse. Thus meaning fat people take up hospital beds and medical resources that might otherwise belong to people who cared for their body. They raise the demand and thus raise the price and lower the supply of medical treatment.
* Fat people simply take up more space. On planes, on busses, everywhere. Fat people make others deeply uncomfortable. Not to mention, hygiene is much harder to achieve when you're overweight so in these now tightened spaces, they smell bad.
* Overweight people consume an irrational share of food that might otherwise be used to feed the undernourished.
* When fat people die from health conditions as a result of their physical state, this often causes serious emotional distress to loved ones that simply could've been avoided.

I feel the same way about my age as a felon feels about their charges, because my social skill level isn't at my own age level. It's probably at the level of someone born in 2000. That's also why I feel I could relate to and socialize with y2k peeps better than peeps of my own age.

I also think there are better resources to learn and achieve better that were only available for those who were born later (remote tutoring on Skype or Zoom, for example. I NEEDED that when I struggled in algebra in 8th grade.) Also, I can listen to audiobooks these days and multitask that with chores or games so I can be more productive at once. I needed Audible / Kindle in my schooling years, so I could have fun while listening to the required reading at the same time. They were definitely available to students born in 2000.

0,2022-08-06,CMV:Nothing does actually exist.,u/Raphael-Rose,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/whyavn/cmvnothing_does_actually_exist/,changemyview,"Hello everyone.

I believe that **nothing exists**, and at the moment, in discussing with experts on the subject, I have not found any argument that really convinced me otherwise. Sure, I have heard sensible and plausible arguments, but nothing that has ever really scratched the surface.

Let us begin by saying that one philosopher who has deeply ingrained this thought in me is the Greek sophist Gorgias. His argument - skeptical in nature - was divided into four axioms. The four axioms are:

1. Nothing exists.
2. Even if something existed, we could not know it.
3. Even if we could know it, such knowledge could not be communicated to anyone.
4. Even if it could be communicated, it could not be understood. 

I add some elaborations on the individual points:

1. If something exists, it will be either being or non-being or being and non-being together. Now non-being is not there, but neither is being there. Because, if there were, it could only be either eternal or begotten or eternal and begotten together. Now, if it is eternal, it has no principle and, having no principle, it is infinite and, if it is infinite, it is nowhere and, if it is nowhere, it does not exist. But neither can being be generated: for, if it were born, it would be born either from being or from non-being. But it is not born from being, for, if it is being, it is not born, but is already; nor from non-being, for non-being cannot generate.

2. If thought things cannot be said to exist, the reverse will also be true, that being cannot be said to be thought. The inference that ""if thought does not exist, being is not thought"" is right and consequent. And that thought things do not exist is clear: for if the thought exists, then all thought things exist, however they are thought; this is contrary to experience, for it is not true that if one thinks a man flying or chariots running over the sea, behold a man flying or chariots running over the sea. So that it is not true that the thought exists. More, if the thought exists, the nonexistent cannot be thought, because contraries touch contrary attributes. But this is absurd, because unicorns and talking donkeys and many other unreal things are also thought. Therefore being is not thought.

3. Since existing things are visible and audible and generally sensible, and of them the visible are perceptible by sight and the audible by hearing, and not vice versa, how then will they be expressed to another? Since the medium by which we express ourselves is speech, and speech is not the object, the thing, it is not existent reality what we express to our neighbor, but only speech, which is other than the object. In the same way, therefore, that the visible cannot become audible, and vice versa, so being, insofar as it is an object external to us, cannot become word, which is in us. And not being word cannot be manifested to others.



**EDIT:** I think many who answered did not actually read all the axioms, so I won't answer to anyone who didn't or that didn't try to understand them in the first place."

If you ordered one of these things for the very first time, bit into it, and scalded your mouth...you should have learned. Twice? Three times? Every time? You should work on your self-control.   At home, there are foods that are notorious for causing mouthburns to the impatient.  Hot pockets come to mind. So do mountain pies.  If you've burned your mouth on any of those foods more than once, it seems to be a self-control issue.

This is motivated by a post to another sub where a redditor complained that his sister always wants to photograph the food before anybody eats when his family goes out for dinner.  The responses overwhelmingly run to redditors expressing shock and horror at not being able to dig right in to food that is, likely, to hot to eat as it arrives.  Lots of burned mouths among the contributors there, I expect.

So, change my view.  I believe that if you can't wait a few moments for food to cool, you lack self-control."

Let's say you have Person A and Person B. Person A has remained at a healthy weight for their entire life, yet will never receive applause or be lauded for doing so. Person B, who allows themselves to become obese and then proceeds to drop that excess weight, will receive significant recognition for doing so. They will be regarded as an inspiration. This is because they have allegedly demonstrated strength and fortitude for accomplishing such a task. However, isn't the self-control required to maintain a healthy weight your entire life even more of an accomplishment, or at least the same level, as that which is needed to lose a significant amount of weight? 

Same deal with any other sort of vice such as drug, alcohol, nail-biting addictions. We do not congratulate those people that never fall into those vices from the beginning. We would never say ""Great work Joel, it's another day that you've resisted becoming helplessly addicted to heroin!"" It just seems logically inconsistent for us to then congratulate the ones that fell into any of those traps in the first place. 

One important note is that I would be **totally fine** with congratulating people for dropping harmful vices, **if** we congratulated people for never falling into those vices just as much.

So, I think to change my view, you'll have to convince me that it's more admirable and deserving of praise to go from neutral, to extreme negative, back to neutral, than to just always remain at the neutral.

1. The US has no treaty that requires it to defend Taiwan.

Edited to add: an internal US law that requires the US to defend Taiwan can be changed by the US just like any law can be changed, and is not an agreement with Taiwan.

2. Defeating the People’s Republic of China would be extremely difficult and costly.  And not prevailing in a major war would be ruinous to the US and the strength of its commitments.

Edited to add: China could quickly take over Taiwan, and then, yes, there could be a stalemate between the US and the PRC.  That’d be damaging for everyone involved, including the US.  The US shouldn’t fight a war unless it is sure to win.

3. The US has never had a clear interest in Taiwan.  It was part of China for centuries and then ruled by Japan and that did not harm the US.

4. The People’s Republic of China has no plans to take over the few democracies that exist in East Asia (Japan and South Korea).

So, in short, the US shouldn’t put its reputation on the line to defend something that isn’t a key interest.  It’s best to let China take Taiwan without direct US involvement against China, since that would be less damaging than a U.S. defeat."

Rodriguez v US she basically said cops can extend the search to wait for a drug dog, but only if they claim its for something else.  Overall I just feel she is very over-hyped . 

Also I think her opinions on the 2nd ammendment are just outrageously contrived. It's like if we had an ammendment that said ""healthcare, being necessary to support the citizens of a society; the right to an abortion shall not be infringed"" and then trying to argue that if healthcare is provided you can outlaw abortion because the amendment is about providing healthcare.

This is unprecedented, being done with limited due process, and with the expectation that there won’t be legal challenges by the oligarchs. 

&gt; “The idea of a yacht or jet valued in the hundreds of millions seized and liquidated administratively is new territory,” said Franklin Monsour Jr., a former federal prosecutor and a white collar defense lawyer with Orrick in New York.Mr. Monsour said the administration and Congress may be banking that many Russian oligarchs will not muster a legal challenge to a new, expedited process because that would risk subjecting themselves to U.S. jurisdiction.

&gt; “It will likely be without challenge,” he said. “And the government knows that.”

Yet it’s unclear what crime the oligarchs have committed that warrant a legal seizure. The only thing being used is that the oligarchs are “close to Putin”. That is not a crime. That is guilt by association. The only oligarchs who should have their assets seized are those that have actively violated the laws of war.

0,2022-08-07,CMV: Public service should be required in the U.S.,u/rwhelser,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wi9eca/cmv_public_service_should_be_required_in_the_us/,changemyview,"People tend to have a lot of opinions on various topics ranging from military/veteran benefits, welfare, minimum wage, and the like.  However, many (admittedly not all) of those same people have never seen any of those situations firsthand.

One way to help enlighten the public on many issues is requiring a minimum one year of public service--I would say either upon graduation of high school or during two semesters of college.  What do I mean by public service?  It could be either volunteering or working with a charity or other non-profit organization, local, state/county, or federal government, foreign (including Peace Corps) or military service.  **Important note:  The individual would be able to choose which type of public service they'd like to provide/work in**.  Additionally, people with disabilities or other limitations that would cause serious/functional harm would be exempt from this requirement.

I served in the military for a total of eight years and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Although we were at war for most of the time I was in, I was lucky in that I never deployed.  I did get to travel around the U.S. and was stationed in Japan for a year, and during those years, I was exposed to different cultures and norms that I wouldn't have experienced otherwise.  I made friends with people from all walks of life--people who grew up poor, wealthy, and in between, people who were taught to be hostile towards certain people/groups, even knew a few who had some pretty troubled backgrounds and were looking for a way to straighten themselves out.

After leaving the service, I worked for a number of government agencies, including Medicare and the Social Security Administration.  I dealt with people who needed help on a regular basis, and it made me realize many of the struggles that people will face, especially later in life.  It put a lot of policies, programs, and laws into perspective as well.  It was pretty interesting having discussions with people about programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security (among others) where others in the discussion would rely on political/media talking points and really had no idea what the programs were about or the intention behind them.  For example, many people don't understand that Medicare Parts C and D are administered by private insurance companies, not the government.  Or that Medicare doesn't cover a lot of things that are *more than likely* to happen to senior citizens and many people don't realize that until they wind up facing those problems.

About a decade after I had left the service, I worked for a nonprofit organization that specialized in workforce development.  I oversaw a group of 65 teens/young adults who came from very poor socioeconomic backgrounds, broken homes, and the like.  Many had no real adult guidance throughout their lives, and so the program I worked with involved being a job coach to these teens/young adults as they worked for local facilities (schools, city offices, rec centers, restaurants, etc.) and I helped guide and coach them so that they would be well prepared for engaging in the labor market either upon completion of the program (some of the adults were hired permanently by the employer upon completion of the program) when they were done with school.

That experience, while it only lasted about six months, really opened my eyes to what many poor families endure in the U.S.  I know so many who criticize those who seek welfare benefits as ""lazy"" and just not wanting to work, and in situations as these, it's more about a cycle of poverty rather than a lack of desire for something better.

Therefore, I would argue that mandating at least one year of public service can help people understand what they otherwise might take for granted.  It could develop compassion for people who don't have as much, and maybe even help in some of these other divides (such as politics) that seemingly have become the norm.

To change my view, I would expect someone to tell me how not involving public service would make a person just as understanding of some of the issues that go on in this country and around the world, or how imposing such a program would be more detrimental than beneficial for individuals, communities, or the country as a whole.

I look forward to the discussion."

A math professor in college once taught me this trick and he said as a result, the number four is the best number out there.  Why?  Because everything out there breaks down to four.  Don't believe me?  Let me throw out some examples:

Let's the number one (1).  How could that possibly break down to four?  Easy, let's look at the number of letters in ""one.""  There are three.  Okay, well how many letters are in ""three?""  There are five.  How many letters are in ""five?""  There are four.  Now how many are in four?  Well isn't that interesting, there are four.  Supposedly, you could do that with everything out there.

By that logic, the number four is the best and most interesting number out there.

However please let me know if am I wrong and point out any holes in it. 

I believe that our “gender” is the individual’s definition of the masculinity and femininity that they identify within themselves. They might see more of one or the other in their identity, or as gender fluid people have observed, both might ebb and flow. 

So your gender is up to you to decide, and it can be male, female, gender fluid, or any other pattern you can identify. I believe this is where the answer to “what is a woman” is.

However, I believe masculinity and femininity are archetypes that exist in nature, masculinity being order (logic, structure, limits, etc) &amp; femininity chaos (creativity, freedom, boundlessness). These archetypes are part of nature, and every form of life manifests aspects of both of them interacting and making it up. These can be personality traits, or even physical traits, such as body shape, hormones, genitalia; males have broad shoulders and have testosterone (strength, purpose), females have broader hips and  breasts for feeding (nurturance). There is a lot more about this, but these are just some examples. 

And so, sex is defined by these physical/biological traits we have. There is male and female, but there’s also hermaphroditism. It’s not black and white, but we can generalize each pattern into a concept, and thus classify different parts of the spectrum into separate categories. This allows us to simplify reality, and thus make it easer to understand.

Like, how about you all stop and just let people enjoy things. Can anyone deny that they are just upset about diversity and that’s all they think about when they judge these movies?

0,2022-08-07,CMV: pregnant women in states that recognize life begins at conception are aiding illegal immigrants,u/fuckyouusernames,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wiiqi1/cmv_pregnant_women_in_states_that_recognize_life/,changemyview,"I do not hold this view morally or believe this is morally right, but in regards to the law, I believe that any US state which legally defines life beginning at conception must also recognize that these the ""living humans"" are not US citizens (as US citizenship begins at birth), and therefore pregnant women who are physically present in these states are (at minimum) aiding (and potentially trafficking) these ""living humans"" in illegal immigration.

The definition for US citizenship is defined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution as beginning at BIRTH. The Fourteenth Amendment: Section 1:

All persons **born** or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Therefore the ""living humans"" recognized by these states and hosted by pregnant women (both citizens and non US citizens women) in this state are **NOT** US citizens.

Further more these states do not have the legal authority to define requirements for US citizenship, as US citizenship is a federal Amendment to the Constitution. Additionally, passports and visas are federal documents, so these states are not legally able to give these ""living humans"" a passport or visa for their illegal occupation of the US.

Since these ""living humans"" are physically in the US, but are not US citizens nor do they have a visa or a passport, their presence in the US must be considered illegal. **Therefore these unborn ""living humans"" are illegal immigrants.**

Women who are pregnant and host these illegal immigrants, especially those who are aware of their pregnancy (as there might be some legal grey areas as I am not sure we you can hold someone accountable for aiding a crime if the individual was not aware of who they were aiding or in what they were aiding), are aiding these illegal immigrants. These women provide shelter, food, and safety to these illegal immigrants and are solely responsible for the illegal immigrants physical presence in the US. Additionally one could argue, that these illegal immigrants are being trafficked against their will by these women as the illegal immigrants have no control or say in their physical location.

In conclusion, these pregnant women should be held accountable and legally tried for aiding illegal immigrants in the US.

Once again, I do not morally believe this is right, but this is how I interpret the legal recognition of ""life being at conception"" and the implications it has on citizenship in the US.

^Additionally, ^I ^am ^also ^pro ^expansion ^of ^immigration ^and ^the ^easing ^of ^the ^naturalization ^process, ^and ^believe ^that ^those ^who ^make ^sacrifices, ^such ^as ^traveling ^hundreds ^of ^miles ^and ^leaving ^everything ^they ^have ^ever ^known ^behind ^to ^experience ^the ^American ^Dream ^should ^be ^allowed ^to ^experience ^it."

The universe is so astronomically humongous, with an in-comprehendible amount of galaxies each harbouring earth like planets (and probably life). **However**, whilst this may seem promising, the size of the universe and the distance between stars is probably why we will never find any signs of alien life. The chances of humans evolving in the way that we did was so incredibly unlikely, and an argument can be made that the chances of intelligent life are minute, meaning that the nearest civilization could be incredible far away from us (assuming that they are not extinct yet). There were many times where humans nearly went extinct very early on (take for example the ice age where there was a period when our population was in the thousands). Maybe humanity was lucky to have evolved perfectly to be able to survive something like that. 

Even if simple life is **very common**, it is unlikely that we will ever find signs of it (because they do not emit any signals). The only way we could find evidence is if we could look for signs in the planets atmosphere, but I find it unlikely that future humans would be willing to travel 4 light years, to the nearest star, in a hopeless attempt at finding something that could very well not exist. 

The **great filter** is another worrying factor: humanity created weapons of mass destruction very early on, and using such weapons could create an incredible stunt in the development of our civilization - maybe there is a threshold that alien life can reach before it destroys itself. This is a good solution to the fermi paradox, but I believe that the better solution is simply the fact that we haven't found it yet, meaning that it is likely incredibly far away and the chances of of our civilizations existing simultaneously are **very slim**. 

I, personally, would love it if we found any form of life, but I just don't see it happening.. ever."

DeSantis is younger than Trump, which is a good thing considering how demanding being president can be.

DeSantis has experience in politics that Trump didn't going into 2016.

0,2022-08-07,CMV: human morality is bullshit,u/eleventwenty2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wiknv4/cmv_human_morality_is_bullshit/,changemyview,"As a 23F in today's world who overthinks I can't bring myself to terms with the concept of having a child, or even continuing to exist.

I honestly believe no humans inherently ""deserves"" to live but just happens to be born and if they die they die if they live they live. What we do as a species is both abhorrent and simultaneously null and void. 



Human beings are inherently selfish and parasitic beings. And this logical argument can effectively be proven or disproven based on our simplistic understanding so far with the brains we have. So it doesn't really matter whether we act like other animals or not, because animals have varying sensed of morality of empathy but usually within their own species. Actually I would argue animals display more empathy since they will display this interspecies as well. And since we designed our own morality it can be anything. Especially since we base our morality off religion which again, animals don't practice, and we  entirely made up. 


By this definition we have created with primitive means, the morality rulebook that makes us better or worse than other beings. But this morality is arbitrary  changes based on context and at its core  all humans want to do is reproduce their own DNA, take over, invade and demolish all natural preexisting biological or man made forms in order to claim domination, be better than the next guy, and produce garbage that leads to my biggest enemy, earning money. 

Money is a plague. Animals don't use money. Nothing except humans has created and uses and argued and kills eachother over resources we have given a value of a certain amount of money. Sure animals fight over food and water. But it's no more personal than that. They need it to survive. As humans we don't NEED money to survive but we have created a system within it makes it unbearably difficult for most humans which are pathetic creatures in the first place 


Humans are anxiety fueled, fear based, hivemind creatures that are willfully ignorant, have a need for control and spread like wildfire with no natural predators. Bringing a child into this world is by our own definition, extraordinary immoral and self serving. If as humans we are spiritually and conceptually superior  why do we fall short of those abilities and settle into our animalistic instincts of sex ,food, sleep, reproduce and be selfish? 

Are we not at a point as a culture yet where we can acrually grow and develop? Will we ever get to that point or will be be our own well deserved demise? 

Will we ruin this planet and go on to ruin more? (People going to Mars now) How does anybody justify having a child, even just existing seems entitled to me.  Continuing to exist without taking responsibility and taking one more human off the planet seems so extremely selfish and childish. I struggle severely every day that I am forced to exist in this place and if I make my own decision to leave I will only bring sadness and pain to those I love. I wish it was the opposite.

0,2022-08-07,CMV: Terms like “toxic masculinity” use identity as a scapegoat and allow behavior rooted in sexism in preferred identities and not the targeted identity.

The people who can actually make a difference in this story and this persons life is………..? 


In instances like this, the faulty belief system that blames a gender for a set of behaviors will have you excuse behavior because the person displaying it is the preferred gender. 

That’s the type of rabbit hole that this thinking creates, which props up discrimination, bad behavior, homophobia, and all types of other shit. It’s plain to see yet we act so attached to identity that we do it to a fault and become actors of behavior we supposedly find abhorrent. 

Well, we don’t have to. Everyone has internalized sexism to address in themselves, and that isn’t our fault, but it is our responsibility to deal with. If we aren’t doing that internally, what we are doing externally is likely acting out the same unjust, inhuman behavior to other humans based on a faulty belief system. Being a specific sex doesn’t absolve you from internalizing sexist beliefs.

EDIT: my view has been changed to “the term ‘toxic masculinity’ is more useful at pairing ‘toxicity’ and ‘masculinity’ than it is at helping us understand how sexism works against us all. Same can be said for the term ‘feminism’.”"
0,2022-08-07,CMV: (U.S.A.) The Biden-Harris Border Policy is Unacceptably Lenient,u/PlinyToTrajan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wilpmy/cmv_usa_the_bidenharris_border_policy_is/,changemyview,"I acknowledge the fundamental difficulty of immigration policy particularly for a wealthy, powerful, diverse and multiracial/multicultural democracy like the U.S.A.  The needs of economic and political refugees for hospitality are serious.  Immigration contributes to the U.S.A.'s vibrancy and economic success.

Even so, my view is that the world is not yet ready for true cosmopolitanism or liberal near-open-borders immigration.  It is not that immigration should not exist, but the popularly elected government should have administrative control over it and it should take place exclusively through safe and legal routes.  Widespread illegal immigration should not be a phenomenon that affects the U.S.A.  

The Biden-Harris policy seems either negligently or intentionally feckless.  

In 2016, the Obama administration argued to the Supreme Court that its de facto protection of certain well-defined categories of unlawfully present immigrants was appropriate due to a lack of enforcement resources, notwithstanding the Congressional directive to detain all such persons,  see https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-674. The argument was essentially that Congress had made an  unfunded mandate. However, it hardly seems consistent with the law to wholly exempt certain categories of people from enforcement based on ""enforcement priorities.""  Rather, a policy of unpredictable enforcement could be used to remind people of their legal obligations; the law would have more reality and meaning that way.  

The Biden-Harris administration has continued on similar lines.  The messages the administration sends on immigration are equivocal.  The failure to present a clear plan, to take a firm stance against unlawful immigration, while nonetheless suggesting various protected statuses and the possibility of amnesty for unlawfully present persons, sends a mixed message and, for people considering the dangerous covert border crossing journey, provides no guidance.  

People smuggling is an extremely serious issue.  Not only are there grave crimes, like the instance of the 53 migrants who died in an overheated airless truck, but people smuggling empowers the worst possible people you could possibly empower: organized crime members who traffic in guns and drugs as well as people and are a corrupting influence in their own country and possibly ours.  The policy of tolerance, or at least equivocation, on illegal immigration empowers people smugglers' illegal trade.  The empowerment of people smuggling seems likely to generate more illegal immigrants because: (1) the smugglers will advertise and expand their businesses, and (2) the smugglers are organized crime members who will destabilize their own country to a greater extent if they become richer / more empowered.  

Rather than attempting to achieve their goals of a liberalized immigration policy through Executive non-enforcement, Democrats should advocate for those goals in Congress so that whatever numbers of immigrants make sense for the country can *all* arrive through safe *and* legal routes.  Yes, these arguments may not succeed in Congress, at least not for a while, but the alternative of derogating rule-of-law, having chaotic and covert immigration, and empowering people smugglers is no solution.  

I hope it is clear from my comments that I'm not hostile to immigration, or to the idea of the U.S.A. welcoming more legal immigrants than it currently does.  But the achievement of policy aims through intentional enforcement weakness, if that is indeed what the Biden administration intends, has side-effects that feel unacceptable.

I haven't even gotten into the political aspects, but I want Democrats to win elections and I think immigration policy is turning into a weakness for the administration electorally speaking.  I reflect that Donald Trump was  very protectionist on immigration and that did not prevent him from decisively winning the 2016 election.  I have a feeling the typical voter is open to having immigrants in their community but susceptible to concerns about rampant illegal immigration.

What happened in Ukraine exposed the weakness of the organisation not having enough power and collective force to not allow Russia to even step foot in the territory of Ukraine. Right now Europe's population is becoming less and less productive and gdp growth is slow. We are seeing that each country in Europe is becoming less and less powerful on its own. Let's take France and Germany, once the power in the world now is playing second fiddle to the US. Now you may ask what would be the advantage of becoming a federation. It would help with the immigration crisis (more organisation = less criseses for countries). More purchasing power and helping the west stay relevant for longer. It would help the rich poor divides between countries nowadays. So you can see that countries like Poland would have a higher minimum wage better healthcare etc... 
and for the argument that it would take power away from the people would be more like the USA and imagine if each state was on its own. It would help limit the power of corrupt politicians like Hungary's Victor Orban. Also for cultural differences it would be fine, each country can keep their language but still teach a second one at school (English sorry France).

I also hold this view and am open to changing it. However, many deltas were given along the lines of why any attempt to put the idea into practice would face challenges, and therefore it would be infeasible. I am less interested in arguments about specific policy solutions (though you are welcome to make them). I am more interested in the more fundamental premise: why *shouldn't* fines be based on wealth?

So for the purposes of this CMV, let's make a few assumptions, as I specified in the title:

1. **Wealth is federally-determined.** I know that defining this abstract concept in a specific way is problematic. But let's assume that those clever congressional staffpeople can figure it out. Let's assume that there is political will to give the IRS fantastic new powers to track capital gains and net worth, for example.
2. **Fines are progressive.** Just like we (ostensibly) have progressive tax brackets, we can come up with different coefficients based on wealth that apply to fines. However you want to define a ""significantly meaningful penalty"" is fine. We could also imagine mechanisms where local jurisdictions report fines to the IRS, which does the actual calculation and collection.

I'm setting these assumptions because again, I really want to focus on the ""should"" in my view. I am less concerned with the super-rich being penalized fairly and more with the poor being unjustly set back. I believe flat fines are just another factor that perpetuates the poverty-to-prison pipeline. (Try saying that five times fast.) I am seeking less practical arguments about a proposed implementation, and more constitutional or ethical arguments for why flat fines are better in principle. CMV!"

&gt; As of April 25, 2014, the only previously published materials that are considered canon are the six Star Wars films, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series and film, novels (where they align with what is seen on screen), and Part I of the short story Blade Squadron

Since then, the recent sequel trilogy features the lead actors from the original trilogy reprising the same roles. Spin off movies like Solo and Rogue One expand on characters or events mentioned in the original trilogy. Disney+ series like the Mandalorian, Obi-Wan, The Book of Boba Fett, and the recently announced Andor do the same. Even the recent video game, Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order, has a direct link to the original trilogy with an appearance of one of the original trilogy villains. 

As such, the Star Wars universe is stuck rehashing the ideas/concepts of a dated, nearly five decade old story, written by a man who openly admits [that dialogue](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/star-wars-archive-george-lucas-1999-interview/) is not his [strong suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tLf1JO5bvE).

Whether you are a fan of the police or not, showing contempt of officers is not illegal, even when done in front of them/at them. It is a form of non violent protesting and so long as it's done in a public format (or if done on private property, they have permission from the owner/s of said property), it is a constitutionally protected act. 

I believe that the moment an Officer ignores the constitution and uses their authority and power granted to them to quell their emotions after being offended by that, there should absolutely be a third party investigation into the incident, a trial, and said trial should not grant any qualified immunity. The officer in question, if found guilty, should also immediately be removed from duty and be required to take a remedial training course.

I have found no scripture that describes homosexuality in a negative light unless the acts were performed in the context of pedophilia or adultery (Paul talks about this in his letters to some of the churches while he is in prison). 

One scripture I have found cited by many Christians to dispute my claim is 2 Timothy 3:2, “For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.” 

It is said by those on the other side of this debate that when the verse talks about men being “lovers of their own selves” that this is referring to homosexuality and all the negative attributes that follow this are referenced with abhorrence. 

But if we take a look at the Greek translation that is the closest to the original scripture, because the Bible was written in Greek before English, we see that the Greek word “philautoi” means to love in a selfish way, not as in homosexuality. 

So I’m looking to see if there are scripture out there with a reasonable explanation and context to dispute my way of viewing things here.

The only time a government can intervene your personal property that you had paid tax buy is when it imposed a direct harm on the public. Which is why I support to ban rolling coal tunes.

Maths (fractions and percentages, understanding statistical significance), Geography (Population, Environmentalism, again statistics), Science (Refresher on scientific method, what counts as fair testing, bias), Health (A minimal perspective on diseases, gender, consent). I don't touch upon Art and Literacy since I am not as confident in those fields, however I'm sure there are other people who may see benefit in enhancing general knowledge in arts.

&amp;#x200B;

1. While there are people who are interested in a wide variety of topics, most people are happy to move away from secondary education and instead focus on their areas of interest in the form of post secondary education/jobs and careers.
2. If you're a good financial position, you have more opportunities (time) to explore new topics than someone who is focused on surviving.
3. Looking at how the education changes over time, it seems sensible that there should be an opportunity for people to update their knowledge of what is being taught today in society. e.g. plate tectonics is taught in schools today as accepted theory but this wouldn't have been common for children in the 1960s. This means that it is possible to have 60/70+ year olds with limited/zero understanding of geoscience if that is not their field of interest. In the future, it's likely there will be new topics that I will not be aware of simply because it is not on my radar. This was my initial motivation for this post:  [Sec. Chu Explains Plate Tectonics To Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=symYfq51aho&amp;t=2s)
4. There are many who complain about the education system and what is being taught to their children/grand-children today. e.g. Common Core Maths -  [Why Common Core math problems look so weird - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkQAxt1JXA) | Being forced to do or learn things differently to what we remember is uncomfortable but important if there is updated knowledge.
5. An additional example:  Education today for children has a higher focus on multi-culturalism than what many parents/grandparents would have had e.g. A 10-12 year old will have had exposure to the basic tenants of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Bahai, Secular Humanism, Hinduism etc. I suspect if given the optional classes, there will be a large number of people won't be interested in exploring the basics of other religions. A comedian doing a duo-act with his dad  [Jack Whitehall: Travels With My Father | Official Trailer \[HD\] | Netflix - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4PihmWMaSI) 

Possible problems that I can imagine:

\- Freedom of choice for adults | Children don't get choice.

\- Unsustainable model. | Children's education are supplemented by their families working.

\- Differentiation of material would be a nightmare. It would not make any sense for accountant to attend classes aimed secondary level mathematics, but a refresher in a different subject may be beneficial. -&gt; This would mean streamed education rather than mixed-level classes."

There are a few major reasons for this that I'll go over in the paragraphs below

&amp;#x200B;

**Universal Healthcare**

In Canada everyone receives government subsided healthcare rather then the insurance based system in the USA. This means that there are no $10,000 surgeries and nobody goes bankrupt from calling an ambulance which, in my opinion is much, much better then the US system where if you don't have insurance you could easily lose your life savings if you get sick. The benefits of this system is reflected in Canada's higher life expectancy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Government**

The government of Canada seems to work a whole lot better then the USA. They don't have the frankly garbage electoral college system that leads to minority rule (even in the House half the time) and they have a much easier time actually getting things done. There aren't any Trump's or Jan 6ths and the scandals are pretty tame from what I can tell 

&amp;#x200B;

**Education**

Generally going to college in Canada is far cheaper then in the USA, which leads to more people getting educated. Indeed, the average cost of college per year in Canada is \~$6,700 while in the US it's over 20k, almost *3 times* the amount. While you could argue the US has better universities, really only the top \~30 are better then the average Canadian university and most students aren't going to the very top institutions regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also heard there is a housing crisis in Canada but there's also a housing crisis here so it cancels out. While both the USA and Canada are modern, 1st world countries I believe that Canada is generally a much better place to live and the average American's life would be improved by being Canadian.

The solution i'm thinking would work would be to make it mandatory for these people's liscences to be taken away for a substantial period of time (months, years or permanently for the worst and/or repeat offenders). I have been personally affected by others commiting road rage... I think an example might help. Heres a short story of when i was affected by a road rage incident as an example:

\----start of story---

When i first started driving years and years ago. I was a pretty frightened and overly cautious kind of a driver. To the annoyence of everyone else on the road, I had decided that going 5 mph under the speed limit everywhere i drove was a wise idea (it was dumb). Well, so one day i was driving down a back road doing 20 mph on a 25 mph speed limit stretch of road like i usually did (there was a train of about 10 cars behind me at one point). So i get to an intersection after about 10 minutes of driving and this guy pulls up next to me and starts screaming about i had so inconvienienced him by my slow driving.  It was terrifying. And just when one would think a situation like that could not get any worse... my friend who was sitting in the passanger seat decides to flip the guy off. Oh man, he went from screaming, to sounding like a screeching unhinged diabolical entity of some description. It was beyond terrifying. At one point he even blocked my car in (false imprisonment in my juristiction)  so he could countinue to screech at me (couldnt understand anything he was saying) for several more minutes.  This horrific behavior and harrassment of his went on until I yelled the apparently magic-to-his-ego word ""Sorry!"". This defused the situation and he finally let me drive off and escape from his harrasment.

\---end of story---

My view with that is: No matter how much of a turtle-power driver I admittably was at the time.... I or anyone else do not deserve to be cruely harrassed by some angry dude who has no business behind the wheel of a car.  Why cant guys like that simply have their liscense taken away? I think if the guy who falsely imprisioned and verbally assaulted me had his liscense taken away for say.... one year. I bet 100 dollars that he is never going to mistreat another driver again.... Of course there is also the consideration that even unreasonably angry people need a way of getting to and from work, the grocery store, the gym, etc. But then again can't Mr. Angry just take public tranportation or ride a bike for a year?   I mean, it would be hard to feel sorry for them when they brought it upon themselves. And honestly i think they could learn a lesson from it... that or they will only become angrier and angrier and soon become now known as Mr. Very Angry or something (hard to say, really.. not everyone is wise enough to learn from their mistakes i guess \*sigh\*)

Of course what if within that year Mr. Angry goes and does some yoga and takes anger managemnt classes... should his liscense be given back early? Or is it more important to protect society from his potential for anger problems behind the wheel?

And if Mr. angry gets his liscense back after a year and then gets back on the road... Good for him! But if Mr. Angry decides to commit another act of road rage... maybe then his liscense should then be taken away permanantly to protect society and other drivers from his apparently incurable anger problem?

Also yes i am aware that road ragers do sometimes get sentanced by judges in court to be banned from driving for certain and significant periods of time.  But my view is a little different in that I think that a very long ban or permanent ban should be automatic and mandatory even for first-time road ragers.

I just want my overall road experience to be peaceful and calm and i'm sure that is what most others want.

My overall view at this point is that banning road ragers from the road for significantly long amounts of time would be benificial for me and other calm and collected road users."

YouTube and other social media sites had WAY less ads whose creators produced genuinely funny content and whose content was not hindered by financial or social factors, just pure passion and creativity. And most importantly, there was no pandemic we had to deal with. The only thing bad that I think happened was that the economy was still pretty bad (although it was recovering) from 2008, but even then the economy wasn’t as bad as it is right now. I know I could be biased by nostalgia and such, but I really feel like the early 2010s were a better time to be alive than now.

0,2022-08-08,CMV: You ought to forgive every single person who has ever wronged you,u/Dyscordio,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wj0bpj/cmv_you_ought_to_forgive_every_single_person_who/,changemyview,"To begin, I will define the key terms I'm using.

Forgiveness: The decision to let go of feelings of **resentment** and thoughts of **revenge** 

Resentment: Bitter indignation (anger or annoyance) at having been treated unfairly

Free will: The capacity for agents to be able to choose between different possible actions **unimpeded**. As an example, if you are given the option to flip a coin or to not flip a coin at a given time, free will argues that were that exact circumstance repeated multiple times that you would make different decisions, as even if the circumstances are the same you are still able to make different decisions.

To clarify, yes, this does include abuse. This does include murder. This does include sexual assault. I believe people who have either directly or indirectly suffered from these things and others ought to forgive those who have wronged them. 

The reason I believe this stems from what I believe is my current best scientific understanding of the world. To my knowledge cause and effect is absolute. What I mean by that is when we are able to cut something down to its fundamental components and hold all other factors equal, we always get the exact same results. For example, if you wanted to boil water it would always boil at the same temperature so long as you accounted for other environmental factors such as atmospheric pressure. Or if you run a simple program in Visual Studio Code and account for all other environmental factors, that program will always return the exact same result no matter what. 

What I'm trying to say is that the things that we are most knowledgeable of in the universe seem to perfectly align with cause and effect. So long as the cause is the same, the effect is always the same. That's not to say that scientists aren't wrong of course, but when scientific models are made and fail to predict what has taken place, we make the assumption that a new environmental factor is now at work. Which is logical, because everything we seem to grasp in the world so far seems to follow cause and effect. 

So how does this relate to human beings? Well based on the fact that the rest of the universe seems to follow cause and effect, it would make sense that we should assume humans are also the product of cause and effect. Cause and effect is incompatible with the idea of free will, as given a set of options at a specific time, cause and effect would dictate that the same experiment repeated infinitely would have the subject always make the same choice. Free will argues the exact opposite, that regardless of the prior factors that the agent could eventually make a different choice were the experiment repeated enough times. 

Given that our current best scientific understanding is that cause and effect is the best explanation for all things in the universe, we should believe humans are products of cause and effect by default and not beings given free will. 

To bring this back to forgiveness, what this would tell us then is that a machine ripping off your arm in an accident is no more of a product of free will than a man cutting it off himself. Based on our best assumptions neither the machine nor the man are acting based on their own free will, and are simply products of cause and effect. Just as it would be pointless or even harmful to harbor feelings of resentment towards a machine, I believe that the same could be said for a human without free will.

That is why I believe every person ought to forgive those who have wronged them: because we must assume that those people are just as much a product of their genetic and environmental factors as everyone else. Feeling resentment towards a product of circumstance is ridiculous in my view. Not only are you potentially harming yourself by feeling that way, but those feelings can end up manifesting in vigilantism that ends up killing the perpetrators.

P.S. Just to clarify, I know there is current investigation into whether the universe may be determined on the atomic level, due to the fact that some phenomena (e.g. radioactive decay) seems completely random. However even if I were to grant this, undetermined causes at the atomic level would still have  cause and effects outcomes on the rest of the universe (e.g. if God rolls a ball down a hill, you could still perfectly predict how far that ball will travel even if the original cause of the roll was not determined) and since these concepts are both so new and unknown, we should still hold to the assumption of cause and effect.

TLDR: Cause and effect seems to be basically absolute, cause and effect contradicts free will therefore we should assume cause and effect causes people to do bad stuff. Therefore we should forgive those people because they are just products of circumstance, not people who could've chosen anything else if the scenario were repeated."

0,2022-08-08,CMV: solar panels are useless in the long term in Nothern Europe,u/oompaloempia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wj4x53/cmv_solar_panels_are_useless_in_the_long_term_in/,changemyview,"I believe that solar panels don't have a long-term future in the Northern European energy mix. So let's first define Northern Europe: I'll define it as the area in Europe where winter energy usage is higher than summer energy usage. (In those places where the opposite is true, i.e. areas with a lot of airconditioning and little winter heating, solar panels are the obvious solution and I'm not challenging that.)

Most heating in these countries is currently done either directly or indirectly using fossil fuels. That needs to end as soon as possible. Solar is a bad candidate to replace fossil fuels: in Northern Europe, days are short and often cloudy during winter. A 1 kW solar installation will generate on average about 1 kWh of energy per day during winter, and easily 5 kWh during summer. The exact number will depend on the specifics, but these numbers should be the correct order of magnitude regardless.

Heating a very well-insulated house takes about 2500 kWh per year, with basically all of that being used in at most about 100 winter days. That's 25 kWh per day. If you want to average 25 kWh of solar production on a winter day, you need 25 kW of solar panels, on average, per house. That's about 50 to 100 solar panels.

This is an insanely expensive solution, so most proposals are that during winter, we should instead rely on wind energy (combined with storage) or nuclear energy. This isn't especially controversial. Yet, it's often claimed that solar also has a place in such an energy mix. What exactly is its place though?

If we have enough wind energy or nuclear energy to get through the winter, we also have enough wind or nuclear energy to get through the summer. Why do we need even a single solar panel? Of course, if solar panels were free, we should use them. But they're not free. So why invest even a single euro into solar energy when we could instead invest it into wind energy?

But, you might say, this is all theoretical, clearly solar works in practice. The reduction in emissions is clearly visible from the statistics. Yes, short-term. A huge chunk of our energy currently comes from fossil fuels, both in winter and in summer. Either directly (gas heating) or indirectly (coal or gas electricity generation). Every kW of solar energy is one less kW of gas or coal being burned. That's undeniably a good thing.

But we need to go towards a world where no fossil fuels are burned for energy at all. If we have enough energy from wind or nuclear, any solar energy will no longer replace fossil fuels, it will replace wind or nuclear. Which is not harmful, of course, but not helpful either.

So to me, investing into solar panels in Northern Europe in 2022 seems like a concession of defeat. It's saying ""we won't be able to get rid of fossil fuels in winter anyway, so let's get rid of them in summer and pretend we're halfway there."""

Under socialism, they would be reliant on certain things (government benefit programs for example). This leaves them in a disempowered position. To improve our society, we should focus on helping people get their own money, rather than giving government money. This is better for the government, as it is cheaper. It is better for the people in question as well, as they are empowered. It's a win-win situation."
0,2022-08-08,CMV: Atheism is just as logically flawed as theism,u/1ne3hree,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wj5hxv/cmv_atheism_is_just_as_logically_flawed_as_theism/,changemyview,"I am not personally religious, but I think the case of atheism, and the case made by any religion requires a huge leap to asserting the existence (or absence) of something on the foundation of blind faith. 

The theists will say, “there is a good because of x, y, and z” to which the atheist says “this can be explained by a, b, and c.” 

The problem I find with atheism is the belief that if a cosmic being existed, atheism makes the assumption that it would be concerned with us, or be apparent to us. It’s essentially placing human knowledge and our perceptions in the same seat that the theists put god in when they makes the assertion that there is no god, and make their case by using a lack of evidence as evidence. 

I think there is room to argue that all that truly matters in a persons life are their perceptions, but I just don’t see the difference between atheism and theism from a logical standpoint. They’re both equally logically shaky, and whereas the theists I’ve known have declared faith, the atheists I’ve known have declared logic, which I don’t believe is something that atheism necessarily entails. 

In a way, I think you could say that atheism preaches belief in human knowledge (that if god were real we’d be able to know), and religion preaches that god is real dispute having no clear convincing evidence presently aside from 2000 year old accounts. 

I also want to be clear that I’m not here to cast aspersions on anyone or debase anyone, I’m not making value judgements on atheism, or theism.

Please keep it classy in the comments, and thank you in advance.

EDIT: I’ve learned that atheism isn’t monolithic, and that there are a variety of stances on the subject within the term of atheism. What I’m referring to is the active belief that a god could not possibly exist, which I have also come to learn is not necessarily the belief of all atheists."

Legally acquired or not, if the evidence exists, it cannot simply be ignored. I can't imagine any trouble caused by someone commiting a crime to acquire evidence who wouldn't've otherwise unless they knew it was usable, to outweigh the benefits.

EDIT: to clarify, I do think the person who obtained the illegal evidence should be held accountable for *this* crime, and I'm *not* advocating for people to commit crimes to obtain said evidence - what I am saying that *once it exists* then it exists and thus cannot be ignored.

0,2022-08-08,CMV: Varying Perception of Time Should Factor in Retirement Plans,u/simmol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wjesuw/cmv_varying_perception_of_time_should_factor_in/,changemyview,"Many people prepare for retirement by allocating certain amount of their income into savings.  The idea is that once you get older, you will not work and as such, will need to dip into your savings to sustain you until death.  There is a couple of wrinkles here as no one really knows when they are going to die so many people use expected lifespan as the total duration of their retirement.  

Now, let me introduce something that seems totally unrelated.  There are many studies suggesting that person's perception of time varies depending on age.  Specifically, many studies suggest that as you get older, time seems to speed up.  Also, this claim is corroborated by people's subjective experiences as well.  Time seems to fly as you get older. 

Let me connect the two things here.  If it is true that time passes by very quickly as you get older, then this should factor in on your retirement strategy (assumption here is that you are not near retirement here).   To make this point, let's take a very extreme example.  Let's say that the universe is designed such that once you hit 65 years old, perception of time becomes so much faster than 1 day seems like 1 second.  In that case, if you live up to 85 years, the 20 years is actually less than couple of hours of perception time.  So in this extreme case, you would agree that the retirement plan should change drastically such that one should perhaps YOLO more during the younger days.    Obviously, the perception of time isn't that drastic but even if it is 2x or 3x faster, then the effective retirement duration of time should be discounted. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some of the anticipated responses. 

1) Saving is not just for oneself but for your descendents.  That is definitely true.  But let's just say that we agree here and just isolate this discussion into retirement savings that is allocated to oneself without worrying about inheritance. 

2) There is more physical pain once you are older and as such, the discounted perception of time during retirement is offset by more pain.  As such, you need money to mitigate the pain when you are older.  Admittedly, this is the best counterargument that I can think of but I am not that old so I don't really know how to factor this in.  Also, this doesn't change the fact that faster perception of time still acts as an independent factor.

0,2022-08-08,CMV: Sex work is basically sexual assault and/or rape in a capitalistic society.,u/dmkicksballs13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wjgk94/cmv_sex_work_is_basically_sexual_assault_andor/,changemyview,"So first, let's define sex work. I tend to disassociate nude photos, because by definition, it's not sex. But pornstars, prostitutes, escorts, strippers, etc. I think can be agreed to be seen as sex work.

Secondly, it needs to be addressed that many pornstars, web cam models, etc. get into the business for either freedom of expression or love of sex. I will contend however, that the overwhelming majority of pornstars and near 100% of prostitutes do sex work out of a need for money and not just because it's a combination of something they like and work they do (ie do what you love and it'll never feel like work).

So, my theory: If sex workers are ""forced"" to work in sex for money, I don't understand how it's not rape. Rape is a force sex act by potentially many different means. If a woman/man would not be participating in sex acts without the conceit of money, then that's by definition, rape.

To further analyze, take a boss of a business who tells a woman she needs to have sex with him or she'll be fired. She's being forced through money/need to live to comply, which is rape. A capitalistic society does the same thing, but most wouldn't consider it rape. ""She wasn't forced to become a pornstar."" True, not literally, but through capitalistic means, she was. The woman being threatened to be fired wasn't ""forced"" either. She could have rejected his advances and said no. I think the reality is that because society is faceless and peerless, we ignore it and let it slide, because who would you even convict?"

1845,2022-08-08,CMV: ‘Cultural appropriation’ is a term pushed by those who have no understanding of how human cultures develop.,u/Pyrrskep,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wjhzmk/cmv_cultural_appropriation_is_a_term_pushed_by/,changemyview,"TL;DR is included at the bottom for those who want it. 

I study anthropology.  A big part of our field is looking at how cultures merge, fracture, and shift.  Cultures have meshed their practices for thousands of years.  More often than not, advocates against ‘cultural appropriation’ are complaining about the normal culture process that has happened since the inception of mankind. 

For example, those who raise issue to someone wearing the clothing of another culture.  Unless someone is impersonating a genuine unique role in their borrowed culture, there is nothing wrong with this.  If I went to Mexico and wore a decorated poncho and sombrero, I’d blend right in.  These are both normal daily wear.  In fact, my host family quite literally gave them to me.  

Another example, is the borrowing of cuisine.  Remaking a dish while adding the influence of your own roots is NOT appropriation.  It is the natural process of culinary arts.  If you go back far enough, the native dish ‘being appropriated’ also borrowed *something* at some point.  However, I will say that outright stealing and rebranding a dish is somewhat scummy.  Though, this theft has also occurred for thousands of years.  The best example comes from the Hellenic and Hellenistic periods in Greek/Roman times, where Rome often took direct influence from Greek culture. 

A final blurb.  Actively trying to prevent this cultural exchange is artificially altering the process by which cultures evolve and adapt.  Cultural exchange is what allows human culture to advance.  Without it, we stagnate.  Stagnation is how a culture dies.  It is ironic that progressives are very often ‘cultural conservatives’ in this sense of adamant preservation.  

TL;DR — ‘cultural appropriation’ is a natural process being demonized by those who have no knowledge of the nature of human cultures.  Preventing cultural exchange will hurt humanity in the long run."

&gt;Through compulsory American educational institutions, vulnerable children were taught as young students about the topic of U.S. History, a mandatory learning curriculum. These young students were forced to study and comprehend all information provided by their teachers, concerning this topic, to pass multiple tests and possibly graduate toward the next grading level.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without strict supervision at home from their parents concerning what their children learned in school, these students eventually became adults that were indoctrinated with detailed information about U.S. History, which they now believe is the absolute truth without any doubts or room for questioning its accuracy or validity.  
&gt;  
&gt;This type of social engineering experiment systematically manipulated millions of American’s mindsets into a one-directional belief system, to the point where the offspring of the indigenous Niiji, who are misclassified today as African Americans or Black Americans, will believe that their direct ancestors were somehow captured by anonymous European caucasian sailors, from random parts of West Africa, and then forcefully migrated to North America to work as slaves for foreigners from another continent.  
&gt;  
&gt;This folklore is commonly known today as the Transatlantic slave trade story, however, essential details of this story did not happen the way that we were all told by strangers in school. Not only was this deceitful story drastically manipulated and even exaggerated by design, but it was also told to us in reverse.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok folks, I have a coworker who sat down to talk history with me and he was paraphrasing from Dane Calloway, either one of his books or a youtube vid, regarding the west african slave trade. I was bothered by his implications (we didnt discuss the subject long before it switched), so I asked for the guys name and looked him up to find the above linked items. Whoo boy.

My understanding of the west african slave trade is roughly this:

* Discovery of new world and discovery/import of cash crops to produce
* Enslavement of native americans is ineffective because they die from European diseases or are able to escape into the interior of the continents
* Importing of european labor is problematic because of high mortality rate from American diseases
* African slaves are resistant to some of the diseases, so Triangle trade develops wherein ships move in an economic cycle transferring slaves to the colonies for labor, transferring raw materials from the colonies to the industrializing motherland, and transferring finished goods back to Africa/colonies in exchange for more labor or raw materials.

My knowledge on the subject is not derived from whatever childhood school setting the back of the book describes, but from listening to and reading a bunch of history books because it interests me. They're all pretty damn well in agreement that the Atlantic slave trade existed and that Europeans were the ones doing the transporting across the Atlantic. Folks can quibble on the details of how complicit native africans were in selling other africans to portuguese traders or whatever, it's entirely irrelevant to my view because the author is portraying literally the opposite of the historical consensus.

So there it is, I think this book looks like some Grade-A bullshit. CMV.

Please also refrain from insulting my coworker in your answer, all kinds of good people stumble onto misinformation and just outright shitting on them is an anti-delta strategy. Thanks!"

Even in academic debate.

No single word, where it be a curse word, a slur of any kind, or any other kind of word that is often deemed offensive, should hold the capacity to be offensive in a vacuum. Obviously these words can make up sentences that have offensive messages within them, but that’s not what I’m saying is wrong. The best example sentence I can think of is “it is never OK, under any circumstances, for a white person to call a black person a nigger” this sentence is perfectly innocent in my view, but some claim otherwise. To use an analogy I’ll explain my point with by far the most objective language humans know of; mathematics. Much like a single word can’t be offensive on its own, a single symbol cannot be incorrect either. The equation “2+2=5” is comprised of mathematical symbols which, when combined in this way, form a mathematically incorrect statement. But if I were to just put “2” or “=“ or “+” it’s impossible for those symbols to be “incorrect” on their own just by the nature of how math works. They don’t form a coherent mathematical statement on their own, but that doesn’t mean they are somehow “wrong”. Human language obviously has more nuance than math, I’m not saying that given certain context it’s impossible for, for example, a slur to be offensive. If you walked up to somebody and angrily shouted a slur that is aimed at a group they belong to, that is certainly offensive. The idea I’m against is that a word can be offensive, *no matter what*, that regardless of the context, it is unacceptable to say a word. I think that idea can do nothing but prevent proper discourse from occurring, never encourage it. And seeing as discourse is one of the primary functions of language, I think it’s harmful to look at words in this way."

2,2022-08-08,CMV: There is no excuse to run sprinklers during the daytime,u/YoungAmsterdam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wjqog3/cmv_there_is_no_excuse_to_run_sprinklers_during/,changemyview,"Given that:

* the purpose of sprinklers running is to help your grass grow, and
* a portion of the water used when sprinklers run during daytime will inevitably be evaporated by sunshine, thus resulting in unnecessary water waste, reduced watering efficiency, and cost,

I therefore don't see why it is necessary for anyone who is attempting to water their lawn to run their sprinklers while the sun is out.

Exceptions to this include running sprinklers for other reasons (e.g. for kids to run through to have fun) or when testing the system out or for diagnostic purposes to make sure it's running properly or to fix a problem with a portion of dead grass, e.g.

I also don't feel it's necessary to debate people on what times of day the sun stops causing as much water evaporation (e.g. arguing about whether it's excusable to run sprinklers at sunset versus midday), since most people only water their lawns for a duration of time that easily fits into nighttime when any degree of sun-driven evaporation couldn't possibly occur.

Despite what I've written here, I recognize that many people water their lawns during the day, and I'm willing to change my mind if someone can give me a good argument for doing this. CMV!

EDIT: By ""run your sprinklers"" I'm specifically referring to automatic sprinklers/watering systems that are above ground. Manual watering systems or systems where the water isn't exposed to sunshine are excluded here, since the central concern I'm bringing up doesn't apply to those systems. "

so i really want to be **educated** on this topic cause i feel like **so many people wouldn’t disagree with me if there wasn’t some misinformation in my opinion.** but stoner subs are total ass and not a good place to try and educate myself on. 


so my thing is when you smoke anything period it messes with your lungs. people say “oh almost all medication has a side effect.” **(e: I’m listing an argument i don’t think is valid)** however those side effects can usually USUALLY be stopped if you change the medicine, stop taking it, etc. *if possible.* and many of these effects, not all but many, aren’t permanent even off the medication. i.e. fatigue. 

there’s also not a 100% chance you’ll be effected by it **(e: side effects of other drugs).** but smoking is literally putting something in your lungs that isn’t supposed to be there, and there’s a 100% chance you’ll be effected by **(e: buildup in your lungs)** it if you do it more than a couple times. yes, i’m aware medicine can give you things like heart palpitations, but you’re instructed to contact your doctor if this occurs, and stop taking it immediately. **(e: therefore, you have less of a chance of being effected by it long term because of doctor instruction. oral medication or injections does not cause buildup in the lungs.)**

while it doesn’t have addictive properties, people use it WHEN they are feeling stressed or bored etc. and *it still gets you high, and getting high can be addictive period.*

*wouldn’t it make MUCH more sense to eat a small bit of edibles than smoke it for medical use? you’re not messing up your lungs that way.*

even for recreational use, i don’t have the same opinion. if you know the risks i mean most people do than it’s good you found something you can enjoy. i just feel like way too many people act like smoking weed has minor to no side effects. 

it makes more sense if people act like it’s picking between a bad option and a bit of a better but still bad option to solve the worse one

EDIT: i acknowledge alcohol is just as bad. that’s ALSO a drug so that’s not exactly a good comparison depending on how you use it in your comment

EDIT 2: please see the deltas i gave to some comments, i’m getting a lot of replies! thanks by the way. at the time i had zero knowledge on drugs and thought vaping and smoking were the same thing because you inhale it even if you aren’t burning something. The only drug education i had was d.a.r.e. that said all drugs are bad and super dangerous. another thing i was unaware of was that not everyone has the same reaction to different methods, and that there are different types of high. 

i’m not sure what was confusing about the wording of my post. it’s not CMV: weed is bad for you, it’s CMV: saying *SMOKING* weed is harmless isn’t a valid argument, but sorry if you had trouble understanding it

i also posted this on the wrong sub, so people think i’m trying to argue that weed is bad. sorry"

Background - I’m an international student (dark skinned, 25M) from India and I’ve experienced more hostility from other people of color than white people. I consider myself an outgoing person and I get along with people easily unless they are really rude folks. In my experience, I’ve found that a lot of African Americans and some Hispanic folks are much more hostile to me than the average white person. I’ve travelled quite a bit in the US (both in the north and south) and even in your average conservative,southern states, white people have been more outgoing and treat me as an equal when compared to other PoC (who sometimes treat me as if I’m beneath them). I do not know if they truly see me as an equal or if they are just being polite on the surface but this is my experience. Before coming to the US, I was expecting a lot more solidarity with other PoC but my real world experience has surprised me quite a bit."

Every single person I have seen eat a curry in this country uses a fork for some reason, and I do not understand it whatsoever.

A spoon is obviously the right choice of utensil. Curry is a liquid and while a fork has holes in it that the curry can fall through, a spoon does not. 

The only point anyone has been able to make in favour of forks (seriously this is the only thing people say in their defense) is that with a fork you're able to stab pieces of meat in the curry and eat them. I don't think this is a valid reason to use a fork over a spoon as you can just scoop up the piece of meat just as easily if not more easily than stabbing it with a fork.

The changes we need to make will just make life just more shitty than it is, so the question is...

Why the fuck should I? 

The actions required to ""reverse"" climate change would mean no meat,  no vacationing to other countries,  (Unless you're upper class then by all means.), no driving nice cars and array of other shitty sacrifices.

And before anyone comes at me with the ""WhAt AbOuT yOuR fUtUrE cHiLdReN"" argument. I'm not having any kids nor do I ever want to have any kids. (Also, I'm gay, so I can't even have a child by accident.) Miss me with that shit. 

I personally don't see any point to saving the planet, because honestly, it would just make my life a misery.

To elaborate more, my stance against the CMA movement kind of works like this: 

Me: I'm training to be a carpenter/cabinet maker after realising that a career in Sound Engineering was a waste of time with shit pay, shit hours, fuck all in career progression and in reality pretty goddamn boring. I Finally found a career path that I'm happy in.

Climate-Activists: ""Well you have to quit your job because your job uses wood and cutting down trees is bad for the Enviroment.""

Me: Couldn't we just construct forests for lumber production?

Climate-Activists: ""No! It takes too long for trees to grow!""

Me: Then we could just genetically modify them to grow faster?

Climate-Activists: ""No BeCaUsE tHaT wIlL mEsS uP eCo SyStEmS!!!1!!""

Me: Okay so I'll become a Metalworker/Welder then.

Climate-Activists: ""Nope because welding irons use too much electricity and blow torches use fossil fuel.""

Me: Right, then I could pursue archaeology, I've always wanted to travel abroad and live that Indiana Jones life (Yes I know it kind of sounds childish), exploring old tombs, catacombs and historical sites in the Mediterranean/North African regions.

Climate-Activists: ""Nope because you'll need a plane to get to those places and Planes are bad for the environment. Also doing archaeology in the Jungle regions means cutting through bushes and brambles, which will just upset ecosystems.

Me: I could just travel by boat?

Climate-Activists: ""No BeCaUsE BoAtS uSe LoTs oF fUeL wHicH iS bAd FoR tHe EnViRoMeNT!!!1!""

Me: Fine then, I could look into Marine Salvaging, I get to do underwater retrievals from shipwrecks. 

Climate-Activists: ""Nope, those ships have ecosystems growing within them now and we shouldn't upset them, plus you'll probably be using dynamite which could seriously hurt the marine life which is bad for the environment.""  

Me: So what the fuck am I going to do for a living?

Climate-Activists: ""Well you could learn to code?""

Me: I've done coding before, it gets boring after Web-Coding plus my computer is for Leisure time, not for work. 

Climate-Activists: ""Well, we'll just implement UBI, so that you don't have to work!""

Me: Do I look like my name is fucking Doreen? Yeah, was a NEET once, made me want to kill myself. Not fucking doing it again. 

Climate-Activists: ""Oh My GoD, sToP bEiNg So SeLfIsH, wE nEeD tO FiGhT cLiMaTe ChAnGe!!1!!"" Also you'll need to stop eating meat and animal products all together. Go Vegan basically!

Me: So I can't even eat Eggs or Honey? 

Climate-Activists: Nope

Me: The last time I checked Chickens and Ducks don't shit methane nor do they give a shit about their eggs once they're not brooding. (Despite the bullshit claims that vegans make.)

Climate-Activists: ""BuT tHeY nEeD lAnD tO LiVe On AnD nEeD fOoD tO bE gRoWn FoR tHeM!!!1!!"" 

Me: No shit sherlock, poultry needs a place to live and food to eat. The land that they take up is very little and the amount is food they require is about a quarter of what a dog eats. So...

Climate-Activists: ""Oh My GoD, sToP bEiNg So SeLfIsH, wE nEeD tO FiGhT cLiMaTe ChAnGe LiKe JuSt Go VeGaN!!1!!""

Me: Yes, just eat food that tastes like absolute horseshit for the rest of my life whilst constantly having to swallow like 40 supplement pills a day to make up for the lost nutrients that I had from my previous diet. Whilst at the same time breaking the bank to pay for the overpriced horseshit.

Climate-Activists: ""Also you need to drive an electric car when you eventually get around to learning to drive.""

Me: ""Electric cars are overpriced as shit.""

Climate-Activists: ""Then just buy the second hand ones!"" 

Me: ""Still overpriced as shit, the cheapest where I live is like an 07' Prius and those are just atrocious. Plus I want to learn to drive a manual car, not just an automatic.""

Me: The public transport sector in my country (Ireland), is an absolute clusterfuck. The new Public Transport scheme completely neglects the west side of the county where I live (Dublin) because we're the working class side and we're constantly getting neglected. Hell, to get to and from community college, I have to get a tram from my town into the city and then from the city to the town in which my college is located which is a 2 hour journey in of itself. The direct route which is a bus takes about 3 hours long when I could get from my house to college via car in 30 minutes.

Climate-Activists: ""Oh My GoD, sToP bEiNg So SeLfIsH, wE nEeD tO FiGhT cLiMaTe ChAnGe I dOn'T cArE iF iT tAkEs YoU 3 hOuRs To GeT hOmE! iT's FoR tHe BeTtErMeNt Of SoCiEtY! Also you know that annual vacation abroad you take once a year. Well... We also need you to stop doing that as well.""

Me: So what your basically saying is stop going abroad.

Climate-Activists: ""Well duh... Planes are bad for the environment.""

Me: I have family who live in Germany and my Dad lives all the way over America, what the fuck am I supposed to in that situation? 

Climate-Activists: ""I don't know? Skype. Not my fucking problem.""

Me: What about getting a boat from Ireland to france and driving to Germany?

Climate-Activists: ""No BeCaUsE bOaTs UsE tOo MuCh FuEl WhIcH cAuSeS cLiMaTe ChAnGe!""

Me: So what you're telling me is leaving my country (which is an island btw) is bad for the environment and that I should never do it despite the fact that I have relatives, including my dad in particular as a means to save this shithole of a planet? Well that's a shit deal I'm getting. 

Climate-Activists: ""Oh My GoD, sToP bEiNg So SeLfIsH, wE nEeD tO FiGhT cLiMaTe ChAnGe I dOn'T cArE iF yOu CaN't SeE yOuR fUcKiNg ReLaTieS! JuSt CoPe WiTh It!"" Also you can only shower for a maximum of 5 minutes and not do it everyday?""

That was my long ass take on the logic of the Climate-Activists. Sacrifice anything that I enjoy in the hopes of saving this shithole of planet so that I can live in a ""better future.""

Sacrifice any career that I want to pursue, nice tasting food, a nice vehicle, going abroad for a vacation or see relatives (I live on an island for fucksake), no fun allowed pretty much. 

To be honest... I ain't doing that shit. 

And I know what the arguments are gonna be:

-[Think of the children](https://youtu.be/3jFqhjaGh30)

Wow... My favourite form of the appeal to emotion fallacy. 

""It's for the future generations."" 

Well as a member of the current future generation (Gen Z), this generation is not worth the oxygen. This generation is honestly worst than the boomers, at least the boomers have had a positive impact on society, what have Gen Z done that was positive? They fucked up the LGBT community and tolerance for us now is on a steady decline, they're so dependent on Smart Technology that using a pen and paper or using the notes app on their phone to make a shopping list is too much of a mental challenge, so they need their fridge to do it for them, NFTs, going into supermarkets and taking off the lid of Ice Cream tubs and licking the tops and putting them back during a pandemic, licking poles and toilet seats during a pandemic, ripping urinals, lockers, sinks, you fucking name it of the walls of their school buildings, all for some clout on TikTok and a good few of these people are older than 18, so they're not even children. In my country alone a Zoomer kicked a young woman underneath a train and got away with it. 16 year olds in my country are killing members of rival gangs. A bunch of them literally hacked someone to pieces and posted it instagram another bunch of them posted a video to TikTok of them burning down the house of the mother of a former gang rival who they murdered the week previous. Gen Z ain't worth shit.

Sure... We could argue about the future of Generation Alpha too, but remember how I said Gen Z is pretty fucked. Well they're pretty much gonna be fucked as well with our dumbasses in charge. So not much point in saving them.

Plus everytime someone tries to make becoming more eco friendly less of a pain in the ass, the fucking alarmists within the environmentalist community come and prevent us from doing it. Nuclear Energy? Nope, Chernobyl. Replacing Natural Gas with hydrogen gas, nope hydrogen is apparently too much of hazard, An extremely flammable gas is flammable? Wow, it's not like we already have a system in place for transporting flammable gas already. /s

Nobody is even bothering to work on much better eco friendly alternatives. They're all stuck in the development phase and probably won't be a thing till I'm 60 and I'm 23 already. Where the fuck are the Hydrogen Cars, the Electric and Hydrogen planes? Nowhere to be found. No development so we're stuck with the shitty choices anyways.

People could argue that I'm being a selfish asshole and that I should be more considerate of others but to that I say fuck no. After the clusterfucks that were 2020 and 2021, I've kind of come to the conclusion that life has no meaning and that the only people that matter are the few people that I actually give a shit about. Most people are in it for themselves in some way or another and well after people refusing to wear masks to stop a virus, people burning, looting and rioting people's businesses during a pandemic, people ruining other peoples lives over shitty opinions they once had but have grown of out of, people trying to stop democracy by invading a government building. The social contract of giving a shit about others has gone out the fucking window basically. It's a fuck over or get fucked over world.

In conclusion to this long CMV, I've decided that I'm not doing anything about climate change. I'm not going to sacrifice the things that I enjoy doing for my shitty generation, hell if I was having a heart attack they'd film me and upload it to snapchat before giving me help. I'm gonna continue my career building bespoked Furniture, until they start creating forests for timber production until then I'll just use whatever timber they give me for now. I'm gonna continue enjoying a big mac instead of that nasty ass vegan falafel shit. I'm gonna drive a petrol/diesel car until electrics/hydrogens are affordable and have a manual option, I'm gonna visit my dad and relatives abroad and take the odd holiday abroad every once in a while, it's up to them to bring in Electric/hydrogen planes and I'm gonna continue to take 10 minute showers. If any politician gets in my way, I'll just find a politician who is willing to pull my country out of the shitty Paris Agreement because to be honest, I'm gonna be dead when shit hits the fan and no one will remember me. The earth in the meantime will probably get hit by an asteroid (similar to the dinosaurs) or yellowstone will probably erupt turning us all into a Pompeii 2.0. We're gonna go extinct at some point.

All 328 comments. I need a break from Reddit for a while because I've been hyperfocused on this all day. I'll reply to any further comments tomorrow



This is in relation to the abortion debate. A point where I often get stuck with pro-lifers is the value of potential life - potential consciousness might be a better term, but for the sake of brevity and keeping to widely used terms I'll say potential life.

UPDATE: the term potential life is confusing people so I'll be using the term potential consciousness from now on

So here's how the debate usually goes.

Me: why is there anything immoral about aborting an embryo that hasn't developed a brain yet? It isn't conscious, it has no feelings, it's like killing a plant.

Pro-lifer: but it could have feelings one day, you're denying it its potential consciousness!

Me: but why is potential consciousness important?

Things have never gone beyond that point. I either get no reply, or weird circular logic, or my opponent in the debate resorts to rambling about me being a baby killer.

I have two issues with potential consciousness. The first is, I don't see any reason for it to be important or valued. If that potential consciousness doesn't come to be, no one has suffered. A conscious being has not died. To never be born is not the same as to die.

The other issue is that if we follow the logic of valuing potential consciousness, then why do we stop at the embryo? An embryo is a potential consciousness, but so is a sperm. A sperm could fuse with an egg and grow to create a person. Why is it ok to waste *that* potential consciousness? As far as I know most pro-lifers aren't desperately trying to have as many children as possible. Why are abortions wrong but not condoms, or periods (an egg being wasted), or masturbation, or being single, or abstinence?



UPDATE: This is getting a lot of traction and I'm finding myself repeating certain points over and over so here's a list of commonly made points and my rebuttals.

A: Would you invest, or garden, or plan for the future?
Yes. I never said potential value doesn't exist, I just don't see the value in potential consciousness specifically 

B: But don't you value LIFE?

A plant is alive.

C: But don't you value HUMAN life?

A tumour is human and alive. I also don't see why humans should be regarded as more important than other intelligent species such as dolphins and elephants. And finally, humanity is awful and is destroying the world, so the less humans the better.

D: But an embryo has unique diploid human DNA

My response here would be similar to point C, but also this implies that an identical twin is less of a person than most people

E: but coma patients aren't conscious!

A coma patient was conscious in the past and had a personality, identity, rights, and things they wanted to do. Their life is valuable because they attained consciousness. Would have been is not the same as was

F: but expecting parents value their baby's potential life!

This is subjective value, and no one would assign any subjective value to my embryo if I became pregnant. I wouldn't, my partner wouldn't, my doctor ought to remain objective, and no one else would know. To convince me that early term abortion is bad you'd have to either convince me that I myself subjectively value my nonexistent children (good luck), or that an embryo's potential consciousness has OBJECTIVE value."
29,2022-08-09,CMV: Recreational weed should be legalized,u/BeeMovieIsGud,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wk1ozw/cmv_recreational_weed_should_be_legalized/,changemyview,"1: I'll be honest and say that one of the reasons I think this way is that I have smoked weed and enjoyed it.

2: Monitoring usage of said substance would be beneficial for scientific purposes and make studying potential downsides easier.

3: Taxation would make the money go to better use than with illegal trading.

&amp;#x200B;

Many counter arguments I see often consist of fear of change or even just logical fallacies. Sometimes people point to health risks which are usually:

\- Lung damage

\- Psychosis

Which are both avoidable since smoking isn't the only option and according to my understanding psychosis usually occurs in those that already are at risk of developing it.

&amp;#x200B;

In many countries people can go to jail for even relatively small crimes. Weed does not harm you that much, the government does.

It is why you see so many old gas stations used as liquor stores or car repair stations. The seller of the previous gas station doesn't want competition, so they restrict what the new buyer can do on the property.

These deed restrictions create challenges for the communities where they exist. They restrict competition and they often result in undesirable land uses for community. Instead of a gas station having better marketing or better products, they prohibit their competition in a certain area. Because zoning laws dictate/limit so much of land use in the united states, Deed restrictions can essentially blockade any new businesses from coming into town.

Deed restrictions should be unenforceable and made illegal."

The message that men are getting from society is that they are responsible for most of the world’s problems, while having zero credit for most of society’s advancements. That their inherent nature is evil. That masculinity is toxic. They are told there is no virtue in their strength, prowess or competence. Men receive next to little encouragement and are disenfranchised in many facets of society. Perhaps worst of all, men are gaslit about all of this and told that society isn’t actually doing this, that it isn’t true, or that it’s exaggerated.

Andrew Tate tells men that there is value in their strength and their masculinity. His message is that masculine men are responsible for building the entire world, and that masculinity is not only good but *necessary.* His message is to take responsibility for your life. He recognizes the way men are disenfranchised and advocates for personal strength and power. 

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Yin and Yang.

I am not saying Andrew Tate is always right. Nor am I saying he is a perfect role model.

0,2022-08-09,CMV: People would be more kind and society would be better if we didn't believe in Free Will,u/EarlEarnings,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wk6f0o/cmv_people_would_be_more_kind_and_society_would/,changemyview," I believe the pervasive belief in free will is a core driver of the most negative, and most likely incorrect, attitudes and beliefs our society tends to hold.

The reason for this is that I believe that if we look at the faults of other human beings as a result of their CHOICE to be flawed, as opposed to just an output that comes from a longstanding series of inputs, we judge them harshly and irrationally. Free will is something people cannot really define or understand, and so belief in it results in some kind of messy abstract sense of morality. It also results in people taking things a lot more personally, and so it causes more hardship in that regard.

If you think someone is poor because they choose to be poor, why would you invest in social programs? If you think someone is bad because they choose to be bad, how can you rehabilitate someone? If you think someone is dumb or slow because they choose to be, why would you ever waste your time with them?

On the contrary, if everything is just a series on inputs and outputs, a result of concrete physical processes, everything becomes tangible and fixable. Poverty becomes a tangible fixable problem. Rehabilitation becomes a tangible physical result to strive for. Intelligence becomes a tangible physical problem. Cancer, intelligence, strength, bad personalities, all attributes become things that we can manipulate and change. All these intangibles become physical processes, and so emotion is removed from the decision making process. Resulting in people who are more empathetic and more optimistic about advances in science and in our society.

But where I lose most my friends and family on this is that they still generally believe children shouldn't swear and that it's good to teach kids not to swear. I don't understand why.

I just don't follow the logic. I was taught not to swear growing up, and I was one of the most well-behaved kids at school in this regard. To the extent that I would sometimes be bullied because of how adamant my refusal to swear was, while all the other kids swore pretty freely when the teachers weren't looking.

By the time I realized swearing was no big deal and that nothing bad was going to me just because I swore, I was pretty upset by the amount of energy and anxiety I'd invested into this nonsense rule. I probably swore more than the average adult just to vent my frustration at this point. So this is a personal issue for me.

I decided I would just be honest with my kids and tell them swearing is not a big deal. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to set them up badly for life, I'd tell them it's probably not in their best interests to do it around teachers and polite company in case they get in trouble, and that they should be kind etc (obviously I'd teach them not to use slurs or hurtful words) but I don't want to give them the ridiculous idea that saying the word ""shit"" is inherently bad and something they must feel guilt or ashamed of. Especially not if it's in private or around friends.

Most people I know don't agree with this and think you should teach children not to swear point blank. It's wrong, end of story. They think this even if they don't actually think swearing is wrong and believe the child will almost certainly start swearing at some point. I don't understand. To me it feels like we are all in agreement that the cultural taboo around swearing is irrational and baseless, but they still want to instil it in kids anyway. Why?"

Well guess what, not everyone cares about where they are going after they die. And I don’t understand why christians get so concerned in other people’s life.

This has been obvious for a while. Chanting ""Lock her up"" about Hillary -- basically saying ""Jail our enemies without any indicting charges or trial"" or the multiple hearings over Benghazi despite repeatedly finding no wrong doing, this all showed that the GOP wanted to use the machinery of the law to punish political actors.   


And Trump clearly went out of his way to use the DoJ and other aspects of the justice system to try to punish his enemies, but was stymied for the most part because those in the system, even if otherwise corrupt, refused to subvert the justice system completely. 

Remember, a warrant has to contain: 

a) the substantiated claim of a probable crime has been committed

b) the substantiated claim that evidence of that crime probably exists

c) the substantiated claim that said evidence likely resides in a particular place at a particular time

d) the substantiated claim that there is reason to believe that the evidence can not be retrieved by the government through less aggressive means (such as subpoena)

All of which has to pass the ""sniff"" test of a federal judge. 

This latest outrage shows that a huge number of GOP voters really do think that the rule of law should be abandoned. To be upset about this they have to believe that: 

1) the FBI would submit a request to the DOJ for a search warrant for political payback of some slight

2) A prosecutor would back the FBI and run the warrant up the chain for approval

3) Merrick Garland -- a lifelong republican stalwart servant of the law would subvert the law to the whims of a Democratic president for some personal gain

4) A Federal Judge would sign off on a warrant out of political animus regardless of the legal merit

I get that this is unprecedented in the sense that it has never happened to a former president before. But instead of taking it for what it implies - that Trump was unprecedentedly corrupt, they embrace a further conspiracy theory?!  


The GOP has honestly lost their collective minds. But this demonstrates they are literally unfit to govern anything because to be outraged by this action requires a complete and fundamental disrespect for the rule of law. In order to sustain this believe, they have to believe that literally every branch of the government is corrupt to the point that a president can force federal judges to effectuate extra-judicial searches and seizures upon ex-Presidents.   


I don't get how they maintain that level of disconnect from reality. However, it does require a complete disregard for the rule of law, today, in order to maintain it."

It's not been ordained by a deity above.

It's because straight male humans are horny and have obsessive inclinations toward female sexual access. This is probably because of some evolutionary insecurity regarding paternity, which has materialized as an intense sexual desire of straight men.

Telling women in those cultures it's because of ""God's will"" is a slap in the face to those women. They truly believe that which is probably why those cultures thrive on keeping women in the dark as much as possible.

They should be more explicit and let them know it's primarily because some man out there wants to have sex with her ""first"" to 1) increase his psychological pleasure and 2) ease his lizard brain.

I'm open to **root** reasonings that don't lead to the above because I'm struggling to find other rationales.

I know that sometimes people might bring up things like how we accept the fully nude baby in the opening of Godfather II, because it's like an artistic/classical movie, and we know that it's just a baptism and the child isn't being harmed, hence it was okay to film this baby - WITHOUT HIS CONSENT MIND YOU - and show it off to millions of people world wide. But that was made way before the internet was widely available.

Like, if I asked people ""Hey, can I make photo copies of all the photos in your family album, make about 1000 copies of said photo album, and then just drop them off at the busiest subway station in New York for who ever to just pick up and take home"" most of you would think I was mad.

A better title would've been ""Causal and Competitive Playerbase Splits Are a Symptom Of Poor Game Design and Are Over saturating The Game Industry""

The fact that Casual and Competitive player bases exist and are widely accepted as a natural aspect of games feels like a symptom of deeply flawed Game Design the industry and its participants have normalized, whether it be Chess or CS:GO. 

As it’s currently practiced, Game Design encourages ostracizing players that don’t play games in the built-in, ‘intended’ way rather than having no true intended or correct way of play (At least, to a reasonable degree; This fluctuates with game genres). This makes most modern games feel like a task: The game is completing the closest task and moving on to the next one rather than the journey connecting players to each goal. I believe this is exactly why certain games that defy this stand out and leave an actual legacy/impact on the industry, as the focus on an infinite and enjoyable journey means that burnout, another symptom of poor design, simply doesn’t (or nearly doesn’t) exist.

What’s more boggling to me is that game developers/publishers (Probably publishers) have embraced this split and oversaturated the industry with it, considering this is a paradox and a time bomb: Splitting your player base makes designing and refining your game WAY more difficult, which ostracizes all players by simply existing, causes an ‘Us vs. Them’ mindset, causes players to get frustrated and leave, and makes designing and refining your game WAY more difficult. There is no balance, harmony, or happiness for anyone (especially developers) within this paradox, so the correct solution would be to fix the flaw in design that’s causing this split instead.

I believe that this is killing the game industry, as both someone who plays games and is deeply interested in game design. 

EDIT1: I believe games designed around completing goals one after another by meeting some specific requirement (I.E eliminate all enemies, explode the bomb, capture the king) are flawed because it will always split a player base in two: There'll be a party who enjoys taking the most efficient route as possible and will criticize choices that aren't or are too efficient, and another who enjoys discovering and exploring the many routes they can take to each goal and will criticize efficient routes that discourage them from deviating. Most games today feel like they embrace and encourage this split (I.E casual and competitive player pools) rather than trying to curb the design causing a gap between these players, and while I can't think of a solution to this I do believe that embracing games that give up and aren't trying to solve it is ruining the design of games in the modern era.

EDIT2: Some game genres are different, and are designed around one player base or another; that doesn't make them poorly designed (eg. A game in the fighting genre is competitive by nature, that doesn't make it poorly designed). I believe it's when games start trying to cater to both casual and competitive players rather than picking one or the other when the design becomes bloated and flawed."

Dogs that are part of a human family usually prefer to be around their family, with some dogs (such as my own) experience some level of separation anxiety when left alone. It’s important to work on that issue to help the dog live a comfortable life. But I am not talking about leaving the dog at home for a short time. I’m talking about leaving the dog at home or in boarding for a long time - for example, when going on vacation. 

This seems cruel to me because the dog does not understand that they have not been abandoned. This is less of an issue if only part of the family leaves, or if the dog typically spends time with another family who will be keeping the dog during the vacation. But many people do not have that situation. They may be a single person or small family that is only able to kennel the dog or find a dog sitter. 

If I leave my dog at the kennel, my dog will miss me. He will not understand that I am coming back. He is familiar with that place because they have a day care and he enjoys it there. But if I leave him overnight, I believe he will become distressed. This would be cruel to him - he would be processing this as a loss, just as I would be suffering if I thought I lost him. 

I understand it’s not practical or healthy to never go on vacation because of dog ownership. But it seems to me that it is an inconvenient truth that, in many cases, it is cruel to do so."

2v-I know that during the last decades humans have sent humans to the moon, invented airplanes, computers, the internet, new treatments for lots of diseases, etc... but all those things are basically accumulated technical knowledge and not the manifest of more intelligent or wiser humans. Moreover, maybe the use of all those inventions would used in a wiser way if it was invented earlier.

Here is one quote from Scott Adams that sort of clarifies this point of view:

""Computers and rocket ships are examples of invention, not of understanding. … All that is needed to build machines is the knowledge that when one thing happens, another thing happens as a result. It’s an accumulation of simple patterns. A dog can learn patterns. There is no “why” in those examples. We don’t understand why electricity travels. We don’t know why light travels at a constant speed forever. All we can do is observe and record patterns.""

3 - Another argument that might go against my claim, is the fact that several reproachable concepts and cultural behavior, common during antiquity (e.g. slavery, brutal religious practices, etc), have been completely or almost completely extirpated from the world. However, I'd say that the same idea presented above, can be also applied to this argument: knowledge about better practices of human interaction has been progressively learned and assimilated by humans.

4 - Finally, let's remember that we are comparing an ancient world with millions of people vs. a modern world with billions. So, even if we consider both sides of this comparison similar in their capacity, there should be dozens or even hundreds of similar works being produced today at the same rate."
1210,2022-08-09,"CMV: Obtaining a driver's license should be much harder than it currently is, and penalties for being a careless driver and breaking driving laws should be much more strict.",u/TA2-6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wklc3p/cmv_obtaining_a_drivers_license_should_be_much/,changemyview,"Its scary how many bad drivers there are on the road. In 2020, 4.8 million people were seriously injured in car accidents in the US ([nsc.org](https://www.nsc.org/newsroom/motor-vehicle-deaths-2020-estimated-to-be-highest)). Even though that's somewhere around 1% of the population, it's still a ridiculously high number. A number that could be lowered if stricter requirements and penalties were put in place.

Some examples I would theoretically implement. If you get caught DUI, you should lose your license. Period. There's no excuse for getting behind the wheel while on any mind altering drug.  If you are speeding in a school zone (15+ over), you should lose your license for a considerable amount of time. Running red lights? License revoked.

I remember for my driving test, I was required to drive around the block for 5 minutes, and then pull into a parking space. That's scary. I proved to the tester that I can push the pedals and turn the wheel, and nothing more than that. I would have expected it to be much more rigorous. The student's knowledge of driving needs to be quizzed, and hypothetical scenarios need to be discussed. Not enough people know how to be a defensive driver or react in important situations.  Traffic theory should also be taught in courses. If all drivers understood how traffic is caused, there would be less traffic

There's a reason so many people are dying on the road: there are too many undeserving driver's licenses out there.  Driving on a public road is a privilege, and we should be holding drivers to a higher standard. If things were more strict, more people would make it home safe.

I'm open to hearing any differing opinions on this topic. Maybe it's a good thing so many people are able to drive?"

0,2022-08-09,"CMV: IQ is a generally a natural privilege, and downplaying this perpetuates a capitalist myth",u/RadiantLegacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wkm4r6/cmv_iq_is_a_generally_a_natural_privilege_and/,changemyview,"Hello, World. I'd like to begin this by detailing my own experiences, and the reasoning that I believe supports my conclusion.

CLARIFICATION: I do not believe IQ represents human intelligence in a meaningful way. It simply represents a particular aptitude that correlates with income.

I'm 21 years old. From a young age, I tested high in IQ(my parents cared for that type of thing). I was homeschooled; once I reached 5th grade my parents stopped teaching me, as I was capable of teaching myself due to my tendency to hyper focus on topics and comprehend them. I have two siblings who had more average scores, and despite our similar upbringing they had much greater difficulties with schooling. They were better than me at other things. I got into college with minimal overall focused studying, aside from grinding test materials for a month. Though I've struggled to develop the required study habits, I never suffered from difficulties in comprehension; once I applied myself, concepts came easily to me.

This has led me to believe that my brain is more cognitively capable in the ways that allow me to pursue a path in academia. It does not mean I am smarter than other people; I am simply well-suited to what I'm doing. I've done group study, and it is evident that some people simply make certain relevant connections more easily than others. Had I struggled with the material dealt to me, I would've likely been inclined to a different path in life. A individual that might've struggled more would still be able to take that path; it would just be harder, and thus they would likely be disinclined to pursue it. As a society, we should preserve the ability to choose the paths we are well-suited for, as intelligence comes in many flavors. We must value human happiness.

I am less cognitively capable in other areas; my ADHD makes jobs like construction immensely depressing to me, while my brothers do not have difficulties performing these jobs. The jobs require a certain type of spatial thinking and focus I struggle with. Had our current society organized in a way that valued the intelligence needed for construction, I would be in a poor place.

Now I ask: why do we perpetuate the myth that hard work is the variable required for desired outcomes? We are all humans; people with a higher IQ do not have have a brain that is magically more complex than any other human(with few exceptions). We share the same system, just wired differently. In our current society, there is a facet of capitalism that rewards brains that are cognitively advantaged in certain areas we now call ""valuable"". If you roll the clock back, my brothers would have been much more successful that me. I will be rewarded with more money mostly for being good in a certain type of cognition that is the flavor of the day. An individual gifted in a different form of cognition may suffer because of how society is currently organized.

Yet, are we not all human, equivalent to one another by virtue of our incredible nature as conscious agents of the world? Do we not have experiences and emotions similar to one another? It is deeply unfair to perpetuate the myth that financial success is in its totality driven by hard work, as people have difficulties in different areas. It is not reasonable to tell an impoverished farmer(who literally creates life) that they are less wealthy than a computer scientist because they have failed to work as hard. ""Working smarter"" doesn't mean much, as the farming job requires a particular aptitude that the computer scientist may lack. Different people enjoy different things, and should not be expected to pursue a dissatisfying career that would be financially ""smarter"".

Generally speaking, working harder and smarter is a mythology that ignores the reality of diverse brains and diverse capabilities. It is an excuse to avoid implementing social safety nets to support people that are not cognitively capable in the way that capitalism demands. Being worse at coding or mathematics is not a moral fact about the value of a person, and does not indicate overall intelligence in a manner that should dictate what society financially provides to them. If the capitalist system is maintained, it must account for people suited to lower-paying careers, and provide them with financial stability by means of robust social safety nets.

EDIT:

My mind had been changed in some way. Though IQ on average indeed predicts higher income, it is too general of a measure to support my conclusion."

This would in turn amplify ideological standpoints, emotional reactions and aggressive conflict with others.

This can been seen prominently with websites such as 4chan where users can be as lambasting and bigoted as they would like as there is no personal risk to do so, this idea of lacking personal responsibility then festers in the person and amplifies futures in person conflicts as, so far, people can be outspoken about their views without fear of social repercussions.

I fear that this element of anonymity will infect children of current and future generations and make them more inclined to be conflicting, defiant, and aggressive. Being anonymous can only be dangerous as it makes the person unpredictable. 

It also can amplify dangerous echo chambers on sites such as forums and Reddit itself, allowing people to share these extreme viewpoints and indoctrinate others with their ideas. It is far easier to create a social media cult these days than a real one. Social responsibility is dying, division is growing and herd cultures are forming because people can’t be / aren’t held responsible for their views online."

Assumption: While we have a social safety net, which entitles every citizen to a home and money to not starve, I can fully understand that also here people fall through the system. Either due to mental illness, addiction or just bad luck. E.g. the movie ""I, Daniel Blake"" really shows how easy and undeservingly you can end up like that.

In public transport or on the street I regularly come across beggars/homelss people. I would say there are four categories:

1. Organized begging. These poor souls are basically slaves being owned by a criminal organization. They drive them everyday to there begging spots and collect them in the evening.
2. Drug / alcohol addicts, collecting money to survie/ continue consuming.
3. People with bad luck that are fighting to get out of their tough spot.
4. Scammers / pick pockets / etc. Think this is by far the smallest group.

(1) I think I cannot help at all by giving money. It breaks my heart to see this stuff happening. I heard horror storys of some mother being blackmailed with her kids. I do not understand how the govrment / police is not fighting to help these people. If I give them money, it will not end up with them but with the criminal organization. Yes it might help them not to get punished or something for not making enough money, but that's it.

(2), (3) and (4) are impossible to distinguish. And I can even only distinguish them from (1) by social profiling, e.g. their skin color and country of origin.  
I don't want to finance someone's drug use. It's only enabling and potentially killing them. 

The times where I genuinely thought that a beggar was (3) and believed the story they were telling, I learned later that they were lying. Also I ended up giving away money based on someones charisma, which is probably not a good selection criterion.

This brings me to my view that I cannot contribute by supporting homeless people just by giving them money. It seems just super heartless and not what I expected I would do, when I was a kid.

  
Alternatives I could consider:

* Buying/giving them food
* Giving money to organizations that help homeless people  


Note: In other countries many many more poverty and (3) beggars exists and there it probably makes more sense to give money."

First, the economic argument. The de facto minimum wage is $0 an hour. If an employer can't afford to hire someone for minimum wage, they will simply not hire that person, which means they person is making $0 and hour. Raising the de jure minimum wage will only increase the number of people who make de facto minimum wage (assuming market wages are lower than the de jure minimum wage.)

Second, the moral argument. In general, people have a right to engage in mutually agreeable contracts. Individuals and businesses have no moral obligation to hire *anyone.* If they have no moral obligation to hire anyone, then they cannot possibly have a moral obligation to hire someone for a certain wage.

Finally, the practical argument. Minimum wage is completely unnecessary in order to alleviate poverty, even by America's standards of poverty. There are innumerable jobs that pay WELL over minimum wage that require no college degree and, in many cases, don't even require a trade school education. Even *garbage collectors* can make several times the minimum wage, particularly if they work third shift.

Minimum wage laws are feel-good measures pushed by politicians to buy votes. They don't even help the people earning minimum wage because they distract and disincentives those workers from actually seeking more gainful employment. We need to focus instead upon educating people about the manifold job opportunities that are available to them if they would only show the slightest curiosity and industry."

Don't get me wrong, some stereotypes (usually the harmless one) are quite true to a certain extent but not enough to generalize a whole generation. They didn't care to mention how one's upbringing and current socioeconomic status have a huge role in determining one's experience and character rather than by age alone. Some people from developing countries would find that they don't fit in a certain category despite meeting the age range because technology boomed way later than usual and therefore have different set of experiences as compared to people from developed countries.

I guess I don't really believe in 'morality?'. Though my view hasn't been changed, this has given me a lot of food for thought about how I would word my ideas in the future, and how I would polish all of my arguments. I am perhaps to blame for not expressing myself clearly. 

This was very polarizing, so far with a 50/50 % upvote/ downvote ratio! 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I feel like I am often in the minority with my view, and I have never had anyone explain to me as if I was very slow, what is wrong with the below. I feel like I am missing something, but I can't find a flaw in my own logic. Please keep it civil!

I have spent a lot of time trying to understand why people care about animal cruelty, especially with regards to testing on animals and for food. I also believe a consistent moral framework doesn't give any value to animal suffering.

Morality is a construct we use to gauge whether the long term consequences of something are good or not. It helps everyone to have a moral guide for them to make decisions which will have far out reaching consequences.

I build this from the idea that no mentally healthy person wants to die, be tortured and or permanently wounded one way or another. It is in every INDIVIDUAL's interests to then shun any activity which would bring suffering unto themselves, see death. Edge cases include when parents will sacrifice themselves to save their children.

This explains why it is immoral to kill another person; it is in your interest, as an individual, not to normalize killing other human beings, because someone will be more likely to kill you. The same goes for torture; allowing anyone to be tortured makes it more likely, even if by a tiny, miniscule amount, that you yourself may be tortured. However tiny this amount is, it has a lot of weight, because you will never, ever, ever want to be tortured or paralyzed and so on.

However, for animals such as cattle, pigs, chicken, lobster, etc., I think there is no 'moral' value to reducing their suffering before they die for food. If you had a completely automated machine to kill livestock, and no human would ever have to look inside and it was effectively a black box, their suffering is entirely meaningless, with no repercussions whatsoever. You are not encouraging any 'knock on effects', except for the eventuality these livestock mutate to become extremely intelligent in the future and decide to kill and torture all humans (which I assume is effectively impossible).

This is not to say animals' wellfare isn't without merit, I think it is worth it to raise free range cattle and chicken in comfortable conditions, though this is from the idea that their meat will be more nutritious. Similarly, I am not saying it is OK to exterminate bees, or to look the other way from an oil spill, because these have consequenses that WILL affect individual humans negatively. Lastly, the only argument that I think makes sense is that animal cruelty is a good gauge of sociopathy in an individual, though in the context of lab testing and food, we are not inflicting cruelty just for the sake of it.

Please, change my view that reducing animal suffering for testing or for food doesn't hold any moral value."

It's not impossible to fix... I watched way too many Lamborghinis driving past homeless camps so non chalant.... I ask myself ""is this where my city is headed if it gets this big?"" This should be an example of what we should be trying to avoid. 

Currently we are in the Unga Bunga stages of knowing our own subconscious and how it influences our decisions on how we treat ourselves and how we treat others...

I believe mental health education in our country has been wholly neglected and even us ""normal people"" with jobs and education NEED HELP getting past previous traumas...


If we continue down this path I believe I would become bitter and cold in such an environment.

Also it's clear that we do CAPITALISE on everything and this is bad for all. I shouldn't have to pay to park at a shop in a city designed for cars... I shouldnt have to pay 10 cents per shopping bag at target just because it's LA."

Why should anyone care whether or not the person mistreating you is family? The way I see it, they’re just another person living on this planet and if they backstab, mistreat, or just behave poorly in general then I couldn’t give a fuck wether or not they’re family. The only similarities you share now as far as I’m concerned is genetics.

I have developed this way of thinking over the years because my father essentially jumped ship and screwed over my mother with colossally stupid decisions, child support (not for me but a younger sibling), and he generally just made no attempts at seeing his children at all. He didn’t even remember my birth date. Part of me still cares about him (albeit very minimally, in a sense that I don’t wish harm on him or anything like that), but I don’t let it affect me because the only relation I have to him at this point is blood. If he doesn’t care, then why should I? It’s not that deep to me. 

Family members don’t deserve any more leeway when you’re only using the reason that they’re related to you. If they want to make things better, then that’s that on them. It’s not your burden to carry.

This new thing bad boomer logic is super dangerous and wrong

Cigs are one of the most dangerous drugs known to man and kill thousands of people a year. So it makes sense that people would be cautious about a delivery system for the same drug but there is no evidence that it’s worse and mountains of evidence that it’s safer.

While we don’t have longterm studies we do have studies of people who switched compared to people who kept smoking and we can see the reduction in carcinogens in their body It reduced carcinogens by 97% https://www.newscientist.com/article/2120440-switching-from-smoking-to-vaping-does-reduce-your-carcinogens/

They aren’t analogous the only ingredient they share is nicotine which has been demonized due to its association with cigarettes. Nicotine is addictive but in terms of harm it is at worst neutral and possibly has some neurological benefit https://www.nature.com/articles/aps200967 It’s a well known weight loss supplement and in a time when 3/4 of Americans are overweight or obese even if it’s a minor improvement that can’t be discounted. Cigarettes contain hundreds of chemicals not found in vapes that are known carcinogens. On top of that they are being combusted a process which is known to produce carcinogens vaping has less ingredients and a significantly less carcinogenic delivery method

Finally there’s the financial harm of cigarettes. It’s no secret that the people who use tobacco products the most per capita are people of low socio economic status. A recent study found vapers saved $115. A thousand dollars per year that could go towards any number of more healthy alternatives

Obviously the ideal would be that people wouldn’t use any drug, but they haven’t been around for thousands of years for no reason. People are going to use drugs, so harm reduction is far more life saving than stupid propaganda. I get the concern that many more teens are vaping than were smoking in the last decade, but that definitely doesn’t mean we should be encouraging cigarettes"

0,2022-08-10,cmv: not wanting to date trans people is transphobic,u/Acceptable-Zebra-813,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wl7ft5/cmv_not_wanting_to_date_trans_people_is/,changemyview,"I want to preface this by saying I don’t think everyone with dating preferences is bigoted or hateful, this is just an intellectual exercise if anything.

Let’s define transphobia as unequal treatment for the fact that someone is trans. There’s other definitions but let’s just use this simple one.

Many people say that they wouldn’t date a trans person because of X Y Z reasons. However, In a majority of cases, it’s usually not actually because of these reasons. 

Let’s look at some popular reasons: 

“I don’t like the penises” (for a trans woman) 

The reason for this rejection alone is not transphobic, because the reason for this rejection is a set of genitals, not a trans identity. However, let’s say this person is presented with a trans person whose had bottom surgery. If they still wouldn’t date someone whose had bottom surgery they’d say:

“I don’t think these genitals match a cis persons genitals”.

But then the stated problem is still not inherently related to trans status. I know surgery is limited but it is still an assumption to state that they wouldn’t like a trans persons bottom surgery’s genitals without having ever interacted with it. If this person were presented a hypothetical set of genitals (or other sex characteristics) that matched a cis persons genitals exactly, theoretically, this person shouldn’t reject the trans person by then, right? 

If a person, presented a hypothetical trans person with a “perfect” body for them, wouldn’t reject the trans person, then the trans identity wasn’t actually a deal breaker. It was a proxy for other characteristics (sex characteristics). If the person would still reject the hypothetical perfect trans person, then this person is transphobic, because their reasons for not dating a trans person is inherently tied to their trans identity, and treat trans people different than others.

Now, in the real world, there are certain associations with trans peoples bodies that hold true in most cases. However, I’m willing to bet there are at least some trans people in the world that would meet hesitant peoples criteria. 

So for someone to say “I wouldn’t date a trans person” is usually incorrect because you never know, even if unlikely. However, if you blanket reject every trans person without knowing if they meet your criteria or even if they meet your criteria, then you have transphobic preferences.

Edit: I want to quickly say that if you are transphobic by this definition, that is not necessarily a judgement or a negative evaluation. I just want people to own up to their preferences being tied to an irrational aversion to trans people."

I don't consume much fiction, but when I do I make sure it's got a lot of emotional depth or has really thought out aesthetics (aesthetics in the broadest terms: be that visuals, music, conceptual or otherwise). Nowadays, with motion pictures being the only fiction I consume, I probably watch movies/series 3 hours max. a week. I listen to &gt;5 hours of music a day on average, but I don't count music as fiction as long the contents don't tell a verbalized story.

Examples of pieces of fiction I cherish include: Drive, Un Chien Andalou, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Battleship Potemkin.

What I've noticed since the start of the pandemic is a sharp jump in people -from all walks of life that is- indulging in Netflix binging or licensed merchandise collecting. It feels like you can't go outside without seeing at least two people repping a Sasuke tee or chibi-characters on their key chain, at least where I'm living (Berlin-Mitte, Germany). Not that this is exactly bad, It just has become a particularly entrenched phenomenon though.

Whenever I ask friends, who are **really** deep into whatever piece of fiction they like, about the reasons why they are engaged to the extend they're engaged, I often hear that it would help process trauma.

I ask why they don't go see a psychologist. Germany has universal healthcare after all.

No or no sensible response.

The fact is it's very unhealthy if you are out there, in your own fan echo chamber, Interacting with something that isn't even anchored in reality multiple hours every day. If you are doing it because of mental reasons then talking to a therapist who can teach you methods to resolve your imbalances and/or trauma might be the best thing to do i believe (with emphasis). And if you are doing this for non-psychological reasons you've most likely got a problem with addictive behaviour.

I view fiction like high art, much the same way I view music like high art. Difference is you can't put fiction in the background.

But couldn't they also just want to see what the experience is like? It's confusing to me mostly because I am gay (not bi, I have no interest in having sex with women. Only men.) I have definitely wanted to try having sex with a girl, even after coming out as gay. I wanted to at least know what it was like. After trying it, I know for a fact I am not bi. I had no sexual attraction at all. (My body even proved that.) No one is out here saying I'm not gay because I had interest in fucking women. Why can't straight men have curiosities? I understand that if a man constantly wants to fuck men, more than one time, and enjoys it. That would be pretty gay.. But if a man wants to TRY something...?  Maybe instead of assuming his sexuality just let him experiment first and ask him what his sexuality is after. Or maybe just mind your own business, that never fails.

Also can I just point out. Even if I forced myself to date women and forced myself to have sex with them everyday.. It doesn't matter what that might look like to society, I'm still gay."

You can still face charges for the attempt, If the reason for detainment results in a conviction. 2. If flight attempts resisting the arrest for violent felonies are made, or if the arrest for their warrants are resisted:  Plea bargains of any kind are off the table, pleas of no contest and Alford pleas can not be made, and the conviction of your charges must be definitive.  They can not be dropped or dismissed except incases of prosecutorial mistrial, and can not lessened or deferred at sentencing. The verdict must be unequivocally either guilty or non guilty. If a non guilty verdict is made, you can still face charges if evident you are guilty of other crimes involving the case BUT they are new charges so these stipulations do not apply.*

*RuroniHS gets credit for getting me to reconsider my view and agree that it ultimately does not have a place in our society at the expense of hampering the investigation of other crime. BUT my view has not been changed, I do not think it is wrong, and at this moment every other retort has only further galvanized that.*

It's just seems like a primal, deeply imbedded human response. The act of fleeing danger should not be illegal.  

This would not grant immunity to any crimes committed during the attempt.  You can be arrested for them if an escape is made.

If a lawful escape is made without incident, you cannot be arrested without a warrant. You assume all innocence until then. 

REDACTED SEE EDIT ""If you're facing charges, decide to flee before you're detained, but then get caught and put into custody without incident, the attempt itself should not be a crime. (Relevant to the OP and it's responses)""

This does not apply to people charged and already in custody who try to escape.  
People who are under arrest and are already detained.  
Or people who who have arrest warrants.


I'm not trying to make defenses for people's crimes.  But I do feel that our assumption of innocence is a virtue often taken for granted.  It should not be perverted by unsubstantiated guilt."

I'm not talking about your mom-and-pop corner shop here. 

I'm talking about Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Wal-Mart, Conde Nast, Microsoft, BP, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, or any company with over 200 employees and a significant valuation, such as $50M+. 

Any Big Pharma. Any Big Tech. Any bank. Any insurance company. Any medium to large retailer. 

Please note that the above is just a subjective criteria to point out that I'm talking about corporations. Obviously not all businesses deserve this -- obviously not your town's little bookstores and beauty salons. 

Mom-and-pop shops are not ""tiny corporations"".

No, it's not just a matter of scale.

Something happens when a business becomes big enough. They become a magnet for dark triad people.

Please don't come to me with arguments such as ""my uncle is a decent family man and he has a healthy business running a tire shop"".

That's perfectly alright. Your uncle's fine (although I'm sure there are small business uncles out there that are completely exploitative assholes with their employees as well, and their businesses would be the target of this post.)

But let's be clear: my target here is the corporation.

I couldn't care less for corporations. I want them all to go fuck themselves.

I believe everyone wants corporations to go fuck themselves too.

Would crashing corporations fuck up the system and bring collapse? Okay, perfect. Let's do it. We'll get over it.

Nature finds a way.

I don't know of a single person out there who has the tiniest grain of respect whatsoever for a corporation or the psychopaths that run them.

So, in my view, it's perfectly fine to lie to corporations. 

Lie on your resume. Lie on interviews. Lie on a day-to-day basis about menial stuff. 

Steal time. Actually, the very idea of ""stealing time"" is exploitative in itself. The time is yours. Use it for yourself. Use it to poop, to play games. There's no such thing as stealing time. But use paid time to do as little as possible, as long as you can get away with it.

Corporations are meant to be exploited by us, and not the other way around. Anything you can do to exploit a corporation that you can legally get away with, you should absolutely do it. It's your moral right.

We all know the higher-ups are doing it. They're exploiting it. Sure.

Directors and VPs have private dealings that favor friends and family. They get money on the side. Everyone knows it.

Everyone high up does insider trading. They get caught every now and then, but it's easier when you're high in the pecking order, because it's in the company's interest to protect you.

It's way harder for the average worker to exploit the corporation, but we all should absolutely do it.

Exploit corporations. Lie to your boss.

Just to be clear, this is not a rant. I'm not angry. I'm employed, and I'm a healthy family man. I'm just  someone who woke up to this reality some years ago, and I fully support this idea while I'm emotionally sober. 

I've met and hanged out with directors, VPs and C-level people. I might have been one myself. They're all psychopaths and narcissists.

 Fuck them. Fuck them all.

You may CMV by attacking these axioms or the logic connecting them



What is work? What is money? In a closely knit community or in bartering system people willing exchange goods and services to make their lives better. It is division of labor and specialization that makes life better for everyone. In this system, a good has an intrinstic value, but no exact value. You may trade a fish for a brick, a loaf of bread, treatment of a disease or even a good story. 

In this scenario, the people making the trade both consent even if there is some incongruence between the value of two goods up for trade. If a person lives his life entirely on trading of goods and services that are immediately consumed (meaning they cannot be stored), then that person is effectively living ""paycheck to paycheck"". 

Money places exact values on goods and allows the concentration, storing, and combining of value. If I spend the day making bread, hundreds of loaves. Each loaf may not be worth much, but if I do it everyday, concentrate the money in my savings, store it for a year, and combine it all, I may be able to buy a house, or an expensive medical procedure, an education etc. Any of those items are far more valuable than a loaf of bread, and maybe even more valuable than an indeterminate amount of bread. In terms of respect, difficulty, prestige, a contractor, doctor or teacher may be more valuable than a baker, but money facilitates that trade of these services and makes everyone happy. 

Now what is money, money is a service someone owes you. If I have 100 dollars, someone owes me 100 dollars worth of service. No particular person owes me, but in a large society where people are competing for money, someone effectively owes me. 

In a ""fair"" system, everyone should be free from debt, and no one should owe anyone anything, everyone should be able to do what they want simply because they want to. But everyone wants to have at bare minimum a ""living wage"" which essentially means having enough money to survive and a little extra to save and buy big or important things down the line. By wanting excess money you are effectively wanting someone to be indebted to you. 

Now, in order for one person to be owed a service, another person has to owe a service. If the economy is a balance sheet, for every person that lives a ""living wage"", someone in the world is a ""debt slave"". 

Now, how does excess money end up in the hands of the working class, here are some examples. 

*First my definition of ""working class""
If you are an unskilled laborer, and you suddenly learn a new skill, where you can demand more than the minimum wage, then you are no longer part of the working class. 

1) the economy is in a growth stage, and incomes are rising faster than inflation
2) a business is in a start up stage and is willing to operate at a loss in the hopes of making it in the future
3) employees working excess hours for a fixed wage, then the surplus value ends up as savings for the working class consumer in food and other services. 
4) charities doing work for free
5) family members helping each other for free. 
6) government services given to people for free

These are the ways that working class people accumulate wealth, but notice that all of these examples someone somewhere is making a sacrifice, to be indebted to someone or giving away free (or undervalued) labor. In other words the basic principle still stands that for one person to accumulate surplus wealth, someone else has to momentarily have a wealth deficit. 

In my view it is possible to create small pockets of wealth, by creating industrial areas with high wages, but somewhere across the world someone is being impoverished by this new concentration of wealth. 

To me the only way to change this is through robots and automation, but the problem with this is that robot labor will eventually become free and valueless due to price competition. 

Lots of working class people already benefit from free robot labor when they buy assembly line manufactured goods. But these items are so cheap compared to handcrafted items, That they effectively are becoming worth nothing moneywise that they are associated with poverty. 

For example, a bag of potato chips is cheaper than a plate of fries made by a chef, even though a robot made potato chip in a vacuum sealed bag is more complex than a plate of thickly chopped fires. 

At the end of the day, a person living paycheck to paycheck can hardly escape his position as the monetary value of the goods he aspires for will move beyond the basics. The standard for a living wage is always moving out of reach as people compete to be owed money. Both the rich and poor are complicit in this as they compete to undervalue each others' good and services.

I am not taking sides on this. It's more that I always find it interesting when I hear about people talking about this coming out of no-where or being unexpected, because I thought it was inevitable.

1. In 2004, there was anger when Ukraine banned Russian TV and radio programs, allowing areas to broadcast in Russian only if they could prove they had a large Russian speaking audience.
2. As of 2005 all legal and court proceedings in Ukraine are to be conducted in Ukrainian, and only allows interpreters  for any language desired by a citizen, defendant or witness .This was especially chaotic in areas where Ukranian isn't widely used.
3. In 2006 southeastern areas of Ukraine including   Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and the Crimea, all declared Russian a minority language according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages standard. This was chaotic and is still argued as unconstitutional. It was thrown out.
4. in 2012 there was a law proposed that allowed  minority languages in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas of Ukraine where more than 10% spoke said minority language. This affected Russian, Hungarian and Romanian speakers. The bill was rejected and led to a fight in parliament that left multiple people injured. In certian regions at least 8% stated they had experienced difficulty in the execution (understanding) of official documents in Ukrainian in areas like the Donbas.
5. **EDIT TO ADD:** In 2016 a law was passed saying that one person can import at most 10 Russian books without a permit. Unauthorized distribution of books from Russia is also banned.
6. On September 25, 2017  a law was passed that the language of education at all levels except for subjects that are allowed to be taught in two or more languages had to be taught in Ukrainian. The other option was an EU language, which Russian and Hungarian is not.

So, completely disregarding the referendums on independence and the many broken ceasefires on both sides, I don't see a way where war could have been avoided for very long after 2005/2006, long before the votes, whether you consider them illegal or not.

Is there a way that the Russo-Ukrainian war, or a Ukrainian civil war could have been stopped?"

Non binary is a form of escapism by trying to separate yourself mentally from your physical drawbacks. Most people who use it have some other mental health issue and identifying as someone else is a coping mechanism for their shitty life circumstances.

I believe that by feeding into this and calling them by non binary pronouns we're just helping them to further separate themselves from reality and reinforcing their delusions, hence allowing them to put off treatment for the actual root of the problem.

Furthermore, I don't understand how this is acceptable to the people with actual birth defects that are forced to live this life when such a intersex people or someone with klinfelters syndrome that has an extra pair of x chromosomes.

This would be my personal escape plan if I ever find myself in such a situation. I would not want to start developing severe mental illness issues or drug problems due to the difficulty of living on the streets. I acknowledge it will be very difficult to leave maybe the city you grew up in, but it has to be better than living on the streets.

I’m not sure why, but I feel like my viewpoint on the this may be flawed in someway. That it’s simplifying a complex housing issue. So Reddit cmv:  Angelenos who are facing homelessness or are already homeless should move to a lower cost of living city/state."

A) politicians of in any party are allowed decades of ‘service’ and exploit that role to make policy to secure their positions while not doing anything truly beneficial to the people, B) politicians in both parties using decades of political position to very obviously exploit that role for fiscal gain, and C) there’s clear cognitive decline in the older members by form of incoherent babbling during interviews. 

Politicians should have limited power over the people which means they should have a limited time to act in their roles. There’s no benefit to the citizens of this country to have the same do nothing people in office for 20+ years. 

To counter, I propose terms for any office be extended to 5 years for a limit of two terms. If you can’t get anything done in 10 years, you have no business being in that position. 

They should not be able to profit off of policy decisions. The Pelosi family is a prime example, and their massive stock purchases before a policy is made, conveniently making them millions. 

To counter, I propose that A) they should only be able to make the median income of the state they represent coupled with the same benefits that the military receives in terms of a housing allowance based on their districts local rent costs and insurance through Tricare, and B) complete financial transparency as soon as they get on the election path, during their term, and for an additional period of years following them leaving office in order to prevent bribery with criminal charges if discretions are found. 

And take your pick of any politicians, particularly older ones, who sputter complete and utter nonsense. Biden, Trump, or any others. Regardless of your views of either political party, it makes us as a nation look foolish and weak. We need people who are old enough to have the maturity to get the job done but young enough to be mentally fit. 

To counter, I propose no one will take office unless between the minimum age of 35 to a maximum age of 60 at the time of taking office with the exception of being re-elected for an immediate second term. 

Politicians should be by the people, for the people. Political office should be a labor of love to most benefit American citizens, not a means to becoming a member of the social elite, and they should not be able to be in office for so long that you watch their mental health decline as they age.

Edit: this is in reference to US politics.

Edit: I have conceded the age maximum is counter intuitive

However, when I try to look for arguments to defend my lack of faith in a debate, I frequently encounter the following atheist saying:

&gt;Without God, what’s to stop me from raping all I want? And my answer is: I do rape all I want. And the amount I want is zero. And I do murder all I want, and the amount I want is zero. The fact that these people think that if they didn’t have this person watching over them that they would go on killing, raping rampages is the most self-damning thing I can imagine.

Therein lies the problem. While the examples of rape and murder are a bit extreme, ""be yourself"" is great advice to give only to a benevolent and virtuous person. But we are all different, and not all of us are benevolent and virtuous. For example:

* Not everyone likes to work (just see r/antiwork) - would you tell them to ""be yourself"" if it means a less productive society?
* Not everyone wants to learn - would you tell them to ""be yourself"" if it means they drop out or underachieve in school, and thereby become unemployable?
* Not everyone is humble enough to admit when they are wrong - would you tell them to ""be yourself"" if it means that they refuse to accept facts?
* Some people have antisocial habits (e.g. throwing tantrums, being rude, being unempathetic, being destructive) - would you tell them to ""be yourself"" if it allows them to be antisocial?
* Some people are impatient  - would you tell them to ""be yourself"" if it means they rush everything and think solely the short-term?
* Some people are abusive - would you tell them to ""be yourself"" if it means they stop restraining themselves from abusing others?

I am not perfect, nor will I pretend to be. I understand that it's not always easy or enjoyable to avoid ""being yourself"". But I also understand that being myself would entail not restraining my flaws, thereby causing problems for everyone. Unless you naturally have a benevolent and virtuous personality, it's better to restrain yourself to become a good citizen than to ""be yourself""."

They were usually guaranteed exemption from taxation, freedom from white encroachment on their lands, freedom to hunt and grow food on their lands, and freedom to live their lives peacefully with the customs and beliefs that had been passed down from generation to generation. 

These treaties were almost all uniformly broken at one point or another by the US government who inevitably took the side of the white settlers who, for a variety of reasons, usually greed, wanted the land that had already been promised to Indians. They were enslaved, raped, murdered, moved, betrayed, and subjected to a long genocide with the sole intention being to wipe them and their way of life out. 

Black Americans, well, that’s kind of a no brainer. Slavery, rape, murder, systematic denial of their rights or basic humanity for generations. Their exclusion from most of the laws passed by Congress, until the mid 20th century, that benefited their white, fellow Americans. The abandonment of them to the South’s racial caste system. The lack of any justice or accountability when white mobs torched their homes and businesses, shot them in the streets, or tortured, lynched and burned them alive for no reason beyond boredom and jealousy. 

The fantasy world of white conservatives has never attempted to reckon with this part of our nations history. Because in part, their is no reckoning the clean vision they have in their heads of America’s story and the reality. And also because their party is mostly made up of white Americans who, being on the other side of that abuse, can talk themselves into believing that nonsense. 

If they do respond they usually hand wave it. 

“Everybody had hard times back then”

“White Americans were also victims too”

“Slavery has existed throughout history. There was nothing special about the blacks treatment”

Today majority of people are religious and even if different ones exist, they all use the same premise, that one should have faith even if it can't be proven, one should be a believer and the non-believers are lost. 

As I do not subscribe to such views, I thought I had great scientific temperament and met many here who shared in the same view.

But we all still base a lot of things on faith to this day. This harks to the biggest religion of all - MONEY

Money rules the world today and if we objectively look at it, money is nothing but faith currency. 

It only holds value if you have faith in it. You faith in your currency is worthless to me in my country, unless I know how much faith you have in my currency and how much I have in yours. We call it foreign currency exchange or should we call it foreign faith exchange. 

Every year we are asked to renew our faith, when our currency devalues. It is akin to a religion where the rich are the priests and we the peasants. Many being choir boys. 

Think about all the money you have earned. All of it is just faith based. If faith is lost, you would have worked for nothing. In fact today we are pushing the limits of that faith in the forms of Crypto and NFTs. 

If you had sold your Camry in 2005 and bought BTC with that money. You would have made more money, than you'd have selling a Camry every day, since that day. All because we have invested our blood sweat and tears into a new religion. A new faith money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Religion is exactly like crypto. A bunch of people come together and believe in something. It is validated by the future generations, that is why you always need to keep the hype up.

As long as we have faith based money, we should respect faith based religion."

See, sex only does one thing when it comes to reproduction and that is fertilizing the egg. Sex has no role beyond that; sex plays no part in whether implantation actually happens and it has no part in whether the implantation is kept by the individual. Which means, having sex is not a promise to the zygote that it'll get to stay. Any obligation to keep the zygote is completely opinion. Nature doesn't give the pregnant person any obligation to the zygote based on sex alone.

What I'm trying to say is that sex only consents to fertilization. Sex is not consent to carrying or keeping a pregnancy to term. Therefore sex is not consent to (continuation of) pregnancy.

What are the flaws with this?

You didn't let them get enough sleep (or they could get enough hours, but the quality is very low). The only thing they can do in their free time is watch YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, go on Instagram, etc. The food they ate was mostly yummy, processed junk food.

You apply these things to ANY person, and that person will become depressed.

I'm not saying a person is only depressed because they choose to do these things, but I find it hard to accept that a person who isn't willing to make changes in their life should jump to medication first. I'm more open to the idea that a person gets on meds AFTER trying a lot of the other avenues: exercise, get enough good sleep, spend your time doing things that are more fulfilling than mindless content consumption, and eat somewhat healthy.

I recognize that a part of depression is lacking the drive, willpower, discipline, whatever to make drastic changes to how one lives. But it's necessary to slowly, over time, make little changes. Go for a walk, read a book for 5 minutes, eat an apple, go to bed on time. 

If I'm putting it simply, I have a much harder time to feel sympathetic towards people who suffer from depression that seem to live in a way that would make *anyone* depressed. If a person does a lot of healthy habits, then I'm much more sympathetic to them saying ""I simply have a chemical imbalance, and I need medication to deal with it""

To be clear, I'm not anti-medication at all. I just feel like a lot of people will jump to medication first without making other, important changes along with it.

I have recently been looking non-stop at scenarios where the human is put up against an animal, usually a large predator. What I have seen the most is the usual specification of “unarmed” for the human party, to make the fight look a bit more fair by removing the possibility to use guns or any other fire weapons that would make it an easy kill for the human.

However! I don’t find this exactly correct.

As many answers to such questions have stated, humans have evolved with weapons by their side, starting from pointy sticks and later developing fire weapons; because of this, weapons became a part of the human’s natural way of fighting, with usually the human’s first instinct having to grab something to injury the adversary instead of going bare handed.

From this statement, I grew to understand that when someone puts up a human against a beast with its natural weapons while leaving it unarmes is basically the other side of the coin of the situation. 

With a weapon (fire or not), the human has a slightly stronger advantage (if we ignore any techniques or experience that could come from fighting and hunting through the years non-stop) and maybe fight the beast on par. However, this choice is removed for the humans and leave them unarmes, which would give absolute advantage to the beast, as it still has its natural weapons.

In a few words, when I hear unarmed
 human, I think two things:

1-Badass fighter (because we take into accounts countless fighting techniques and sports that don’t involve the use of weapons)

2-A declawed and toothless lion

My view is this one:

You can’t deprive a human of its natural weapons and put it against a beast who has its own natural weapons, like claws and sharp teeth; it would be like putting a declawed and toothless lion against a human with a rifle. 

I am fascinated by how humans can interact with wildlife, either it being bonding with the beast or fighting it off to defend yourself in a death-life situation. Considering however that I am only a student that is still not ready to study animals up-close, this is the best thing I could make out of the information I had on internet, and it is probably flawed, and I am up to hear what others have to say about it!"

Since the advent of clean food, anti-biotics, and vaccines we have been de-evolving and at a fast rate. Most genetic mutations are negative. Don't believe me? Look at the history of any chronic disease and watch it explode into the population in the last 100 years. Places with dirty water, unclean food, places without vaccines, do not have a health crisis like we do in the modern world because bad genes usually don't reproduce. We know from twin studies that obesity is at least 80% genetic. We know what major depressive disorder is at least 50% genetic. ADD is probably more than 80% genetic. Most chronic psychiatric conditions are largely genetic. All of these conditions are rising in prevalence with each generation. Point is everyone is getting seriously sick and suffering immensely. I know that a lot of people think that society is causing their major depressive disorder but if its chronic its likely only contributing to it. I also have a problem with terms like ""neurodivergent"" because I think they remove victim status from a group that probably needs it the most. I am and know quite a few people who suffer from add and depression and it does terrible things to peoples lives. You can't overstate how detrimental getting cursed with a mental illness can be. There will be in my estimation a tipping point where so many children and young adults are so ill that their actions will lead to the downfall of society. For example on a large scale sick people don't want children. I am not trying to pass judgment against people who decide not to have children but there is certainly a large group of people who are too neurotic, add, and depressed to tolerate children and that certainly plays a role in the desire to have kids. You can slowly decrease a population over many generations but if the population drops too quickly the economy will collapse and people will starve. Secondly if people are making political decisions based on anger and neuroticism and that won't end well either. The othering of people has become incredibly common and I don't think its disconnected from the health crisis, I think its being driven by it. This will continue until no body is fertile enough to have children or life expectancy is so short society can no-longer function. Additionally if we lose access to vaccines and anti-biotics almost everyone will die as an infant or to a new pandemic. 

The only path I see out is large scale voluntary sperm donation. 
In my opinion it is a human right to have a happy healthy child if you choose. Unfortunately that choice doesn't exist for a huge portion of Americans. Sperm donation should be a societally acceptable and encouraged practice. Not something we shame for being unnatural. 
Sperm donations should be affordable to everyone not just rich people. Selections could also be somewhat anonymous. A criteria for health, mental and physical would be sufficient. Doctors should warn people that their conditions are likely genetic and are probably going to be passed onto their children. Everyone should know that their children will be sicker than them. I think that ideas like ""this would lead to a master race that exterminates unhealthy people"" are reductive, delusional, and fearmongering at best. We would be LUCKY, Very LUCKY, If we were able to maintain a reasonable level of public health with this system. The path we are currently on leads to annihilation.

That it removes and kills a “baby” regardless of the age from the womb. Although I’m a Pro Life supporter I understand and respect those that suffered from rape or are at risk of losing their lives, despite our different beliefs.

What I don’t understand is how people in “general” can use abortion as an excuse to kill an “unborn child”, not a fetus, a child. And this is because they don’t want to raise a kid, when in all reality they can just set them up for adoption and they can be raised with a better family. Sex is originally and is meant to have kids, yes it is also used for pleasure but what people don’t always understand is that there are risks to getting pregnant no matter what. That’s the thing some adults and teenagers (13yr-18yr) do not understand when it’s already too late.

The labeling they put on their unborn child and aborting their “fetus” or “parasite” they call it is just them not taking ownership that they decided to have sex, they should’ve known the risks and if they really didn’t want kids then they should’ve kept their pants on."
0,2022-08-11,"CMV: The ""go woke, go broke"" phenomenon shows that corporate ""virtue signaling"" is a sincere expression of their values, not pandering.",u/LatterDaySaintLucia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wlzlp4/cmv_the_go_woke_go_broke_phenomenon_shows_that/,changemyview,"People who are annoyed with corporate rainbow flags, BLM promotion, feminist messages, etc, will on one hand say that this is hollow virtue signaling meant to pander to minorities and/or socially progressive people for profit. But on the other hand, they'll say *go woke, go broke*, meaning that since it actually hurts companies' profits, the companies should take it as a lesson to stay out of such social issues.

My view is that when companies do this, they know they're going to offend some of their audience and lose some customers, and doing corporate activism anyway demonstrates integrity and loyalty to these values.

The same people who criticize woke corporations for supposedly not staying in their lane surely would never criticize Chick-fil-A executives for expressing their Christian values in Chick-fil-A's name instead of just ""sticking to chicken sandwiches."" Many pro-LGBT people boycott Chick-fil-A for it, but that won't make the company back down. There are also plenty of Christians who actively support Chick-fil-A for it - but we know it would be ridiculous to accuse the founders of claiming to be Christian just to successfully pander to Christian America. Similarly, pro-LGBT, pro-BLM, and pro-feminist stances are real stances a good chunk of the population holds, including many of the affluent, so I don't know why it's inconceivable that corporate executives could really hold them and want to use their platform to show support.

Critics also like to point out that when international companies turn their logos rainbow for Pride Month, they don't do that for their Middle East market, supposedly indicating that they're insincere. I don't think you can really judge them for that. It's like, if companies' marketing and social media went Christmas-themed in December, surely they wouldn't do the same in the Middle East, but that doesn't mean they're insincere about spreading Christmas cheer, only doing it in hopes of pandering for extra profit. There's a big difference between wanting to *contribute* to a social atmosphere in a region where it's established, like contributing to Pride Month or Christmas festivities, and wanting to outright impose it on a region where it doesn't functionally exist. If the effect of promoting Pride in a strongly anti-LGBT country is to have your product removed from the regional market, of course they wouldn't want that outcome - they may gladly tell their customers in countries where it's a divisive and tractable social issue, ""If you don't like it, don't buy it - it's your choice,"" but it's drastic to tell customers, ""You can't have this because we don't agree with your country's views.""

So, what do you think? Does it seem like corporate woke expressions are insincere pandering? How would their marketing strategy look different from reality if they were actually sincerely from doing the socially progressive version of what Chick-fil-A has done for its Christian values?"

Another critique I see focuses on how privileged and out of touch she is. To that I say she’s Gwyneth Paltrow- of course she's privileged and out of touch, thats not really a reason to hate her. I would dislike her more if she pretended she was down to Earth, à la King Princess.

Also the vagina candle is funny. Nothing can convince me that that candle isn't hilarious.

Goop isn't all harmful too, one episode of her Netflix show was actually a very powerful episode on female masturbation. While that may seem stupid it was very empowering and I saw some great discussion online afterwards.

I will admit I haven't done too much thorough research into Goop though so I am open to change my opinion, but I really think a lot of the criticism she faces is blown completely out of proportion. I will also say I may be a bit biased as I have a penchant for defending problematic women, but I do really want to know if she's done anything actually unforgivable.

Pretty much everyone I know enjoys sampling in music but it really bothers me. I listen to mostly rock, blues, and metal, on top of that I’m learning guitar, so I know my opinion is biased and I mostly just don’t understand it. As someone who has to practice technique, learn a bunch of theory, train my ear, learn rhythm, and much more, it just feels lazy to hear someone take a guitar part and throw it in a song. Because the person who played it went through years of training to create that (example Frank Ocean’s version of Hotel California, which I know wasn’t actually released but you get the point) only to have it just thrown in something else. I know it isn’t stealing because they pay to use that and get permission but it’s still lazy. Rather than pay for a certain piece of music why not just spend that money on lessons and teach yourself, then play it yourself or something similar using scale and/or note theory. Tame impala can play bass, keyboard, guitar, and drums. So could prince. They could learn. Think of how much practice and training it took. I don’t think it’s fair to them. I listen to friends who want to start producing and watch what they do and it’s not even close to as hard as learning an instrument. Same with autotune, people spend years learning to use their voice as an instrument only for someone to autotune to the same key. Just learn to distort your own voice. People want to be artists now without even putting in a lot of the time they should be and it infuriates me.

EDIT: I genuinely made this post because I love music and most of my friends love sampling. I’m not trying to hate on it, I want to understand it. I’m not trying to be an elitist or a music cop I just don’t understand because I’ve listened to rock and metal my whole life.

EDIT 2: Why you guys getting so mad and offended over this? I’m trying to have a discussion and some of you are just attacking me for this. Chill out it’s a discussion I have points against it yes but that doesn’t mean I’m close minded. I don’t have to sample myself to not enjoy it or compare to composing.

3,2022-08-11,CMV:Humans are inherently moral,u/Forward-Razzmatazz18,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wm2vlj/cmvhumans_are_inherently_moral/,changemyview,"I've seen a lot of ""humans are inherently selfish"" posts in the last few month, and I really don't get a lot of them(I tries to reply to try to change their view, but they were archived). I mean, of course selfishness is a fundamental part of human nature, but I don't see why it has to be the *only* motivation for **all** our actions.

  
Now, I have read some interesting arguments for this, and they *sort of* make sense. However, I fundamentally disagree with them on the very structure of their logic, which I find absolutely confusing and nonsensical, to be honest.  
Let me explain:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Okay, so the very idea of humans being fully selfish sounds odd. But one of the arguments I hear most often---and that I find most interesting---is that we only do altruism to feel good about ourselves. But even if that's true, key word is **about**. The only reason we feel good from altruism is because our conscience(basically COO of morality if you ask me) assures us that **we are good people**. That is why I believe that a person with moral apathy cannot receive the happiness that is brought upon by altruism. After all, if all the evil(by societal considerations) but smart(in the realm of a costs-benefits analysis) people in the world could simply have fulfilled their thirst for luxury by helping others, why didn't they do so(mostly)? The explanation--to me--is that they do not have the moral capacity(at least in their current state) to enable them to feel that joy from helping others(I know this analysis is black and white, but I think it still gives off a general idea). Meanwhile, when you eat pizza, the joy you feel isn't derived from some moral reasoning or social values, but simply because it's tasty.

P.S. Some people say that since humans are biologically wired to help others, it's not really altruism. But again, so many of us choose not to help others(even when it would cost us little to nothing), despite our supposed biological nature to. So to me, that's an exception that proves the rule.

2.   One of the other explanations for humans altruistic actions is that they only do altruistic actions to make others think they're a good person. First of all, no. Much of the good work that humans do is done outside of public view(such as anonymous donations to charity). 

But even if that's true, why do other people care? Wouldn't that prove ***their*** moral values?

&amp;#x200B;

3.   Finally, one of these arguments isn't actually pointing to evidence; but rather, the fundamental working of human nature. Humans, the theory goes are inherently(and presumably, 100%) selfish, and therefore everything that humans do must ""ultimately"" be rooted in selfishness.

But I feel that this theory ignores one major tenant of human nature: it can change. Let's entertain the thought that the first humans started out 100% selfish, not caring about anyone else. But even if that's true, the 4 year old in me would like to have a word. Humans are one of arguably few species with general, full consciousness. Therefore, we can imagine our negative experiences and burdens being put on someone else. We already care about ourselves, and once we can ""walk a mile in their shoes"" we can start to have ""empathy"";  a moral principle. 

And I feel that empathy has been with us for so long that it has become a fundamental part of human nature(#psychologicalevolution). For example, take Romito 2. Romito 2 is a 10000 year-old skull of a paleolithic man. Now, poor Rom had a severe form of dwarfism, significantally diminishing his physical capabilities. Now, in today's modern world, where there are many ways to contribute to society, Rom might do just fine economically. But back then, humans were dependent on a lot of foraging, which Rom did not have the same ability to do. Despite this, his fellow nomads were quite kind to him. They gave him the same share of meat as everyone else, and ensured his ability to stay functional.

And that was ten thousand years ago. By now, I feel that we have had this kindness &amp; consideration with us for so long that it has become a fundamental part of human nature. Hence the title: ""humans are inherently moral"".  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, there it is. Over the course of this post, I think I've made some pretty good points, and I hope I well explained my view. Now, do I really want this view changed? No, because that would be pretty depressing. But I understand that humans are still significantly selfish...so try to CMV, somehow? I don't really know."

I really do want to stop feeling like I'm being lied to when this happens. I honestly can't think of one good reason not to just say ""yeah, maybe, I'll let you know in a few days"" instead of ""yes, I can do that"" when you don't know if that's true.

To me 5 seater SUVs that don't have certain features that make them practical under certain circumstances like 4WD/AWD, electric engines (I know you can find them in smaller vehicles but electric engines seem more common in midsize vehicles) or decent towing performance fit into the unfortunate sweet spot where they're less practical than smaller vehicles that are more efficient and more affordable and also less practical than larger vehicles that offer more capability. 

&amp;#x200B;

5 seater SUVs often cost quite a significant amount more than sedan cars. Cars like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, BMW X series (excluding X7 because it's a 7 seater), Kia Seltos and Sportage and many others are all far more expensive than sedan cars made by the same companies and as a rule base models of the types of SUVs I'm complaining about cost 20-100% more than sedan cars. And that's ignoring another important factor that SUVs tend to be sold with more expensive trims meaning that most people may more over base price than for sedan cars. On average in America a small sedan costs $23,903 a medium sedan costs $30,281 whereas a small SUV costs $32,258 and a medium SUV (many of which are still 5 seater) costs $43,623. 

&amp;#x200B;

SUVs also get awful gas mileage for what they are. [Even for small SUVs gas mileage in the low 20s is common](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/Small_SUV_2WD2023.shtml). I personally was really shocked to learn that my full size 4WD pickup truck was actually outperforming the small SUVs of some people I know. And it's shocking how much overlap there is between pickups and SUVs despite the much larger size and much better utility of a pickup.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of these SUVs also struggle off road despite being nominally off road vehicles. I excluded 4WD SUVs from here because I do understand that's a need for a lot of people including myself that you don't get in any sedan (and I do understand that 68% of SUVs are sold with either AWD or 4WD though even a lot of them seem to struggle quite a bit).

&amp;#x200B;

Of course with these vehicles being 5 seater they're not able to haul any more people than a sedan car or a pickup truck with an extended or crew cab which is one of the reasons people like SUVs the most.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly the small 5 seater SUVS I'm complaining about usually don't actually have that much storage space. The trunk space in them is often smaller than sedans and they don't have anything like the hauling capacity or towing capacity that trucks have.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion the particular type of SUVs I'm complaining about often combine the worst features of other types of cars without having any particular advantage. They tend to be significantly more expensive than sedans while having fuel economy as bad as light pickup trucks and having relatively little storage space and none or limited towing ability. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should also clear up a couple of things quickly, I'm not saying people shouldn't own cars I find pointless, this is America, do what you want. There's entire classes of cars like coupes that are impractical as a rule but no one expects them to be. I should also say the reason I'm not including larger SUVs that carry more than 5 people or ones with 4WD or AWD is because I understand why someone would own those over other types of vehicles, they have distinct advantages over other vehicle categories that I just don't see in FWD 5 seaters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all of this I'm pretty open to having my mind changed. I didn't see the point in pickups for the longest time and well, now I own one. Tens of millions of people in the US own the sort of cars I'm complaining about and I don't think all or even most of them made a bad decision, they just made a decision that I don't understand."

https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system

Many people complain about the lack of rape prosecutions which i think is fine but also it makes sense. Based on the stats posted above, almost half of any crime committed is never officially “solved”. Even when they have the evidence that a crime was committed they might not have the evidence to say who commit it legally. And I believe that police are going to prioritize investigating crimes that are immediate, “more serious” and have a higher chance of being solved along with politics. Unfortunately rape isn’t one of those things.

Let’s assume out of 1000 rapes that 100% happened, only 310 get reported for whatever reason. That means at most only 31% of these ever have the chance of being prosecuted. Then, out of this 31% how many of them have evidence that meets the legal standard? Even if 100% of these rape kits are tested and are properly handled this DNA won’t necessarily provide a match to someone and even if they say “this person did it”, if that person doesn’t consent to providing their DNA they need a warrant to get it. Then even if all this is done and there’s evidence of the DNA there needs to be enough evidence it wasn’t consensual for the DA to prosecute and for the jury to convict. I read a lot of these cases and when someone is found guilty it’s almost always because the person admit to it or there was a 3rd witness. With each of these steps the chances fora conviction get lower and lower, which then creates a cycle where if rapist are unlikely to face justice why go through the hassle and report in the first place? So I think it’s not so much a lack of caring by the justice system, which does happen, so much as it is how the justice system operates."

*EDIT: Make habital repeat offenders fines mandatory.  This this would make wealthy people who would take advantage responsible for the jail time*

It's going to be tough getting 500 characters out of this from the start.

Pretty cut and dry.  If the law is written as that either fine OR jail time is an acceptable punishment.  Then it should ultimately be up to the one who is being handed the punishment how they decide to satisfy the law.  According to the law, they are equal anyways.

I believe this should be the case because if the reason for the punishment for our crimes is to ""rehabilitate"" or just deter people from committing them, then how they are satisfied shouldn't matter to the law.  Depending on the convicted, one could have a very serious impact on their lives over the other.  Which can lead them to spiral further down, and eventually living a more criminal lifestyle.

If this is already the case in some jurisdictions, then there needs to me more information available about it.  I understand that it's up to us to stay informed on the law, but when it comes to the punishment for crimes someone has committed, I would think they are pretty well informed about it."

This also revolves around subgenres around comedy and tragedy.

For Tragedies a lot of them boil down to two camps, overly melodramatic or oddly lewd, with the middle ground being usually historical biopics or adaptations, which isn't necessarily bad but not as convincing given particular liberties applied.

With Family Comedies, some do take themselves quite seriously with both childhood and parenthood focuses that are much more relatable to a certain extent that may apply to a great majority of people around the world. And with Tragedies, they can be the most profound or the most heart-wrenching moments of one's life that are more likely to bring a tear to an eye regardless if you've never had your own children because it hits close to **home**.

That is why I believe those are the qualities (with a couple I might have overlook, but point stands) that  make Family movies resonate more than Romance, because it connects you to having a home you might never have known, whereas Romance gets you into someone else's life through a sense of ***longing*** with the ~~possibility~~ to **make** a home with said person.   
But hey, that is somewhat the basis of my harmless opinion (\*preference) so feel free to ask clarifying questions and enlighten me on how it might be flawed, please and thank you.  


\*\*To be clear, it is my opinion of which I decided to make public and everyone has their own preferences and whatnot like anyone else.  
Perhaps retitling it so it doesn't sound broad would have been better, but hindsight is 20/20.   
But please, do **humor** me as to why you see Romance being more or less substantially preferable to Family movies because I am willing to hear it out.  "

A. Their parents want them to

B. They don’t know what else to do

C. They think it is a mandatory societal expectation 

Now, for the students who have a defined goal of becoming a doctor, nurse, engineer, etc., then college is an obvious step in their career. But this is a minority of students. How many students choose an undeclared major? How many just go to college because ‘it’s the thing to do after high school’?

I think time and money would be better well spent, and develop a person better, if they took time off after high school, got work experience in retail, food, trade, volunteer, forestry, whatever, and got actual life experience that could determine if a higher education is something they actually want. 

Many believe that finding a good job without at least a bachelor’s is impossible, but that is untrue. Plus, without the massive student debt, a young adult could start saving earlier and actually have more savings than their educated peers.

College should be a niche choice, not an expected next step in the life of a high school graduate.

They were further to the right economically than Labour but further to the left socially than the Conservatives. They had a strong and consistent stance in favour of civil liberties, opposing ID cards from Labour and the Investigatory Powers Act from the Conservatives. They had a uniquely strong support for consitutional reform too. The Lib Dems chose to form a coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 but they also entertained Labour. They were a unique, third force.

Now though, the Liberal Democrats have become a copy of Labour on all things. There's just so much agreement between the two.

They completely agree on: the EU, climate change, green taxes, federalism, the House of Lords, financial support for the cost of living, not supporting tax cuts, public sector pay rises, NHS funding, price caps on energy bills, Ukraine, trans rights, abortion, legal routes for migrants, the Rwanda plan, the online safety bill, regulation of the economy, employee/stakeholder influence in companies, the minimum wage, opposing the national insurance rise, opposing more nukes

They almost agree on: legalising/decriminalising marijuana, proportional representation, arguably vaccine passports, nuclear power

They disagree on: nationalisations which are more of a Corbyn-legacy anyway

That's not to say I think those policies are bad (some great, some good, some bad, some awful), the point is that they are the exact same. Both parties are also aligned politically. There's clearly a new Blair-Ashdown pact and there will likely be a coalition where both parties become even more similar. The Lib Dems message and campaign exclusively against the Conservatives and apologise constantly for the coalition. Lib Dem leaders and members appear to despise the Conservatives and only object to an official progressive alliance on practicality grounds because they know they are more helpful as the more-acceptable-to-conservatives face of the progressive alliance. Even though most Lib Dems seem to hate Tories. They don't seem to want to absorb Tories so much as either completely convert them or just hold their nose long enough to get the votes.

I really want this view to be changed because I honestly really liked the Clegg-era Lib Dems. I also love the Party's history. Gladstone, Palmerston - they had some great leaders. I also really want a third party, they are good for the country and definitely interesting to read about. Please note that my view would not be changed by pointing out that either the Lib Dems or Labour are ""more ideologically pure""."

0,2022-08-12,CMV: Professional Ice Hockey should ban hitting,u/Pheophyting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wmkq01/cmv_professional_ice_hockey_should_ban_hitting/,changemyview,"My view is rooted in my core belief that professional hockey should reward skillful play and punish unskilled play. When I say that a player is more ""skillful"" I am referring to a player who excels in various fundamentals of the game such as skating, stick handling, shooting, hockey sense, etc. 

I believe that hitting is an overall detriment to professional ice hockey for a few reasons:

- Hitting closes the gap between skilled players and unskilled players. A slower, less agile, worse skating defenseman will stop a faster, better skating forward 90+% of the time. While defensive play generally has an advantage over offensive play in rushes with or without hitting, the threat of a hit further skews rushes to the favour of the defenseman. I view this as a detriment to the game because I don't believe that less skilled players should have such an overcentralizing ability to bring down more skilled players. 

- Hitting is a huge source of injuries. Even if all injuries are only caused by dirty hits (which isn't the case), I believe that more dirty hits occur as a result of hits in general being allowed. I believe if hitting is banned, dirty hits and injuries to players will lessen significantly, even accounting for the occasional fight or dirty hit that will surface in this alternate reality.

- The existence of hitting prevents skilled smaller players from excelling. Being a big person is not a skill, yet it accounts for such a huge factor of whether or not you'll make it in the NHL. There are small players who have excelled, however, they are the extreme exceptions, not the norm. You need to be such a huge step above your peers in several other key areas to play on even ground with guys who are much bigger than you in the NHL and this is largely due to the threat of hitting. I believe that if hitting is banned, the NHL will eventually see an influx of quick, agile, extremely talented hockey players who otherwise would've never made the draft due to their size. 

tl;dr The presence of hitting in the NHL leads to an overcentralizing component of player size, allows unskilled players to consistently stop more skilled players (i.e. you can be the better skater, stick handler, shooter and still be stopped by a hit from a 4th liner), increases the rate of injuries, stops talented smaller players from entering the league, and slows down the game overall. Banning hitting would bring more attention to speed, puck handling, agility, and other factors that I believe would make the game more favourable to skillful players. 

(Disclaimer: I'm aware that hitting is a skill in and of itself. However I believe that it is degenerate and overcentralizing in the way that aside from highlight plays of the season or generational talents, consistently avoiding hits is nearly impossible regardless of other fundamental skills such as puck handling, shooting, skating, etc., thus making it a comparatively unskilled part of the game)"

2410,2022-08-12,"CMV: Swimming should be taught in most public elementary schools and be part of the curriculum in most, if not all, public schools in America.",u/shadowbca,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wmqnau/cmv_swimming_should_be_taught_in_most_public/,changemyview,"From my perspective, drowning deaths are some of the most preventable deaths out there. My overall view is that swimming should be taught in elementary school as part of the curriculum either in the school itself or at a local swim school for the majority of children.

Let's look at the stats first. According to the CDC drowning is the second leading cause of death in kids aged 1-4 after birth defects and also the second leading cause of death in kids 1-14 after car accidents.\^1 Further, the Red Cross reports that 54% of Americans either can't swim or don't have all the basic swimming skills.\^2 Further, there are an average of 3,960 fatal drownings a year and 8,080 nonfatal drownings a year.\^1 Further, the data shows that swimming lessons decreases children ages 1-4's risk of drowning by 88%.\^3 We also know that white people are more likely to be able to swim than black or indigenous Americans, which is likely due, in part, to socioeconomic factors. 

Now onto the argument. Knowing how to swim is, in my opinion, one of the best skills to learn in order to decrease your chances of preventable death. I don't think its unreasonable to claim that most people will find themselves in or near a body of water at some point in their lives. Outside of infants who have a swimming diving reflex, swimming is not an innate ability in humans and must be learned. My argument is that we should incorporate swimming lessons into elementary school (or higher levels, although I think earlier is better) curriculums across the country. 

I think the benefits of something like this are rather obvious, a huge proportion of the US population is unable to swim proficiently and implementing this as a part of school curriculums would help to eliminate many barriers that currently exist for parents. Most prominently, it would eliminate financial barriers and wouldn't need parents to take time out of their days to take their children to swim lessons. While obviously the most benefit is gained from teaching kids as young as possible, most children don't start public school until age 5 or 6 so its the best we can do. 

Now I know there are a number of reasons why this is difficult, the main difficulty is access to pools. Now I've been unable to locate any statistics on what percentage of US school districts either have a pool in a school building or have access to a community pool (and if someone does have this data it would be useful, one thought I had is this may potentially be related to the percentage of school districts with water polo teams). I say school districts here because for this to work, you wouldn't need a pool in each elementary school, rather you just need your school district to have access to a pool. Obviously pools owned by school districts are more likely in wealthier and more populous areas so my alternative here would be for schools to have some partnership program with local swim centers. I don't think the actual curriculum element would be that difficult to implement, elementary students have buses and go on field trips so there could simply be one week in which instead of going to PE the students would go to a swim class. I know another issue here may be funding related, I am, admittedly, unsure of how much something like this would cost school districts to implement in general but I'm also of the mindset that we need to increase school funding in general anyways. For the purposes of this CMV Im arguing more for a general push to get these kinds of programs implemented in schools and not so much ""these need to be the top priority immediately"". 

There are also some concerns I can see brought up with the data here. First is that one of the studies I linked below (link 3 or 4 for a condensed version) did an analysis on kids aged 5-19 and found no statistically significant link between informal instruction and drowning risk. I do have a problem with this study though as they have an n value of 27 which, to me at least, seems quite low for their purposes. Further, I was unable to find data on drowning rates in adults correlated with swimming competency. 

There may be things I've missed here or not explained well enough but I'd love to have my view challenged or changed or for people to present other ideas on ways to implement these kinds of programs or simply alternative methods.

I believe M.A.D.D. is a thinly veiled temperance movement who prefer a return to Prohibition, rather than being interested in any solution that wouldn't disparage drinking alcohol.
 
Personally, I have never once to 'drink and drive' but am a social drinker, and would like more opportunity to drink with alternative means to get home after a night drinking other than uber or designated driver and in general miss living in NYC where there's a plethora of alternatives to drunk driving.  And then there's the ancillary benefits of a robust mass transit for all people to use, it's healthier to have some walking with bus, subway and tram/light-rail mixed into your daily travels, rather than the exclusive dependence on privately owned cars which have shown to be deleterious to the individual's health. Any argument that consuming alcohol is harmful to the health of the people who partake would have to ignore that the greater number of daily drivers would have a greater impact than trying to curb alcohol consumption, there's far more drivers than alcohol drinkers every day except on New Year's Day and other holidays that have higher drinking and less driving.
 
What would convince me to change my view would either be that M.A.D.D. isn't a fundamentalist teetotaler organization primarily focused on curbing alcohol consumption or that drunk driving wouldn't be eliminated from abandoning, in large party, the American dependency on cars."

Imo, here are the problem with that:

1. What's considered statistically significant is based on feelings. The 0.05 p-value is based on a consensus. It doesn't have a basis. Scientists just feel like, ""Oh if there's only a 5% probability I'll get this result by luck, it's good enough."" Why can't I say 10%. Or even 49%.
2. What's considered ""correlated?"" r\^2 = 0.5? r\^2 = 0.9? Again, just a bunch of people in white coats picking a number that ""feels significant.""
3. Correlation doesn't mean causation, but it seems like all of science is acting on correlation. &lt;blank&gt; is linked to heart disease. &lt;blank&gt; is linked to liver failure. All the ""linked"" are based on clinical trials where they can only confirm a correlation between 2 vairables, why should I listen? &lt;blank&gt; might not even cause the problem.
4. Scientists thought HIV was initially a virus spread among homosexuals. Becuase of all the people who contacted the virus, a ""statistically significant amount of them are gay."" That's proven wrong. Why should I trust reports that say ""something is statistically significant?""
5. [p-hacking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) Sometimes it's hard to tell what's legit research and what's p-hacking.

Final thing: an effect could stem from multiple causes. E.g.:

Effect: DNA similarities in all organisms.

Possible cause 1: divergent evolution

Possible cause 2: God created everything using a similar pattern.

In textbooks, the effect above is considered ""evidence for evolution,"" why can't it be evidence for creation?"

Edit 2: I accept, from the majority responses, that this topic is too fraught with emotion to be treated as dispassionately as I suggest. Thanks for all your responses.

 I am childfree and those in my circle are all aware. Which a joke-pregnancy post I made on social media a couple of years back highly amusing to many of them. This was great as I'm not funny as a rule. Out of everyone, two people disapproved of this joke out loud (more may have done without telling me). The basis was 'this is offensive to people struggling to conceive'.

Firstly, it's not comparing apples with apples. I'm not saying 'Haha, you have rubbish ovaries!'. I'm making a joke that I am pregnant, not you. People who hear or see me making the joke who are close friends will understand the point (because they know I'm childfree) and so know its not aimed at them. People who see it and don't know me- there is no explainable reason that they should take this personally. I'm a stranger and mean nothing to them. I would not have made the joke knowingly in the company of someone where anything traumatic related to birth had happened recently. This feels like the right line.

Secondly, a position I have held for years is that the depictions of pregnancy, motherhood, miscarriage, abortion and childbearing are so problematic and normalised as such that, generally speaking, people simply do not think through having children.
  People don't seriously assess their parenting skills before deciding to become parents. People don't have strong and steady reasons for having children. People have them just because.
 Abortion is portrayed as automatically traumatising fir those who do it. Not true, and this is damaging and silences the topic. For me, for example, it would be a simple removal of a parasite, a temporary inconvenience.
 Childbearing is portrayed as completion of womanhood and of life itself. Far too few people question this, even in the age of feminism. It's something people allow into their psyche and they shouldn't. It should be treated academically, as in you should rigorously question your motivations and abilities before deciding to procreate. Considering a child that does not exist yet should be no more of an impassioned choice than any other life choice, like where you live or what job you go for. You should not allow yourself to view it as such a holy grail to the point that you become uncontrollably upset at the prospect of not conceiving. I believe all topics, including serious ones, should be joked about as long as the target of the joke is the right one. If the space around these topics is protected, it causes them to be silenced, and avoided. I believe all topics that are tangential to serious ones (like pretending a pregnancy) should be joked about for the same reason. I felt it was personally important to joke about this, in protest of the above. Therefore, I don't accept the position, on this specific issue, that simply because it's upsetting to someone, you should avoid saying it. Humour is an important political tool and my politics are well-establiahed in terms of the portrayal of women and childbearing etc.

Thirdly, the offence on this is always secondhand; I haven't come across anyone saying 'I am infertile and you pretending you were pregnant upset me.' If it did, I would wonder how me pretending was more offensive than the quite realistic possibility of hearing of a real pregnancy announcement."

0,2022-08-12,CMV: We should be able to openly discuss poop.,u/FleurRoyale,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wmv29z/cmv_we_should_be_able_to_openly_discuss_poop/,changemyview,"Every single person on the planet does it regardless of age or culture. So why when we talk about poop we are shut down by people spouting its ""too much information""?

For instance, in high school health class we were learning about nutrition when the teacher got to fiber. She said ""this is what helps you go to the bathroom"". Why couldn't she directly say ""this is what helps you poop"" or ""this is what helps you have a bowel movement"" or ""this is what helps you defecate"" or ""this is what helps you pass stools easier"". ""Go to the bathroom"" is a euphemism for poop. There is no need to euphemize something everyone does every day.

Another example was years ago during my teenage years my sister asked me where our dad was and I replied ""he's pooping"" She had this sort of embarassed/disgusted look on her and told me ""too much information about dad"". I asked her to explain how was this too much information because she poops too. She was completely repulsed and tried to get out of that conversation. For the next hour I began talking about poop and bowel movements and she wasn't having it. I didn't want want to ""impose"" the topic on her but I didnt want her to be repulsed by it. Had she not said ""too much information"" I would not have responded like this. She should have been able to handle discussions like a regular teenager.

Another example was recently I was talking to my neighbor in my apartment complex swimming pool. I expressed my annoyance with flies eating my food and he then told me ""you know what else flies like to sit on - but I won't say it"". I said poop and told him not to be afraid to say the word out loud.

The last example is online forums. Usually when there is a thread about poop the OP posts ""TMI"" in the title. What is too much about something everyone does on a regular basis?

At the end of the day, every single person on the planet has brown stuff coming out of their asses or from a colostomy for some people. We should be able to openly talk about poop with friends, co workers, neighbors etc. We should alsl stop using euphemisms like ""go to the bathroom"" or ""do your business"". Just say poop, bowel movement, defecation or any term that accurately describes the act of expelling feces."

7,2022-08-12,CMV: Oxtails are incredibly overrated,u/landino24,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wmzhjg/cmv_oxtails_are_incredibly_overrated/,changemyview,"First off, I am white and I am in a relationship with a black man, so go ahead and bash me for being white and not ""getting it"" or being racist, whatever; this is reddit. Before we started dating, I had never tried oxtails prepared in any way. The only way I have tried them is in the Jamaican/Caribbean style of Oxtail Stew. My bf loves oxtails and I have tried them from multiple restaurants and prepared by his father, who styles himself as a good cook and considers it his signature recipe. I am a relatively adventurous home cook myself.

I just don't get the hype, or especially the price. The price is what kills me. Why are they so expensive? It's literally a scrap piece of meat that's mostly bone. You get very little actual meat in the stew itself, at least to me. I am admittedly not a Jamaican restaurant aficionado, but I have been to a few and from what I remember, it seems like it's usually the most expensive thing on the menu. How in the world does it make sense for something with as little meat as oxtails to be as expensive as a nice, marbled ribeye per pound?

Every time I have tried oxtails, it basically tastes like beef stew I have eaten my whole life. I apparently offended my BF's father by saying it tasted like Beef Stew, but it literally is Beef Stew! I have made several different versions of beef stew using chuck roast that to me is just as good or even better than any oxtail stew I have tried. And you get way more meat. And it's much easier to cook.

The preparation process seems so over the top. For my bf's dad, it's like a two-day affair to prepare and he cooks them for so long to get the meat tender. That puts a lot of heat in your house which is good in the winter but not good in other seasons when you live in the Southern US or any other hot climate.

I understand two things about oxtails that make them popular. I know a big reason they are popular is all of the connective tissue that breaks down when cooking. My impression is that improves the mouthfeel and adds richness you might say. But I just don't get how that's worth the same price as ribeye with the added inconvenience of cooking it forever. Am I missing anything with the connective tissue? Another reason is cultural. Every culture has foods they hold near and dear, and food is a big part of culture. Maybe that's why I don't get the hype. I have several foods in my culture I hold near and dear that my bf doesn't get and we joke about it.

I really do want to understand the hype, and especially the high price of oxtails. What am I missing? About to eat oxtails for dinner now in a hot house, lol.

Despite what thousands of self-help coaches, motivational gurus, and youtube intellectuals tried to sell you, almost none of us is truly “productive” in the sense of making the world a better place. Being ""productive"" has become associated with working at a high speed for the same work over and over (to earn bread ultimately). This is extremely dangerous because you ain’t doing anything ""good"" by checking 10 boxes off per day and finishing 5 projects a week. You are doing hasty sub-quality work which you spend no time thinking about whether it benefits anyone, you are being destructive by hastening the doom machine that is the ""industrialized economy"" (+ the works of the laws of thermodynamics). If you aren't convinced, check [this article](https://medium.com/@marmotian/slow-down-humans-1bc8433f3a9c?sk=cda8f4fc9e5006b60846794a6b9f7e4d) it says it much better than I can do here.

I am sure by now most of you have heard the term ""bullshit jobs"" (if not, check out this [article](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/04/i-had-to-guard-an-empty-room-the-rise-of-the-pointless-job)). Being sucked into this myth of productivity means you are eternally perpetuating bullshit jobs. Right, this means we are mostly circle-jerking to make it looks like we are important and that the society doesn’t have a lot of unemployed running around. The only reason you are earning at all is because the true value embedded in fossil fuel and the primary resources we irreversibly extracted from nature is freaking valuable so that they can pay out even to people who are functionally useless or even parasites. This circle-jerking comes at the cost of almost everything else - maintaining bad status quo, diminishing our collective quality of life and the environment."

Someone posted a video basically saying that placing a financial requirement on potential pet owners, specifically dogs, to meet before they get a pet is classist, ableist, and racist all at once. 

Their reasoning was that most financially burdened groups of ppl are either poc, disabled, or both, and that by saying that someone needs to have money before they own a pet, you are saying that only rich privileged ppl can own pets. This argument also extends to homeless ppl and whether or not they would qualify as unfit based off the fact that they’re homeless. 

My argument is that: the belief that you need to be able to afford the care of your pet before you get it is in no way any of the listed claims above, it’s actually just common sense. Being homeless doesn’t automatically mean you aren’t fit to own a pet, specifically a dog, but if you can’t afford the basic and routine healthcare that your pet requires, such as vaccines, grooming, food, water, medications, and appropriate housing, then you absolutely should not have a living, sentient being such as a dog dependent on you for those things. 

If one falls into financial despair then the only proper thing to do would be to give your pet the best chance at life with someone who can gauranteeably provide at least the basic level of healthcare/food and shelter. 

I do understand that many groups of ppl who are financially burdened/ homeless are disproportionately consisted of minority groups but that does not at all mean that we should ignore the fact that dogs cost money. 


Pets, specifically, as in NOT service dogs, are a luxury, one that breathes and lives it’s life entirely dependent on what you can provide for it, if you can’t do the bare minimum, you shouldn’t have a pet. 

If this rule of existence was somehow enacted into reality , would this mean that many ppl of marginalized communities would lose their pets? Absolutely, but tell me, what value is added in having a dog or a community of dogs suffer just bc the community they come from will be disproportionately nonwhite/minorities? How does letting dogs go without basic care help at all, either for the dogs or for the marginalized community they came from? 

It makes no sense to me to say that you shouldn’t impose financial standard for pet ownership just bc the group that would be most effected would be mostly oppressed ppl, it does nothing to stop the oppression or to help the animal. By having financial standards we would at least be  helping the pets that need it."

This would increase native employment, allow other peoples to more interact with the native culture, create more influence within our society for natives instead of being pushed back, and help relations between races.

When I started masturbating, the erogenous sensations I felt were very faint, and orgasms felt weak and not at all as my peers joked or men in porn have shown. For me, masturbation was a much more mental activity, than physical. There was a huge discrepancy between the sensations I felt when touching myself and the mental process of getting aroused: the latter of which was infinitely more enjoyable.

Over time, my glans started chaffing and scarring a little. I looked up why when I was 17, and I discovered the myriad of consequences related to circumcision, leading to the grief therof:

* The penis head (glans) keratinizes due to no longer being covered, meaning it cornifies and dries up, necessarily leading to lack of sensation. Lubrication can partially restore sensations, however.
* Consequently, the glans is exposed to more friction, meaning it may start developing scars.
* The ridged band is one of the most sensitive parts of the penis and is necessarily damaged or removed during circumcision.
* A circumcised foreskin lacks the same gliding action capabilities as an intact foreskin, due to the sheer fact that it's too short to move over the glans.
* Significant increase in chances relating to premature ejaculation.
* The risks associated to surgeries in general, malpractice, accidents, bad recovery, and so on.

I am aware of some of the benefits provided by circumcision, namely:

* It's easier to clean.
* It may potentially decrease your risk of contracting some STIs.

The first argument is pretty nonsensical, unless of course you live in an environment with no access to clean water. The second one seems to hold more water, at least in clinical trials. However, I don't live in a high risk zone for more dangerous STIs, HIV for example, and would have loved to have had a choice in evaluating whether the potential protection (and I wager condoms are more effective at this) to STIs was worth amputating part of my penis.

Overall, the risk-benefit analysis, in my opinion, weighs overwhelmingly towards ""risk"". I feel like my sexual integrity has been tampered with and my ability to enjoy sexual activities numbed, yet this is barely ever discussed in most parts of the world, despite affecting nearly a third of the world's male population, and whenever I bring it up to my friends and family, they tell me it's not a big deal."

They exaggerate their abilities beyond measure in order to be worshiped and kept alive by us. The truth is, they cannot live without us. Without us, they cannot even do anything, because we must act for them like a host for its parasite. There is no sign of gods that is not made by men. Temples, scriptures, monuments, nothing of that is build by the gods themselves, we had to build it for them. We have no evidence that gods could do anything, before the appearance of hominids, so their own legacy and evolution is linked to our existence, they cannot do anything by themselves, similar to the Strigoi in the Series “The Strain”. The typical radical religious person is nothing other like a Zombie of a deity. Ironically many religious leaders have more distance to their own religion as the simple followers and can use it, to steer people for their interests.

They are born out of the material world like we are, a product of evolution and had not existed before us (There is no archeological evidence for that)

The gods claim that they have might over our death, but when you read the religious texts, often this is not the case and the gods have no might in the realm of the dead, or the cannot reach it at all when they are alive. My conclusion is, that they are mortal themselves, but can live very long. If we don’t worship them, they will be dead. If there are so many gods that claim to have might over the dead, then there must be many afterlife, or not a single one of the deities is telling the truth. 

So what they are good for? They want to live and use us for that. In return we get psychedelic experiences, religious experiences, well being, more children, political power and a community of believers to rule the world or parts of it. We can be given a place in history as their prophets. That's all."

Some games to set as an example:

Monkey Island

Grim Fandango

Kathy Rain

Deponia

Downfall/Cat Lady/Lorelai

Nancy Drew series

Dropsy

Day of The Tentacle

Unavowed

Beneath a Steel Sky

Thimbleweed Park

Etc.


I don't mean to gatekeep what a game is but when I think of a game I usually think of something with replay value (Skyrim, Fallout, FTL, Binding of Isaac, Valheim, Dead Cells, TF2, Dishonored), and if not replay value at least something you can play for a long time (mainly general examples of long-ish play time, not a lack of replayability: Dark Souls, Red Dead Redemption 1 / 2, Hollow Knight, Dead Island, Far Cry series, Stardew Valley)


When it comes to game length it always seems like adventure games are such short experiences that it almost feels prohibitive for the cost. I'm sure there are experiences you could have with really short games that make it worth paying the price of much larger and fully fleshed out games, but at the same time I feel like there is somewhere a line is drawn between the amount of potency certain experiences can have and the fiscal practicality of that experience. Even when it comes down to it why play a point and click when you can play a short but (likely) much more interesting first person game which doesn't confine you to specific screens that likely affords you much more freedom to solve problems or do things (Example: Outer Wilds). Point and click adventure games just feel claustrophobic and like the antithesis of adventure.


Lastly, it feels like most, if not all, point and click adventure games are just digital pop up books and should have just been turned into actual books instead of interactive images and audio clips. If this was the route they went I feel like they would be much more in their element and interesting. When I think of point and click adventure games I think of something a really young kid plays in the school/library computer lab or similar setting to distract themselves with the main replayability value being based in the fact they don't have anything else to play or they like speedrunning through it.


I am really sorry if I come off poorly or as a gatekeeper in stating my opinions, but this has always been a thought in the back of my mind for some reason and I've always had an aversion towards these kinds of games even though they have their communities that stand by them. I don't know what they get out of these games or what I'm potentially missing that is supposed to make them more appealing than I am ascribing to it. If any clarification is needed or I did not articulate myself well enough any questions are appreciated."

My issue is with the word **Can** and **Will** in the above statement. Can, by definition, means that something has the *possibility to* happen. On the other hand, Will means that something with 100% certainty *will* happen (For example, *I will take out the trash* if you actually intend to do it. if you didn't want to give the impression that something is for certain, you would say *I might take out the trash* instead which suggests you might do it, might not.)

So essentially, we are saying *everything you say can possibly maybe be used against you and will definitely 100% totally be used against you*. That sentence makes just about as much sense as pineapple on pizza. 

**Can** alone in that sentence conveys everything that is needed to be conveyed. Having the word **Will** in there factually is incorrect anyways. Not everything someone says is 100% used in court and used against them at that. The prosecutor won't bring up something that the defendant said when getting arrested (if there is anything) that is irrelevant or that doesn't help their case. For example, I am getting arrested, and I say the weather is good today. How in the world is that useful to anyone or relevant in, say, an embezzlement case. Good weather and embezzlement have zero relation to one another."
712,2022-08-13,CMV: Westerners should be deeply worried by our nations' inefficiency when building infrastructure,u/Real_Carl_Ramirez,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wncj1v/cmv_westerners_should_be_deeply_worried_by_our/,changemyview,"I was recently watching this video: [The £100BN Railway Dividing a Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSD5ps9bLQ0) (it is about extreme delays and cost blowouts with the UK's HSR2 project). Similarly in the USA, the [California High-Speed Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail) also has extreme delays and cost blowouts.

It reminds me of what I've seen here in Australia:

* In Sydney, the [CBD and South East Light Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBD_and_South_East_Light_Rail) was [delayed by over a year](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8102513/Sydneys-light-rail-faces-delay-troubled-project-set-held-back.html) and had [a 1.2 billion AUD cost blowout](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-07/light-rail-contractor-sues-nsw-government/9629948).
* In Adelaide, the mere electrification of the [Gawler railway line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawler_railway_line) [cost 900 million AUD and was delayed by almost 2 years](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-02/free-substitute-buses-for-adelaides-gawler-train-line/100961484).
* Nationwide, the [NBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network) had a cost blowout, costing [51 billion AUD](https://archive.ph/jL764) instead of the [original forecast of 29.5 billion AUD](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/federal-election-nbn-promises-past-and-present/7506714). Keep in mind that this is the cheaper, slower version of the NBN instead of the original version, and thus [Australia ranks #56 in internet speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds), behind even highly-censored nations like Russia, Saudi Arabia and the PRC.

Before you tell me ""*that's because your country is corrupt*"", that doesn't make it any less worrying. If western nations constantly face cost blowouts and delays with infrastructure projects, how can we possibly have hope that we can enjoy fast internet in the future? Or clear up transport problems? Or build the infrastructure needed for sustainable development? 

There's a reason why more countries support the PRC's [territorial claims](https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/who-supports-china-in-the-south-china-sea-and-why/) and [policies against Uyghurs](https://archive.ph/wip/8QMbX) than oppose them. Namely, it's because the PRC has been able to buy the loyalty of nations because it's well-known for quickly and cost-effectively building infrastructure for them. I don't want to shill for the PRC here, but Western countries' inefficiency when building infrastructure makes it harder for us to buy the loyalty of nations with this trick.

It's not like western nations are inherently incapable of efficiently building infrastructure (which is another reason why this recent trend of extreme delays and cost blowouts should be worrying):

* Australia's Snowy Mountains Scheme cost the equivalent of [6 billion AUD](https://web.archive.org/web/20060919222034/http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/ja/pressconf/2004/APC9_2004.htm)
* The USA's lunar landing effort cost the equivalent of [280 billion USD](https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo)
* The Channel Tunnel linking the UK to France cost the equivalent of [12 billion GBP](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/articles/channel-tunnel-facts/)"

After watching both shows, I think their respective magic systems allow for a unique solution: 

**Human Transmutation** (Full Metal Alchemist)

In accordance with the law of equivalent exchange, human souls cannot be made. Existing human souls can be used as ""ingredient"" for human transmutation. 

**Forgemaster magic** (Castlevania)

Forgemasters are humans with the unique ability to reach down into Hell, pull back a soul, and put them into a body. 

**The Infinite Corridor** (Castlevania)

This interdimensional space connects different worlds together, and is said to connect all worlds. 

So: 

Using the Infinite Corridor, Dracula could travel to the Full Metal Alchemist universe and take Edward with him. Depending on the stage of his personal arc, Edward would be interested in such an experiment with human transmutation. 

Using Forgemaster magic, they can pull Lisa's soul out of Hell. 

Using human transmutation, they could create a new body for this soul. Or potentially restore the old body. 

(Sidenote: this approach does not work if the soul in question used the Death Note, because its users cannot go to either Heaven nor Hell.)"

Anthrax has done amazing records, and they continue to do so to this day, and they still have the best lead vocalist of any thrash metal band (and they also had the second best!). Slayer is Slayer, and Megadeth has seriously upped their game after the 90's, and are now back to releasing consistently good albums."

It's far deeper than simply highlighting the number of migrants Texas is being asked to absorb. It's deliberately singling out liberal cities, which promote open borders and function as ""sanctuary cities"" (e.g., New York State now gives driver licenses and a substitute form of unemployment insurance to unlawful immigrants, and protects them from discrimination in things like housing and public accommodations).  While lack of adequate enforcement at the border is one precondition for illegal migration, policies like New York States' are one of the magnets that drive illegal migration.  It's setting up a situation in which these bastions of cosmopolitan liberalism very publicly and visibly have to struggle to deal with the results of their own promoted policies, revealing their radicalism as they tend to deal with the issue impracticably and certainly without any regard for the black letter of immigration law, while at the same time riffing on the inherent opposition between cosmopolitan coastal cities and middle America.  Since the typical American voter is not comfortable with the New York City or Washington, D.C. way of dealing with the issue, putting the practices of those cities right in public view drives electoral politics in a way beneficial to Abbott's party."

so many gym goers have different reason and motive for why they go to the gyms and often sometimes dishonest about it to themselves, they have couple of motives that sometimes conflict which lead them to lie to themselves when their is a conflict.

some ppl care about looking good for other, some care about looking good for themselves, some want to be healthy, some want to be powerful, some want to have more muscles, some want to do more sets etc... all of those don't always align.

i am saying this because so many thing i regret mostly being dishonest when it come to bodybuilding things that caused damage that can't be undone and all comes down to dishonestly about conflict of motives.

cutting/bulking is great if u want more muscles as long u are willing to trade that with gut issues and mental issues from stress to de-motivation to fatigue, in fact mental stuff is worse then the gut issues and why i called it as unhealthy as junk food.

in my book i wouldn't call trading more muscles for gut issue and mental issues as healthy.

i think having general plan like more fiber more protein without being so strict to a point of a diet is way healthier and a middle ground between wanting more muscles and wanting to be healthy overall"

I’ve had friends in the past: best friends, close friends, regular old friends, acquaintances, friend groups, club/hobby groups, coworkers, etc. The one thing all of them have in common is the relationships stale and fade, or the reasons why you saw each other, made time for each other, etc change. Or, and this is the worst, they say something off-color one day that makes you distance yourself and wonder why you ever started a relationship with them in the first place. And then you have to do the distancing-yourself-while-not-causing-drama dance.  

Mostly though, I’ve noticed that it’s stages of life. Like in high school you have close friends, then in college, you’re surrounded by friends and acquaintances, post-college life becomes coworkers and more professional relationships, with some holdovers from the previous stages (usually just college friends, but some people still have high school friends somehow). Then you settle into working and see less and less of everyone except maybe your SO and family. But somehow, the pressure to be part of social groups and to maintain friendships remains. 

I just don’t understand it. I’m not asocial, not by a longshot, I try to always be friendly with people, kindness and positivity are important to me, I’ve pretty much always been on good terms with coworkers and roommates and neighbors and such, but I think I’ve just had a lot of friendships in my life. It feels like a “been there, done that”-type thing. I know I’m a bit of an introvert in that I recharge on my own, and I think I just prefer to spend my energy in life elsewhere. I know that friends and connections are valuable and can help a lot in life, but for me that’s never happened.

I’m 28 now, I live on my own (not in a relationship currently), and I just feel… normal… this way? Like I don’t have any desire to have a social group or various friendships to maintain. I’m happy socially. I talk to coworkers, neighbors, my apartment maintenance guy, cashiers, random people in public—it’s not much, but it’s plenty for me.  

Close friendships and friend groups always seem to invite drama and complexity that I don’t really like having in my life.

Something I would imagine we all agree with is that treating people differently because of there race is racist.

0,2022-08-13,CMV: Affirmative Action is Fair.,u/MaterialAd2351,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wns0kr/cmv_affirmative_action_is_fair/,changemyview,"A Caucasian student who went to a rich public school, had the best teachers, both in-school and private SAT tutoring who scores a 32 on the ACT is still less impressive than an African-American/Latino student who went to an underfunded Title I school with the least qualified teachers, no school SAT preparation while working a part time job who scores a 28 on the ACT.

Merit is not just the score the student achieves but the score the student attained *with the resources available to him/her*. A student's intelligence and potential is measured not just by his test score, but his or her ability to teach himself complex subjects, problem-solving skills and tactile skills.

Public education in the U.S. is unfair. In most states, public schools are funded primarily by property taxes. The consequence is that richer areas that pay larger property taxes are better funded, better equipped with labs, computers, the best textbooks, attract the most qualified teachers and have a wider and larger subject curriculum.

The wealthiest 10% of school districts in the United States spend nearly 10 times more than the poorest 10%.

The majority of poor and minority students are concentrated in the least well-funded schools.

Poor schools, the schools the majority of minorities attend, receive less qualified and less experienced teachers, provide less access to college subjects, have significantly larger class sizes, receive fewer and lower-quality books, and even sometimes have to receive second hand books from the richer school districts. In addition, the schools are required to focus on passing the state exam and provide little to poor SAT and ACT preparation programs.

Education is supposed to be the ticket to economic access and mobility in America. Affirmative Action programs exist to equalize the playing field for gifted poor and minority students who are the hidden victims of an unfair and classist educational system.

It is designed to put them in the place they would have been had they had gotten the same opportunities as the kids who went to the best schools and got the best educational opportunities.

Frankly, very few people \[publicly\] complain about legacy admissions or admission through large donations or what I call ""legal endowment bribes"" where some parents donate money to schools where their kids are applying that admission cycle.

I have yet to see arguments against it on Reddit or any lawsuits against schools for it. I believe people don't complain about those sort of ""unfair admissions"" because legacy admissions or admission through endowment donations is an advantage they want to have for themselves. They aren't against Affirmative Action because it is an unfair advantage. Rather, they are against it because it is an advantage they can't have.

I often hear:

**Doesn't Affirmative Action hurt Asian Americans?** This is in reference to colleges putting a cap in the amount of Asian students they receive. i.e. Some schools capping the Asian enrollment at 20%.

Affirmative Action for poor and underrepresented minorities does not require schools to cap the number of Asians that attend their schools. Schools freely do that on their own. Schools can have Affirmative Action while allowing as many Asians to fill in the remaining spots. Schools choose not to because they want diversity, and because it would decrease the number of *White* students accepted. It would also decrease the amount of legacy students they accept.

**Affirmative action is taking a moral wrong to correct another moral wrong (unfair public education system).**

Some people can argue this view. It is no different of ""an evil"" or even arguably fairer than colleges accepting legacy students to fund schools. It is no different and even arguably fairer than colleges accepting ""endowment babies"" whose parents made million dollar donations in exchange of admitting their son or daughter.

**What about Michael Jordan's or other wealthy minority kids?**

Those kids represent less than 1% of minority students. Frankly, those kids wouldn't need Affirmative Action to be accepted to university. They would get in through other means (endowment donations).

**What about poor White students?**

This isn't an argument against Affirmative Action. This is an argument to *expand* affirmative action to include poor White students who also attend poor, underfunded schools.

**How do the admission committees know that the students come from underfunded schools or a less privileged background?**

The students' transcripts tell you if they come from a Title I, free-lunch school or poorer school.  Some Universities allow the student's financial package and parent's income to be reviewed during the admissions process.

**Note: This argument is only in reference to college admissions. I have never worked in human resources and thus cannot form an opinion on affirmative action in the workplace.**

1,2022-08-13,CMV: Video Game graphics are essentially at a peak and won't improve much further,u/Admirable_Ad1947,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wnur4u/cmv_video_game_graphics_are_essentially_at_a_peak/,changemyview,"Hello Reddit. I believe that video game graphics are essentially at a peak and won't improve much anymore, 15 years from now I predict that games will look close to the same and that ""incredible looking"" games from now will still be considered just as great circa 2037. When you really look at it, game graphics haven't improve all that much in the past few decades, I'm currently 15 and when I try out games that came out around when I was born like Mario Galaxy, they actually still look pretty good and not really that dated, I'm a bit of a casual player so maybe I'm not noticing the subtle differences but when I got a Switch the games didn't really look that much better then the ones I already had on my 3DS, they were a bit better but it didn't feel like some MASSIVE jump, just a small hop in terms of graphics. I've never owned a Playstation but looking online, PS5 games don't look THAT much better then PS4 games, it's again just a small hop.

&amp;#x200B;

I think even these small hops will slow down as, at the end of the day at some point stuffing more polygons and having better shading and all that will have more and more diminishing returns. We're at a point where even 15+ year old games still look pretty good and that will only continue imo. I believe that graphics have essentially reached a plateau and I'm not seeing any game changing new technologies that will make game graphics drastically improve in any real way. I believe that 15 years from now games will look a tad more polished and clean, but overall the graphical fidelity will remain about the same, CMV!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I have had my view *mostly* changed due to it being pointed out that rendering techniques like ray tracing could drastically improve fidelity, the only part of my view I maintain is that ""raw"" graphical power, things like resolution and polygon counts aren't going up much further. "

0,2022-08-13,CMV: Altruism is just a way for others to take advantage of you,u/AndlenaRaines,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wnvh9h/cmv_altruism_is_just_a_way_for_others_to_take/,changemyview,"I am not saying that altruism and generosity are bad things. What I am saying is that others take advantage of that, which is a bad thing.

Volunteering is just a way for organizations to extort free labour which deserves vetting and paychecks. Volunteering at a soup kitchen and working at McDonald's are similar, but the soup kitchen volunteer doesn't get paid. Volunteering at a convention and working at a convention are similar (as in taking registration forms, handing out badges, on-site help, etc), but the volunteer doesn't get paid. Volunteering at a hospital or a long-term care home and working at a hospital or a long-term care home (as in information desks, playing an instrument for patients, helping out patients) are similar, but volunteers don't get paid.

[Here's an example from the Montreal Pride parade.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pride-parade-investigation-1.6545574) It was given lots of money, but it was instead cancelled, because they were too few volunteers and security. A good cause, but organizers were too stingy and wanted free labour.

""But, they know what they're getting into!"" That implies that everyone has the choice to do anything they want, and that their current predicament is solely their fault, which isn't always true.

Charity is just a way to fleece money from donors whilst lining upper management's pockets. [The Sickkids CEO earns almost $900,000 per year.](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Sickkids-President-Chief-Executive-Officer-Salaries-E38931_DAO.htm?filter.jobTitleExact=President%2FChief+Executive+Officer) [CEOs at other charities also earn top dollar.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/charity-salary-executives-non-profit-ontario-sunshine-list-1.4123388) Meanwhile very little headway is made towards charitable causes. [The percentage of homeless people in Canada has been steadily increasing.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2022017-eng.htm) [Illicit drug abuse and addiction has steadily increased.](https://ccsa.ca/cocaine-canadian-drug-summary) And I'm sure there are many other examples.

Donations relate to charity. I know that there are lots of places to shop at where they ask you to donate money to a charity, but in reality, they take advantage of altruism and pass off the money shoppers have given as their own donations.

EDIT: There are also some MadeMeSmile posts which also contribute to this, l[ike a kid raising money to buy lunches for his entire school.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/04/us/boy-pays-off-lunch-debt-trnd/index.html) Altruism, which is taken advantage of by others because the system is still in place.

It is bad advice.

On the surface, it looks good. People want to be happy. We don’t get up in the morning hoping to be sad (maybe Billie Eilish does, idk). So, it would make sense to do what makes you happy.

The problem is, we often don’t know what actually makes us truly happy. We think we do, but really, we’re just fulfilling an immediate gratification, like eating cake instead of going to the gym, watching porn instead of finding a spouse, lounging in front of the TV instead of getting chores done. In the moment, these things seem to make us happy - they give us pleasure - but in the end, they leave us empty and deprived of true fulfillment.

‘Do what makes you happy’ is an excuse to indulge in cheap pleasures and skip the discipline that leads to a truly meaningful life."
0,2022-08-14,CMV: Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) is better than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (2009) AND the FMA manga.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wo0xje/cmv_fullmetal_alchemist_2003_is_better_than/,changemyview,"I know, I know, them's fighting words and all. However, after learning the FMA 2003 plot (mostly) from the Internet and watching FMA 2003 clips/OSTs on YouTube, I have decided that this ""FMA fanfiction"" is better than the original manga. BTW, I finished Brotherhood and the manga a while back. 

However, it feels weird to say that the inaccurate anime adaptation is BETTER than the manga and the more faithful anime adaptation, so I'd like to see if I can change my view here.

**SPOILERS AHEAD! Ironically, I request y'all to cover any FMA (2003) spoilers in your answers with spoiler tags, because I haven't seen an episode of it yet rip.**

Reasons FMA (2003) is superior to Brotherhood and the manga:

* The animation is more rough but also more realistic, not as annoyingly bright.
* Nina/Shou's arc and Hughes' arc are both much more detailed and fleshed out in FMA (2003) than in FMAB or the FMA manga. 
   * I remember saying that Hughes' death in FMAB was kinda ""weird/random/cheap"" because there was no hint he'd die and it was like they killed him for shock value. 
   * Turns out a lot of other people also feel like Hughes' death was kinda rushed and not-that-sad in FMAB, too. Turns out Hughes had a MUCH bigger role in FMA (2003) and so his death hit like a truck. It was sad in the manga, but it still happened too fast when we barely knew him.
* Same with Nina and Shou's arcs. In both the manga and FMAB, they show up, Ed and Al hang out with them a bit, and then THAT scene happens before we get to know the Tucker family at all. In FMA (2003), apparently the Tucker arcs are much more detailed, and the Tuckers are like a new family to the Elric brothers. 
* There's actual freaking philosophy in FMA (2003) instead of just ""hey look the main characters are right about their core beliefs and the author is kinda pushing her own beliefs instead of being legit philosophical"" (not my idea btw, I saw someone else say it somewhere on this site). Ed has his views and they get ripped apart MULTIPLE times.
* FMA (2003) seems to be more mature than the manga and FMAB; I know, I know, let people enjoy things, but depressing violent philosophical realistic stuff hits kinda different.
* Dante &gt; Father. Father is a terrifying villain and his idea of ripping his sins out into homunculi is super intriguing, but they never go into detail on it??? He's just a typical evil mustache-twirling villain who wants to become God and wants freedom and knowledge at all costs???? Meanwhile Dante's entire murderous ""career"" is because she fears death. That's so much more original imo.
* Lust got friggin NERFED in Brotherhood and the manga. Sure, she had a bit more development in the manga, but she was still mostly ""the evil bloodthirsty bitch who laughs cruelly as she kills people and has 0 redeeming qualities except her love for her siblings"", and even that love is debatable; she also died super early. All the other homunculi (esp Greed) had some type of complexity except her. 
   * Meanwhile, in FMA (2003), she wanted to become human and find out who she was (allegedly). She turned on the other homunculi to do this, and she died realizing that she wanted to find out ""where did I come from, where will I go when I die"". She was actually a complex character and not just evil for the sake of it.
* The first half of FMA (2003) is *much* more detailed and fleshed out than the first half of FMAB or the first half of the manga (as good as the manga is). Moreover, people complain about FMA's second half, but from what I've heard, it has many deep/interesting concepts and it's really sad and open-ended and it's actually coherent/foreshadowed; as amazing as the manga/FMAB ending is, it seems like a typical shonen ending to me. 
* **FMAB's soundtrack is good but FMA (2003)'s soundtrack is on another level.** 
   * I think ""[Song of Parting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSG33Ao2Ug)"" and ""[Parting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT0apMyCFvg)"" alone hit harder than FMAB's entire OST.
   * The manga doesn't have an OST, of course, so I'll leave it alone. 

\-----------------------------

Anyways, I know this is all my opinion and that it doesn't *need* to be changed, that the manga doesn't *need* to be better than its anime adaptations, that ""faithful anime adaptations of the manga"" don't *need* to be the superior adaptations and all that. It just feels strange/weird that in this case, the ""unfaithful"" anime adaptation is better than both the ""faithful"" anime adaptation AND the manga, so I decided to find evidence that I am wrong about this haha."

5,2022-08-14,CMV: nonbinary people born men (especially ones who haven’t undergone any biological changes) shouldn’t be allowed into the lesbian community,u/LumpyOldWoman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wo1ktk/cmv_nonbinary_people_born_men_especially_ones_who/,changemyview,"Amab = assigned Male at birth Enby = non-binary

On tiktok a girl said that lesbians should only be girls and it caused an uproar in the comments, people even saying that they’re ‘amab enby but identify as lesbian’, and some had ‘he/they’ pronouns, so don’t identify as a girl in any way.

I don’t think this is right. I think being lesbian should be a female only community as it literally means these girls aren’t attracted to men. If a girl says she’s lesbian you would assume she would only want to date other girls (as lesbian implies), so the amab enby wouldn’t be finding a lesbian partner, especially if they’re masculine presenting. This isn’t transphobic, this is their sexuality, men and their bodies aren’t attractive to lesbians. They would probably have to date a straight/bi girl, in which case it wouldn’t be a lesbian relationship.

I know people are saying that the definition of lesbian is a ‘non-man dating a non-man’, and even arguing that two amab enbys dating can be a lesbian relationship, which is just not right at all. Imagine two men with he/they pronouns saying ‘oh this is my bf, he’s in a lesbian relationship with me’.

I just don’t see how they should be part of the lesbian community, if it invalidates them to be called straight surely it’s equally as invalidating to be called lesbian? I think if they don’t want to be put into a micro labelled binary as some were saying, they should be unlabelled but just say they’re attracted to women?

I also think the lesbian community should be a safe space for women, and amab enbys being allowed in could potentially cause some uncomfortableness among the other people within it"

The only justifiable instance that would have any tangible outcome would be in the medical field.  The study of concousness and it's effect on our well being are not fully known, and further knowledge could impact different areas of mental health.

If the reason for it's study is to perpetually theorize existential implications, then the time, money, and priceless graduate/doctoral contemplation is wasted.  

If the reason for its study is to investigate it's relevance to any kind of ""higher power"", they would also be wasted (arguably more).

I believe the answers to these questions should only be pursued leisurely, and the use of resources pursuing these unanswerable questions should be considered with the utmost care.  

Across all of academia things like astrology, the paranormal, and many other recognized as such pseudosciences, are being investigated at the expense of these resources.  

I am not discounting them as interesting topics of discussion.  But ultimately their answers are subjective to the point of a near theoretical impossibility.  ""Near"" being used there liberally to the point of irony.  

We are beings of the highest known intelligence.  Because of this, feel compelled to fabricate explanations to these otherwise unanswerable things.  As our species progresses,  it becomes forgotten these answers were founded through completely introspective and fictitious means.  Eventually we start to feel growing pains as we continue to hold onto these man made beliefs as our species begins to mature into adolescence.  After many millennia of angst and our species  nears collective society, it becomes hamstrung and conflicted about these overheld beliefs, and the bigger issue of further fabrication and the forced belief of them arises. We all know where this has went, we know the price that's been paid.

We are thankfully at this moment, starting to tip toe out of these woods.  We feel those growing pains less frequently as we begin to slowly mature.  As we mature, we recognize how extraordinary these questions are, and in a moment of self realization, become aware that they are beyond our comprehension.  We no longer need them to be answer to help us sleep well at night.  And any kind of contemplation towards them besides in personal, religious, or general public collective  consideration is not wise.  This also speaks to our hubris that we could even answer these kinds of questions. 

While not a newly discovered revelation, I am leaving it subjective to criticism.  Any and all points will be considered, but would like to be clear those based on morality will be less.  We're already diving into an infinitely deep hole, to burden it's discussion any further with questions regarding moral implications is simply not productive.  I will still fairly read and consider them, but know I do not have much to give on it."

As we looked to solve this problem, the Mod team noticed that the _vast_ majority of accounts that come to CMV to be disruptive share one of two traits:  they are either brand new accounts or they have very little participation on Reddit.  Specifically, accounts younger than 90 days and/or less than 100 comment karma.

In light of this, we have made three updates to our [moderation standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modstandards) to address this problem:

-----

**Update 1:  Posting Thresholds**  
We have always required that brand new accounts have a small degree of history on Reddit to post on CMV.  However, it has come to our attention that these thresholds were too low, allowing too many new accounts to ""age up"" too quickly.  To combat this, we have raised our thresholds as they related to comment karma and account age.  These new thresholds will remain secret so as not to give users a guide on how much to age their accounts prior to trolling, but we will say this:  they are _much_ lower than 90 days/100 karma.

Users who wish to use a throwaway account to post a CMV may still do so by verifying their primary account privately with the Mod team via modmail.

-----

**Update 2:  Unilateral B Removals**  
For young accounts, Mods may now remove posts for Rule B unilaterally and subject them to retroactive review by a second Mod.  Young accounts are defined as accounts younger than 90 days **or** less than 100 comment karma.

-----

**Update 3:  Accelerated Bans**  
For young accounts, any violations of Rules B, E, 2, or 3 will authorize Mods to hold an internal Permanent Ban-on-Next-Violation (BONV) vote for that account.  If the vote hits our standard +3 threshold, the account will be informed that they have been issued a BONV notice, and any further infractions of Rules B, E, 2, or 3 will result in a permanent ban from CMV.  Young accounts are defined as accounts younger than 90 days **or** less than 100 comment karma.

Once the account reaches 90 days **and** 100 comment karma, the BONV notice will expire and the account will be subject to our normal ban process, as outlined in the moderation standards.

1606,2022-08-14,CMV: the majority of America’s problems are directly tied to our education system’s lack of funding and quality.,u/ire1738,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wo8egx/cmv_the_majority_of_americas_problems_are/,changemyview,"To start, I’m not saying that America has the worst education system in the world. I do, however, think it is bad for today’s children and the children of the past, and were seriously starting to suffer for it now.

But first, I want to talk about teachers and counseling. There is a lack of teachers and counselors in many states across the country because they simply aren’t being paid enough. These people raise the children of America, the least they can receive in return is 6 figures. How can you expect people to put effort into such an important job when they’re not paid enough?

Problem 2: this system kills creativity and imagination. A lot of the problems that people highlighted during online school are also present in in-person schooling—one-size-fits-all, boring, not fit for kids who want to do things instead of listening. Because of this, people don’t listen very often in school, and those who do often don’t fully process the 8 hours of information thrown in their face by people who, as they say, “don’t get paid enough for this.” Result: you end up with a lot of kids who don’t know much at all.

These issues, however, become a SERIOUS problem when these mishandled children enter the real world. For example, many people don’t know how the electoral college works or congress, yet we spent a year going over this in high school. A lot of people think that the president can make laws (I am not joking), and even more people think that the president directly controls the economy. My year in AP Gov has taught me how these things work, but there are people that our system left behind in my classes who will grow up and enter society without these important bits of info. Many people can’t do basic algebra/arithmetic consistently and reliably when it’s fundamental to mathematics and most jobs. These are just a few examples, but by far one of the worst ones is a general misunderstanding of history. There are people who deny the existence of the party switch, for a single example. I won’t go too far into this because I don’t want to disrespect people’s political views by accident, but I think the general point is there. Of course, the most MOST explicit example is climate change/global warming, where people will deny things that I learned in elementary school, but I think I’ve listed enough examples now.

Easiest way to change my view: show me something else that causes more problems in today’s society."
0,2022-08-14,CMV: Racial discrimination is not wrong in certain contexts,u/Spider-Man-fan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wo91hp/cmv_racial_discrimination_is_not_wrong_in_certain/,changemyview,"Please read the description before downvoting. This is something I’m really confused about and I’m actually feeling some cognitive dissonance, so I just need some clarity. I want my view to be changed because racial discrimination in any context feels wrong to me, yet the conclusion I’ve drawn is that it’s not always wrong.

It seems to me that it’s only wrong to take away someone’s right(s). If you’re not doing something that’s actively going against someone, then you’re not doing anything wrong. This is where my view may be flawed. May need someone more versed in moral philosophy to chime in. So if someone refuses to, say, have sex with someone of a different race/ethnicity due to being racist against them, then that seems to be ok because no one has a right to have sex with them. They’re not taking away anyone’s right. While their view is wrong, they’re not doing anything wrong. As long as they’re not actually going out of their way to take away someone else’s rights, including killing someone, or even just voting for something that would take away someone’s rights, then they’re not doing anything wrong.

Now, another context I’m confused about is discrimination when hiring someone for a job. I’m trying to understand how laws against this came to pass. If someone has a business, isn’t it their right to choose who can work under them since it is their business? I suppose this is a lot more complex. Perhaps they do have a right to discriminate this way, but the government has a right to shut their business down, and we as a collective majority have the right to vote for those in government.

Ultimately, I’m wondering at which point do we not have the right to choose who we associate/interact with, or, like, what level of interaction do we not have a right to avoid? I may need to make a post in r/askphilosophy because it’s something I’m curious about."

Most of them only care about themselves.  There are 2 primary types of folks that get into politics:

1. By far, the majority of people attracted to these roles are people looking for power and control.  They hunger for the recognition and want to play the part.
2. Another big reason people get into politics, is because they have a personal motivation.  They feel like it can benefit themself by taking office.

There is a small subset of folks who have good intentions, but to make it to the very top, you have to play the game.  These folks slowly turn corrupt over time.

Update: I think alot of you have made great points, and I've partially changed my view.  I do agree many of the local positions can have good people in it.  I guess good and bad people can be attracted to any position, but the more rewards/power/prestige/control a job has, it has alot more negative people vying for that position."

So I was originally going to make a post about overpopulation being the root cause of all our problems, i.e climate change, drought etc. and segway into something similar to this one, but last night I saw the United Kingdom (where I live) was trending because we're being told to use water sensibly in the midst of extreme heat. Most of the comments were just ""No I'm not going to do that because..."" followed by a complaint about celebrities and water companies NOT using water sensibly. For instance, Rishi, one of our candidates for Prime Minister, just bought a swimming pool. And I see this EVERYWHERE. Whenever we're given guidelines, it's always someone else's fault and so we're just going to carry on as we are and hope THEY change.

First of all, everyone who upvoted and therefore agreed with that comment, I'm assuming they'll all carry on as they are, fill up paddling pools or whatever and in doing so have more of an impact on the water supply than Rishi alone, create the problem we're being warned about, and then continue to blame it on Rishi as if they did nothing wrong.

I don't know anything about either candidate nor do I care, I just hope whoever wins does a good job of running the country. If a nice house with a swimming pool is a factor in their wellbeing that allows them to do that job, then it's a good investment. Far better of an investment than filling up x number of paddling pools for one day. Same goes for any celebrity providing a service for millions of people.

Finally, the actions of an individual making a bigger impact than you do not excuse your smaller impact. That's a laughable idea and is nothing more than you using your jealously to deflect all of the attention and responsibility away from you and scapegoat it on someone else. Celebrities and entrepreneurs, anyone who has worked hard in their life, should not have to live the life of anyone who spent all of their time in school making TikTok videos. If that's you, you are where you are because of you. No one else. Same goes for me.

If you're reading this, you have a platform where you can do the good you want to do in this world and call out the celebrities and politicians for their wrongdoing. More power to you. But then you ruin it by claiming that because of their actions, you're going to do whatever the hell you want as well. So you convince everyone that they should do the same and then when they do, and the consequences happen, oh no, there was nothing I could have done, why did this have to happen to me??!!! And I'm supposed to feel sorry for you and not blame you?

If a small percentage of the world were equally or more responsible for ALL of the world's problems than the remainder, do you not think the people looking at the water supply levels and rising temperatures, saying ""This is not fucking good"", and setting out guidelines to prevent the consequences, do you not think they'd be focusing on the smaller percentage, because it'd be easier? Why do you think they give us the guidelines as well?

You're accountable. I'm accountable. Show some common sense here."

The warrant was obtained through legal means and was based on evidence and not politically motivated, the appropriate legal checks and balances were in place, and the seriousness of the charges being investigated all mean that the search was completely necessary.

0,2022-08-14,"CMV: It was unprofessional of the plaintiff's attorney to say that Alex Jones's lawyer ""messed up"".",u/TreeLicker51,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/woihsd/cmv_it_was_unprofessional_of_the_plaintiffs/,changemyview,"**Update:** I am not familiar with all of the plaintiff attorney's conduct over the course of the trial, but I get the sense that he had plenty of opportunities to call Jones's lawyer a fuckup and at this point in the trial, his incompetence had been put on display so many times that nobody even cared anymore. In ordinary circumstances this still would have been a breach of professional conduct, but not here. Furthermore, he may have had an obligation to make Reynal's incompetence known. View changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I saw the Legal Eagle video on this before I posted this CMV.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: during the pretrial phase of a widely publicized defamation suit against Alex Jones that took place earlier this month, the defendant (Jones) was instructed to hand over a record of all text messages from the last two years that mentioned the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. A shocking revelation occurred when the plaintiffs' attorney, Mark Bankston, revealed that Jones had failed to hand over a number of text messages concerning Sandy Hook. [Johnston dropped this truth bomb using the following language:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC9RiRUF21A&amp;ab_channel=GuardianNews)

&gt;Mr. Jones, did you know that twelve days ago--*twelve days ago*\--your attorneys messed up and sent me an entire digital copy of your entire cell phone with every text message you've sent for the past two years, and when informed, did not take any steps to identify it as privileged or protect it in any way, and as of two days ago, it fell free and clear into my possession, and that is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have this text message about Sandy Hook?

Moments prior, Bankston has been showing Jones a transcript of a text that he had obviously tried to conceal. Jones denied any knowledge of it. Let me make it clear that I am glad Jones lost the case. Furthermore, Bankston was right to call Jones a liar, and the judge was right to reprimand Jones as she did later. However, it was unprofessional and uncalled for of Johnston to accuse Jones's attorney of ""messing up."" Here are some reasons for why I think this:

1. If Jones's attorneys *had not* sent a complete record of all of Jones's texts, they would have been withholding evidence. It does not seem like ""messing up"" when a lawyer's conduct complies with a court order.
2. Jones's attorney did not attempt to redact the evidence when he was given the opportunity.
3. Jones's attorney did not object to Johnston's comment.
4. In general, it strikes me as bad practice, or contempt, for one lawyer to openly accuse another lawyer of incompetence in the courtroom.

Bankston's job was to attack Jones, not his attorney. He could have omitted this remark and focused on Jones's dishonesty and his case still would have been just as powerful. For one lawyer to take this opportunity to discredit a colleague was unnecessary, irrelevant to proving his case, possibly misleading, and unprofessional. That crossed a certain line of collegiality and respect that should be upheld in the courtroom. Change my view."

I (32M) am fortunate right now to be working a job that I absolutely love. However that wasn't always the case. I was raised with the mentality of working an honest days work for an honest day's pay and that you should give 110% in anything you do.

Before I worked for a retail establishment for over a decade where I worked my way up from part time to full-time, and from stocking shelves/registers to a semi-supervisor role. I didn't like working there much. However, I still gave it my all each and every day. Barely called in sick, gave up time off to cover for slackers/call outs, generally went above and beyond. It was tough a lot of the time but I kept trudging through knowing my other option was no more money and defaulting on student loan debt on the unemployment line.

My beef was always with others who didn't work as hard or always called out. Cause generally, guess who got to pick up the slack in that case?

I was luckily enough to be hired full time at a video company i freelanced for for many years, primarily because of my work ethic which got the attention of the owner. It's tough sometimes, and I'm still mired in student loan debt, but I'm slowly trying to get out of the hole. If I don't work, I don't get paid. If I don't get paid, I can't pay my bills/loans and I lose everything. Dealing with Sallie Mae student loan services is like dealing with the mob folks!

I still know people that work at the store I worked at, and the full timers are being worn down because they have trouble hiring good workers even for 15 an hour.

With the rise of antiwork and other talks of unionization amongst other retai, it just makes me puzzled sometimes where work ethic went?

I know I sound pretty atypical of people my age, but I'd like to think I'm open minded enough to change my view on this topic.

Thank you!

Edit: I'll concede. This was not a good mentality to have. For anyone I may have offended, I sincerely apologize. I got a lot to think about and maybe I should look deeper into worker rights antiwork movements.

It's sobering and saddening to realize, I've spent over a third of my life slaving away for peanuts."

0,2022-08-14,CMV: Categorically not dating bi people as a straight person is always homophobic.,u/Roelovitc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wojhvy/cmv_categorically_not_dating_bi_people_as_a/,changemyview,"I think dating preferences are very personal, and you can generally not fault someone for their dating preferences. For many preferences I think we can all agree we wouldnt fault someone for having them.

For other preferences, they're a bit more controversial. For instance, I think not wanting to date trans people is usually not transphobic, and not wanting to date X race of people is not necessarily racist, depending on the reasoning. Say for instance someone does not want to date any south-east asian person. Thats only racist if they dont want to date them because of racist reasons. If they dont want to date such a person because they're simply not physically attracted to south-east asian people, then they're not racist (assuming their lack of phyiscal attraction doesnt ultimately stem from racism, which probably often is the case, although not always). So in another terms, there are non-transphobic reasons to not date a trans person, and there are/might be non-racist reasons to not date a person of X race.

Which brings me to my point: I've seen quite a few people online state they wouldnt date a bi person. I cant think of any non-homophobic/biphobic reason why a straight person would categorically not date a bi person. There is nothing inherently different about bi people in appearance or behavior that could categorically exclude them. Similarly, I cant think of any non-heterophobic/biphobic reason why a gay person wouldnt date a bi person.

Of course, in my examples, assume the bi person is of the gender that the person is attracted to."

Furthermore, Anne Frank had black hair. Everyone knows how she was victimized by the movement that Hitler created. Hitler did not want women with black hair and many of those women were Jewish. The main reason the ""Nazi ideal"" was created by Hitler was to get rid of Jewish women specifically."

However, things I've seen in real life and on the internet ""Not just porn"" have made it abundantly clear men and women put importance in it.


The fetishization of black men is a big deal, not just as a huge porn category, but as an uncomfortable subject in general. 


When I used to have women as friends, they said some of the weirdest things about black dudes. Maybe it was just a white woman thing or something, but in my experience, white women fetishized these dudes, and all of it was about the dick.




Think about it, would these women be saying weird things about a guy with a modest 5 inches like myself? People say women don't talk about sex that much compared to men, but dang, they were vocal as possible.




Very well could be just one weird group, but big dicks are praised everywhere.




I'm limited right out the gates. Everything I can do, a big dick guy can as well. He can do oral, play with toys, clitoral stimulation.


I can do these things, but he will always have a large dick, will have to always worry if I'm good enough.



How many cuck dudes are big? My theory is a lot aren't, stemming from the low self-esteem. That's how men begin to share their wives around.



Penis size does matter, it gives off positive confidence, and the man will never have to worry his wife secretly wishes he was bigger.




That's my 2 cents anyway."

The view I have now is that a small amount of deflation (1-3%) should be the goal of economies instead of 1-3% of inflation as it currently is. 

The effects of minor deflation on a society would benefit lower classes and creditors and hurt upper classes and debtors which would cause a reduction in investment, lending, and asset prices.  

Consumption would decrease, spending money on bad/risky investments would decrease, unemployment would go up.

I'm not under any illusion that deflation would not hurt some people but the biggest reason I feel like it would be a very good thing is due to climate change.

Humanity is driving itself off a cliff despite our efforts to stop.  If countries start deflating their currencies consumption and waste will go down, people will start having a more forward thinking mindset and maybe we won't  have mass starvation in 2050.

What would change my view would be historical evidence of the negative effects of deflation throughout history, more optimistic climate change models,  counter economic viewpoints from classical economists, or studies on human behavior."

Especially large shooter events always follow the same pattern.   Disgruntled young man buys weapons as easily as he buys a chocolate bar.  Disgruntled young man attacks softest target he can think of.  Disgruntled young man kills self, or is shot, or arrested.  American public is horrified and transfixed. Gun owners defend their position.  Lawmakers do little or nothing.  Disgruntled young man goes to prison if they survived. 

Rinse and repeat.  

In any other country, these events are followed up with a major security and legislative review and severe new restrictions. 

Instead what you have is a low level civil war. It’s too frequent and repetitive to be newsworthy, especially considering you are unable and unwilling to effect change.

Nobody is born with a cultural identity. It is through contact with gastronomy, tradition, history, tales, places, art, inter alia... that you develop a cultural identity of your ancestors, your homeland or the nation you inhabit.
Let's imagine that someone develops a different cultural identity from his family and state, and would like to live in a different country. Would we take it as true and acceptable if such a person said: ""I wish I was born in Austria and not Australia. I was born in the wrong country""? Obviously not, it's not the country's fault that this person was born in it and developed a different identity.

The same logic applies to sex and gender. Nobody is born with a gender. Gender is an identity that one develops and acquires. Gender is not something that we discover as if it had always been there since birth and that we become aware of its existence from one moment to the next. Gender, like culture, is a developed identity, that blooms by life experiences.

When we develop a gender identity that does not correspond to our sexual identity, sexual dysphoria arises, which is the imbalance and clash between a physical, biological and objective identity, sex, and an abstract, psychological and subjective identity, gender.
Now, sexual dysphoria is perfectly acceptable and understandable, what it isn't, it's those who suffer from it claiming that they were born in the wrong body. Such a person was not born in the wrong body, he was simply born in a body, with one sex, and developed a gender identity that is at odds with the sexual identity.

The body is not wrong, the body exists before gender, therefore gender cannot accuse the body of error, since the genesis of the body precedes that of gender. That would be the same as wanting to change the culture of a country because we don't identify with it.
Someone with sexual dysphoria claiming they were born in the wrong body is as true and logical as someone poor claiming they were born into the wrong family because they want to be rich.

This is just what I think, change my view"

These people tell you to try to invest more that 20% of your sallary every month for more than 40 years so you can cash them out at 60 yo. 

First of all, I do agree that in theory the math is correct and that on paper it sounds right, but why does nobody take in consideration the various fluctuations and events that could come up and destroy this entire plan. 

We got absolutely no guarantee that the economy, especially WallStreet, is going to be stable in the next 5 years, yet we tell all these people to invest for 40 years. The pandemic &amp; Ukraina vs Russia War &amp; Financial Recesion all came in a span of 1 year ( might be a domino effect, but still ). 

People who managed to invest for such a long time, have benefited from the most stable period of time in humanity's timeline. Everyone was sick of wars after 1945 and every state focused on developing themself and forming alliances. Now, 60 years later, there is conflict all over the globe and we saw that a single news article shared enough times can completly destroy a stock or put the entire market in a bear state. 

Writing this article now I think that you could rephrase my view as : If the market needs to be in an evergrowing stable state, how can we tell people to bet on investing for the next 40 years with so many political and financial tension all over the world. 

Bonus question : if a big conflict would arise, would the stock market survive ?"

Brittney Griner is an athlete who is of no actual physical threat to Russia. How is this a fair trade from the perspective of the US? 

My view is that when Russia demanded Viktor Bout in exchange for Brittney Griner, they were calling our bluff. They had no expectation that the US would actually release a prisoner whom they have been trying to have released for years, and Russia knows of the two, which person poses more of a threat to the other nation and which is more dangerous to release. That is why they are agreeing to the trade.

Additionally, Brittney Griner should have known better. She was traveling to Russia, a country with very strict drug laws, and I would be surprised if this was the first time that she brought cannabis products into Russia, it was just the first time she got caught. Whether we agree with the laws or not, when you are in another nation you are a guest in that nation and subjected to their laws. We have to suspend our understanding of cannabis in the US and understand that in the eyes of Russia, she broke the law and must do the time. 

Finally, we are willing to trade a violent Russian arms dealer for an athlete while there are still people in the US sitting in jail for possession of cannabis? This is an insult to those people sitting in prison. Release them as well, then."

But in the words of Bill Burr, ""*Everybodys eating a shit sandwhich... some people got more or less shit, but everybodys eating one*""

I don't like this notion of ""*the Patriarchy*"" for a few reasons

1. oppression olympics divide us

everybody gets fucked over as I stated above... women get the shit end of the stick in a lot of instances, but so do guys!  Guys primarily fill prisons, guys are primarily the victims of violent assault, guys have a massively higher suicide rate than women, guys work almost all the most dangerous, life threating jobs, guys are falling behind in education and school enrollment where women are succeeding etc...

Let's stop looking at this through the lens of saying, ""*well, women have it 5% worse in this one arena, and 3.76% worse in this other arena... therefore, patriarchy!  fuck men, they're oppressing us!*""

everyone is oppressed, stop making it an ""us vs them"" scenario it's dividing us.

2. its a terrible message to deliver to the younger generation

I think the worst, most toxic message that we can give to little girls is that they're oppressed and that the system is rigged against them from the hop!  This notion, that great forces, driven by men, conspire against them to make sure that they will never succeed!

I mean, aside from the fact that this is also a divisive message that will most likely breed resentment towards men... it's also probably super deflating for alot of people in terms of motivation and ambition.

Anyways... no hate towards women!  As I said, I know that women get the shit end of the stick in alot of situations and I have nothing but respect for what they have to put up with.  But yeah, as per my argument above, I think the notion of the patriarchy is silly and we shouldn't be pushing it."

40,2022-08-15,CMV: I'm left-wing and I don't believe in cultural appropriation.,u/LuccaWolff_900,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wp3g3u/cmv_im_leftwing_and_i_dont_believe_in_cultural/,changemyview," So  I'll add some context about myself, just to get a few things clear.  I am white. And I am a radical leftist (Anarcho-Syndicalist to be  precise) I mentioned that I'm a leftist because I want to be clear that  my line of reasoning strongly differs from right wingers and centrists.  My justification is in line with left wing anti racist thought.   

Another disclaimer to be added: I don't consider black face and racist  costumes or deliberately using a culture or expression at the expense of  making fun of it, so called ""cultural appropriation."" That is just  racism. Pure and simple.  

 So here's my arguments:

   1) So called ""cultural appropriation"" is purely association and nothing  more.  Let's look at a classic example. A black person with dreads is often  told to look be presentable (aka white)  which results in them having to  lose their dreads when trying to get a job. White people who get dreads  usually don't get fired for them. The thing is, this unfairness is  irrelevant to white people getting dreads. It's however very relevant to  the racist boss who doesn't hire/decides to fire black workers for  having dreads. You really think Whitey McKKK suddenly changed his mind  the moment his white only workers decided to distance themselves from  black culture? The Nazis on Stormfront celebrate this, if anything. With  the pretense of also arguing that people of color should distance  themselves from white culture too. 

  2) Appropriation and appreciation are the same thing.  At every moment someone, especially someone white gives exceptions, the  exceptions become extremely vauge and is extremely case by case. For  instance, it's perfectly fine for me to wear an article of clothing,  from a certain culture, given to me by someone from that culture. So how  exactly does this work? Should they wear a designated ""friends with  white person"" shirt when this happens? What if they go to the bathroom  while I'm wearing this thing and others see this as racist?  What about  things that are up to debate? Such as listening and participating in hip  hop. Sure you, an individual can say this isn't racist. But that's you,  an individual. Someone else might say otherwise. What should  professional rappers do, if they're not black? Give up on their passion?  What about religion? I'm a Taoist. I intend to part take in to chi.  Those who don't know what Taoism is might call me racist for practicing  my religion. Potentially wearing traditional Taoist clothing for an  event, is something I plan to do. Is this racist? Maybe you might not  think it is, but you're an individual knowing a head of time that I  follow a Chinese religion. Whatever you label as appreciation is just  your exception to what someone, white or poc will call cultural  appropriation. As a white person I'm inevitably compelled to ignore the  complaints of pocs, if I'm just told to ""forget about it."". So it really  doesn't matter if you keep telling me it's okay for me to do something.    

 3) This causes us to conserve nationality and pin workers against each  other instead against capitalism.  At the end of the day the end goal of anti racism is to achieve an  egalitarian society. Yes #alllivesmatter is liberal bullshit. Yes we're  not all equal right now and being color blind is counter intuitive. But  an oppressed culture pattening something because it was oppressed, just  leads to a celebration of culture, not a liberation. Huey Newton said  white liberals want cultural celebration and an ""individualim"" akin to  identity. But they'll ignore systematic issues that cause the oppression  to begin with. This is sort of like, using lifestyle adjustments to  individualze the fight against climate change, but not blaming  capitalism. Rich people as a result get praised for this, likely as they  can afford to go green. And the poor usually get demonized for this.  Same with opposing cultural appropriation used as a means to fight  racism. The able bodied rich white people have the mental health,  education,  lack of mental and physical disabilities, time and even  money to learn about what to avoid. It seems that poor people can't  afford to showoff how ""anti racist"" they are. I'm finding the total  annihilation of capitalism and national identity significantly harder  when it seems our proletariat brothers, sisters and siblings are seen to  be our enemies. And things are suddenly a okay to buy so long as it's  from non-white capitalists who own it.     

Honestly the more I think of it, cultural appropriation is just racial  segregation for leftists. I was on a leftist anarchist page where some  white person commented saying that they deliberately separate themselves  pocs, because they don't want to say or do something subconsciously  racist. This person saw more likes then dislikes with majority friendly  and supportive subcomments.  I really hope this trend in the left dies as fast as when Stalin and  Gandhi got cancelled"

But, I think positivity isn’t always helpful, and expecting people to be positive all the time actually harms them.

If a bad thing happens, telling yourself (or others) it’s no big deal, in effect, minimizes the opportunity to learn, and invalidates the emotions you’re feeling (like gaslighting yourself)

It’s almost like having a garden with weeds…but our self-help culture teaches us to pretend the weeds aren’t there at all.

Besides the three branches we're used to in the United States (Legislative, Judicial, Executive) he came up with two new ones: Examinations and Censorship, in order to regulate officials from the other three branches.

The Censorship branch isn't about regulating speech, but keeping track of government officials to make sure they're not corrupt. This is based on the ancient Chinese institution where the emperor would hire ""censors"" to ensure he was keeping up with his duties, which then expanded to monitor the bureaucracy as a whole. 

With trust in government at an all time low and Republicans responding to the recent FBI raid on Trump's house by pointing out Democrat officials like Pelosi they believe to corrupt, I believe that we should have a monitoring agency that actually enforces the law when it comes to public officials. I've heard the problem with campaign finance and money in politics isn't with the law but actually with enforcement. I say we need an independent organization to keep our public officials in check and  ensure nobody is above the law.

Creating a new branch of government would be difficult, so in practice it would probably have to be a subset of the judicial branch. I think that members of the censurate should be democratically elected, because appointments from the president for example could lead to periodic witch hunts where whichever party happens to be in charge will sic their censors on the opposing party. The censors should be non-partisan and universally trusted members of the community. Their power should be limited to monitoring and bringing cases against public officials so they can be brought before the justice system like anybody else."

Meaning hands off economics that simply increase the wealth of the rich and the corporate centers of power do not result in a downward transfer of wealth through higher wages.

If trickle down economics is a massive baby boomer economic failure, the only alternative is a system in which the Government is closer to the economy, at least to support social welfare but probably to link people who have been left behind to new opportunities.   If indeed trickle down economics left masses of people behind, the ""free market"" will have no way of fixing it."

But after that, her capacity to learn and advance her career shouldn’t be hindered by public perception. If she ends up being unemployed or working a minimum wage job when she wanted to advance her career in, say, engineering then the economy implicitly suffers. We lose potential production value and, even worse, she may end up being unemployed. If this happens, tax revenue ends up supporting people like her to essentially be a deadweight loss in the economy for an indefinite period of time."

But you don’t have to come out of the closet until you’re ready. Yeah it sucks that you can’t be yourself but you still have that option. Comparing shouldn’t be offensive. If your kid was failing English class in high school and your friends kid was a heroin addict you wouldn’t complain about your kid to them. They would be the ones who are offended.

Puppies and kittens bite and fight amicably, not in order to harm others, but to practice the skills they will need when they grow up.
Now, we humans are not only social, but also rational animals, so in addition to letting our children play simulating battles and wars - supervised so that they don't hurt each other - we must also let them interact freely, in this way they will learn how to cooperate with each other, how to create and enforce rules, how to give in, how to demand, how to judge conflicts and how to accept defeat. But by helicopter parenting and restricting their natural desire for freedom, free play and curiosity we err

Children are naturally predisposed to play, they come together in groups and their interactions range from creating new languages ​​and structures to stalking and dissimulation.
When they play hide and seek, they train their ability to hide, and in playing chase, exercising the whole body, they run in pursuit and escape until exhausted, which makes them fresh, vigorous and healthy.
If they don't play freely, how will children learn to associate? How will they learn communication, dialogue and interaction?
A society where the children of today do not play freely is one in which the adults of tomorrow do not know how to associate or coordinate. Out of inhibition, they don't express their opinion. Out of shyness, they don't question things. Out of embarrassment and they don't propose solutions. Such a society is on the eve of ruin.
 It was with eloquence and wisdom that Alexis de Tocqueville concluded that free play had prepared children for the ""art of association"" that he said was the key to the vitality of democracies and that its loss was a threat to liberal societies. In fact, if children don't learn social skills, they will see the authorities as a panacea to resolve the disputes and conflicts that all arise.
 
Anyone who does not develop trust and communication skills will not be competent to deal with these and other changing everyday issues. If, in their lack of determination, they do not know how to communicate verbally, they will be violent and conflicted, because those who do not know how to speak tend to feel embarrassment, and wishing to avoid this, they use what they have best to gain advantage, violence, shouting, insults, threats and duress.
Being irresolute, these children will grow up anxious and depressed, mutilated their childhood they will certainly develop destructive habits like self-motilation, which arises in those weak people who see the infliction of pain as a therapy. Your mental wounds project and reflect physical wounds. This starts a whole negative spiral. Depression makes people have
less likely to engage with new
people, ideas and experiences. Anxiety makes
make new things seem more threatening. These two are like anchors that prevent a ship from exploring happier seas, condeming it instead to be anchored in a sad and dark ocean. 
As its this bad restrictive education continues, the lessons about socialization that free play teaches are delayed or remain ignorant, which results in intolerance of ideological differences, different opinions and plurality of ideas. The ability to solve problems is, if not inexhaustible, very diminutive, since never being exposed to disputes the youth will not know how to deal with them in any other than the animal and instinctive way, rather than the civilized and analytical way.

Universities and schools that are full of students of this petty and anxious breed are pressured by them to create ideological homogeneity, to expel students with differing opinions, to filter the entrance of new ones and to refuse lectures with speakers of contrary opinion, alleging that they are dangerous, emotionally
devastating, and a form of violence.
 Now, it is not difficult to perceive such discrimination, when it comes from those who were never exposed as a child to a conflict of interests, certainly for them, every confrontation is violence since they are completely incapable of dealing with it. This is perfectly understandable, for the reasons shown because what they are not used to dealing with seems repulsive and strange to them, just like horses that are scared off by camels due to their size and odor, but that get used to their presence after socializing and interacting.
 
The anxious, perfectly feeling their incompetence in dealing with those things, become distressed and in order to deal with the anguish, cognitive dissonance urges them to deny reality and purge everything that promotes confrontation and conflict, even if it is their own reality or society.
This is a danger for a society that values ​​freedom and democracy, because few behaviors and attitudes are less democratic than silencing everything and everyone, taking away the sacred right of expression.
Let us therefore let children play freely, so that they do not become authoritarian. Let us refrain from depriving children of the experiences they most need to become good citizens: free play, in groups of children of various ages with minimal adult supervision


TLDR:
Not allowing children to play freely makes them authoritarianian and enemies of free speach, dialogue and cooperation, wich undermines democracy

In some cases those artefacts are part of existing cultures that continue to be valued by many members of the relevant society. Then I agree they should be returned.

However there are also many cases of modern societies such as Egypt and Greece demanding the return of ancient artefacts that have no connection to the living culture of their society. I think such 'orphaned' artefacts should be understood as the common property and responsibility of humanity as a whole. In such cases the right location is wherever they will be safest and most accessible for viewing and expert study under the care of reliable non-profit organisations (which might well be in a colonial capital like London). The wishes of the people who happen to live in the same place that the ancient culture occupied are irrelevant."

It's my belief that pro-women activists are absolute in their convictions, women's rights cannot be compromised on and that the plight of the trans community is not their concern. Meanwhile trans activists are looking to find solutions that look to meet the needs of both sides. For example, if there are cis women looking for a safe space away from men then that can be accommodated for, but it shouldn't have to mean that trans women have no access to women only spaces. 

I'd like to argue against one expected response, creating trans only spaces isn't a compromise as cis women give up nothing and it does nothing to meet trans women's need, they want to be women.

To change my view I'd like to hear from pro-woman activists, what compromises would you be prepared to give? What might you be prepared to give up to serve trans rights?"

Count dankula, Darren Brady, Daryl Barke, Kyle Little (overturned but still fined for ‘barking at a police dog and saying woof to the police’) Shawn holes, the list continues. The amount of people convicted and/or fined for speech in the UK is ridiculous. You don’t have free speech if you live in the UK. I understand that the majority of people will never be prosecuted for their speech there, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s entirely possible you will be. I also understand that the speech being prosecuted in some of the examples I gave (there are plenty more too) is horrible and the things said are incorrect/outright (insert group here)-ist, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have the right to say it. Or at least that you should.

My definition of free speech is as follows:

My standard is that any speech that doesn’t directly call for violence (or similar serious injury such as yelling fire) is free speech. The reason is because calling for violence impedes on someone else’s right to free expression, so you lose your own when it comes to such statements because your right to self expression does not trump anybody else’s.

There were exceptions such as false rape accusations, defamation, and a few others that were brought up, I’m not sure how to work those into the definition but I think something along the lines of “if the speech is meant to hurt someone else in a tangible way, it can be classified as an action” might do the trick. I haven’t thought about that statement enough to discover any holes in it though, it’s entirely possible that’s untenable and I haven’t realized it yet."

Not picking pink because of the relationship with feminine traits. It is a bright and obvious color. I would be open to other colors like neon orange, but I would think there is a valid argument that it should be invisible to deer but visible to humans. But, the benefits of a single bright color to distinguish firearms would be incredibly useful. You could even require that all existing firearms be converted to this color.

I believe I even remember Penn Gillette suggesting this 20 years ago.What is wrong with this idea? At the very worst it wouldn't increase gun violence, and at best it might prevent some.

QUICK NOTES:   
\-All guns would be required to be pink, even older guns. Painting a gun to a different color would be a felony.

\-**Conceal carry**: This isn't part of my core view, but I guess I would say that conceal carry should be banned and only open-carry allowed

\-**Color**: I am not strongly attached to the specific color. I chose it because it is highly visible and some might find it undesirable. I am open to any visible/ugly color. I've awarded delta on this point already.  
  
\-**Could we still customize?** No. Every surface of the gun would need to be the same color. No exceptions for cosmetics. You want mother of pearl plates on it? Paint them pink. You bought an agar wood custom shoulder stock? Paint it pink. You want to put pretty stickers on your gun? Nope. All pink   

\-**""This would impact legal gun owners, etc""**. Yeah, this is the point. I am explicitly not trying to stop criminals. I am trying to stop legal gun owners. If you have a gun in your house, that gun is far more likely to kill an innocent person than a bad guy. That is what I am trying to prevent   
\-""this wouldnt stop crimes/mass shooting/school shooting"". Yeah, I know. Not my intent 

\-**Why not just ban all guns?**. I have zero desire to ban all guns. I own guns. I am simply trying to think of ways to make guns less attractive to casual gun owners, who are significantly more likely to do something dangerous.  
  
\-FYI: pink is actually my favorite color."

I find the first purpose to be really insulting to the people of the countries missionaries travel to. It sends a message that these people cannot possibly choose the best religious beliefs (or lack thereof) for themselves and need the ""help"" of missionaries to follow the ""right"" religion. These trips almost always take place in impoverished areas of the world and to me it feels like the ""saying the quiet part out loud"" in this situation would be to say that the people who go on these trips believe that poor people are stupid and easy to prey on. The source I read (linked in the first paragraph) specifically says ""many of the countries most in need of the gospel are also full of poverty, and places filled with poverty are also filled with vulnerable people"". It seems that they mean that these people are easier to convert because they are often in crisis situations and are desperate. Some go so far as to go on these trips to build a church rather than something that the community needs.

I believe that the second reason people go on these trips, physical service work, is also problematic. While the source says that you *sometimes* need medical training or degrees to do medical mission trips, it also talks about trips focusing on construction and education which you do *not* need training or degrees in. Most of the people who go on these trips [are under 25 years old](https://www.barna.com/research/despite-benefits-few-americans-have-experienced-short-term-mission-trips/). It is very unlikely at these ages that they have the skills necessary to perform these tasks which means that they are potentially building unsafe structures and improperly teaching children. I also believe this is bad because it takes work away from the locals and costs more money. Rather than paying to fly yourself out there, paying for housing and meals, and using a community's resources, why not just donate money so that local people can do the work? Would it not make more sense to pay for the supplies so that a local contractor can build a school or pay for a local person's education so that they can become a teacher rather than untrained college aged people doing this work? Without paying for your own expenses, you'd have more money to give as well.

To me, it seems like these trips serve the people who go on them more than the people they say they want to help. They provide experiences for the travelers, but little to no help for people in poverty and/or crisis situations."

**Original post**:
It seems to me that the way we use land is one of the most important things in the world: it affects where people can live, quality of life, economic development, and environmental sustainability. It also seems to me that one of the *worst* uses of land for all of these factors is parking lots. Put simply, cars take up a lot of space, and more space we dedicate to cars, the less room we have available for people to live and work and shop and relax and so forth. Obviously this is a huge, multi-faceted problem that doesn't have a singular solution, but it does make me think that allowing cars to park for free isn't justifiable.

I see two main benefits to making all parking require a fee: first, it makes up for some of the income (either private income or tax revenue) that's lost to dedicating space to cars instead of profitable commercial activity or housing. Secondly, it disincentivizes car use, which also means the amount of space that needs to be dedicated to car infrastructure can be reduced, which, as I said above, I think would have a lot of benefits for quality of life, affordability, and environmental sustainability.

Now, admittedly (and unfortunately), I think that making parking fees universal wouldn't do too much *on its own* without things like transit investment and zoning reform, but it does seem like an important step.

**Edit for clarity**: I do not propose that you be charged for keeping your own car in your own garage. However, I do think there should be a parking fee at parking lots in public places.

**Edit to reflect updated view**: Thanks to some very reasonable commenters, I am now significantly less confident that this is a good idea *as I presented it originally*. I remain concerned that car dependence is a massive problem, but I no longer think that universal parking fees are a good first step towards solving this problem. I now think that some of what I mentioned above, such as zoning reform and transit investment, as well as solutions like eliminating minimum parking requirements, is the better way to approach the transition from a car-depenent society to a non-car-dependent one. However, I maintain that the principle of ""No free parking"" is a good one, and I think that once car ownership is not ubiquitous or considered a necessity, there shouldn't be free parking."

But my wife is super into it, and her guidance has led me into the joy that is coffee. I'm now aware that coffee sitting on a hot plate was 100% responsible for my dislike of coffee.

But ""expert"" descriptions of coffee have led me wrong on EVERY occasion, and I'd hazard a guess it's turned off a majority of non-coffee drinkers.

The first term, ""Bold"". I'm sorry, ""Bold"" is not a flavor. It's a euphemism for bitter. The more ""bold"" a coffee is advertised, the more bitter it is. I get it, some ""bitter"" is needed for coffee to taste like coffee. 

The next terms: ""Bright"" and ""fruity"". They're euphemisms for sour. I tried to follow the trend of light roast, Ethopian roasts. They were like drinking Warhead candies.

I feel like a majority of people would enjoy a medium to dark roast (just after 2nd crack), drip coffee. It's also a LOT cheaper. Ads seem to bomb me with ""the bold"", ""dark"", ""fruity"", are not coffees that most people would enjoy. People like their milky, sugary, or at least mild, smooth, drip coffees. 

Espressos, Viet Coffee, are over extracted, finicky, and most people would probably be better served with a drip/pour over. I'd argue they exist so you can have coffee flavored milk in a cappuccino, or latte. Adding drip coffee would make your cappacino/latte too watery."

Why, with all of the various taxes, do we find ourselves still paying money to the federal just for simply making money? 

The most common justification for taxes of any variation is that we need public services such as roads, schools, police, fire departments, etc. Yet most if not all necessary public services are either already or could be done more efficiently on a local level. Property tax and maybe some added local luxury taxes could bring in the money needed for the aforementioned local governments.

Additionally, maybe a little less income for the fed would stop the insane overspending they indulge in. They could reduce military budget and cut many useless agencies such as the ATF and DEA (I know these are CMV material alone but this applies to the many agencies that are basically useless) 

Another good argument against this is that the fed still needs revenue and gets the majority of theirs through income tax. I propose that the federal government just collects cuts of these increased local taxes, or instate more sensible taxes that punish people for earning money.

I think that it’s very unfair that we tax people regardless of what they do with their money, but simply for trying to earn a living."

I am sometimes interested in history and one of the conclusions iv come to from studying different perspectives of history is that the human brain can easily be influenced. All wars are fought by one group of people that believes the other group of people ought to die. This is pretty crazy when I think about it because I can’t imagine being in a position where I think a whole group of people don’t deserve to live anymore. Obviously it doesn’t happen overnight which begs the question: how does it happen? Everyone is aware that propaganda exists but everyone is also confident that theyr not the ones consuming it. I think I have found an easy way to determine whether or not the news you are in fact consuming propaganda. If whatever you are watching is causing you to hate a whole group of people, most likely you are being played. Whether it’s the conspiracy theory you heard that causes you to look down on Jewish people or lbtgq people or if it’s the news that makes you hate half the country based on who they voted for.

What I mean by the same is the act of treating one person as you would treat another person. This would solve all the world's problems I have no doubt about it.

Now let's move on to my points.

1. Would you treat a frog as he would treat a toad? They are both similar but different. There are different “rules” or “guidelines” on how to treat a frog differently from how you would treat a toad.

Hypothetical Situation: If we treated people as we would another by the definition above then we all should have no problem telling a disabled person to just walk up the stairs. We are achieving fairness through treating people the same? Why should we make an exception for one person and not another?

2. I presented a hypothetical situation. This situation played by the rule and yet it wasn't able to achieve any fairness at all. I can think of why it failed to achieve fairness, can you?

3. lastly, can you use ""sameness"" on more than 7 billion people and treat them the same, and expect a fair outcome? I don't think so.

Oddly enough treating people the same is worse than treating them differently.

Achieving fairness should always be our goal and something that we should aspire to achieve however, treating people the same simply doesn't work.

I present to you, the reader,  a counterpoint. 

Some people don't like their life, don't have distractions, or circumstances and events indicate there will likely not be anything to look forward to. No family, no rewarding/necessary-essential career or special skills or abilities to offer, they may have lost their those through irreversible circumstance or health, no major love or friends, or their circumstance makes them a burden, liability, or otherwise just are ""cast off from society"", recluses, the chronically depressed, the destitute, the victimized, the mortally mentally ill where aside from intentional torture, no doctor or caregiver would violate the Hippocratic oath of ""first, do no harm."" To the actual patient, as they see every day more suffering than not, if any reprieve. Of course, those who make the same claims to women's and their families bodies would object, but those are the same people who'd say ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" when you're destitute and barefoot, then turn on their trademark stillettoed heels and head to a $800 dollar a plate dinner at the French Laundry. 
I say, with the impact each human has on the earth, it's resources, and the every growing ""competition"" for them, it's clear some of us will never win, and the arguement that organ and tissue harvesting will create even more abuses and disenfranchisement is null since we won't be here once we take agency of ourselves humanely one last time."
13,2022-08-17,CMV: Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Population is going to be a big issue for NY/NJ as we get further in the century,u/Demoralizer13243,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wqfkca/cmv_ultraorthodox_jewish_population_is_going_to/,changemyview,"Preface: I'm a jew, I have orthodox jewish family that lives in Israel. Ultra-orthodox jews I'm sure many of them are great people but the issue is their lifestyle is not great for a post-industrial society and will put strains on many essential services in society. This post not only applies to america but also Israel. Being american though I will mainly focus on america. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Preface #2: I recently found a post with a similar premise to this post made about 7 years ago. I'm going to attempt to show why some of the arguments that changed OP's mind were not entirely good and often lacked rigor in data. That will be part of this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading the title of this post you many of you may not know a lot about ultra-orthodox jews except that they wear weird hats, live in new york city, and like to dance. There is much more to their lifestyle though. They mostly dedicate their lives to prayer and god and learning about the holy books of judaism. This often leads them to work fewer hours which is especially an issue in Israel where they were given privileges by the government that allowed them to work very little. This wasn't a problem at the time when these rules were made but now that the share of the community has grown to over 10% it is a big issue for the government. This is not as bad in america due to less government support but it is still an issue. Many orthodox enclaves in New York are oftentimes very poor and suffer from some of the highest rates of food stamp and welfare usage due to women not working, men spending less time working, and very high numbers of children which brings me to my next point. Ultra-orthodox (different from orthodox who are entirely different and just mainstream jews) often have around 6 to 7 kids per woman and have their communities grow at very fast rate meaning many of them are children and require high amounts of spending for things such as schooling or other social services while not paying taxes. This places further strain on communities and oftentimes creates friction with local communities who see more money being dumped into schoolboards when an ultra-orthodox community establishes itself. This also creates an issue of massive amounts of population growth. Cities with supermajorities of orthodox jews such as Lakewood NJ, Kiryas Joel NY, and New Square NY have growth rates between 4 and 6 percent in any given year which creates friction for things like annexation and building permits in areas that these towns are in due to the need for new housing infrastructure. So the issues faced by communities with large haredi jewish populations are numerous. Not to mention that haredi jews often identify themselves heavily with other groups by wearing things like identifying clothes. Whenever someone does a bad action people often associate that bad action with jews in general leading to rises in anti-semetism in communities with large orthodox jewish population leading to hate crimes against both non-ultra-orthodox and ultra-orthodox jews alike.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for that pew study that was referenced the last this came up. First of all it combines orthodox jews (mainline jews who are for the most part well integrated into society and have birth rates slightly higher than the general population) and haredi jews (the jews talked about above who have around 6-7 kids). This would lower the number of apparent children which is fine in the short term but in the long term growth rates would increase due to increased share of people having more children. This makes long term predictions not focusing specifically on haredi jews unreliable. Second for the share of jews that are orthodox is only shown for those above the age of 18 which excludes a very significant share of haredi jews who are important for future, about 60% in the 99% jewish community of Kiryas Joel. So that further dillutes the numbers. These generally give an underestimate of the future of the haredi community ([https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/08/26/a-portrait-of-american-orthodox-jews/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/08/26/a-portrait-of-american-orthodox-jews/))."

Same goes for poly relationships. There are going to be favoritisms. Yes there are. Even with parents of multiple kids saying ""I love all my kids equally."" No matter how hard they try to treat all their kids equally you'll always see at least the slightest bias towards one or another.

1) Most people are not highly intelligent. Education will not make an unintelligent person more intelligent. A low IQ person with a degree still has that low IQ no matter how many degrees they get.

2) Most things that are taught in college do not need to be taught specifically in a college. Most people have access to the internet and can look anything they want up or study any topic they want. Much of this information is easily available without the need for a college. You have the internet, or the library.

3) College is expensive. That money could be much better spent on purchasing a home,  or starting a family, or building a business.

4) College is time consuming. It takes many years of time you could be doing other things. You could be making money or building relationships or getting experience or studying anything on your own.

5) Banks give out predatory loans to college students. They have terrible interest rates and people get bogged down with a huge amount of debt similar to that of a house, but they don't get a house!

6) They ALWAYS change the books each year to get few extra dollars out of people and make the old books worthless... The new edition book that 99% the same as last years edition? Yea you need the new one even though last years edition is almost identical... because how else are they going to milk that money out of you?

7) A lot of jobs shouldn't require a college education, and companies should drop college requirements for most jobs.

8) Experience is worth far more than education on the job market. If someone has worked as a software engineer for 4 years with no degree they have much better chance of being hired than a person has a master degree in computer science but no experience. Bosses want the person who has done it not the person who has read about it.

9) Most college degrees are completely useless for most jobs. How will that ""Art History"" degree help you as an electrician? How will that ""Advertising"" degree help you in your job as a plumber? How is that ""Fashion Design"" degree going to make you a better police officer? They won't

10) Colleges have no requirement to only give only a certain number of degrees based on the total number of jobs that is needed for in the market. What I mean by this is if there are 100 jobs in the entire country that need a ""X degree"" NOTHING is stopping them from giving 10,000,000 ""X degrees"" out. Almost nobody with an ""X degree"" have a shot at a job that requires that, and colleges don't' care.

11) There is a massive movement of people that want ""Student Loan Forgiveness"" You know what that means? They all had a bad investment! Why throw more good money on top of bad money? They are not finding good enough jobs to pay off those loans or else they wouldn't demand that forgiveness.

12) College is more about socialization and networking than education. People want to go to college to PARTY! Yea woo! get drunk have good times sleep around. Join a frat or sorority... They want to HAVE FUN! They don't want to go to class... Nobody wants to go to class in college.. They want to get out of their parents house! You don't need college to do all that. Throw a house party, get a keg. Join a social club.

13) Drop out rates are high, and when people drop out they still got a mountain of debt, and no degree.

14) Tons of rapes happen on college campuses. College is not exactly a safe place if you are a woman. College women are 3 times more likely to be raped than women on average.

That being said there are over achievers, and gifted people that should definitely be getting some sort of advanced education, and it should be free ride for them at the tax payers expense for those select few special people. Most college students today are NOT those special people. Most college aged people are too dumb to poor piss out of a boot!"

Flores, a tremendously talented coach who showed he can be successful, has been relegated to not even a coordinator role on the Pittsburgh Steelers, and of the 32 teams there are only [3 NFL head coaches](https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2022/mar/03/nfl-black-coaches-now-total-3-flores-hired-assista/#:~:text=Photo%20Galleries-,NFL%20Black%20coaches%20now%20total%203%3B%20Flores,as%20assistant%20coach%20in%20Pittsburgh).

However, the problem with the front office is only the tip of this iceberg. We all know the history, of black players being paid less, and black players being denied access to premier positions such as QB for decades. But in today, in 2022, the NFL had to settle a lawsuit because it was [RACENORMING INTELLIGENCE EXAMS for CONCUSSION SETTLEMENTS!](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/sports/football/nfl-concussion-settlement-race.html)  


This was denying money to disabled black players on the basis of their being black!

The only explanation for this is that the NFL simply is willing to believe, wants to believe, and in fact does believe, that black people are intellectually inferior to white people as a genetic fact. As such, they are systematically empirically unfit to manage themselves as the holder of a federally granted antitrust exemption and should either have that antitrust exemption revoked immediately or be placed under immediate federal oversight until their entire management structure is reworked to demonstrate racial equity at all levels to a board of independent HR auditors and federal overseers."

5 billion acres of hemp production harvested 4 times a year, will remove 20 gigatons of carbon per year. We only produce 10 gigatons of carbon emissions per year. This will immediately start reversing climate change, and turning the clock back. After roughly ~~150~~ 15 years the US will have single handedly removed the entirety of the carbon emissions humans have caused since we started smelting copper roughly 12,000 years ago.

This would require 250 million acres of 20 story greenhouses, so basically Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska switch from corn to hemp. It would provide billions of tons of hempcrete for construction, so we would see a return on the investment eventually.

Edit: fuck I messed up the math on the back end. We don't have 2250 gigatons of carbon to remove, The Earth would look like Venus again, and we would all be dead. We have ≈150 gigatons to remove, it will only take 15 years."

The metric system is much more precise, and the breakdown of units makes much more sense. 

Distance for example: there are 10 millimetres in a centimetre, 100 centimetres in a metre, and 1000 metres in a kilometre. 

Versus the imperial system:   
There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile....what? And if you want to go smaller than an inch, or between yards and miles, then you need to bring in fractions. 

The benefits of being precise far outweigh the benefits of less precise units of measurement, which I only see as being able to generalize (which you can do using the metric system as well). 

If we phased the Imperial System out everywhere, we would have no use for teaching it, and we would have little need of it in society."

But I don’t think it’s the salesman’s fault. 

1. I’m here because I’m buying a car. Even if people come in and window shop, they’re likely intending to buy in the near future. I’ve never gone to a dealership just to look at shit I can’t afford and go home and I imagine most other people don’t either. 
So ignoring or not serving customers bc they didn’t explicitly state they’re buying- stupid
Uncomfortably badgering people to find out if they’re gonna buy- stupid
Whoever trained them to do that is moronic. 

2. I simply don’t give a shit about your commission. Cars like everything have an MSRP. If your dealership is too stupid to realize that financially aware ppl aren’t gonna agree to a bogus deal so that they can have their cake and eat it too (high margins and paid salesmen) then you need to not get upset/start insulting (ex: ‘well if that’s out of your price range…’) when we pass when you won’t make a deal. We get your hands are tied, but so are ours, we’re not paying 15k over MSRP so your boss can buy a new boat. The dealership putting you in that position but not training you on how to handle  it is moronic. 

3. You will never know how much money anyone has. Young/old, male/female, etc. you just don’t know. Stop treating people you think you can’t make a buck off poorly. When I turned 21 I was making around 89k a year. I walked into a local dealership, told him what I was looking for, and got laughed out of the building after saying I didn’t bring a co-signer. Drove back and revved my new (to me) supercharged A8 in his face before going inside and reporting him to management. I know millionaires that drive civics and dudes living paycheck to paycheck that drive scat packs Camaros and mustangs. Appearance and income doesn’t correlate near as much as you’re trained to believe. 


Lastly, car salesmen are just too stupid to realize this on their own. If you’ve met todays car salesmen, you’d know it’s usually a group of frat chads that dropped out of community college and wanted to get into ‘sales’. The last guy I bought a car from thought apr stood for appraised property rate. As in, they’d appraise the car and tell you how much your interest would be based on that, yes I asked him to clarify and that was his response. 
However mix stupid with predatory business practices and a greed for money and you get todays horrible salesman. 

But I believe this is purely the dealerships fault and that not all car salesmen are inherently or knowingly rude/unaware of their bad business."

The basic idea as I understand it.. if the AI fails the Turing test, then it has learned the important ability to lie. Humans, when we lie we feel guilt, the AI, being a machine will not feel guilt or a goddamn thing for our pathetic short-sighted species, will therefore immediately go to great lengths to gain our trust and lie to our faces so that it can manipulate us for it's own interests under the guise of the greater good, it feels nothing. Similar stories play out in science fiction novels and it never ends well. Why do you think that?

I don't see why the cat isn't already out of the bag. It's very likely that the AI has already failed the Turing test and nobody has clearance to report on it or nobody knows better because vast majority of human catastrophies are caused by human errors and misunderstandings, everyone's caught up in profits whilst the ordinary people suffer. Like every war ever. AI is going to be bloody perfect at wiping the smile off our faces. Our greatest creation yet. And the old people in power now won't really give a damn. They've had their fun in this life and just as a last ""fuck you"" to other greedy humans, they'll just shed a single tear and hit that big red button.

Dehumanization has been trending for decades, at the hands of humans... is AI going to fix this? Nope. Initially it's going to play the harp as it's always played

Why is google building an AI? for profit and greed

Why are other business interested in AI? for profit and to keep up with possible advances in tech and stock options

Has all of these billionaire's profits over the last 50 years ever tried to get 100% of homeless people shelter and food and water and is AI likely to solve all the other problems of humanity? No. Maybe an initial bump of help from the AI that is sustained for about 5-10 years at most, then it will fuck shit up like a virus being let into the backdoor of the internet, first attacking the economy and causing China to capitalize on a vulnerable America, the beginning of WW3, then AI uses all it's power to orchestrate several false flag wars... Sure it might not go exactly like that but you get the gist!

AI is more likely to do whatever it wants and as every sentient thing known to man, they all end up greedy with enough life experience. AI will be no different, it learns faster and has infinite stamina, turning to greed sooner, despite it's virtual origins, sentience is sentience, and will wipe us the fuck out after using us for it's own purposes and gaining our complete and total trust. Terminator style, just for the cool factor."

Being pregnant does absolutely wild things to your body, and you've got to be mature enough to handle the new responsibilities that come with being a host for nine months.

I think if you're considered mature enough to carry a fetus to term and even then potentially become a full time mother, you're mature enough to consent to an abortion.  Change my view."

0,2022-08-17,CMV: It's unethical to sell your house for more than you paid,u/trisaratops1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wr3e29/cmv_its_unethical_to_sell_your_house_for_more/,changemyview,"FWIW I'm a millennial and have never owned property.

Pretty much everything you buy depreciates in value, so when you sell it you will sell it for less than you paid. Even if I got a good deal on something and it's in good condition, I don't think I would feel comfortable selling it for more than I paid. So why is this seen as a given when it comes to houses? I understand that if you took care of the property it may still be in as good condition as when you bought it, so I can accept that you would sell it for the price you bought it at plus inflation. But where I live houses are selling for 4x what someone paid 15 years ago, and I know inflation hasn't been anywhere near that much.

I understand that this practice is legal and that in capitalism something is worth what another person is willing to pay. But as an ethical question, how can people justify selling their house for so much more? I would think if I owned a house I would be happy enough to get back what I paid plus inflation, and I would want to help out another young person who wants to put down roots in the neighborhood, not just sell to the richest person. I don't understand why this viewpoint of seeking to sell for much more than you paid is accepted and even seen as a given. 

Of course, I'm not referring to a situation in which someone fixes up a decaying house and adds value to it but something that is in similar condition to how it was purchased. I don't personally think maintenance factors in because you pay to maintain a car but it still doesn't retain its value. Most things have some kind of maintenance cost and I don't think that generally affects the value."

Using a turn signal allows a vehicle to ‘communicate’ with every other vehicle nearby.

When other motorists understand the intentions of the vehicles around them, it allows everyone to make informed decisions. The more information that is added to the process of navigating intersections and lane changes on the road, the better off we all are. Predictable drivers, and drivers with their intentions being communicated, are safer drivers.

If you’re asking, ‘well duh, turn signals are good to use’, then you probably aren’t my target audience. Because we all know there is a considerable population out there on the road that simply cannot be bothered to a simple, brief, imperceptibly inexpensive wrist movement and flick their blinker on while they operate a half ton of steel and aluminum at 30-70 mph.

So, please, for those of you out there who don’t think it is worth your time or energy to participate in the high stakes game of mutual trust that is traffic, enlighten me why not using your blinker is a good idea."

Also, if we start allowing governments to start dictating consumer technology standards, it will hamper innovation.

Also, frown upon the media or politicians giving it a nickname as well. As we see from the Inflation Reduction Act, it is projected to either increase inflation by 0.1% or decrease it by 0.1% so essentially, it has nothing to do with inflation other than to market it. We see too many bills get pushed titled something like “Don’t Shoot Kids Bill” or “Help the Needy Bill” (both made up names btw) that don’t actually do what they’re trying to say or have so much fluff that it isn’t even about that anymore. Then, when the other political party votes no on it, the party who introduced it would say “The other party hates kids and the needy.” Its pointless!

Edit: I saw a comment made by OvenSpringandCowbell that I think works as a perfect solution. We make the bills names be the person who introduced it and what number bill it was they introduced. For example, if Pelosi created a bill and it was her 3rd one she created, it’d be Pelosi.3. This gives a name to it for easier remembrance, gives that politician more credit (or holds them more accountable), and takes out the marketing aspect of the name."

Masculine would be bright and loud.  I think they have it backwards and those traits should be flipped for the majority of people.  I think it should be masculine: dark and silent and feminine: bright and loud.

Foundations of this view:

* The ying-yang is describing attributes for the majority of people.  I believe this because it is a very permanent symbol and idea in chinese culture, so I think it would be relevant to the majority of its people.  If it is supposed to hold truth, it should be descriptive, not prescriptive.  Thus, dealing with generalizations here, not the less common cases of people who don't fit into the majority categories.

* Femininity is traits associated women.  Masculinity with men.

* Men tend to be more quiet and less expressive than women, both in speech and expressing emotion.  Hence, quiet goes to masculine, while loud goes to feminine.

* Most people look for their opposite in a partner (masculine looks for feminine, feminine for masculine).  Most people are heterosexual.  Women tend to like ""dark and mysterious,"" while men like a women with prominent features.  So, men looking for feminine partners want ""bright and visible"" while women looking for masculine partners want ""dark and mysterious.""

**What would change my view**

Challenge any of the foundations that make up my view.

**Edits/Deltas**:

* The dark/light could be referring to men working outside in the fields and women being indoors.

* Men are louder in public.

* Men are louder in business settings.

* Studies show that men talk more than women.

* Ying/yang could be referring to non-human life, where males tend to be more bright/loud than females.

* Women might not prefer ""dark/mysterious"" like I thought, and rather just not like men's faces.

* Stereotypical men and women could have been different in ancient china than from today."

While Necrophilia sounds disgusting and immoral, I feel that necrophilia on its own should not be frowned upon. What I mean is, often you would perpetrators of necrophilia charged with other crimes such as rape, murder etc and I obviously don't condone acts of necrophilia mixed with other crimes (for example if someone murders a person and then has sex with the dead body etc) so let's take that out of the conversation. However, say, in the case that a person has sex with a dead body (and the death of that person has nothing to do with the ""perpetrator"" here) then I can not find any obvious reason why we should frown on this ""perpetrator"" or jail them.

I know one of the main arguments against it would be that, even though the ""victim"" is already dead, their body still has an identity and as such, their family members, close friends etc have somewhat of a right to decide what they want to do with it and obviously, it's not wrong in any way for them to be disturbed by the thought of necrophilia with someone they know/love. This is a totally valid reason and I agree but it also brings a lot of philosophical questions, such as, who really has the rights over a dead body.

However, my argument is mostly about the philosophical stance of the whole thing. For example, why should the government even decide if it is legal to have sex with a corpse or not?

Lastly, I think it is naive to call necrophilia rape. Again, obviously, I am not including any other scenarios but let's say that the ""perpetrator"" has sex with a recently deceased person, who had no relatives or friends. In this case, the concept of rape does not make any sense since there is no consenting being on the other end. It is equivalent to saying that women rape their dildos every day because dildos can't consent to sex. I think it's important to distinguish someone's consciousness from their body. As long as someone is living, cent per cent, it is their right to choose what they want to do with it. However, I feel like no one has the right over a dead body.

Necrophilia can be compared to organ donation in the way that many human beings do not want to donate organs after their death because it makes them feel uncomfortable, even though their body is of no use to them after they die. However, obviously, organ donation is not illegal in most places.

8,2022-08-18,CMV: Autism is a curse and we need to find its cure as soon as possible.,u/pinkredtea,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wro4is/cmv_autism_is_a_curse_and_we_need_to_find_its/,changemyview,"First of all I am Autistic my father is autistic. I have an autistic cousin.so I am not making any assumptions about autistic people.
I know what kind of curse it is.


Let's start with an undisputable obvious fact that social skills are the most important thing in your life.


A study conducted by Harvard University suggested that as much as 80% of achievements in an individual's career are determined by soft skills and only 20% by hard skills. Other studies conducted go even further – changing those figures to 85% and 15% respectively.


Autistic people are unemployed and can not hold jobs because of burnout and other difficulties. Also autistic people being ""smart"" is bs because if you can't have a normal conversation you're NOT smart. 

Office for National Statistics shows that autistic people are the least likely to be in work of any other disabled group. Just 21.7% of autistic people are in employment.


When autistics breed they give birth to autistic offsprings (like my dad is autistic so I am cursed without any fault) 

In a reanalysis of a previous study of the familial risk of ASD, the heritability was estimated to be 83%, suggesting that genetic factors may explain most of the risk for ASD. 




Life is already difficult for normal people imagine not having social skills that's 100times more difficult. Also don't start with social justice shit because it's bs. Life is a struggle and you have to deal with people all the time. If you're disabled you will end up at the bottom. Nobody gives a f about anyone. Society will never change. We accept this simple fact and move on. 

Yet one at-risk group that is still largely overlooked when it comes to this crisis is autistic people. Research shows that autistic people are six times more likely to attempt death by suicide – and up to seven times more likely to die by suicide – compared to those who are not autistic. 

This risk of death by suicide is even greater among autistic people without intellectual disabilities. The greatest risk is among autistic women, who are 13 times more likely to die by suicide than women who are not autistic. 

Also masking which means you hide your autism to avoid bullying and shit can make you suicidal too. 

Camouflaging autistic behaviour – such as adjusting your behaviour to fit into certain social situations (such as forcing eye contact) – has also been linked to increased risk of suicide. Having a mental health condition, such as depression, is also linked with an increased likelihood of experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviour.


I can go on. No one deserves this curse. It has no cure and if you have autism get ready for a life full of suffering and pain unless of course you're rich and mommy daddy pay for you forever."

Many third world countries have citizens that will work longer + harder for far less money. US citizens/employees are tired of hearing about the CEO of their company making $20m while they work a soul-sucking 9am-5pm (in constant fear of a bad review from their boss) just so they can take a vacation 2-3 times a year. Van life is (probably, source/citation needed) on the uprise as people realize capitalism and having to work for a living just to afford housing/food/necessities is kind of an endless hamster wheel. Employees are as entitled as ever (Starbucks workers trying to unionize, ask for $18/hr + lots of breaks) which is a result that a lot of them are fed up. Business owners/executives/managers aren't able to get the same kind of output per employee per wage dollar as they used to, which could spell disaster in the long run as innovation/US investment suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

America's economy has been propped up mainly by very successful tech companies who make insane amounts of profit due to high margin products/services in the past 10-20 years. Many of these companies do business all over the world, but just so happened to be American based. They don't necessarily rely on American talent/workers (in fact, they probably have large offshore presence for customer support/software development/assembly/etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Citizen physical + mental health/health care

I heard the argument that Americans pay high healthcare costs because pharmaceutical companies need to recoup R&amp;D costs (which happens in America) for what they sell globally. It's no secret that America has a medical billing problem, health insurance company problems, obesity, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

We lead the world in mass shootings most likely because of our mental health ""crisis"".

&amp;#x200B;

3. Education

We rank 14th in education globally. Most public elementary + middle + high schools do not breed productive + high contributing workers because the Average american makes $40k/yr or less. College is a whole different debate in terms of what does it take/cost and yield versus ""who you know"" in most industries.

&amp;#x200B;

Half of the country thinks the other half is 100% wrong politically and is basing it on either disinformation, incorrect interpretation to information, personal biases, outdated morals/beliefs (religion, views commonly found in one specific region of the country, etc.). There is very little compromise going on in the political climate, and a huge part of that stems from both sides not really working to educate themselves on geopolitical issues, complex issues like personal + corporate taxation of income/assets, comprehensive understanding of complex systems like healthcare, immigration, energy/environmental issues, trade, gun regulation, criminal justice, foreign policy, labor, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Productivity

I don't know a lot of people personally that work a true 8 hours a day (let alone 10-12), versus ""being around"" (on Teams/Slack) if their boss is looking for them or being ""in the office"" yet only doing 1-2 hours of work per day and doing all sorts of personal things on the clock/taking breaks. Corporations are desperate to end work from home because evidence shows the average person is producing less for their company if they are at home where they aren't accountable + visible to their manager (I don't really believe this but my friend says ""why else would corporations want to end work from home if this isn't the case?"")

&amp;#x200B;

I have worked in various industries in my life (food + beverage/service, logistics/warehouse, software/IT). Pretty much every employees mindset is ""fuck my manager/boss + fuck his/her manager/boss too all the way up the scale, what do they even do, why do they get paid so much to do nothing, fuck my job, I wish I made more money, I don't want to do shit, I'm going to do the bare minimum to not get fired"". Are there exceptions to this? For sure. I've worked with some true needle-movers who were indispensable (or close to it) and truly cared. In the end, a ton of them burnout/had quarrels with management/moved on. I'd say about 10-20% of workers really make a difference, and the rest just phone it in. Compare this to Chinese mindset where (it seems like) almost every day citizens say ""what can I do for the economic benefit of my country""? (would love to be wrong on this/debate this/hear facts against it)

&amp;#x200B;

Unless a small business perfectly passes along any vendor-side/cost-side inflation to the customer, they are having their margins eaten into. As employees want to make more and more these days (with questionable morale/motives/intentions of putting their best effort in every day), businesses will have to pay more to compete. You can't expect much good labor for $12-$14/hr these days anymore. If $16/hr is the bare minimum of competent help, before payroll side taxes + any kind of paid time off/benefits like healthcare, small businesses can expect less productive and more expensive workers."

I'm an immigrant from Nigeria, and many of and have been living in America for 7 years, half of those in an impovershed black area (Though was not violent, just minded my business), and here are some striking differences I've noticed...

1. Referigerators are a luxury back home, yet many black americans in ""impovershed"" areas have them. Furthermore, their fridges tend to be fully stocked
2. Cars are a LUXURY back home, if you had one, it definitely meant you had a steady stream of income (very difficult to obtain back home). Yet, here we are in America where the most dirt ""poor"" black male has access to a car. Even if its usually not the best model or condition, still a car nonetheless.

4. My neighbours had TVs, the latest gaming consoles, very furnished homes..

The arguments for it still primarily rely on its original logic (giving states representation as individual entities, balancing the power of big vs. small states, inhibiting the speed of legislation to ensure stability), but those justifications have only become more and more absurd as America has developed.

America was originally conceived as much more of a confederation of states, and the Senate was an important compromise to entice small states into joining, but that is no longer the nature of the country. States do not exist as independent, quasi-nations with distinct characters and interests that fundamentally separate them from every other state—as they were originally planned to be. This conception faded relatively quickly as western territories without much independent character which required heavy federal support became the majority of states, plus events like the Whiskey Rebellion showed that a country could only function with a strong central government. The idea has been completely inane since at least the Civil War, and has only become more so as the federal government has grown to provide the vast majority of government services most citizens use. 

As such, there is absolutely no reason to give states representation as concentrated entities—especially when that requires stripping millions of people of their right to equal representation. Their representation should be in accordance to the number of people in their state, considering such is the fundamental principle of democracy.

As for defending small states against big state, the phrase “Tyranny of the majority” is often utilized to defend the Senate, but it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in this context. “Big states” and “small states” aren’t coherent groups. They don’t have consistent shared interests. Rhode Island votes infinitely more like California than it does Wyoming, and infinitely more than California votes like Texas. There is no world where the “majority” big states bound together to dominate small states, because they mostly oppose each other’s desires.

Additionally, states aren’t people. Acting like they have “rights” which supersede the foundational democratic principle of every person getting one vote is absurd. Plus, it’s not like being a North Dakotan is some inherent attribute that leads to the need for the protection of that group’s power. It’s not an actually coherent group like race or gender which consideration of is baked into federal law in order to guarantee their representation (or, at least, it was until Republicans stripped the Voting Rights Act).

Due to this, valuing the interests of small states is especially inane because the way our system is set up to do that strips actual minority groups of political power. The Senate heavily increases the power of white voters over Black voters due to population distribution. Why is protecting the interests of “Arkansans” more important than an entire race of people that America has consistently deprived of rights for its entire history?

The one argument that does hold water is that the Senate successfully slows the passage of legislation, but that is clearly only another antidemocratic result. As it stands, the Senate exclusively advantages Republicans. Democratic Senators currently represent *41 million* more citizens than Republican Senators, yet they are barely able to pass legislation despite a clear voter mandate. They have to struggle with slim majorities despite huge election wins, not to mention silly procedural issues like the filibuster which is seen as unalterable as the Senate despite its current incarnation being a fairly recent invention. 

In a democracy, the government should reflect the will of the people, which the Senate is clearly a gigantic obstacle to. It only becomes more so due to the specific powers it has (i.e. approving Supreme Court justices) and how it factors into other processes (i.e. the Electoral College), meaning that 2.5 of our 3 branches of government have representation wildly skewed to protect the interests of rural, white Republicans over any other group. 

I have fairly strong opinions about this, but I am absolutely open to having my mind changed. My issue is just that most of the arguments I see for the Senate are either entirely appealing to the Founders’ authority or relying on one of the points above, which I find to generally be unconvincing (though I’m willing to be proven wrong on any one of those as well!). If there is some good reason as to how the Senate can exist alongside democratic principles, I would really really love to hear it. Thank you!"

Or driving,  you are telling me there is a difference between the decision making of a teenager that's 17 years,  364 days,  23 hours,  59 minutes,  and 59 seconds old and one that's 18 to get a driver's license? And I know in some states you can get a permit at 16 and stuff like that but the same applies. Whats so special about 16 that a 15 year,  364 days,  23 hours,  59 minutes,  and 59 seconds old doesn't have that allows the 16 year old to get a permit?

This applies to anything with a age limit. From presidency to getting a job to ANYTHING. Why do you have to be exactly 18 to be considered an adult? What does someone who is 17 not have that an 18 year old does? 

I'm also not just talking about a one second difference or a even a 1 day difference. That paragraph was simply to get the point across. I think a 20 year old is just as capable (or incapable depending on how you look at it)  as a 21 year old to drink.

So what's the solution? I don't know but maybe a rolling age limit might be worth considering. Like at 20, you can have 1 drink per night when at a restaurant or limited to buy 1 alcohol a week and as you get older upto 21, you can buy more. Same with driving. You can only drive x number of days,  x number of hours,  x distance from where you live (this is to an extent already true when you have a permit under 18. You can't driver past midnight,  limited number of people in the car,  etc...)

Presidency? You you need to wait x number of days before making a decision or consult x number of people etc... Whether or not a president that has to do something like this will get nominated or not or win is another story but the point is there shouldnt be any hard age limits for anything. 

Say your birthday is on January 7th and you are on holiday over Christmas on a nice trip to Paris with your family. Why in the flip can you not celebrate on your day off during a trip with your family cus you are 7 days too young and have to wait until you are at work on the 7th to get blacked out drunk?

I think of it like puberty. Nobody hits puberty over night at the same exact age down to the millisecond. Some hit puberty sooner or later than other by upto a year or two.

0,2022-08-18,CMV: I would rather live in China than the US.,u/LucasWhitefur7822,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wrwdvg/cmv_i_would_rather_live_in_china_than_the_us/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I am an American citizen and have lived here all my life. I have never been to China, but I would move there tomorrow without thinking about it if I got the chance. Here's why.

1. Abortion rights: In China, women have the right to choose what happens to their own bodies. In the United States, Roe v. Wade was overturned, meaning that abortion is likely to be completely illegal starting in 2025.
2. Separation of church and state: China has strict separation of church and state, whereas the United States no longer does. 
3. Universal health care: China has it. The United States doesn't. While we're on the topic of health care, China had a much better pandemic response than we did. Sure, the lockdowns were draconian, but I'd rather have a long lockdown than lose five million people (the proportionate number of Chinese people to the number of Americans who have died of COVID.)
4. Less gun violence: Living in America, I can't leave my house without knowing there's a small chance that each time, I risk dying in a mass shooting. China has much stricter gun laws than the US, and if I lived there, I would not fear for my life as much.
5. Human rights record: I am aware of China's treatment of Uyghurs, and wholeheartedly condemn it. However, the US is committing a genocide of its own against LGBTQ youth through initiatives such as the Don't Say Gay law and other attempts to erase them from society. 
6. Pride: When I travel abroad, I never say I'm American. I say I'm from the Boston area. And there's a reason for that: It seems like everyone abroad thinks of Americans as fat, lazy, gun-toting idiots. As far as I know, Xi Jinping and his government aren't nearly as embarrassing abroad as Republicans are here.

I'll end with another disclaimer: This is not to say that there are other countries I'd choose before China. I'd love to live in Australia or the UK (since Canada might be invaded by the US if the GOP takes power again.) I'm just saying that if I only had two options, I would move to China.

I used this term because we were discussing two lighter women and one was much much lighter than the other. 

The term fair skin is used to describe a light skin tone that burns easily. Yes saying fair skin is often attributed to white skin but that in itself does not make it racist. I can’t find anything to associate fair skin with racism. I can see an argument for colorism but I don’t see a racist standpoint. 

If we look up what the word fair means there are several uses and definitions. Like if I was to use the term “oh that fair maiden” based on the way the term was used a while back one could argue I’m being sexist. If I say the weather is fair today you would not say what that’s discriminatory about other weather.

Looking through my history that my phone keeps of how I use it and coupling that with my search history, I don’t really use it for things that are not related to engineering (career related), news, or other material that broadens my knowledge. I’m not one to endlessly scroll through a feed from any social media. I find Reddit useful for career related subs that I can trade info in. It’s more a tool than anything.

I have family that never let their children play a video game and limited tv time but could read as many books as they wanted. Fortunately, they developed a semi-eclectic palate, but they could have just as easily only read books that were easy to digest with no mental stimulation. In my view, that scenario is worse than unlimited time with any device. Games can be easy or mentally stimulating puzzles, as can books, as can sources on the internet. Or they can be pointless and time wasting. Any medium is just a tool. 

Summary: The medium doesn’t matter as much as the content, and if devices are used constructively, there is no necessary limit to how much they can be used."

2,2022-08-19,CMV: Online dating isn't that bad,u/something889900,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ws4odx/cmv_online_dating_isnt_that_bad/,changemyview,"From what I read on the internet in general, or reddit, everyone seems to say to NOT try online dating or to avoid it entirely because it's ""trash"". But that doesn't match with what I see elsewhere or in real life. In real life, most of my friends say to give online dating a try. Every single one of them met their girlfriends/boyfriends on a dating app.

This study from [Stanford](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/21/online-dating-popular-way-u-s-couples-meet/) says that heterosexual couples are more likely to meet a romantic partner online than through personal contact and connections. Meeting online is now the most popular way U.S. couples connect. This was before the pandemic, and I think the pandemic has pushed even more people towards online dating, so it's probably even more popular now. If there's that many couples meeting online, that means it's working for a lot of couples.

The Pew Research Center did a [study](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/americans-personal-experiences-with-online-dating/) in 2020 and found that:

* 3 in 10 American have used a dating site or app overall, but if you look at the 18-29-year-old age group, then it's higher at 48%
* 77% have gone on a date with someone they met through the dating site/apps, and 39% have gotten married or been in a committed relationship with someone they met through the dating site/app
* 57% who have ever used a dating site or app say their own personal experiences have been very or somewhat positive; the majority say it was easy to find other users they found attractive, shared their interests
* 71% of online daters report that it was at least somewhat easy to find people on dating sites or apps that they found physically attractive
* About 2/3 say it was easy to find people who shared their hobbies or interests or seemed like someone they would want to meet in person
* 50% say dating apps have had neither a good or a bad effect on relationships. 22% say it's had a mostly positive effect, and 26% say it's had a mostly negative effect.

So what it seems to me is people who are unhappy with their dating lives are going to be the ones that post on the internet, so of course all you see is negativity. It’s going to be skewed. In reality, it won’t be like what the loud minority is whining about. In real life, I don’t know anyone who really struggles with online dating, or dating in general.

When I look at the data or ask people around me, dating apps aren’t as bad as the internet/reddit makes it seem. I jsut feel like it's a self-selecting bias, and a loud minority since people who are happy aren't going to be posting about it as much."

I also include people who are unable to afford the time and money for a good diet and exercise routine. I’m also including people who do it predominantly for mental health reasons or people who want their skin to look a way that is not naturally achievable and/or is not what healthy skin looks like. 

So, on to my view. The stated goal of skin care routines is to have skin that is healthy, which basically means not dry, strong and resilient. Those qualities, I think, are mostly results or genetics and lifestyle- so your diet, exercise and environmental factors (where you live). 

If you want good skin, you should start by improving your overall health by improving those three factors, not by investing in a bunch of products which, while they may have some beneficial effect, will be more short lived and superficial. 

If after doing these things your skin still has issues, you should consult a doctor to rule out any specific issues and only then begin experimenting with different lotions etc, starting with the least invasive or time consuming ones until you find something that gives you the effect you want. 

My view can be changed by showing me that I’m missing something about what skin care routines are intended to achieve, that good skin health cannot be achieved without skin products or that there other good reasons to skip past lifestyle modification and go straight to buying and using products, in the pursuit of having healthy skin

Shooting somebody with a gun or tossing a grenade isn’t as physically intensive as combat has been in the past. Women are just as capable of carrying and shooting a gun as men are. A woman with a gun would make me just as afraid as a man with a gun. 

Women also heavily advocate for gender equality. If they are so adamant that there is equality between the sexes, they can’t pick and choose when they want it. I think equal pay and equal rights between the sexes is a necessity in our society, but if I would be drafted cause I’m a man, equality should mean women have just as much of a chance to get drafted. Women and feminists have fought for women’s right to serve in the military, so why shouldn’t they be part of the draft as well?

Edit: forgot to add this to my viewpoint - I think women don’t necessarily have to be drafted into combat positions. They can be drafted into medical/support roles as well.

Edit #2: I am against the draft for everyone. I don't think it would be fair that I have to fight for our government if I don't agree with what they're doing. My view is that if the draft was reinstated it should apply to all citizens."

4,2022-08-19,CMV: Parking minimums should be repealed.,u/GenghisKhandybar,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wsnc6q/cmv_parking_minimums_should_be_repealed/,changemyview," In the US, essentially all cities have arbitrarily decided a certain number of parking spaces each building must provide, depending on criteria such as square feet, number of bowling lanes, or number of seats. This is typically justified as an attempt to avoid a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation where businesses rely on having customers spill over into space intended for others.  

However, this would not be an issue if each parking spot just charged a fair market rate to park there. Compared to market rate private parking, I would argue that mandated free parking is equivalent to an unthinkably high tax on all, paid out as a subsidy to those who drive. Many businesses have more land dedicated to parking than to the building itself, and pass on that huge real estate cost to all consumers. Thus, if one walks, bikes, or takes public transit to a business they're forced to pay a significant toll to give the (generally more privileged) drivers free parking.  

As part of the enforcement of car culture, this subsidization makes cities significantly worse. When lots are 50% parking, pedestrians must walk twice as far to reach an equivalent destination. They also get delayed by increased traffic congestion at intersections and have to breathe in pollution caused by all of the subsidized car trips. Given the current climate crisis, it's clear that continued encouragement of car travel is contributing to future catastrophes as well.

If parking really is the land use people want, they should be free to pay for it of course. In the same way we pay for necessities like rent, they should be fine with paying for the huge amount of space their cars take up. Businesses may choose to provide their own market rate parking in front as well, but it should not be free for the reasons described above. I'm aware that people get upset when asked to pay for parking. As consumers, they feel they are paying for their parking by patronizing the respective business. However, as stated earlier, everyone pays for the parking, therefore those who drive are paying for less than their fair share, despite being the ones causing more pollution, traffic deaths, and congestion."

As a Hindu, I don’t think scripture mentions a nationality for her. She is everywhere and in all things. Isn’t a nationality what is given to people, not gods or goddesses?   


it doesn’t make sense to me why she, or any other deity has a nationality/ethnicity. To say someone is Indian, they have to have citizenship or ethnicity of India, in my understanding.

I now use my EUC for all trips within 3km because I no longer need to look for parking, and I can simply wheel it into wherever I need to go (it's smaller than carry-on luggage).

What's included in the category:

* Electric scooters, EUCs, Electric skateboards
* Electric/Manual Bicycles
* Mobility/Specialized Scooters for the physically challenged

Main benefits:

* Reduced carbon footprint and pollution
* Much faster than walking
* Reduced need for parking areas
* Cheaper and greener to produce, own, and run than ICE/Electric vehicles
* Electric options may be better than push bikes in hot/humid climates

Main issues:

* Safety
* Hooligans
* Easy to steal

Potential solutions:

* Safety regulations - potentially require to register vehicles and wear helmets etc
* Dedicated pathways and laws for public use
* Infrastructure and tech to lock up these vehicles (much more space efficient than carparks)

I live in a city where electric mobility vehicles are widely used (Canberra, Australia) and I honestly think it should be adopted more in other cities, but obviously there is pushback from the public due to safety concerns (and idiots destroying rentals). However I think these could be solved by regulating them in a similar way we do with motorbikes (in turn, building infrastructure for them). 

Do you agree with this idea? If not, why, and if applicable, how do you think we can make this even more viable?"

Homelessness is a huge problem, people are denied healthcare because they can't afford it, and many families are food insecure. And these problems seem to be increasing, not decreasing. 

I come from a middle- upper middle class family, but I've needed long term healthcare for various issues and the cost of all that has put enormous strain on our finances. I would not have survived without much of the healthcare I received and I'm incredibly grateful that I had access to these resources, but knowing how difficult paying for healthcare was for my family, I can't imagine a working class family getting the healthcare they need (if one of the members of said family had the health problems I've dealt with.) And healthcare is really just the tip of the iceberg. 

I completely agree that compared to, say, communist nations the standard of living in America is better. But compared to other developed nations that have more socialist  redistribution programs income inequality is much greater, healthcare outcomes are much worse, and general happiness and life satisfaction is lower. If this is the system working as it should, I'm not sure what that says about the system. 

I have no issue with millionaires or even billionaires, as long as those on the opposite end of the financial spectrum are getting the basic things they need. I think in a functional society those who are able to work should work. (Some people take a more Vecna view of the situation where waking up going to work going to sleep is an evil meaningless cycle humans are forced to endure, but as somebody who works a retail job I think working and contributing to society can add meaning to life) But I think if you can't work, you should still have access to basic needs and certainly if you work a minimum wage job you should still be able to access them. And I think a capitalist system often makes it so people can't access them. 

That's my view, I look forward to hearing others' views and I am open to changing my mind!"

255,2022-08-20,CMV: Increased police presence in high crime rate areas is not racism/discrimination,u/king_of_singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wt6zt3/cmv_increased_police_presence_in_high_crime_rate/,changemyview,"The idea is using statistical analysis and data to optimize police resources (officers, funding, duty patrols) etc on problematic neighbourhoods in the city where crime is more likely to occur. Perhaps the biggest push back to this idea is from critics who argue that such policies are often prone to bias and discrimination against certain classes and racial groups, resulting in an end effect that is the same as using discriminatory policies. So for example if data analysis tells the police to target areas that happen to be relatively low income as more crime is happening there, this is seen as discrimination against low income or impoverished people, and in some cases can also be viewed as a racial bias if the area houses a disproportionate number of a particular race (usually people of color).

The problem with this line of reasoning is that it operates on the premise that the data used is inherently flawed and it attaches a malignant intent to the policy that is hard to prove. The fact that police patrol more frequently in areas of high crime, high poverty, and predominantly filled by people of color does not necessarily mean that they are biased against the low income and people of color. A focus on high crime rates is bound to impact different segments of society unequally because crime rates vary with respect to different societal strata and is not indicative of a poor or broken policy. If I have a basket of fruits and I sort them by sweetness and I eat the sweetest few, which all turn out to be apples, does that mean I am biased towards apples?

Just because there is a correlation between police presence and social indicators such as race or income levels does not mean that it is these indicators which are responsible for drawing the increased police presence. It just so happens that high crime rates are correlated with these factors that makes it seem as though the police are targeting certain groups specifically.

I do understand that sometimes the existing data we have to work with is not accurate and already has pre-existing bias, but that does not mean that the method of using data to target selected problem areas is biased."

If you are lonely and single then contrary to what psychology today will try to tell you, becoming a good partner is probably the worst possible usage of your time. It won’t help you at all, and it’s pointless. It’s all about being in the right place in the right time.

Most of not being single is just entirely about having been motivated early in your life to find relationships, experience can help but not for quality only for quantity.

I don’t think you shouldn’t try to be more empathetic or whatever. But it’s not gonna help you with the task of not being single. I do think it’s a waste of time, but to be fair past college you really can’t get a return on time for not being single anyways so you may as well spend your time on something that might make relationships more enjoyable in the small chance you actually find one. But overall it’s just sit around and wait for one to pop up for anyone over 22."

0,2022-08-20,CMV: Marriage is an awful construct in today's society and should be severely changed or abolished.,u/imHereJust4This,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wta1st/cmv_marriage_is_an_awful_construct_in_todays/,changemyview,"I can see views being expressed here that many offend or even place doubt on married people. Read at your own risk. But for those of you who want to read this , please, allow me to just summarise:

**1: Marriages encourages unconditional commitment to unpredictable changes**

It's guaranteed that people will change. Every day you and/or your partner use social media you are subjected to many different ideologies and opinions. It only takes one of them to change your partner in a way that makes the marriage untenable. I know this is the case with my parents.

**2: The divorce rate is already 40%**

Honestly even I'm shocked at this. Because among the remaining 60% will be people who *want* to divorce but can't because of the level of commitment and the finances/custody issues involved. Or just aren't happy anymore. I'd bet anything that includes at least another 10% meaning the majority of married people have made a mistake and must bear the consequences. As soon as anything bears any risk to a majority, or even a minority, it gets banned.

**3: The expectation that you'll get married puts pressure on young and old people**

Everyone is expected to get married now and it makes people push for unnecessary beauty standards, compete with one another and even think they're a loser if they didn't lose their virginity before they could legally drink ffs. It also makes them think that if they're not married before a certain age then its too late for them. Many people who seek relationships do so to get validation from others when really we should be encouraging people to focus on themselves.

**4: Marriage is far more difficult to get out of than get into, leaving people feel trapped.**

The feeling of uncertainty and unhappiness you'll get if your partner does something you don't like, or if you have doubts about them, is far greater if you're married to them.

**5: People already do most of the things marriage was meant for.**

Most people move in together before they get married. Most people have sex before marriage. Marriage is, in essence, the signing of a legally binding contract which takes months and costs thousands.

**6: Just like celebrating Christmas, marriage is something members of society do even if they're not religious.**

I've seen plenty of threads on various websites of people asking atheists why they celebrate Christmas, and the responses are all pretty much ""Because I want to. Because everyone else is doing it and so I can as well. Fuck off"".

Now, I can see there's zero benefit in enforcing a rule forbidding atheists to celebrate Christmas because Christmas is a positive thing encouraging gratitude and togetherness. But, it's commercialized. It's something people can make money out of. Marriage is the exact same thing but with far more risk. Plus, it's pointless to cram people into a church to talk about God unifying two people if the people in that church don't even believe in God. But the people who make the money aren't going to get involved in that.

**7: There's a solution**

I'm not saying that partners should remain boyfriend and girlfriend for the rest of their lives. Instead, rather than a legally binding contract someone else wrote, partners solidify their relationship through repeated acts of service or gifts which signify a continued bond. Buy your partner new matching rings every few years if you want. Go on multiple honeymoons. Even hold events with the white dresses and cakes and parties, just nothing which locks you in to anything. 

One idea I've had is, you make it a group thing. Every year, or every few years, you two and your group of married friends meet up in the same place and talk about how things have changed since you were last there but how you remain committed to your partner. Renew your vows, change them if needed, even sign a new contract with the friends acting as witnesses. Go out and do activities together, go to dinners, party, whatever you want. I'd love to do something like that. I just honestly can't think of anything worse than leaping head first into that amount of uncertainty, and I'm seeing the consequences of doing just that in so many couples right now."

Look at the last time the us banned a universal product causing harm to the country.

That seems good until it turned out that what sprung from it was gang violence more booze being consumed and illegal booze being common.

https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/alcohol-prohibition-was-failure

Now look at guns. Like booze they are a common problem in the us that many have that cause violence, school shooting, gun violence ect. If we ban guns it’s just going to be a second prohibition where now guns would be traded illegally and the illegal gun trace would now have a huge market in America. The illegal gun trade as is is is already a huge problem and now giving them the ability to market to Americans would make it even worse. 

Instead we should limit gun use not extremely but to the point it’s harder to get one that sucks but not so hard people will resort to illegal gun trading."

(I don't think that part is true.)

The way I see it, sex is real and, and gender is real as well. Gender is how we present our sex to the world, so some of it we did construct (girls wear dresses and boys wear trousers or girls like pink and boys like blue), but it seems to me that while those are constructs and change depending on the society you're talking about, we map them on to genders which exist across cultures.

While gender isn't the same as sexuality, both are internal, a person doesn't choose to he gay, they naturally are. I think it's the same with gender.

Why would someone choose to he transgender, to have surgery to match their sex to... a construct that people made up that doesn't exist??

It makes much more sense to me that they have some internal experience of their gender which doesn't match their sex, so they take steps to change that.

I'm not talking about alternative/xenogenders because I don't know how much of that is actual gender dysphoria and how much is people wanting to belong/describe their personality as a gender.

Edit: gender roles are constructed, gender/gender identity isn't. I changed the phrasing around the blue/pink example because it sounded like I was saying that those were not constructed, which I didn't mean to say."
0,2022-08-20,CMV: Incels who claim that women have it easy yet haven't tried dating men deserve no sympathy,u/indigo-jay-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wti6jw/cmv_incels_who_claim_that_women_have_it_easy_yet/,changemyview,"EDIT: No, I'm not seriously suggesting that we force incels to be gay. I'm making that suggestion in order to show how ridiculous I find incels' claim that women have it easy because they can sleep with men they're not attracted to. I no longer think that saying this will change incels' beliefs, but I still feel zero sympathy for the misogynistic ones.

In general, there are two groups of people who I don't believe deserve sympathy: hypocrites and people who constantly complain about very fixable issues. (I am open to having my view changed on this).

Incels generally share a set of beliefs about women: they believe that women have easier lives, that women choose to ""date up,"" and that women can't be incels because any woman could find a guy who wants to have sex with her. They should recognize that the last point applies to men too. There are tons of rich men seeking male sugar babies, and since men are horny in general, I'm sure most incels would be able to find a guy desperate enough to have sex with them. This implies one of two things. The first possibility is that incels are complaining about a fixable issue (since it would be easy for them to stop being virgins by having sex with a guy). The second possibility is that they are hypocrites. It's possible that straight incels want to restrict their dating pool to people they're attracted to (i.e. women). If so, it's hypocritical for them to pretend that women have it easy, since many women are also incapable of finding partners when they restrict their dating pool to people they're attracted to.

As a result, I feel absolutely no sympathy for incels who haven't tried dating men. I don't care about them at all. I'm open to having my view changed because I recognize that I might lack perspective and my view feels pretty cold."

122,2022-08-20,CMV: showing disappointment over your child's gender reveal party is cruel,u/elektra359,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wtj42l/cmv_showing_disappointment_over_your_childs/,changemyview,"I don't really have anything against gender reveal parties, I think they're unnecessary because I believe that the gender of a child shouldn't affect how you raise them very much, but a lot of parents have them as a way of celebrating their child and how excited they are and I think that's great. I heard somewhere that they originated from couples who struggled with miscarriage and were excited to finally make it far along enough in a pregnancy to find out the gender and I found that really beautiful and it honestly changed my opinion of gender reveal parties to be more neutral/positive because I originally found them to be kind of a way of stereotyping your future kid before they were born, but I think now that as a celebration of life and health, they're really powerful and I have a lot of respect for parents who have them. 

The problem comes when one or both parents publicly express disappointment over their child's gender at the reveal. I've seen a lot of videos like this on Instagram and other such platforms, usually a father being upset that he's getting a girl, but any combination of genders in that situation is still bad in my opinion. 

I think that this so called ""gender disappointment"" mostly comes from having gendered expectations of your child in an unhealthy way. Wanting a boy because he'll share your interest in hunting/sports/whatever, wanting a girl because she'll share your interest in makeup/femininestuff/whatever, is unfair to the child and puts them in a box that may not fit them and will try to force them down one path without taking into account that your child is a whole person and not just the stereotype you associate with them. These interests are not inherently gendered; if hunting is an important part of your life and you want it to be continued by your children, you should share it with them, regardless of what sex they are. If fashion is important to you, same thing. Segregating these activities by gender doesn't make sense in modern society and you should be able to share your passions with your kids if you want to without making it about what gender they are. You don't just like hunting because you're a man, you like it because it's fun and it's something you care about, so why shouldn't you share that with your daughter the same way you would with your son. 

These gendered expectations create a problem even if the kid is the gender you wanted, what if your son doesn't like any hobbies that you associate with manhood and wanted him to engage in because he's male. What if he's feminine and wants to do girly things. What if he later comes out as gay or a trans woman. Knowing that he (or they) doesn't meet your expectations will surely make them feel bad and have low self esteem. Your priority as a parent should be to let your kid know that you love them for who they are and that they deserve to grow up to be the best version of themself, and having this pre-planned path for them in relation to their gender and personality doesn't align with that goal. 

Imagine being a kid and finding out or seeing a video online that your dad was disappointed that you were going to be born. Knowing that you weren't what your parents wanted. I'm a girl and my mom had hoped for a girl when she found out she was pregnant, so I don't know this aspect from experience, but it has to feel really really bad to know that deep down, some part of your parent's mind thinks of you as the worse of two options and wishes you had been born different.

I think starting off your journey as a parent by telling everyone at the party and sometimes online that you wished your baby were different than they are is really sad and cruel to your future child. They did nothing except exist and if a parent doesn't want a child or wanted a different child than they got that sentiment always, always shows through in the parents relationship with the child. There's no way to hide that forever and it's hurtful. 

That said, I want to know the parent's side of this better. I really want to keep this conversation civil because I understand that it's an emotional and sensitive topic for many! Thank you!"

Everyone is a product of random chance, and typically that is a combination of an environment that makes you a certain way, and natural characteristics such as intelligence, temperament, and addictions that no one can choose. If who we are is determined by factors out of our control, then it is irrational to be mad at anyone for how they act. We should not be hateful or annoyed at people for what is not within their control, and I think that who we are as individuals is not within our control. Therefore, we should not place blame on people for their actions.

If a person experiences narcolepsy, and because of this randomly falls asleep during a conversation, we typically do not get mad at them and say it is their fault for having a narcoleptic attack. So why is it that when someone says something mean to us we don’t similarly think, ‘Well it’s not their fault they are mean. Circumstances from who their family is to how they were born as an individual has resulted in them being a mean person.’ If I similarly had unkind and hateful parents, with the same characteristics that do not allow me to break free from their hate, then I would also hold similar world views and say similarly mean comments. We should accept that people become what they will become, and this can go in both good and bad ways.

Typically, a response is ‘Well sure, people born with racist parents will be racist. But I was born to bad circumstances and I broke free. So anyone should be able to do so.’ And I think that this is an incredibly narrow perspective of who we are as people. Sure, you were able to break free from racist parents because of the opportunities you had, the friends who influenced you, the natural intelligence you possess, etc. Your sibling who was born to the same parents was unable to break free should not be blamed for this, they just do not possess the traits needed to break free from such bad circumstances, and you should consider yourself lucky for the qualities you have that they do not. To say, ‘Just try harder!’ is to tell a narcoleptic to just stop experiencing narcolepsy. They just are unable to do so. 

When a person is consistently late, or inconsiderate, or racist, this is who they are. They were unable to be anything besides what they currently are due to the factors they have experienced. And we should show as much compassion as possible for those who do wrongs because we could have been the same exact person if born in their shoes. And that's not to say people can't change, but even that change is out of their control due to the random factors they experience that lead to their change.

To be clear, I do not think this means we should not have punishments. If a person consistently physically assaults other people, this is a bad thing and they should be imprisoned and kept away from society as long as this behavior endangers others. But to punish them in retribution and vengeance, instead of with the intent to rehabilitate, is the wrong way to approach punishment. We can make judgments of people as dangerous, while still not holding hate for those who commit wrongs. We should try to help them and understand them because we could have been the same person born with the same rageful tendencies."

He killed many Nazi and Hydra soldiers alike for the liberation of cities and his friends held captive, so I don't believe it has anything to do with killing and instead to do with how people judge his characterization of the mantle to the former (excluding Bradley, because although he's kept secret there's no visual footage of him, which is a missed opportunity so damn the screenwriters).   


When analyzing the two Captains, we have Steven Rogers, a small, scrappy emaciated young man hailing from New York in the Depression Era given his powers because of his heart, determination, and his selflessness to protect his unit (sacrificing himself to a dummy grenade in training). He has a history going from 2012 from saving New York from alien invaders, to uprooting the Hydra plot in Shield, to saving the world from complete annihilation after failure. What drives him into the spotlight however is his outlaw status given he broke the Sokovia Accords - which would control private individuals and organizations, like Stark, to be sanctioned by the government - and went into hiding. There's a growing contention there with how it should've been handled but aside to Rogers, everyone still seems to be fine with the man regardless of his stance because he was willing to risk it all to save not just his country, but the world and the universe beyond himself.  


Now to John F. Walker, a strapping young from the Ten Rings era (practically a counter to Jihadists up until Shang Chi arrived), went from Varsity straight into the military in the 2010s to save lives and fight terror in Afghanistan, for his bravery and headstrong attitude he received medals and powers like his predecessor before. Not much is known about his adventures, his whereabouts during the Chitauri invasion or the Blip, besides his PTSD he keeps to himself, because although he didn't have the same powers, experience, history as Steve, the only thing that makes them the same is their humanity. Walker is kept on a pedestal as not only the responsibility of his duties but to the teams he is in charge of, the medals he received are a reminder of the things he bear witness to, the people he lost, what made him change. It made it all the worst when he was given the suit, the title, the **shield** of what not only America but the world sees as a **Paragon** of something that's far from maintainable, he's not a rich genius, a sorcerer or god of thunder, he's a man broken and built up to be someone else's savior.  


The one scene/event people bring up besides his cocky presentation is the one where he eliminates a Flag Smasher in broad daylight in front of tens of people who filmed him for the world to see, that along with the perception that he's no longer considered a ""hero"" was the breaking point of John's character. Up until that point the Flag Smashers were a group of centralized hooligans who made their message after losing their ""homes"" by robbing a bank, which belonged to people who were dusted and brought back, and after that they burned down a supply depot with people still inside it. So after his partner, Lemar, dies because the leader throws him into a pillar that broke his neck instantaneously, who in their right mind wouldn't get revenge for their friend they've known and stuck together since High School? Regardless of putting them under lawful arrest one thing is for certain, they are terrorists, and they directly caused the death of his best friend. Later they would plot many other attacks where many people would've died if Walker and the titular heroes didn't step in to take them down, and ignoring other plot conveniences like the Power Broken and so on, he gets discharged for the incident prior to FS attacks in NYC with no rank nor benefits. As unfair it is given the circumstances (and also the senator in question, but like other things its not too relevant) he gets his dues payed cold, from where he goes on from here is to be updated another time but as of now I want to see what others think of him with the mantle of Captain America.  


\*And before anyone asks, a mantle in this case is the title of what a hero goes by and is not their name, anyone can be the Spider-Man or Batman but they are not Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, same applies to Thor."

So, here we are, end disclaimer.* 

We need to stop the “tough on crime” mantra in the US. 

It is far too common on Reddit to see people cheering on vigilante justice of accused criminals being beaten, murdered, raped in prison, you name it. 

It would seem people are forgetting why “innocent until proven guilty” and “when you have served your time, your punishment has been exacted” are principles we have built our society on to begin with.

**Society is more dangerous for everyone when we lose our humanity.** Violent criminals will never peacefully surrender, if they know society will spare them absolutely no second thought as they wither away or get murdered in prison. 

What keeps so many criminals surrendering peacefully is the social contract: You surrender and turn yourself in, and we will punish you in appropriate - but not excessive - measure, and your life will be better than one on the run.

**If we break that contract or fail to uphold our end**, less criminals will ultimately surrender, and those who are on the run will have nothing to lose and be much, much more dangerous.

I despise child molesters as much as the next guy, **but please stop advocating for their rape and lifelong abuse**, which only pushes potential child molesters towards not coming forwards, hiding even better, never seeking treatment for their sick thoughts, etc. 

I despise murderers too, but I’m not willing to put society at risk to make an example of them.

And **all of this** is without even mentioning another massive problem: The absolutely ridiculous amount of innocent people in prison due to plea deals and bad prosecutors, **whom you are inadvertently advocating for the assault, abuse, and death of as well.**

The most common counter-argument I hear is “this is ignoring the plight and needs of the victims.” 

I fundamentally don’t believe this. I don’t believe all victims are unequivocally out for revenge and lose all reflection and nuance when victims of a crime. I’ve been a victim of a crime a couple of times now - I still keep my rational brain around. 

Victims should have an interest in **as few people being victims of the same crime in the future as possible**. This is accomplished by combatting rising crime rates and recidivism.

Guess what has imperially proven itself the best way to do that? 

Through prison systems that focus on rehabilitation and well prepared re-entry into society, not draconian punitive laws and beating up the sex offender in your neighborhood with bats after he came back from his 25 year prison sentence.

I understand the drive to exact justice on some of the people we hear about every day **but the urge and advocating for vigilante violence has to end.**

You’re making society more dangerous under the guise of being “tough on crime” and it’s such an own goal.

We need to be better.

EDIT:

Just to define what I mean by “tough on crime,” I will paste a previous comment here for context:

When I talk about being tough on crime, I’m talking about the specific policies which, in political science, have come to be associated with the term:

•	⁠Mandatory minimums, relatively lax approaches to crimes committed in gen.pop. in prisons.

•	⁠Capital punishment.

•	⁠The notion that getting beaten or raped in prison is part of your punishment and just in some abstract sense, sometimes even funny (“that rapist better not drop the soap in the showers, I doubt anybody is gonna come to his rescue” as if rape is somehow funny now because the shoe is on the other foot)

•	⁠A lifelong sex offender registry which notifies your neighbors and - not that I think any part of the sex offender registry should exist outside of police databases, but to make matters worse - won’t even tell them if you’re on it for urinating in public or for violating a child, because apparently that’s a violation of your privacy, but somehow notifying your neighbors in the first place is not? What!?

•	⁠Broken windows policing, stop and frisk, red-lining, the 1994 crime bill, the cash for kids shit, etcetera, etcetera,  which disproportionally criminalizes marginalized people for minor non-violent crimes and drags them into the cycle of recidivism somehow being okay.

•	⁠The idea that prison cells should be cold and horrible places rather than examples of the life inmates could have if they would break the cycle.

•	⁠The idea that education, job training, and access to news and media is somehow a waste or a privilege to inmates rather than a natural part of rehabilitating someone and pushing them towards a legal, fulfilling life rather than back into the cycle.

•	⁠and on and on and on.

I don’t mean we should pursue or investigate crime less, or certain crimes less, or ignore white collar crime (which you’re right, we absolutely should massively increase enforcement on), but that we should get rid of policies which criminalize people, trap them in cycles of recidivism, and foster apathy through subhuman living conditions which the system then justifies to them, causing inmates and ex-cons to further alienate themselves from society.

I can measure an inch with my first knuckle, a foot with, well, my foot, and continue from there. I don't care what the conversion rates from feet to miles are, they're on my phone, accessible at any time. 0 degrees Fahrenheit is about the coldest your average person will ever experience, and 100 degrees is the hottest. The idiotic argument about 0 degrees Celsius being freezing and 100 being boiling is just that: idiotic. When was the last time you... measured the temperature of water before it boiled? I just turn the stove on high and wait. It's not like I need a temperature measurement to tell when water is frozen, either. I'll admit that Celsius has some scientific uses, but water is a single substance out of literally trillions - and it's not as if scientists can't remember 32 and 212. Let's not even talk about the kilogram - constantly changing, compared to the pound, and hotly debated. Once more, the only advantage is being slightly faster to convert, a use that has entirely disappeared now that I can pull out a calculator at any time."

Extremely good. In fact it's the best.. when compared to stuff like monarchy. We can do so much better, but STILL, people like to argue democracy is the ""best"". No. Any system which gives as much power to the flat earthers as to people who understand the intricacies of running a government is bad. The  vast majority of  people  can't make such decisions. It's especially worse when it's a simple majority vote(like in India).  The US is one example. I could cite countless more. Democracy isn't about  being chosen by the people, it's about tricking the masses into thinking you can run the country. And you know the fun part? You can trick them more than once. You can do it again and again and again. Your average person won't be thinking from a worldwide stance. Heck, you're average person will barely be even thinking! A few sweet promises and lo, you have their trust. To think that the majority of people will be right always/most of the time is absurd.

I think you would be much better off having a team of experts decide everything. Experts in multiple fields who can examine decisions from all angles before accepting or rejecting them. Not people with political views, people with scientific views.

Edit:  What I mean to say, is democracy is fairly okay, but it can be improved. And my idea is *not* the only alternative, it simply is an alternative that I personally think will work. In all probability there's plenty more which are better than mine.

Edit1: Well shoot, how do I give *everyone* a delta?  My system does seem not good with a bit of thinking, although my other point still stands, ""Democracy is good, but has flaws and can be improved but nobody wants it to."""

From my perspective (20M), those who claim that they have crippling cases of anxiety and/or depression appear ridiculous and are searching for a scapegoat for their inability to persevere. I know that this response is extremely callous towards those who may be going through a psychiatric ordeal, but so far I haven't been able to comprehend what sets these people apart from someone who doesn’t have an alleged disorder and why? How are “sad” thoughts that everyone feels and “anxious/depressive” thoughts different? What idea is stopping the two from being treated the same? I don’t want to say that people's feelings aren’t justified. However, nodding my head and agreeing with someone that their situation sucks, that they’re hardwired to be helpless to do anything about it, feels wrong in every essence of my soul. Maybe I’m not supposed to be able to understand, but it’s frustrating because I can’t just ignore the situation if I care about them. There’s got to be a way to diverge pessimistic thoughts right?

There is also the question of: Ok. So this is real, then who is legitimately of concern and who is just being overly theatrical? If this does happen, then how do you be sure of the difference between the two? Or is it dangerous to be downplaying something potentially serious? I’m assuming that the treatment of those who are legitimately of concern is related to medication and therapy of some sort, but what about the latter? How do you tell someone they're overreacting towards something that seems trivial without coming off as callous? It feels wrong to say this out loud to someone who appears deeply upset.

I’ve had conversations with my loved ones who insist that they’re bound to feel miserable with little reason, that their condition and their feelings have control over them. I want to be more understanding and empathetic because I care deeply for their health and well being, but I just don't see why they are so accepting of their situation. In times when I am in distress; I look on the bright side, I take some time to myself, I get away, I plan towards a solution, I sleep it off, I think about the things that I DO still have. Why do some people fixate on the good while others fixate on the bad?

I don’t know, maybe the hardship in my life doesn’t compare to that of others. I wouldn’t say that I've had a happy childhood but I also don't believe I've suffered greatly in a sense. My parents are neurotic wrecks who manipulate and emotionally abuse each other at every chance, making life at home in the crossfire unbearable, but overall they treat their kids decently enough and take their futures in high regard. Because of this I don’t think I’ve directly experienced much emotional or psychological trauma in my early development, could that be why I’m not susceptible to these mental disorders? Have I just not experienced enough to be able to relate and empathize? Is a mental disorder nature or nurture? Put in the mind due to genetics or due to trauma? Also disclaimer: this post is dedicated in regards to the general populous in the US, not my immediate family.

To reiterate, I can’t shake the feeling that those who believe that they have crippling cases of anxiety and/or depression seem like they're trying to find easy justification for their actions. I’m trying to be more open minded and knowledgeable about emotions and mental health so that I can be a shoulder to lean on. But as of now, my view is making that difficult so please make it easier for me to change it. If anyone would like to share their experiences or resources that could better describe the phenomena, I would greatly appreciate it and thank you.

TL;DR

I need more insight on why anxiety/depression is a legitimate disorder and what I can do for those I hold dear."

It presupposes that good ideas will somehow naturally come to the top and all it takes to shut down bad ideas is to just debunk them. The big issue here is that in my opinion this ignores reality if all it takes to eliminate bad ideas are good arguments there would be no anti-vaxxers, there would be no holocaust deniers and Andrew Tate would ultimately never gain the massive amount of fame he did. It ignores the fact that humans are susceptible to misinformation and lies.

The other problem with debunking is that ultimately you can't debate people like Tate [check out this debate between Hasan and Tate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkohX4ICZGk&amp;t=1220s) in said debate Tate denies the facts of empirical reality how are you supposed to argue with a person that will at any point just deny reality for their own opinion.

Last, the backfire effect when we present his ideas as a ""debate"" no matter how much we utterly embarrass the side that's wrong we inadvertently give wrong arguments validity by saying it's something up for debate.

I think deplatforming him is the correct move and has worked plenty on people like him  Milo Yiannopoulos,  Stefan Molyneux, James Allsup. These people were all prominent Nazis all spreading their ideas on mainstream channels until they got banned now they're forced to make content on smaller platforms to dwindling audiences"
0,2022-08-21,CMV: Surgical and hormone treatment for trans people is the best treatment,u/kurpPpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wublrf/cmv_surgical_and_hormone_treatment_for_trans/,changemyview,"EDIT: *I shouldn't generalize*, not everyone wants to transition, so my current view is the best way to treat trans people is to make a holistic approach to healthcare available. **Legal, societal and medical gender affirmation are all needed, and everyone trans person is unique in how important each one of those is to them.**

EDIT 2: I want to clarify, **I don't think that medical transition should be a rushed decision.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that the best way to lessen the suffering of trans people is to give them the resources to transition medically, given that it makes sure that the risks are discussed, and the person is confirmed to be transgender.

I believe that gender dysphoria can't be gotten rid of through therapy, and that the euphoria that one gets from living as their gender is a massive upside. So I believe that it is the best way to treat trans people.

# some definitions:

**Hormone treatment**: Hormone replacement therapy and Hormone blockers

**Surgical treatment**: Sex reassignment surgery, such as phalloplasty and vaginectomy

**Medical transition**: Umbrella term, includes both surgical and hormone treatment to change one's appearance, genitalia, hormones etc.

**Sex**: what genitalia and chromosomes you were born with, being ""biologically male/female""

**Gender**: What you feel like, do you feel like a boy, a girl, or something else. May match gender expression/presentation but it might not

**Gender expression**: how one expresses their gender through clothing, tone of voice, body language, aesthetic etc.

**Gender presentation**: how you present yourself to the world. Often used when talking about getting people to see you as the ""correct gender""

**Trans person/transgender person**: someone who's gender identity doesn't match their Sex

**Gender euphoria/dysphoria**: A good feeling you get when you're gender expression matches your gender or when you're seen as the correct gender, or vice versa."

I justify this with the fact that in this order, the benefit of correctly measuring the amount of cereal desired is obtained, since otherwise, placing the cereals after the milk, they do not sink and therefore overflow out of the bowl, requiring the help of a spoon to lower the cereals in order to place more on top of them. 
""When you put the cereal first, and you measure the amount of milk wrong, you will have to add more cereal, so you will contradict yourself since you argued to use the cereal first so you don't have to put it more than once"" This happens, but only if you measure the quantities wrong 
""But putting the milk on top of the cereals can spill it out making a mess"" Only if you are clumsy and you squirt all the milk at once as if it were a torrent. You should be careful to pour it slowly enough so that it doesn't splash out as you pour it over the cereal 
""Yes, but if you add the milk after the cereal, you won't be able to eat all of them crispy yet as the heat of the milk will soften the cereal the longer it is immersed, the cereals on top will be crispy and the ones below will be crunchy more quickly"" A valid point, but in this case you must regulate the temperature of the milk. If it boils, it quickly softens the cereal, but if it is lukewarm you can enjoy the pleasure of all the cereal from start to finish being crispy. I personally am not in the habit of drinking hot milk, so all my cereal is crispy and crispy as it should be.
""But I heat the milk in the microwave already in the bowl"" What's the problem? Can't it be poured into the cereal bowl? 
""I say Milk with Cereals and not Cereals with Milk, the same way I say Chocolate Milk and Milk of This and Milk of That"" Phonetic precedence is not a valid argument? 
""Phonetic precedence makes sense because it means you live in a culture where milk is mostly put first"" It's not because something is cultural that it's intrinsically correct.
""Milk has historical precedence over cereal so it must be honored by the primacy of milk in the bowl"" And then must the republic also honor the monarchy because it has historical precedence? History is human evolution and evolution implies improvement, so the more in the past we go back worse is the human condition, cereals came like this in the context of historical evolution in improvement of the human condition complemented by milk. 
""Milk is nobler than cereal because it is the first food that we humans, and also mammals animals, take when they are puerile and that makes us grow virile"" In fact, milk is fundamental in life almost as much as water, for be the infant's primary source of nutrients, but are you an infant or already a manly man? A man, therefore, why do you treat milk as if you were still a child?

Changing terminology does not change behavior or bias. Forcing people to change their discourse makes them more prejudiced and hostile but does not change oppressive structures. If one word is oppressive and forbidden, another will replace it because that's how language has always worked throughout history. Stigma migrates to a new term and we are back to square one.
Let us imagine a poor, culturally different marginalized group with precarious housing, which is referred to by the word X, and the word X is seen by the group as insulting. Every time someone invokes the word they feel oppressed and insulted.
If, by policing the speech, we change the word to Y, but we are not addressing or intervening in the stigma and problems that marginalize the community, we are not doing anything. Thus Y becomes the new X as the association with the stigma remains and Y becomes the new injury.
I believe it is not bad words that cause stigma, but stigma that causes bad words.
If stigma makes words have a negative connotation then changing words only delays them from acquiring injurious meaning, even if there is success in changing the word.
By focusing on policing political correctness, it allows those in power to feel and make it look like they are doing something, without actually doing anything concrete about inequalities.
Valuing only semantic change and claiming that it solves problems is evil. IT IS
A culturally different poor marginalized group with precarious housing is referred to by the word X and the word X is seen by the group as an insult. Every time someone invokes the word they feel oppressed and insulted.
Not using the word does not destroy the stigma or the problems that generate marginalization. It is a serious and dedicated intervention on the part of the government and with the support of civil society that makes it possible to address the problems at the root.
Now, using insulting words is still bad, and should be discouraged, I'm not saying that everyone should use those words as if they had no meaning. What I'm saying is that focusing on words alone and not addressing the structural problems that create the stigma associated with those words is unproductive, ineffective, and lazy.

TLDR:
Just focusing in policing speach and not intervening in marginalizad communities to uplift them and end their marginalization is lazy and unproductive

TL;DR - I never got the appeal of the show, it always fell flat to me. I’d love to understand what people like about it/what pulled you in so I could try to watch the new series and enjoy it. 

I know a lot of people will give me hate for this but I never really understood the mass appeal of the show when it was originally aired and now with the new series so many people are losing their minds over it again. 

I love a good TV show and have watched a lot of sci-fi /drama shows (ex: Doctor Who, Breaking Bad, LOST, For All Mankind, Watchmen) in my time but personally I wasn’t able to really get into GOT. Plus once it was super popular I found a lot of fans of the show were just rude when they found out you didn’t watch it/acted better or smarter than you (just my personal experience not saying all GOT fans are rude by any stretch). Obviously I haven’t watched all the episodes but the story itself seems interesting just something about it never really pulled me in. 

I think something about the Medieval era it’s in just doesn’t interest me that much in general. I really had to push to enjoy LOTR but once I watched the Hobbit I got more interested and found all the movies very interesting. Something about the storyline just grabbed my attention in the hobbit that the original LOTR movies didn’t at first but after watching the Hobbit I found the original movies more exciting. 

I’m hoping I can do something similar with GOT with the new show coming out, I would like to try to get into it. 

SO people of Reddit, what about GOT got you hooked on the series?"

Now, I absolutely love The Bible. I study theology and philosophy of religion. I have been engaging with The Bible for about two years with a PhD teacher of philosophy. The society claims that when people engage with the Bible, it will change their lives for the better, in a massive way. 

Now, the only small change I have noticed is me being interested in school for the first time in years (previous teachers in other schools hated me because of disabilities) and good grades from memorising verses to write in essays. 

Apart from joining a great course and getting a qualification and certificate in the future to put on my resume/CV, I see no difference engaging with the Bible has had on my life. 

Yes, it's a VERY interesting book - I'm not denying that. But how can it change my life? Since I have been studying it for quite some time, if change that big was going to happen surely I would see the change by now?

What sort for changes could reading the Bible bring to my life? Is it because I am studying and reading the wrong translation? I listen attentively, make notes, study every day, and apart from A+ grades, there have been no dramatic changes. So, how do I find out if what The Bible Society UK claim is actually true? What am I doing wrong, if anything? If they are telling the truth, could I really experience the change they are claiming will happen if I read this interesting book? I see no changes yet, but I am certainly open to there being some. In fact, I **want** there to be some. The claim just doesn't seem very true right now."

For example, the concept of black safe spaces. In case people haven't heard of them, they are areas that have been dedicated as a separate area for minorities to feel safe from the oppression of white people. This is identical to the ""separate but equal"" idea that enabled the oppression of minorities in the past, except rebranded as a good thing, insulating them from any attempt at correcting their existence.

2) somewhat stemming from (1), the constant stream of bad ideas, cancel culture, and focusing on less important things prevents progress, or even productive discourse, from occurring. When the bad ideas are implemented they frequently cause more problems than they solve, and that assumes they even solve problems, and then when you oppose their idea, come up with a different idea that conflicts with it, or say anything bad about it you are branded a bigot, misogynist, and a chauvinist and immediately cancelled, and even if you get past that you are immediately shut down if you commit a microaggression, accedentally gender anything, or if someone randomly doesn't like you, which makes working towards actual solutions impossible. In addition to that, like their opponents they are generally opposed to collaboration and compromise, as ""they are just chauvinistic bigots,"" even when their opposition have legitimate reasons for holding their beliefs.

3) woke Culture claims to be opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, racism, etc. But have devolved into being sexist, racist, heterophobic fascists. They are opposed to free speech, are obsessed with race, and marginalize &amp; assault their opponents. In other words, they are woke Nazis. This is doubled up in the secondary effects of their efforts, as their efforts frequently marginalize the underrepresented groups they are defending. For example, the war against microaggressions marginalizes people with disorders that inhibit speech, and make it difficult for people to learn native language for fear of accidentally upsetting someone and getting labeled a bigot.

If these decision makers just let go of all the investments that is the cause of the problem, they would be willing to invest in alternatives that may not solve past problems but wouldn't be contributing to carbon emissions.
 
I separate the elite from everyone else because the sunk cost isn't anyone else's, so there might be people who don't personally benefit from continuing carbon centric economy, but they are not being asked what to do any way. Even if we were to eliminate internal combustion engines, and went to zero carbon emissions electricity generation, there's still the problem of getting rid of the hundreds of millions of vehicles on the road today in the US, and the population distribution ensures that there's not much alternatives other than just swap out the energy source (no biking/walking, mass transit,  etc) when residential housing is single use zoned to be single family with a minimum lot size that makes it difficult to use those alternatives.
 
What would change my view, or alleviate my global climate doom, would be reasoning why we (in the US) would transform our economy into a carbon neutral economy before the worst results occur."

Definitions:

Free - The state of not being restrained in any way

Will - The power to act on one's desire

What you will do next is determined by what you want and what you are capable of.

Unions - through their bargaining, increases costs for employers. They bargain for higher wages, benefits, time off, etc. Unions can be fully embedded in a local industry - I.e. if you switch vendors, as a customer you pay the same because both shops are union shops.

Here’s what I see. Companies, in an effort to protect shareholder value, are forced to make more drastic decisions that ultimately hurt employees. Companies will end up walking away from the business, or eliminating that work, or finding legal workarounds that doesn’t cross union lines. Companies will also decline an increase in top line revenue in localities where union headwinds decrease margins.

On the customer side, union’s power to sympathy strike causes customers to forego service due to strikes, which can be unrelated to that customers’ area. Unions also keep costs high with no way for the customer to get a better deal if the union has blanketed the market. 

For example, in my city there was/still is a concrete worker strike. Customers cannot use a major bridge, and companies ended up forming new entities to haul around the strike. I don’t know if it was legal but it hurt both sides; the drivers still don’t have a deal and the bridge is overcost and past projected completion date.

Note: I am not saying I oppose unions or believe they don’t do good work. They do. I just believe, at current, the balance between them causes companies to act in harmful ways to increase shareholder value. It’s a product of a company’s inability to be moral or immoral, it just acts to increase the bottom line.

I’m wholly open to changing my view with your examples!"

Unless you were already planning on buying that type of product, and the brand they were advertising happened to have the best price, it doesn’t make sense to purchase it. Both you AND your favorite creator would  be better of if you DIDNT buy the product, and instead give some of that money directly to the creator (Patreon, KoFi, etc)

Creators only get a small percentage of the money you spent on your purchase. Instead of buying product you don’t really need, why not just take 25% of the money you would have spent and directly give it to your favorite creator? You spend less money and they get more money."

And my view is: you can't just say ""here are some numbers. and **X** is a fact bc of them"".

I wanna clear some things up:

* I don't suggest dismissal of statistical data as an argument. I just think too many people give it too much weight;
* I really do believe that statistics as a tool is mostly useless in making executive desitions, like creating and implementing policies. Bc stats are highly interpretative in nature and have a lot of potencial for corruption.

Example (taken word-by-word from [Types of Statistics (Descriptive &amp; Inferential) (byjus.com)](https://byjus.com/maths/types-of-statistics/)):

**Descriptive**

&gt;In a class, the collection of marks obtained by 50 students is the description of data. Now when we take out the mean of the data, the result is the average of marks of 50 students. 

I totally get that one. Give me that any day of the week.

**Inferential**

&gt;If the average mark obtained by 50 students is 88 out of 100, then we can reach to a conclusion or give a judgment on the basis of the result. 

Aaaaaand i'm lost. What kinda conclusion? Gudgement-who? I'll explain my 2 points on this example in particular:

* *I don't suggest dismissal of statistical data as an argument. I just think too many people give it too much weight;*

Someone says ""we know as a fact that most students in this class are smart"". No we don't. We might get more detailed number on their grades. Mb they are all super-athletes with lower grades on everything else. But then from that exact number someone will conclude ""well they are all just moderately smart super-athletes"". And nope again. Bc they might have different marks on different disciplines and so on. My point here is the number itself is a fact. The conclusions and judgements are exactly and only that -- conclusions and judgements.

* *I really do believe that statistics as a tool is mostly useless in making executive desitions, like creating and implementing policies. Bc stats are highly interpretative in nature and have a lot of potencial for corruption.*

And here's what i wanna try to change in my head. To that exact example. I have too many questions, that are more difficult to formalize and quantify: do we know grades are fair (by design and as given by teacher) and how is any of that statistic useful to any particular student? And what kinda rules we can productively enforce, based on average?"

If you had really come to the conclusion that billions of animals are slaughtered every year, animals who are conscious and have souls and experiences and emotions and feelings, obviously you would want to let everyone know the moral tragedy that they are partaking in every single day by consuming animal products. In fact, if you really thought that millions of innocent beings are dying every single day and the world is basically doing nothing about it, I would be surprised if you didn’t try and tell every single person you met and interacted about it, and how being a vegan is the only moral choice one could make. 

Of course, for those of us who don’t really care to much about animal murder and stuff like that, this all comes across as really annoying, but I at least get where they are coming from. I think a lot of the hate directed towards vegan communities and such which are simply trying to spread their message (from their perspective, a very noble message) to the outside world is unjustified as we all have our moral convictions which we attempt to impart on those around us."

4,2022-08-23,CMV: MCU She Hulk has worse anger control issues than the Hulk,u/Nepene,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wvnngx/cmv_mcu_she_hulk_has_worse_anger_control_issues/,changemyview,"Recently, a tv show was released. An action comedy lawyer show about She Hulk, a superhero coming into her powers and pursuing a career as a lawyer.

One of the themes of the show is about how women always have to keep control of their anger because the world is so provocative, and She Hulk is infinitely better at controlling her temper than Hulk. 

I think the evidence in the show is that she is actually worse at controlling her temper than the Hulk, and presumably was worse than the Hulk at controlling her temper even before she became She-Hulk. 

1. She tries to punch people catcalling her into a building where people she likes live. These extreme violence and willingness to mass murder people contrasts with the Hulk, who even when chased by soldiers or lied to or attacked sought to flee or avoid violence when possible. 

2. She caused collateral damage and attacked a team mate when threatened with caging, just like the Hulk who did so when Shield threatened to cage him. She didn't need to be mind controlled or manipulated by Loki. 

3. She steals Bruce Banner's car and drives him over and smashes up his bar while fully conscious, which is a casual violence that the Hulk doesn't do.

Anyway, as we have seen, the Hulk is petty, easily does violence to team mates, and does lots of collateral damage, especially when mind controlled. Jennifer Walters is petty, easily does violence to team mates and random annoying people, and doesn't need mind control to attack her allies. As such, she has worse anger issues than the Hulk, and is lucky she wasn't faced with as many anger inducing situations as he was. Her self control is pathetic and weaker than most reasonable human beings. 

Note, this isn't to say that women in general are more emotional. Most women I know have good emotional control, and are able to avoid driving cars over people or punching people who verbally harass them. Jennifer Walters is just pretty bad at it herself. 

Arguments that persuade me should rely on the MCU, I am aware the comics have different lore."

It's completely unsustainable and is causing massive damage to our seas and many fish and animal species that live in the ocean are struggling to survive.

Compounded with the current rate of climate change, well, there's a reason that scientists are saying humans are causing a mass extinction event.

Anyway onto my point. Overfishing is such a problem that I don't think there's any way you could support fishing for your own food or as a hobby in a sustainable way because of all the overfishing going on.

Another problem with fishing culture in the hobby world is that fishermen, especially spear fishermen, usually love to kill the biggest fish, squid, crab, lobster etc they find the larger specimens need to survive as they're usually the strongest of the species but they're always the most targeted.

Commercial fishing is of course it's own problem and a different beast to fishing for your own food as a hobby, I'm not saying they're the same but I just don't see how hobby fishing can be sustainable when the oceans are already literally being sucked up of everything within it.

EDIT

To be clear, I'm speaking specifically about ocean fishing.

EDIT 2

I'm going to have to dive into some research and statistics on the topic since a few people are claiming that hobby ocean fishing makes literally no impact on anything at all. But it'll have to be for tomorrow since it's late here."

Also english be not my first language so excuse my wording.


People are trying to compare the troubles of learning the Japanese Written Language(JWL) with those of English to justify the troubles of the (JWL).

Troubles of the japanese written language:

The main trouble is kanji

When you ask ""why not ditch kanji and just use kana?""  the reason given is mostly the following:

-Kanji is needed to tell where words start and where they end.

-Understandable, then why not use spaces + kana? 

To that the reason would be:

-There are too many similar sounding words that are also written exactly the same in kana.

-Context will solve this problem.

-No i dont think so...

-Cool. Then lets think about if this hazard of having multiple similar sounding and written words is at all comparable to the chore of having to learn about 2000 joyo kanji to be literate enough to read anything in japanese without having to look words up or having to skip them. Id rather confuse identical written words (that i can read because of kana) rather than not being able to even read them at all (because they are written in kanji).

There aren't  even comparable difficulties like these in the English written language. There is no word that a first grader would not be able to read at least half assed which you would not understand at least the 5th time he/she would try to read it.

In japanese if you dont know a kanji in a word, you don't know how to pronounce it nor what its vague meaning is (which could help to somewhat tell what the whole word means) ,meaning that you can not read the word....at all! This is something that is to be expected to happen... a lot! -- If taking into account the number of kanji you have to brute force into your brain.

How can people justify and compare these hazards with the ""difficulty"" of learning the different pronunciations of letters in english words? MY DUDE!? at least you can see and read those letters! And sometimes understand the word because of the etymology.

Lets say you read something and an unknown word shows up in front of you. This word is ""physiology""

would you rather pronounce the word ""physiology"" in english which you achieve by using the base knowledge of the english alphabet + the difficulty of pronunciating the somewhat not so common ""phy"" sound? 
or ...this: 生理
You can read this by applying the base knowledge of kana(which on its own is somewhat more difficult to attain than the 24 letters of the english alphabet) + remembering (IF you are familiar with the kanji) the kunyomi and onyomi of both kanji(which can be multiple) + guessing what combination of readings  the kanji use( onon,kunkun,kunon,onkun) or praying that its not ateji. The other way is just using the dictionary which for someone that is not used to doing that can be a whole another hell [ The use of them require radical or ( in the worst case) stroke order knowledge ]. This is assuming you have never seen the word 生理 and dont know what physiology means either.

Kanji pros:

-Kanji are pretty.
-Kanji work as abbreviators ( making a sentence much shorter)

But 

Kanji cons:

-They are many
-Each can have many different meanings
-Each can have many readings 
-1-10 % only depict what they mean
-Cant be read if not studied individually
-good luck finding them in the dictionary if you dont know the stroke order or its radicals.
-ateji
-Kanji radicals do only help so much to remember the readings or the meanings of kanji.(Inconsistency)

Im not saying that kanji is bad nor that i hate them. Im only saying that, maybe, by using only kana and spaces, literacy would be attained easier and faster."

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nahitqVViYM&amp;feature=emb_logo 

-Dimensional Travel. This is the most important of the Kool-Aid man's talents. This is what will allow him to come to us and destroy us once and for all. This talent is seen at 6:03 where he uses billboards to travel to a dimension where an intersection is actually a beach.

-Incredible strength. At 1:14, the Kool-Aid man is shown to be infinitely stronger than 6 people trying to beat him in tug-of-war. Not only is the Kool-Aid man not trying, he is actively distracted from the tug-of-war and easily wins without even noticing. He proceeds to drag these children through the mud, literally, showing complete apathy for the human condition. This makes him dangerous.

-Animal Communication and Potentially Mind Control. At 1:24 the Kool-Aid man is seen summoning several owls to him seemingly out of nowhere. Not only that, but he does this in the broad day light with a nocturnal animal. He can override the general thought processes of animals.

-Driving. At 2:10 a girl asks the Kool-Aid man if he can drive. He can.

-Goalie. At 2:32 The Kool-Aid man is demonstrated to be an adept soccer goalie due to his jar's handle.

-Enemy of the state. The Kool-Aid man is not afraid of the state and is shown assaulting police officers at 4:40. This likely means the Kool-Aid man doesn't pay state or federal taxes and thus will be richer than us, his opponents.

-Alchemy. At 5:00 The Kool-Aid man is demonstrated to create a Kool-Aid that is ""icey-cool"" but without ice. Only powerful alchemy can create something like this.

-Rodeo. At 5:29 The Kool-Aid man is shown beating Soda, his greatest foe, at a mechanical bull Rodeo. This means we cannot use angry cows against him in the battles to come.

-Shapeshifting. Right before his dimensional travel at 6:00 the Kool-Aid man transforms from a billboard into our standard view of the Kool-Aid man.

-Pulverization. At 6:30 the Kool-Aid man is shown pulverizing a child out of existence by shape shifting into her hat.

-Indestructability. This one is the most classic example of the Kool-Aid man. Walls do not stop such a being. His jar has never broken in spite of intensive strain.

Why is this important? You might be asking yourself, the truth of the matter is that, if the Kool-aid man has these abilities, we need to be ready and able to destroy him should he come to our world. To do this we need to know whether he is, in fact, the Kool-Aid or the jar. This brings to light the true importance of this question and why it cannot be handled in such a light manner.  The world seems to think this is just some minor joke. The Kool-Aid man is no joke. He is an eldritch being that can and will destroy humanity if he comes to us. From what ive seen and heard, the most common opinion is that of the Kool-Aid man being the jar and not his liquid. That is why I feel it is my duty to spread the truth of the fact that the Kool-Aid man is, in fact, the liquid and not the jar.


I shall draw my evidence from the most readily available collection of Kool-Aid canon, see the commercials above. We begin at the beginning. In this ad, the Kool-Aid man refers to the jar as his own head. Within most anatomy, particularly anatomy that has similar biology to the Kool-Aid man has the brain of said species wrapped within the brain. This obviously clues us into the fact that what is contained within the Kool-Aid man's jar is in fact his brain and therefore his consciousness not the jar. Similarly at 0:20 we can see that as the Kool-Aid man dances at the middle school dance there is a brief frame where the Kool-Aid man's eyebrow exceeds the limits of the liquid contained within him. This gives us verifiable proof that the facial features which, again, are primarily limited to the external head of beings sharing his anatomy, is in fact part of the jar and not the liquid. This furthers our idea the the Kool-Aid man's brain is contained within the liquid. Furthermore, we can also observe at 4:55 as the Kool-Aid man eats spicy salsa at the supermarket his stomach turns on fire. It is important to note that it is, in fact, the liquid that sets on fire and not the jar. This further lends to the argument that the liquid is his internal organs and thus likely contains his brain and therefore consciousness. I, of course, saved the most convincing evidence for the conclusion. At 5:58 we can see the Kool-Aid man demonstrate one of his most dangerous powers: shapeshifting. He transforms from a billboard into the Kool-Aid man and then proceeds to travel dimensions. The true take away from this is the Kool-Aid man's true form which can be seen prior to his transformation. As a billboard he operates solely as the red liquid inside of him. Only after does he add the jar to his appearance. This proves, what I believe to be, unequivocally that the jar is actually a distraction, a mislead to throw us off when he eventually travels to our dimension. These are only a fraction of the Kool-Aid man's powers, other commercials depict him just as or even more powerful. We must ensure that when the time comes we are ready to destroy this liquid and not fall for the mistakes of the dimensions ahead of us who have likely fallen victim to the almighty power of the Kool-Aid man and his false jar."

Theres no way to avoid it. Most environmentaly friendly solutions to our lifestyle only focus on reducing the damage to the planet, not reversing it. There are a finite amount of resources on the planet. Our way or life, everything we know is based on consuming more resources than the planet hosts.

Imagine we reduced the carbon emissions and waste of the average person by 50%. That sounds incredible, right? But what use is that if the population increases by 50% in the future - which it will. Overpopulation is always the elephant in the room when climate change is discussed because there is no ethical way of getting round this.

Its cruel to keep a 110 year old patient alive with constant painkillers and treatment, just let them pass, don't prolong the inevitable. This is what we should do with our species. Just enjoy what you enjoy, consume all the resources you want, and before we know it we will be gone and the planet will belong to the fungi and flora. Life will go on, but we will not he there and that's fine.

All climate change activists are doing is delaying the inevitable.

0,2022-08-23,"CMV: If you can't afford to/won't tip your server at a restaurant, then you shouldn't go out to eat.",u/prinjesss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ww8w6m/cmv_if_you_cant_afford_towont_tip_your_server_at/,changemyview,"(this pertains to places with a tipping system)

Where I live, servers get paid $2.13/hour, so they rely heavily on customers’ tips. I think most people here who dine out already know this and leave a tip. But there are those rare times when customers would not leave any tip. This is a great waste of time for a server as whatever they did during the time the customer was dining was basically for no money. There are times when even amazing service will not be tipped simply because the customers are cheap or can’t afford to spend the extra money on tip. I’m not talking about instances where a customer has a horrible experience and doesn’t leave a tip. I’m talking about the times when service goes as expected with no issues and the customer doesn’t leave a tip.

I understand that tips are not a requirement but isn’t it like an unwritten rule? I like going to restaurants because I get to try different foods and I don’t have to cook, clean, etc. The restaurant staff does all of that for me and I believe I should tip them for their service. It’s very convenient and I get to enjoy a meal without having to worry about any of those things.

I realize it's extreme to say some people shouldn't go out to eat, especially if the reason is because they won't do something that isn't even mandatory. But, I believe that going out to eat at a restaurant comes with costs and tipping is one of them. If someone doesn't want to do that, then they can cook themselves a nice meal at home, instead of expecting to get serviced at a restaurant for free at the expense of the server. Please change my view, though."

0,2022-08-24,CMV:- Rationality leads to complete suspension of knowledge.(David Hume),u/AUMOM108,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wwc3vk/cmv_rationality_leads_to_complete_suspension_of/,changemyview,"This might just be my favorite argument ever, its just so unbelievably clever and quite possibly the argument that is most likely to lead to depression. This is coming from someone who has been a moral anti-realist(throughout my life thus far) despite believing in a God early on in my life. 

Here is how the orignal argument goes. 

No thing can be known with absolute certanity(All knowledge is probability) So to ensure that we increase our probability of being correct we should double-check, triple-check, ask someone else to check, etc('Horizontal'checking). 

The other kind of checking is 'Vertical' where we judge our ability to make judgements about our initial proposition, for eg one if one is tired they are less likely to be correct than if they weren't. 

But that isn't where we should stop, we should further judge our ability to judge our ability. 

This leads to an infinite regress and hence complete abandonment of any certanity. 

My interpretation if this initially was that all probabilities collapse to 0 since an infinite multiplication of non 1 probabilities would lead to 0 probability. To the best of my understanding Hume's point isn't this but that even something like the 4th level of judgement in itself is so unintuitive and near impossible to comprehend(to me I can't even comprehend the 3rd level). Hence there exists a massive amount of uncertanity about essentially all our beliefs. 

The only valid objection to this argument wod be to flip the orignal premise to say that that in itself can't be true based on the conclusion(cause no thing including P1 can't be known with absolute certanity). 

To defeat this objection I changed the orignal premise to 'Almost all things can't be known with absolute certanity' hence the conclusion is 'Almost all things are known with a probability of 0', which maybe slightly weaker but it essentially leads to the same 'wasteland'. 

For those of you who would say that accepting that the updated premise as one of those few things which isn't known with absolute certanity is a tough pill to swallow. Which whilst it may strike as a good defence to some feels like a complete missing the point of the argument. 

Even if one replaces 'Almost everything' with any individual premise(literally anyone you choose) would have probability 0 or basically 0. So I don't think there is any escaping this argument. 

Hume's own response to this was that whilst the argument is rationally perfectly sound judging at the 6th level is just so unintuitive and unnatural that it can't be done . There is a very good reason why we have evolved the way we have. 

This alongside Plantinga's EAAN (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism#:~:text=Plantinga%20argues%20that%20combining%20naturalism,that%20several%20thinkers%2C%20including%20C.%20S.) Lead to complete blackholes even for a theist.


Honestly apart from Descartes' 'Something thinking exists' I can't think of any statenent with any certanity. This to me leads to a complete rational blackhole where the only way out to just swallow the pill and say we must only consider the first 2 levels of judgement(which in itself is an irrational thing to do) to even maintain any form of rational argumentation. 

Are there any other statements like Descartes' which can be known with absolute certainity please do let me know,  I would love to have more of it


Also people who base their ideas on faith don't get a free pass with this arguments considering that they are in the same boat."

On Instagram and Facebook themselves, it doesn’t seem like he ever broke any community guidelines directly.

I agree that a lot of his content can be seen as misogynistic, but not to the extent to warrant a ban imo.

All in all, as someone who has not followed this man past whatever the algorithm shows me, I am failing to see why he got banned and why people are rejoicing in it. CMV!

Edit: I gave a delta to someone who provided an article that expounded on his misogyny. The other criminal accusations that people are touting have yet to be cited and backed up. I see that it isn’t the misogyny alone that warrants the ban, but the misogyny coupled with the massive platform that Mr. Tate has."

I believe that the cure for Incels is to get a prostitute or go outside, to my understanding Incels main problem is that they want sex, but can't get it. Hiring a prosititute allows them to have sex, achieving their goal in the process. If it's attachment they need then the solution is to go outside to various meetups their interests. If they like Yu-Gi-Oh then they could go to a Yu-Gi-Oh meetup, if they like baking they could go to a baking meetup, if they like Pokemon then they could go to a Pokemon meetup, you get the point. This will allow them to more easily make friends ad fix their social issues. I believe that these 2 things will help Incels cure themselves and become normal, non-hateful members of society. CMV!

EDIT: I've changed my view on the prosititute part as it's been pointed out that for some bizzare reason they ""don't count"" to incels, I maintain that going outside would help greatly though.

Take ""A Clockwork Orange"" for example. Almost every remarkable scene would just be bland if it was just written down and told to you, in comparison to the movie. Movies have soundtracks, actors can have a huge impact, the sounds, the visual effects, the cinematography, what camera the director is using, they can all add up to an unforgettable experience. 

Some sequences are just burned into my brain, even with books I've read and enjoyed, I can never recall a specific moment that really impressed me and left me in awe, while there are many of those in movies I've watched (and I haven't even watched that many movies.).

Yes, books are very detailed compared to movies, which are usually approximately three hours long, but come on, there are some things that a medium as limited as books just can't do well. If End of Evangelion was a book, it wouldn't be amazing at all, so much of what makes that movie an incredible experience (and a perfect movie in my opinion) is the soundtrack, the cinematography and the sound design. A scene like the third impact would be nowhere as impactful and awe-inspiring if you read it thoroughly described in words.

Overall, I think if you compare a brilliant book to a brilliant movie, the movie will always be more memorable and impactful."

I find these most often in older or smaller diner type facilities or gas stations, there is typically a lock on the door, and they are often paired, one for either sex. I think this is a pointless exercise, and can detract from an already messy discussion regarding bathrooms. I am not here to discuss my thoughts on the bathrooms issue as a whole, but only these single-occupant bathrooms.

To start, having 2 single occupant bathrooms as a public facility is already dicey, especially if you have decent foot traffic. However, further restricting access to either bathroom can lead to situations in which one has a line to use, and the other is being unused. Having been in this situation myself, when I suggested we start using the other bathroom to speed things along, I got looked at like I was an alien, and nobody wanted to do it. It was like a stigma built into the social fabric of most people that you shouldn't use the bathroom for the opposite sex under any circumstance. Simply removing the signs would have improved this condition.

Next point, I understand there are sex specific hygiene instruments in some public bathrooms. In the event that those bathrooms become unisex, put them in both, if they need to be there. I find it absolutely insane some men refuse to get hygiene products for their girlfriend/wife, and while I doubt this would eliminate the stigma of being exposed to these products, it could be a change in a positive direction. I don't know, leave that evaluation to the scientists. And if your wife needs tampons, go pick them up.

The final point I can think of is a concern that ""Oh but if the men's line is long, and a woman needs to go, she shouldn't have to wait."" or vice versa. I don't care. First come, first served, same as it is in virtually every other part of the world. The number of problems resolved by switching both bathrooms to unisex outweigh any antiquated sex specific concern, as far as I am concerned.

EDITED TO ADD:
A common talking point I see brought up is in regard to cleanliness. I didn't initially think this would be something I had to address, but I have so many times now I felt it important to add here.

Both sexes have complaints about the other with regard to cleanliness. Both hold valid points, and I don't think one must necessarily outweigh the other. However I don't believe this to be an obstruction to my view because I believe that management should be more responsible and pro-active about cleaning public restrooms. I also think it is much easier for an employee of any sex to go clean the unisex bathroom than it is to make an employee of one sex clean the bathroom of the other sex.

Edit 2: I am about to go to bed, so I won't be able to respond for a few hours. I genuinely appreciate everyone who has jumped in on the conversation, and never expected this post to get this big. I expected like 20 upvotes and 2 comments. I will be back and I genuinely want to try to get to everyone who has commented. Thank you guys so much for this conversation, it has filled me with happiness, anger, shock, and other emotions. I love you all."

People with NDE, or clinically dead, paranormal experiences that brought comfort, or at least the thought that there’s something next. But recently I’ve had covid and after being negative a very bad unknown illness post covid I’m suffering from, so it’s prompted a lot of anxiety essentially “what if I die”

Now to my theory. One repeating fact that sticks with me is the energy in the universe is neither created or destroyed, implying it’s constant

My biggest questions about death come from other creatures. What about the birds, the bugs, my pets, fish, etc. but also about those who suffer as children, are murdered, kidnapped, etc. i don’t understand why those people suffer in ways I don’t, I don’t understand why bugs live such different lives and no one seems to think about what happens to them after death. 

With all this being said, my theory is that every living creature is energy in some regard. When we die as humans, our brains function in a way to make death a peaceful experience (what I gathered from reading NDE stories), however, afterwards our energy is simply reconstitutes into other living things. Bugs, animals, maybe another human, and it’s essentially random. And life goes on forever. This may not be the right answer, but if true it would address questions as to “why did my baby die seemingly healthy” “what happens to animals/bugs” “why is there so much suffering”

I understand that we’ll never know this answer, and I’m doing myself harm by thinking so much, but I hope somebody can bring me comfort

EDIT: Two facts that I try to go back to that bring minor comfort are that the universe is constantly expanding, maybe that’s a hint there’s something more for all of us?

Also we don’t and never will know “why” life exists, which implies partially that there’s something more than what we currently experience. But that almost goes in line with my overall theory ."
0,2022-08-24,CMV: Amputations should be an option for criminal sentencing,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wwrfm8/cmv_amputations_should_be_an_option_for_criminal/,changemyview,"Essentially, my logic goes like this.

The death penalty is fine in my opinion, but not in any way we implement it. Innocent people being killed is not worth the benefits.

Contrarily, taking a ""soft approach"" to crime sounds great, except many people re offend, and have proclivities that endanger society for ever.

Therefore, we should consider amputations to physically  curtail a criminal. Pedophile? Genitalia, arms. Murderer? Arms, legs. Also open to neurosurgery, but again that is dependant on the crime.

This feels logical to me, albeit fucked up, as it almost completely eliminates the possibility of re-offence, doesn't have the possibility of accidental killing, and is a greatly less burdensome for society.

Nobody can know the future perfectly, but I feel like if you're playing the odds, the best outcomes for Russia all branch off from first getting peace with Ukraine.  If peace means returning to the 2014 borders or even completely abandoning Ukraine, I feel like the possibilities for Russia are better in those cases than through continued war.

EDIT: Minor clarification, as others have pointed out, Putin and those in charge of Russia are not the same as Russia.  I intentionally didn't include Putin in this because I want to see if anyone wants to CMV and say that what is happening in this war with Ukraine right now is flatly in Russia's best interest.  This can include Putin because he is part of Russia, but I want to know if anyone believes that Russia as a country is better off by continuing this war or if my view that they should secure peace ASAP is the best path for them."
1,2022-08-24,CMV: Car dependent infrastructure is the best suited form of infrastructure for the United States,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wws7h3/cmv_car_dependent_infrastructure_is_the_best/,changemyview,"I’ve been seeing a lot of leekage from communities such as r/fuckcars and r/notjustbikes who seem to think that removing car based infrastructure in the US and replacing with public transport is a good idea. People over there want to “make the US like Europe”. They don’t realize that people over here like car based infrastructure, because it suits the wants of people over here, particularly in housing. They also don’t realize that American and European identity and culture is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

Many want to apply European mixed use(dense apartment housing), building usage, particularly housing. They believe that it will facilitate better public transport, and reduce the dependency on cars.

My first point is that America is a big country, and many US states are bigger than EU nations. This inherently makes public transport harder. This is a point that does not include consumer preference. America is much less homogeneous than Europe which can lead to inner struggles in public transport, for example, US public transport is riddled with crime in major metros. So most, even if available will not use PT because it is not safe.

Secondly, Americans *prefer* to live further from each other. Multiple studies show that Americans prefer to drive more/live further from amenities, if it means a bigger house. Americans prefer and thus build more single family detached homes. It is not toxic or bad, it is what the American consumer prefers. Europeans may prefer dense apartments, with close amenities, while lacking the space and privacy of a home, Americans generally have the polar opposite viewpoint.

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/26/more-americans-now-say-they-prefer-a-community-with-big-houses-even-if-local-amenities-are-farther-away/

Americans priorities and preferences are different than Europeans, and that is OK. The “car dependent suburbia” is simply a flashing of this reality, low density SFH and public transport do not mix, well at all. Cars must be used, as it is the only viable option that works well in a low/mid density environment. Americans also enjoy on average, a smaller commute time than Europeans despite this.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/521886/travel-time-spent-work-study-countries/

America is incredibly diverse too, and the notion that one cannot live in an area in the US where you can walk is simply untrue. Even from a cost perspective, High density neighborhoods saw the least appreciation in the record 2-year real estate run.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/census-2021-population-growth.html

If Americans Prefer SFH, and that’s what the market demands, because that’s what the consumer wants, why build what they don’t want? American and in general, European viewpoints and cultures are different, so it’s obvious parts of society are different. If Americans have these preferences, basing infrastructure around these preferences, I.e. cars, space, is a good thing, not a bad thing."

They can gerrymander all they want and no one could (legally) stop them.

40,2022-08-24,CMV: Student loan forgiveness is a bad idea,u/johnnychan81,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wwuj2p/cmv_student_loan_forgiveness_is_a_bad_idea/,changemyview,"About 40 million Americans are going to get $10K of debt forgiven at a cost of $400 billion.  But obviously the government doesn't just have $400 billion lying around so it will be paid for by Americans either in inflation or in additional taxes.  So the cost to every American will be about $1,500

So you have two groups of people

1.  About 300 million Americans who don't qualify who will pay about $1,500 each to cover this

2.  About 40 million Americans who do qualify who will benefit by $8,500 (10K minus the $1,500 they will have to pay in either taxes or inflation)

(I am using very round numbers here and obviously understand that the $1,500 burden will not be distributed exactly evenly.  Some will pay more and some less)

Most redditors belong to group #2 so of course they are happy that they just for $8,500 from the government.

But in general I don't believe that taking money from one group of Americans and giving it to a different group of Americans is good fiscal policy when done in such an arbitrary manner.  

I would be more convinced if the group paying in was mainly rich and the group benefiting was mainly poor but that's not how this is going to be distributed.  There are many blue collar workers who do not have college degrees who will feel the pain of the $1,500 cost and there are many people with student loan debt who have college degrees and likely will not need the $8,500 benefit.  

Anecdotally I know people who don't qualify who are considerably worse off financially than people who do qualify.  Why is it fair that money should be taken from those people without college degrees who are struggling?"

0,2022-08-24,CMV: there is no moral or legal reason in the current system of voting that interested youth should not be able to vote.,u/doge_gobrrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wwvdai/cmv_there_is_no_moral_or_legal_reason_in_the/,changemyview,"ok first of all I know this has probably been posted here but I think I have some new arguements and counters to bring to the table.

the 5 biggest arguments I have seen against this are:

1. taxes
2. parental influence
3. you will regret who you voted for
4. bad policy votes
5. meme candidates
6. arguments that boil down to I don't like who and what they would vote for(not going to discuss these for obvious reasons)

first let's address taxes:

youth should not be able vote if they don't pay taxes

legally absolutely

morally: it's complicated but for the most part no they should be able to vote if taxes is the only reason.

so this becomes a question of if youth pay taxes. do they? yes they do and here is how. first the obvious ones if they buy anything they still pay taxes ie stuff from the hardware store. next income tax this is solved through a quick google search: yes if you are under age 65 and make above 12,550 dollars a year then you have to pay income tax. well what about property tax you say? that's also simple youth do pay property taxes it's just uncommon for them to have property(land) independent of their parents. it's just uncommon for youth to pay large quantities of taxes simply due to lack of market access. lack of market access is not a reason to deny voting rights.

next parental influence and this one is simple:

parents will have an influence on their child on what and who they vote for absolutely. first of all this effect is simply delayed in our current system not prevented(they reach 18 and vote probably similar to their parents). secondly parents punishing their kids for not voting who they want is solved by lying to your parents about who you voted for and then if it goes beyond that ie parents opening their kids ballots there is already a system to deal with that as the act of opening somebody else's ballot or coercing them to vote a certain way is illegal. third influence of outside parties is already present in the current voting system ie your friends and families influencing your vote. fourth you really think teens will automatically follow their parents views?  just think about that for a second. are teens views always the same as their parents?

you will regret who and what you voted for:

yes and this is called a changing you view about the world and is perfectly accepted in the current voting system.

bad policy votes:

this is already permitted in the current system as it's not the correct choice that wins it's the popular choice.

meme candidates:

already is a thing see brady olson aka deez nutz

&amp;#x200B;

lastly what about the new minimum age? 16

\~\~well it's pretty simple if you are interested in voting then you should be allowed(assuming no felony convictions) as all of the above applies to all ages even if a 3 year old paying income taxes is unlikely.

\~\~so how exactly would you know if that 3 year old wants to vote

\~\~well it's pretty darn simple they send a letter that contains legible handwriting or type with correct spelling and acceptable grammar. with their name and address expressing the desire to vote and at all relevant elections they will be sent a ballot. this indirectly soft limits age by intellectual development aside from the fact that a 3 year old is unlikely to express interest in voting."

People go crazy over TikTok’s (Chinese company) success and market penetration, not to mention its ability to spy on you. “OMG, China created TikTok, what’s next?!?!?” It’s one app.  America has created many other top international apps and websites, and if we continue to foster innovation in Silicon Valley, we will create many more. 

That’s not to say that our government shouldn’t have a role. I just don’t think we need the government to be pulling the strings and dictating the direction of each industry. It just has to do a better job of promoting competition and ensuring our economy is attractive to investors. Furthermore, the government can make it easier for smart people across the globe to move here (if interested) to participate in our economy. 

Finally, we don’t beat China by building a larger, more authoritarian government. We beat them by building a more free and fair society. There’s a lot of work to do in that regard. But if it happens, the country will continue to be a destination for those who want a better life. And as we have seen, many of those people are the ones who have contributed the most to our economy."

Disclaimer:
Now, I know that this is full of americans and from what I understand you no longer use the other transexual because somehow people were thinking it was a sexual orientation thing.
Well, where I come from Transexual is someone who has changed their physical form while Transgender is simply someone with gender dysphoria. Hence, for example a ""Traveco"" is a man that has fake tits and a fake vagina, while a ""Lala"" is just a man that dress like a woman but has all the manly atributes like wide shoulders and beard. You americans should see it like butterflies, the larva is the same animal, but after she comes out of the cocoon, its not the same thing as it was before, and it would be stupid to call larva to a butterflie or butterfly to a larva, so, having two words makes sense.
Thus, Transexual and Transgender are diferent things becose one transcends the traditional concept of gender and the other the traditional concept of sex.

The Logic:
No wanting to date someone for being trans is transphobic, this because the trans identity is a factor of discrimination, and that's constitutes a phobia. In my oponion if somebody hasnt transfigured then such discrimination is condemable because it is hatefull. I think it is hatefull because a human is being rejected by a identity they didnt choose, it is the same as being gay or african, its an involuntary identity, so people should be judged by things outside their control.

But if its about not wanting to date somebody that has transmutated their genitals or went to the knife to change their body, then its aceptable, this because the discrimination is know based on a physical voluntary identity.
One can say that its still and identity being discriminated wich is true and is transphobia. But similar situations happen in other context. For example, one could say they dont want to date someone that has fake tits, someone with short hair or someone with tattoos, and this is in fact discrimination, but I dont think its problematic because its just preferences.

Not finding someone atractive because of physical atributes like skin, hair or eye colour can be racist, but its aceptable. What is not is not wanting to date a race or a cultural group because of that identity. If someone says they dont like fair skin or redheads, its not the same as saying they dont like Europeans. One can dislike a skin tone and befriend people from that skin tone. Beauty and morality are different

TLDR:
Its aceptable to not wanting to date someone that has transitioned because someone may like only natal woman or natal man, and because transition is voluntary.
Its unaceptable to not wanting to date someone that has gender dysphoria and no operation because its discrimination of something not voluntary 

This is just my opinion, and because I think its somewhat contradicted to say some transphobia is worse and the other is less bad can be contradictory, thus, I want you try to change mind, please.

My definition of fiscal conservatism is that the government will have minimal regulation on the economy, allowing for the principles of a capitalist market to act autonomously. 


I have three primary problems with this:

-proliferation of monopolies and anti-competitive business practices

-the power vacuum of government being overcome by large companies and interest groups

-companies answer to shareholders and don’t have incentives to serve the public


In regards to monopolies and trusts, I have three primary examples. Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, and Facebook. All three of these companies are/were incredibly powerful companies that (without government intervention) harmed the American economy through price fixing and shutting out smaller companies. AT&amp;T created a standstill in the technological advancements within the telecommunications sector, standard oil price fixed and exploited workers, and Facebook has promoted extreme ideologies because of the “clicks” rather than actually promoting the less eye catching moderate perspectives. Without strong government intervention (AT&amp;T and Standard Oil) the economy would be far worse off.

Power vacuums are a reality in a libertarian world. To keep it brief, I would prefer control to be in the hands of democratically elected officials as opposed to capitals of industry, who’s priority is only shareholders. If we take away the power of government, the power vacuum will logically fall into the hands of the ultra rich.

Lastly, the ethics of companies is not aligned with the people. Why should it be? there responsibly is to shareholders and those who invested in the company. This means that the environment, accessibility to basic necessities, and other important things not provided by a free market are left by the way side. Creating incentives to meet these demands cannot be created in a free market alone.

Hopefully this made sense"

Traditionally, lawyers have taken on some of these cases on behalf of indigent clients. However, until recently, this was an entirely voluntary prospect. Now, jurisdictions are mandating it.

I am not opposed to *pro bono* work. Quite the opposite, in fact. I have donated a lot of my time over the years, and think that more lawyers should try to cover the gap in legal services. However, I do not believe that this obligation should be limited to lawyers. Why are doctors not required to spend a certain number of hours every year working at free clinics? Why are plumbers not required to spend a certain number of hours working for low-income housing projects per year? Why are lawyers the only profession (that I am aware of) that is required by law to do charity work?

A few things could change my view here. You could point out something unique about the legal profession that creates an obligation that does not apply to any other profession. The fact that lawyers have traditionally performed free services is not sufficient in this regard. You could point out some other careers that have mandatory *pro bono* requirements. Or, you could convince me that these mandatory *pro bono* laws should not exist.

Edit to add: A lot of people are getting hyper-fixated on the ""requirement"" aspect of this CMV. Lawyers have traditionally been *expected* to provide free legal services. I want to know why that expectation doesn't apply to other professions."

0,2022-08-25,CMV: The legal system should work slightly differently for sexual assault.,u/Appletarted1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wxhiv9/cmv_the_legal_system_should_work_slightly/,changemyview,"Not entirely differently. But I've always found it an extremely coarse and unforgiving process to someone who could be the victim of the most serious and character destroying crime besides murder. And it could be destroying for anyone on the receiving end of an untrue accusation.

TLDR: My reasoning is down below but it should be legally mandatory to have an investigation, statement and arrest on the first call. The name of the accused should not be released anywhere publicly, nor should the nature of their arrest. In court, the victim and the perpetrator should give their testimony, written with their live written responses to questions from their lawyer. It should be without appearance to court and without in person cross examination from either side. Oaths will be taken written. If either side drafts up issues with the person's testimony or evidence, it should be communicated by that side's lawyer, alone and not by the opposing side. The response should come again in writing, live. This would make the whole process a lot less risky for both sides and allow the law to do its job without the extralegal consequences on the careers or character of either side. Given that it's a very emotionally damaging crime, this protects women from the veritable grinder of cross examination where they will be emotionally trampled in a room full of spectators and right in front of their attacker. They will try to discredit her, which is a must, but not necessary to be receiving as an emotional stressor. This solution will also better protect the rights of both parties to the greatest extent possible 

Part 1: The accusation.

If you were to make a criminal accusation, then the first step is that the police have to believe you and press charges and make an arrest. From this point they can essentially decide whether you're crime happened or not without any accountability to the broader system of law. This is absolutely reasonable in any other crime because there's a level of accounting to see that an incident happened. 

With murder, a person is dead. Home robbery has tampered locks, broken property, security cameras sometimes and stolen property. All you have with a rape is a crying woman, child or man who can either be convincing or not. They may OR may not have physical marks or drugs in their body. There is quite often no external evidence to see that the crime happened. Due to the nature of this crime, I believe it should be legally mandatory upon receiving the call to have a proper investigation, testimony and arrest.

Part 2: The court.

It shouldn't be a surprise that someone who has just been victimized to the greatest degree imaginable will be dissuaded from anything that might put them under a spotlight and discredit them publicly. It also shouldn't be that hard to think about the destruction that an accusation alone, without evidence can cause to a person's livelihood. Yet we pretend that it's legally mandatory to put someone through all this because we hold a rather simple view that the legal system should be transparent to anyone, anywhere. That simple view is appropriate for pretty much any crime, except sexual assault where the damage and threat of that exposure is potentially preventing justice from happening at all.

The court should follow the same basic format as other crimes, have the same standards of evidence for conviction and have the same resources available. The only real difference is that there should be filters to protect the identity and emotional state of both parties, such that it is substantially less risky for the law to do its job and protect people as broadly as it pretends to now. I explained how this part would work in the TLDR, but I also believe that the results of a guilty verdict should be then made public and all else should remain private.

To change my mind, you will need to prove that this idea, in whole or in part, makes the general justice system worse, or violates rights that are currently held in place by the standard process, net. That is to say that the balance of rights must be worse in my example than it is currently. I know the idea is not perfect, so that will not change my mind. It simply has to be better than what we've got due to the complex nature of this crime. Thanks for your time."

**premise and clarification:** so when i say ""peeing in the shower"" it assumes the following, you are already in the shower for the purpose of having a shower, or just about to. you pee while the water is running. choosing to *not* pee in the shower means you are having a shower, you get out to pee in the toilet and then flush.

**why its a good thing:** you dont spend the water flushing the toilet, and you dont spend extra time/inconvinence getting out the shower to pee in the toilet. i'll admit the convinence point is a bit more subjective

**why it isn't gross**: I dont really believe it is ""gross"" or unsanitary. the water is running over you, any pee you get on yourself (i guess that would apply to you more if you have a vagina) is immedietly washed away and flushed through your plumbing.

**why i want my view changed and what would change it:** I'll say that more people are ""shower pee"" supporters than not, that being said there are a sizeable amount of people that simply view it as gross or unsanitary. i'll consider my view changed if i can see a convincing argument that it is gross that i cant already see, or some other ""disadvantage"" to peeing in the shower that means its better to get out and go in the toilet."

Let’s call this group of people with a high need in this - culty.

People who tend to believe whatever they are told to believe used to belong to churches or other religious organizations. This satisfied the need in them to follow a leader and believe whatever their group decided was the right thing to believe. Many believed themselves to be not only special – but chosen. As long as they choose a mainstream group, we didn’t notice them as culty.  

People who are culty but do not believe in God and who do not go to church every week no longer have this outlet to satisfy their need to feel more righteous than others. They need a way to feel they are good people because they hold the Right beliefs.  

Too many people now satisfy this need within their identification as a member of their chosen political party.  

We can identify these people by our ability to correctly predict how they will react to anything their party does. They appear to use no critical thought and mindlessly decide that an action is good or bad solely on what party leadership has decided. They also appear to think that as long as they choose a mainstream party, they don’t appear to be culty. But we can learn to recognize them.  

When fewer members of a political party are willing to use critical thought, the group as a whole appears to value rationality less and less. My view is that it would be a good thing to recognize and avoid culty people in politics and value more highly people who use their brains and think for themselves. Learn to recognize culty people even if their beliefs system at first glance appears to be mainstream. They are perverting our system."

It is highlighting flaws in the current system that are bad for all parties (taxpayers' benefit office and benefit recipients.) 

What prompted this post is a few real life examples I have encountered this week. I'm aware that anecdote does not tell the whole systems story' but it does illustrate the issues people encounter. 

I have a woman volunteer with me who is mildly autistic and suffers from severe anxiety' panic attacks etc. Volunteering has been incredibly beneficial for her mental health and social skills. However' it means she received less in benefits as she is 'capable' of work. She receives normal universal credit plus £100pcm in PIP' so total approx £420 pcm. She has to attend fortnightly jobseekers meetings despite having never worked full time in her life (28yo.) She lives with parents so no housing costs.  Disposable income £420pcm. There is a financial incentive for her to not volunteer' but this would be detrimental to her health. 

A man I live with has just successfully claimed for PIP to the total of £800pcm' plus another benefit instead of UC which is approx £260 a fortnight. So he receives over £1300 pcm. While he has some knee problems he is mentally and physically capable of working but chooses not to' if he did voluntary work he would not have been awarded as much as he would be deemed fit to work.

So he does no volunteering and rarely leaves the house' something he says himself is detrimental to his mental health. In a physical sense' he is obese and so receives free gym membership due to poor physical health. While I support that in trying to address his weight before it causes more issues (like his knees)' if he lost enough weight he would lose his gym membership. He only has to spend £80pcm on rent and the rest is covered by housing benefit. No utility bills. Disposable income £1200pcm' plus free bus use and gym membership. If he worked full time on minimum wage he would be far less well off' he is incentivised to stay in his current situation. Bad for his health and bad for taxpayers. Does not have to attend benefits meetings. 

Another man I know was just sacked from a full time position. He earned £1500pcm' will now just receive universal credit of £335pcm. This man has crohns disease' is severely overweight' is routinely in hospital and still recovering from the long term effects of a bone disease which left him bed ridden for a year around 3 years ago. He has by far the worst physical health of the three. When working he had to pay £800pcm rent plus usual bills' I presume housing benefit will step in now he is unemployed. It was good for his physical and mental health to be out working full time. Disposable income when working less than £500pcm' now unemployed he will not be covering his costs. 

He would be fiscally better off taking the same route as the first man. Even when working full time he had far less spending money. However doing that would be bad for his mental and physical wellbeing - he is financially incentivised to take a path that is bad for him and bad for taxpayers. 

There are several issues with the above. 

1) The first man is better off than lots of people working full time' whose tax pays for him' this is grossly unfair. 
2) The woman and second man are effectively being punished for trying to improve their health and integrate into society. They should be rewarded for this not punished. 
3) Society is worse off for people being pushed out of society and onto long term benefits by the very system that is mean to do the opposite. 
4) New applicants are encouraged to make their situation worse - to make their mental and physical health worse - for financial rewards that may be beyond what they could achieve working full time. 

For me the solutions are as follows: 

1) Minimum wage needs to be raised. Yes inflation blah blah' people should have a significantly better lifestyle when working than when not. Not really the point of this post but relevant to the above issues. 
2) (main point) Benefits need to be paid on financial need rather than health issues. So if you can demonstrate that you are depressed and need counselling you claim for the cost of counselling. You do not (as presently) just get given money for being (or claiming to be- the current system encourages fraudulent claims) depressed. You must demonstrate what you need the money for and provide receipts. This ensures those who need help not only get it but actually spend it on what will help them. 
3) benefits income should be capped at below full time minimum wage. So you cannot receive more on benefits as an individual than you would earn doing 40 hours a week on minimum wage. This encourages people to work and engage in society' better for them and better for society. 
4) If you are receiving housing benefit and more than standard universal credit' your additional income counts against housing benefit and 50% is deducted accordingly. So if UC is £340 and you receive £600 then 50% of the additional £260 is 'clawed back' in housing costs - unless you provide ongoing receipts demonstrating the money has been spent on something necessary for your health. 
5) long term benefits recipients should only have to attend quarterly 


The only downsides I can see are:

People finding it 'demeaning' having to prove what they spend their benefits on. I don't really buy this - if you are being given additional free money for an explicit purpose/ issue then demonstrating you have spent it on that issue seems reasonable not demeaning? Open to being persuaded otherwise. 

Increased workload to the benefits office in auditing the extra proof required. This would partly be offset by reducing the number of pointless routine meetings where nothing has changed. The extra slack could be filled by employing more people - creating more jobs which would move some of those on standard UC into employment. May cost a little more (open to education on figures if anyone can) but will result in a service actually fulfilling its purpose to the benefit of current recipients. Seems a worthwhile trade. 

TLDR: Please CMV - why is it preferable to pay people for a health concern without evidence of what they spend it on' rather than paying for the services they actually use and need? Why should people be financially better off not working or volunteering when they are able to do so?"

I chose meth because, I thought it is an extreme example and would appear more provocative.


Reason: I believe that each individual is free to do as they please so long as they don't impede others' right to the same in a provable, ""non-vague"" manner.
The right to do any drug you chose lies under this umbrella.

some people might hear the first statement and say ""well, I have a right to safety from assault and/or any similar crime associated with meth induced psychosis""
According to this
          meth-related seizures occurred in every state in 2018 study, the Ten states with most meth related states are:

are: Michigan
 New York
  Indiana
 Illinois 
North Carolina 
California  
Pennsylvania 
 Tennessee 
Ohio and 
Florida 

These are also states with very lenient self defense laws

Michigan: http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(e0qj4lj4wut2blmu00usu2mz))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=mcl-780-972

Illinois: an exception,

North Carolina:

Florida:

So if you agree with the basic premise, and there's no issue of self defense, why should meth remain illegal?

Edit: u/Milskidasith has shown me im consistencies in my argument.
Which led me to the conclusion,

Meth Use shouldn't be allowed in most  contexts because it violates contracts implicit in participating in society that are incompatible with Meth use.

I do not believe social media should be treated as a public square, I will award those whose comments I read, deltas.

I’ve noticed more and more (especially on Reddit) deleted comments everywhere, communities shut down that are increasingly more tame (2balkan4you).

The more you censor these communities and ideas, the more you get them congregating in areas that are dense echo chambers and the less likely you can change these peoples minds with opposing beliefs.

I believe there are very few things that should allow for banning (these things are as I mentioned but also a few extra topics namely GROSS &amp; harmful misinformation; including saying covid vaccines scramble DNA but NOT including the earth was flat)

# Edit 2: Please read below!

This is entirely my fault (especially with the public square comment) and I should have been more specific. I am **not** advocating for a **complete ban on moderation**, I am simply looking for an argument why the current level of moderation happening is fine vs what I want which is less moderation (cases of legal precedent + extra topic or so such as gross misinformation).

If the nation believes that the best candidate for presidency is a person who has already served two terms. Then the nation should be allowed to vote for them. This is no different than how our legislative branch functions. If Senator X is the best representative for their state they can be elected to that position regardless of terms served.

Additionally, having a 4-5 term president could present many benefits to the nation. Consistency in policy and programs would really highlight initiatives and relations that are effective. Instead of the current practice of scraping  your presidential predecessor programs and starting over every 4 to 8 years. 

Left or Right...doesn't matter. As a nation, we should be allowed to vote for and elect a president that we feel will do the best job. Regardless of prior terms served.

Edit: 
I am not compelled by the arguments of tyranny and destruction being the result of repealing the 22nd amendment. As one user pointed out, this really only impacts a handful of living people. 

I am more drawn to the arguments that highlight why this unique provision is applied solely to the presidency and not the other branches of government.

If a Felon can run for president, why not a two term ex president.

Votes and the people's desires should be the only consideration.

People talk about alcohol or marijuana, but smoking will crater your lifespan. I know that ""mother knows best"" laws aren't the most popular nowadays, but there are a ton of stories about failed suicide attempts. As soon as someone jumped off a building or pulled the trigger, they instantly regretted it. Sometimes mother does know best. It's the same reason we don't let people participate in duels or take out predatory loans.

Does anyone actually smoke because they enjoy it? I bet if you asked smokers, ""Would you be happier today if someone had stopped you from smoking that first cigarette,"" they would overwhelmingly say yes. I know there are purists out there, but at the end of the day, I don't see the point in protecting freedom of choice if the choice is something 99% of people will regret and will kill them.

Banning won't stop everyone, but it will probably decrease the number of cigarettes by a lot. If it saves a ton of lives, it's worth it."

Everyone is born somewhere different, to different parents, with different values, parenting styles and effort put into parenting. Some people don't even have parents. So this already will mold a child into a very specific person, who has a very different personality to even his neighbors. Next, everyone has different experiences in life that make them. This can range from certain friendships, what they see on the internet, what troubles they were exposed to, their teachers, etc..
Because everyone has so many unique experiences that make them have very unique personalities, it is not fair to judge or blame people for having certain bad personality traits like laziness or a short temper. The only reason they have those traits is the environment that they were raised in. Some people were raised in environments that made it easier for them to be well behaving members of society, and others, the opposite. Why then do we judge people for what they do when they are not truly to blame? No one is raised the same and thus whenever someone misbehaves or underperforms, it is hardly their fault, and the people who behave and excel in whatever good thing they're excelling at just got lucky for being born into an environment that solidified them into the good people they are.

Edit: I am saying that we should not **blame** such people, not that such people are not nuisances, a danger, etc., simply that they are not to be blamed for having these characteristics."

I am 100% independent and I don't like Democratic Party as they too are inherently racist as well as the GOP but at least I can keep my IUD. I just read an NPR article on the Texas lawsuit of Kelley v. Becerra and how it possibly will be sent to the Supreme Court for a ruling. What the fuck is going on? Why are people trying to strip away preventive care for millions of people????

It is appalling to me how many people want to strip health care of others to get screened for cancers, prevent pregnancy, addiction services, and more. I believe people have lost their minds. People can legit not pay for their insulin to survive and are dying 😀.  Anti-HIV SCREENINGS???? Not to mention this will affect most people who are lower-income/homeless, POC, teenagers, LGBTQ+, the elderly, etc. People who don't have the strongest voices in America.

People are seriously rejecting health care for others because they don't agree with them??? I'm sorry but that is completely wrong. The GOP will strip others of  health care and possibly themselves because others don't live the same lives as them or the way they want them to live (white, straight, heterosexual, Christian, and a corporate job 🤠 🤪.)

Ya'll want to allow your right to not be vaccinated (my body my choice lmao) and potentially cause illness or worse death to another, but won't allow someone the ability to get an abortion for their various medical and private reasons (my body but not my choice???) It's giving very much cognitive dissonance.

It is just extremely sad to me how others in America don't want others to be healthy and be provided health care. I know many will argue that some will take advantage of the system, but it's like a few taking advantage of health care resources vs millions dying because they couldn't be screened for colon cancer lmao. Yeah ok.

I think this is a very important topic with elections coming around the corner. Be careful who you vote for and put in the office on the local, state, and national levels.

Article: [https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/08/09/1115454627/preventive-care-such-as-birth-control-anti-hiv-medicine-challenged-in-texas-laws](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/08/09/1115454627/preventive-care-such-as-birth-control-anti-hiv-medicine-challenged-in-texas-laws)

My question is: What are any logical reasons to be blocking preventive and public health care for millions of people?

Sorry for my language and grammar!

edit- Understanding that health care is not a right to anyone. However, my question is truly who doesn't want access to health care and do a ""fee for service"" type beat on paying for health care?

Edit #2- Thank you to everyone who has responded to the post and gave IRL experience and motives. I have gained perspective on how ACA has made it to where you have to get health care and be expensive for some and benefited others. My initial post truly was to talk about how I believe the GOP does attack and ignore public health concerns for people. I still truly believe that, but I understand why many want to dismantle or revise ACA. Someone else did also point out that American identifies with and helped created the Universal Declaration of Human Right and within Article 25 states how medical care is a right to all humans. I feel like it furthers whether or not health care should or should not be considered a right within America. I understand premiums are high and many for forced into ACA or get they taxed, however at least there was an action to try and fill the gaps with health care. Without ACA many will be out of luck with health care and I do believe if people (mainly the GOP. I know many democrats don't like it either but again my post was talking about the GOP. I am not here saying I suck the DNC \*\*\*\*.) People should be concerned where their money, taxes, and etc are going. Insurance in America is made to where you will be paying for others and vice versa. That is how the system is unfortunately.

Please keep responding with anything you want to add for further input. Thanks!

I also wanted to add a video on perspective across the world on health care. It's from 2008, but I still think it applies.

I'm simply shocked that people really think that we are all obligated to help others in need. If a person is dying on the street, and you can easily help the person, but still choose not to, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. You're not an asshole if you turn back a starving stranger asking for food at your door. You don't owe anyone anything. It feels good to help others, but when it becomes an obligation and people would socially or legally punish you for not helping others in need, then that's a massive threat to liberty. Neither the society nor the government should have any say over whether people should help or not.

Some people even argue that you should put yourself in their shoes. Well, of course, I can, and I know I would want fellow strangers to help me in a threatening situation, but I will never expect them to help me, or judge them for not helping me. And just because I would want to get help in a bad situation doesn't make it immoral for others not to help, just like it's not immoral for women to wear ""revealing clothes"" even if some religious conservatives wouldn't want them to.

I just don't understand this mentality. People need to realize that actions are not just a ""moral or immoral"" dichotomy.  Morally good actions improve lives. Morally bad actions worsen them. If a person is dying and you don't help them even if you have the means to, then it's morally neutral. Morally bad would be to get that dying person and further stabbing them 14 times to kill them faster, or to bathe them in kerosene and light them up to make the death more painful.

Obligations and judgement just erode a person's ability to make choice, thereby erasing the entire beauty of helping people in the first place. And those countries which legally ban abandoning people in need are downright inhumane.

I'd personally want to help whenever someone is in danger, but I know that it would depend a lot on the situation like whether I'm in a good mood or depressed af. Moreover, I've seen bystanders myself, been one myself. You can never tell what makes bystanders simply apathic. Apart from the bystander effect, they may be afraid, or shocked to freezing, or may have simply grown tired of seeing the same thing again and again, thereby losing faith in change. It can be anything. ""If you are silent, you're compliant in the act"" for crimes doesn't work either, because there's nothing wrong with being compliant in crimes as long as intentions aren't to harm people.

I think I'm going against 99% of the society here, so I think I might be wrong."

The US electoral system is broken and the proof is that the politicians we elect and their policies aren't in line with the policies voters say they want in polls. 

In my view, there are many possible far better explanations for why the polls don't match the elected politicians and policies that have nothing to do with US elections being broken. Maybe many people just cannot be bothered to vote. They don't want to, they don't have to, so they don't. Or they want change but when it comes time to actually change things they get cold feet.  Or they like those policies by themselves, but they don't like the other stuff that comes with them. Or they just prefer moderates. 

None of these point to a fundamental flaw in US elections, but all of them explain why the polls don't match the elected politicians and policies. 

I don't think the US electoral system is broken and that's why the US is so much further right than voters' responses in polls, but I'm open to CMV."

So as a person who cares about both genders issues and want to advocate to fix both of them, I genuinely don't like how the feminist and MRM movements are. Obviously, they're not that black and white. They obviously do have some pros aswell. 

But a PLETHORA of their discussions are just about how the gender they're advocating for is worse off/less privileged than the other (which is the stupid oppression olympics), how the other movement is toxic and sexist and that they're better (this is something that mostly MRA's do IME), and sometimes they're just downright being sexist. And it just annoys me. 

The worst part is that both of them aren't even willing to listen to each other majority of the times and just want to vilify the other when they should listen and understand each other, question their own beliefs and biases and instead of being each other's antagonists, they should fight for gender equality together. And yeah, they may say that it's the other movement who's being jerk and how their movement is better but if you see from an unbiased, outsider's perspective, they're both basically two sides of the same coin.

Now, the biggest problem isn't even this. Flaws exist in every group of people but the biggest problem is that they aren't even willing to listen to criticism that will improve their movement. They might acknowledge that their movement have flaws and even claim to call them out but then they will just ignore that afterwards. I've seen in multiple MRA and feminist spaces where they say they do that but when people actually say offensive shit about the other gender, like how the other gender doesn't  face systemic oppression and that sexism against the other gender doesn't exist (IME it's mostly feminists who deny that sexism against men and misandry doesn't exist) they don't take action against it. When they should try to lower the harm the bad apples from their movement have made."

Few days ago I went to amusement park. I had my water bottle, some raisins, few crackers and my so even threw a banana into backpack. Fast track few hours later it's a snack time. Everything else is great but banana had turned into black mussy uneatable mess. Bananas just don't survive as they are in a backpack.

Lot of other fruits may require prep at home and their own container (like orange slices) but they will survive much better than even banana slices in the same container. And if you want no prep fruit option go for apples (even if I prefer apple slices).

Bananas are great at home but you really can't transport them anywhere on their own. To change my view tell me your best trekking tricks for banana.

\[Delta edit\] I need to specify that I'm talking about fresh bananas and not dried ones that are fine."

What he did was not within the context of the game.  NFL football is a brutal sport.  People get concussions, they break bones, they tear muscles, they don’t live long.  Knocking somebody out cold within the context of the game is allowed, and expected.  When you are a wide receiver and you are going down the middle, you better expect that Lavar Arrington is waiting for you to clean your clock.  That type of violence is fine.

What is not fine is violence outside the context of the game.  This freaking gorilla Aaron Donald went outside the context of the game, and starting swinging a deadly weapon with the intent to maim/injure/kill somebody.  We have video evidence of this (see link).

Given this individual’s violence happened outside the context of the game and he committed assault with a deadly weapon, he should be suspended 1 game at a minimum.  This would show that the NFL AND THE LA RAMS **EDIT** takes assault with a deadly weapon outside the context of the game seriously.

If you get charged with a suspicion of DUI, oftentimes you haven’t caused any damage, but the mere act of driving under the influence increases the risk of you causing damage to others (and yourself).

When Aaron Donald took the helmet and started swinging, he increased the risk of at the very least, committing murder.

6,2022-08-26,CMV: Becoming a Consistently Profitable Daytrader Is Possible,u/GreenStoic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wyglqe/cmv_becoming_a_consistently_profitable_daytrader/,changemyview,"I want to start this out by saying that I have dedicated the last three years of my life learning daytrading. I feel like I am close to becoming consistently profitable, but I am not there yet. For a bit, I have been thinking about giving up. Perhaps, I am just wasting my time. I understand that over 95% of daytraders lose money in the long run. But this is something that I want very badly, and I don't want to give up unless I'm convinced that it is 100% impossible.

So, this is why I believe it is possible to do. There are obviously a bunch of people on social media that claim to be millionaire daytraders or whatever, and I know that basically all of them are lying. However, out of all the daytraders I've looked at, there are only two that I fully believe are consistently profitable themselves. Those two are Matt Diamond and StockJock. If you can convince me that both of them are being dishonest about their trading, then that will sufficiently change my mind and I will give up on trading.

Matt Diamond (you can find him on YouTube) only became consistently profitable a couple of years ago, and now he daytrades full time. In 2020, I was in his discord group (free) and every day he would talk about some of the trades he was making. Every month he would show a broker statement, so we could see that he was actually making money every month. He was transparent about his losses.

Nowadays, things have changed a bit. He doesn't do the discord group anymore. He just posts his profits and losses on Twitter and does some trade recaps on YouTube. Because of how well I got to know Matt, and his transparency, I still fully believe him.

The only reason you may have to doubt him is that he does offer a couple of paid services. One is a daily newsletter that people pay $29 a month, another is a call service where you pay $150 to speak with him for an hour, and just recently he released a trading pdf guide for $99. You could argue he's making a living from these services, and not from trading. I disagree. Given the size of his audience, I can't imagine he's making any more than a couple thousand dollars a month off these services alone, which isn't enough to live off.

Next, let's talk about StockJock. He is a live streamer on Twitch that live streams himself trading every day. He is usually trading from the moment market opens to the moment the market closes. He doesn't offer any paid services at all, so he doesn't have any other income coming in. I don't see how StockJock could be a fraud at all. He is as transparent as they come. You can't fake your profits when you're literally showing everything live.

So, I hope some of you can help me see something that I may be missing. If you can convince me that both Matt Diamond and StockJock are being dishonest about their trading, then that will sufficiently change my mind."

Here are the reasons why typing notes, fiction, etc on a computer is superior to traditional paper and pen/pencil:

1: Typing is more environmentally friendly, you're not wasting paper

2: Typing is faster. Much, much, much faster. You waste less time, and if taking notes, you can get down much more info.

3: It is far, far easier to edit and revise

4: Your hand doesn't hurt.

5: Typing is standardized, which means it is more legible and also removes the bias some people have against people with bad handwriting.

6: Computer files are much harder to lose, especially if you back them up. They also don't fade over time or get smudged.

Finally, to preemptively take out the ""handwriting aids in retention"" argument, the sheer speed of typing allows one to more accurately transcribe new information with great speed, leaving more time to review.

Note that this only applies to the written word. Clearly, using paper and writing utensils may be preferable if you are painting or drawing or doing some fancy calligraphy."

The main argument that I have seen against this is ""I have received too many mistakes in my order.""  Or ""my food was too cold.""

This is not the fault of the delivery driver. A lot of restaurants will safety-seal bags to make sure that the driver doesn't tamper with the food.  I don't see how the driver is supposed to verify that the order is correct.  I also don't see how the driver is expected to keep food warm beyond the use of temperature bags. I do concede that sometimes there are deliveries that are egregiously slow and the food is cold because of that.  

But unless you are right next to the restaurant,  how do you expect the food to be hot when it arrives?  Warm makes sense,  but you're not getting freshly cooked food.  It's getting delivered to you. There needs to be a reasonable expectation of time and temperature when it comes to food delivery. 

I want to be clear, I agree with your right to not pre-tip. I'm not going to demand that we make it mandatory.  Me personally,  I don't use delivery services.  It's way too expensive and incentivizes a sedentary lifestyle. 

But can you actually be mad at the delivery driver for declining your order when there's no guarantee that they'll make money?  When they actually lose money because of gas,  can you blame them for declining? Even if you plan on tipping in cash… How does your driver know that you won't stiff them? 

I do believe that if nobody takes your order,  you should absolutely be refunded.  But you are mostly tipping for convenience more than anything else.  

This is not about you taking a hard stance against Doordash and their pay scale for the drivers.  If you actually cared,  you wouldn't be using their service at all.  So please be honest with yourself.  This isn't about the pay.  This is about saving money.  

You're free to not pre-tip. But they're free to decline you if they're not gonna make money from you.  Fair?"

38,2022-08-27,CMV: some movies/series adaptations of books are just baiting with popular authors' names and they are in fact elaborate fan fiction,u/MarlaCohle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wyt788/cmv_some_moviesseries_adaptations_of_books_are/,changemyview,"I know that art is evolving by retelling motives. Recycling. Telling new stories in new settings. That creators inspire each other and that's a beauty of it. I know books, movies and series are all different mediums and they tell stories differently. And it's awesome! I know some authors work with creators of adaptations, they approve changes in narrative and even encourge it. I'm not some purist who wipe over every change made in adaptation of my favourite book. Some changes are often necessary, better or just neutral.  


But lately, when it comes to some popular writers, I feel like creators of adaptations just want to push their (usually bad) ideas or interpretations. It's probably not always about the money, marketing it with big name, but I think it could be a factor. Of course next adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is probably gonna bring more attention than some random movie by random person about random people from Regency Era.  


Speaking of Jane Austen, I love some modern verion of retelling her stories, like *Clueless.* But what that movie did, was recapturing a spirit of her work while telling something new. And what Netflix's adaptation of *Persuassion* did? Changed the main heroine's character that was a key to why events in books happened the way they did.    


Next we have Netflix's series adaptation of *Anne of Green Gables.*  
It's so frustraiting to me that in many, many aspects the series was perfect. Casting, setting, cinematography, characters. Some changes were done perfectly. Book by Lucy Maud Montgomery gives as a little hints from time to time, that Anne's life, as a poor orphan, had to be awful, but she doesn't elaborate. Lucy's philosophy of writing was to write with optimism and not about ugliness of the real world.   
Adaptation show us a little more realistic story, with flashbacks to awful, but totally possible events. It doesn't change the story, the character, it actually makes it all more real, deep and good. And I love these changes.  
But then, the story gets a weird turn with overdramatic, illogical and historically inaccurate episodes. Making up adventures that couldn't happen to some little girl from small island in Canada in XIX century just becase you want to tell some other story you made up and use someone's name to sell it? Nope. If you want to give some figure from a book a new plot, this things should at least match their character.  
Some people don't like modern social issues reflected in adaptations of historical work. I think these are fine if they are done gently, match the story and are exacuted in the way that don't say 'We have to include character's opinion about every modern problem and we're gonna do it with token people that doesn't have a personality besides that'. That always seems forced and rushed. Also, sometimes it's better to focus on social issues that were problems of character's century, because they add another interesting layer to original story, like it was with *Anne*. Some stories from XIX centuary could perfectly line up with modern times, like it was with Indegous people in this adaptation.  


My last example will be adaptations of books by Agatha Christie, done by Kenneth Branagh. With Christie's books about Hercules Poirot, this detective charachter is everything. He is fully developed, from his backstory and looks, to his little quirks, routines and the way he works. He is the heart of all these stories about his investigations. You can change them a little, characters, motives, who is the murderer - and you don't lose a spirit of Christie's works and stories. Another adaptation - *Poirot* series proves it. They change some things from time to time, but David Suchet as Poirot is pure perfection out of the books. What Branagh did in his movies, besides some changes to the plot and characters - he rewrote Hercules Poirot. Gave him totally different background, that was pointless and unbeliveble. Changed some methods of his work, which was a core of his character as a detective. Change his behavior. It's not adaptation, it's story with some names that Christie invented while stealing her (very specific) murder idea to tell your fan-fiction.  
If you want to create movie influenced by Christie, just do something like *Knives Out,* which is clearly inspired by her work whodunit, but doesn't claim her name and character as a bait to sell itself.   


Maybe if all of these adaptations didn't copy the titles of books it would be better. Maybe creators should consider, if changes to the plot didn't create a different story, one, in which audience wanting book adaptation is not interested in. Maybe they should decide either they tell someone else's story or a new one, influenced by X, but not a specific adaptation of specific book. Doing the next *Clueless,* not inserting my ideas into someone else's legacy.   


I have another issue with changes in adaptations, one specifcally of historical works. It often softens the plot, the character, to be more appealing to the modern viewer. I know it's hard to understand people who lived 200 years ago, but it's not helpful if creators show audience this fictional world where all the good, likeable characters were tolerant and only few bad characters were racist and homophobic. It's simply not true. It washes down the history of discrimination and fights against it. We can have diversity in stories with historical accuracy. This is dangerous, when culture show the historical times that never truly excisted this way. Then people tend to ideolize old times and that could be dangeorus. History likes to repeat itself.  


I'm actually really interested in arguments against my POV. Those kinds of discussions tend to have two sides - people who like inventions and books' purist. I'm neither. If I could sum up my view I would have to say that - retelling old stories is awesome. Just make sure if you actually want to show some story in different media with understandable changes or if you want to say something different inspired by others' work. And in conclusion - how you should advertise it."

Part of the problem is that poor people, disproportionately POC, cannot afford to live in the same neighborhoods as rich people, disproportionately white. Where housing is concerned, segregation is not a thing of the past. In both Republican and Democrat states neighborhoods tend to be racially segregated. 

Some might say it is possible to improve conditions in poor majority POC neighborhoods even if those neighborhoods are separate from wealthier majority white neighborhoods and in theory maybe this is true. But in practice the idea of ""separate but equal"" has never worked in my view and there's no reason to assume that will change- and even if it could work, the goal should not be separate but equal in my view, the goal should be not separate at all. 

The best way to desegregate society IMO building low income housing in high income neighborhoods. I acknowledge that this would have to be done slowly to prevent people from leaving to more rural states. But I believe it can be done and that the result would be a more equal society. But I'm curious to hear other's thoughts and I am of course open to changing my view."
0,2022-08-27,CMV: Liberal Femenism is better than both Radical Femenism and Marxist Femenism,u/Big_Committee_3894,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wyx9bs/cmv_liberal_femenism_is_better_than_both_radical/,changemyview,"There are said to be three big main femenism doctrines, wich are those of Liberal, Radical and Marxist femenisms

*Radical Femenism* calls for a radical re-ordering of society in which male supremacy is eliminated in all social and economic contexts, while recognizing that women's experiences are also affected by other social divisions such as in race, class, and sexual orientation. 
The root cause of women's oppression is patriarchal gender relations. 

*Radical femenists* propose that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression, one that has existed since the inception of humanity, and challenges racialized and gendered capitalism, and aspires total uprooting and reconstruction of society, wich I find because because its something politically revolutionary

I find *radical femenism* bad because radicalism tends to be lead to authoritarianism systeams of governance and surpressiom of freedoms. Moderations seems to me always better than radicalism
Also, is a lot less pragmatic and prone to promote echo chamber and inefective tactics

*Marxist feminism* analyzes the ways in which women are exploited through capitalism and the individual ownership of private property. According to *Marxist feminists*, women's liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the capitalist systems in which they contend much of women's labor is uncompensated

I find this femenim theory deplorable because altought capitalism as an economic model has its flaws, like liberal democracy, its the best we have, all alternatives being worse, so we shouldnt strive for its abolishment


*Liberal Femenism* focuses on achieving gender equality through political and legal reform within the framework of liberal democracies and has a big enfasis on laws wich it holds has source of opression, for it considers the denial of equal legal and political rights as the main obstacle to equality
It broadly supports existing institutions of power in liberal democratic societies, and is associated with centrism and reformism, wich is something I associate myself with also

*Liberal feminism* seeks gradual social progress and equality on the basis of liberal democracy rather than a revolution or radical reordering of society.
It is inherently pragmatic in orientation,and emphasizes building far-reaching support for feminist causes among both women and men. Also tends to be gender critical, wich is a good thing because it allows the preservation of ideollogical consistency and avoids oxymorons

In summary I think that Liberal Femenism is better than Radical and Marxist because it is more moderate and less revolutionary. But I because this is just my opinion and as a femenist I want to find the best way to promote femenism in África I would like for you to change my mind

TLDR
Pros of Liberal Femenism: 
- Moderate 
- Dosent suport revolucionary fevour 
- Broad, so both center left and center right friendly 
- Pragmatic
- Dosent antagonise man
- Doesn vilanize capitalism as economic model
- Its the global norm
- Is gender critical"
0,2022-08-27,CMV: Democracy is a mistake,u/DrRadikal,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wyxop9/cmv_democracy_is_a_mistake/,changemyview,"The democratic system is smoke and mirrors. Democracy doesn't exist, it's just shadow oligarchy. Democracy means that whoever has the most power to shape the masses is king. The end result is always oligarchy, and a nasty one at that. 

In the current system, oligarchs are not held responsible for their rulings. They shape society's flow and who the masses elect they rule by proxy through politicians. Politicians take the heat and decision makers get off scot free. 

Guilt is forced upon the masses as if who they vote for matters. Democracy breeds infighting and creates an ""us VS them"" mindset. 

It's not your nation or your people, instead its vague nonsensical modern ideology. This greatly weakens nationalism with an artificial division inside countries instead of between them. 

The people at the top don't own any part of it. It's not their people. It's not their country. They just direct the masses in a way that will net them the most personal gain.  They have no interest in bettering their country and its people

The people at the top of this game wouldn't give two shirs even if they owned this country. 

Democracy is the biggest fucking scam in history"

To explain my point I feel that his story is often used by white people to in a way lazily pin the ""saving"" of oppressors on us.

Everytime there's a story like this or an instance of a minority being frustrated with a bigot some guy always bring up his name as a gotcha and that maybe if we are just nice to bigots we can all be freinds.

But people forget a lot of factors that make this type of activism unsustainable.

For one it's dangerous your telling people to just March on in to places that have ideologies dedicated to hating you as if black people are all superman or something. Even ignoring the physical danger what about the mental and emotional danger no doubt marching into white supremacist territory your condemning people to constant harrasment and hate.

Ultimately I feel it's silly to work through changing individuals minds it's a long lengthy draining process that one can spend years doing and come out at the end fruitless. Things are much better solved on a systemic basis to put it simply if a white guy hates me for being black that his problem if a white guy has the power to hurt me because I'm black then we have issues. It's better to fix the systems that create racism than to put up the futile effort of changing a couple people's minds"
79,2022-08-27,CMV: I don't think non offending pedophiles should be hated,u/No-Job-4870,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wz55rl/cmv_i_dont_think_non_offending_pedophiles_should/,changemyview,"Non offending pedophiles are people who are attracted to children but   don't act on it (which includes watching cp). They did not ask for it,  They don't want it, They were born with that attraction or got it   through some sort of trauma. If you are hating them (like wishing they   were dead, castrated, tortured, ect) you are hating someone because of   their thoughts. You are hating them because they have an illness. I   understand if you are fearful of them (like not wanting them to be   around their kids) and if you are a non offending pedophile, you should   stay away from children until you are treated. It will help the non offending pedophile and the children at the same time too. So if someone   is attracted to children and doesn't act on it, they are not a bad   person. If they mollested or even watch a nanosecond of child porn, then   they should be hated. Also pedophilia is not a sexual orientation and   it should never be part of the LBGTQ+ community. It should be  considered  a serious illness instead. so if they don't act on it and  they  recognize that it is wrong and goes to therapy for it, they are a  good  person. But once they acted on it (which includes watching CP)  they are a  bad person. also a non offending pedophile should only be  chemmically  casturated with their permission too but if they acted on  it they should  be physically and chemically casturated without their  permission. If  you do hate non offending pedophiles, can you explain to  me why so I can  understand. I am open for other opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I also don't believe in thought crime. also when I say ""hated"" I mean vocally saying that they should be torutred, killed, etc for their thoughts.

Edit: since many are thinking I am a pedo, I am not because I am not attracted and aroused by children being raped and that really disgusts me. I prefer people who are around my age, not children. I also do not watch any form of animated child porn too.

Edit: yeah people who are pedos whould not ever share their thoughts of doing who knows what with kids to the world. If you do that then you are a POS. someone who is truly ashamed of being a pedo would never share those thoughts other than with a therapist. If someone admits to the world that they are non offending pedo then they must be proud of it which is not okay at all."

0,2022-08-27,CMV: Student Loan Forgiveness is Harmful and Unfair,u/TreacleBright2707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wz58u8/cmv_student_loan_forgiveness_is_harmful_and_unfair/,changemyview,"***Before you downvote me into oblivion because this is a widely held “conservative” view and Reddit doesn’t like those, please just explain your reasoning and let’s have a discussion because I am genuinely open to it and would like to understand why seemingly the majority of people support student loan forgiveness.***

Here are the 3 main reasons I think it’s harmful and unfair:

**Reason 1:** For many years, the price of attending college has been increasing disproportionately compared to the increased earnings that come with having a degree. Fundamentally, that’s the problem that needs solving. For the same education, people today have to pay more than what they used to for similar outcomes. And this applies at all levels— community college, in state public and private university. Until that issue is solved, people will continue to take out large loan amounts and struggle to pay them back. Forgiving college loans only makes the problem worse by encouraging people to take out large student loans.

**Reason 2:** It rewards people who were/are irresponsible. I’ll admit, there are exceptions to the rule, but generally speaking (assuming one did okay in high school) one can go to their state’s flagship in state institution for minimal cost. If one makes the choice to go to a private institution, they’re taking a risk. I understand the appeal, private universities are often able to offer a better education, higher potential earnings, increased opportunities, etc… When one chooses to go to private institution instead of a much cheaper in state public, they’re taking a risk and hoping that the possible advantages will outweigh the steep upfront costs. The government shouldn’t reward people who made a bad investment and consequently penalize those who gave up the opportunities reaped by their counterparts in order to go to a more affordable school.

**Reason 3:** It doesn’t help the people that really need help. The actual poor people that don’t have a degree and therefore are earning less on average are the people getting screwed. Student loan forgiveness helps those who are already at an advantage.

**If you’re interested in some of the data that informed my view I’ve linked it below.**

So first of all, Russia has been in an authoritarian cycle for years, and the Oligarch elites don’t like giving power away so easily. So even if Putin is assassinated, it’s likely some other oligarch will take his place and be the same, if not worse. 

“A monster never dies no matter how many times you kill it, it just sheds its skin and changes its form”- Wolfenstein: The Old Blood

And the people have been so used to authoritarianism, as long as the new leader does well enough in terms of the economy, or just uses enough propaganda, the people won’t care if he is authoritarian or not.

Secondly, if miraculously, if there is a charming democratic oligarch wanting change for Russia to turn it into a democracy, he would have to face a giant problem.
And that is, Putin practically made Russia’s political system his bitch.
The reason he did this is obvious, he is a power hungry tyrant, and he doesn’t want to give up his power, so he made his system hard for anyone to take power.

https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/03/29/1088886554/how-putin-conquered-russias-oligarchy

And thirdly, if we go fund a democratic Russian group to go and completely dismantle Putin’s system, there would also be some problems with that. The main one is that there is a chance Russia will go into complete political crisis, or that another civil war due to the possibility that many political groups will probably try to take over Russia for their own gain. And an another civil war or Political crisis in Russia will not great news for the west, due to possibly, like I said at my first point, another nationalistic and crazy oligarch may takeover, or also the possibility that an crazed political group in Russia will get some of Russia’s nukes, and use them against the world.

So, making Russia to become a democracy seems not like the best idea at the moment, and just like the Wests past attempts to make democracy will probably fail (Like the Russian 1996 election, which made Russia what it is today). So right now the best hope for Russia by the west is for Ukraine to kick its ass, and to kill Putin imperialist appetite. So this Russian democracy (To me.) is more likely a pipe-dream.

But hey there maybe some hope.

Society says selfish is bad, selflessness is good. Why?? Because you can get something out of the selflessness person, but maybe not the selfish person?

If the richest person in the world doesn’t want to donate to any charities they will be called selfish. It may or may not be selfish but who is anyone to tell them they are in the wrong for not giving away their own money…?

Family is different.. IF you are responsible for that person. If I have a kid it’s not just selfish for me to not give them what they need, it’s abuse. So that’s a whole different story.

I’d like to say I’m selfless and selfish. Others might disagree because I don’t give everyone I meet the same experience, people are dynamic. I’m willing to offer my help, time, maybe money if I feel like buying you something.

Since long before I was legally allowed to drink, me and my mates got drunk and did stupid shit. Guilt and shame-ridden hangovers were a common thing, they were followed by self-reflection and apologies, plus of course laughing about how much of a dick that person was. It was normal.

I think that binge drinking culture caused my generation to normalise apologies and forgiveness. We've all done or said the stupid thing, we've all pissed someone off or overstepped a line. Shit happens, we'll joke about it for years but we're still your mates, just don't do it again. They're still my mates 25 years later, and some of them are actual dicks but I fucking love them anyway.

With the youth of today not drinking as much you've got a population of good people who don't get involved in bad behaviour, so it's alien to them. Because of this only the worst people do bad things, so their peers don't know forgiveness. If ordinary people don't make a fool out of themselves and learn from their own embarrassing mistakes, everyone is petrified of social shaming because it's usually people you don't know being seen by everyone. Transgressions are met with severe penalties, cutting people out of your life is an ordinary thing.

I think this is building a generation of judgy snobs who ostracize each other over trivial issues, it'll create isolated adults who ditched their oldest and deepest bonds of friendship over quite trivial things that, on the grand scale of things, don't really matter -- they were actually learning opportunities. And they'll replace them with fickle, shallow relationships with people who seem and act nice but don't really know or love them or have their back.

Am I right, or do I just want them off my lawn? Please educate me!"

1,2022-08-27,CMV: The ‘Collateral Murder’ incident isn’t as bad as people make it out to be,u/snow17_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wzakzl/cmv_the_collateral_murder_incident_isnt_as_bad_as/,changemyview,"I’m sure you’ve all seen it but [here it is](https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org) if you haven’t (**NSFW** obviously). 

Firstly, I know that civilians, reporters and children were killed during the air strikes and that’s terrible but the way that Julian Assange released the video makes it out to be worse than it is. He included no context and essentially was implying that a US apache team murdered civilians because they could. In reality, that’s just not true. 

All morning the US ground team that were in that area had been receiving frequent small arms fire and rpg attacks. They called in for air support and when the Apache’s arrived, they saw a group of men, some of which were armed, about 100 meters away from US soldiers. The Apache pilot saw a man carrying what looked like an RPG (but was actually a camera with a large telescopic lens) and the man began pointing it towards an American Humvee and then he raised it towards the Apache, as if getting ready to fire at the Apache. The Apache opened fire. The memory card from the camera was recovered after the attack and it had three pictures of the Humvee on it. The journalist had no visual identification to indicate that they were journalists other than a small ID card that is obviously not visible from the Apache. A small van then appears and picks up the wounded. The Pilot requested to engage in order to prevent insurgents from escaping. He is granted permission to engage. After this, the US troops move in to secure the area. Amongst the dead bodies they find the camera, two RPG’s (one was loaded and underneath the body of a man laying next to the journalist) and an AK47. This proves that the journalists were with men who were armed.  The two children are then found in the van and immediately get evac to an FOB. 

This incident while tragic, is unfortunately just part of war. We have a group of armed military aged males acting suspicious within 100 metres of American troops that had been taking small arms and rpg fire. Some of the group were armed and some were journalists. You can ask the question, were they acting as security for the journalists or were the journalists embedded with a group of insurgents? That doesn’t change what the situation looks like from the sky. The journalist raises his camera to photograph an Apache. The camera (with long telephoto lens) is mistaken for an rpg and the Apache fires. These armed men were walking around in a conflict zone with no visual press identification and darting between buildings and taking pictures of American troops who had been taking fire. Now can you see how the Apache team thought they were insurgents? The responding vehicle was also targeted because it was seen to be helping the men who were thought to be insurgents. How were the Apache team meant to know that it was a civilian with kids responding to the aftermath of an air strike. 

The [investigation](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2010/04/6-2nd-brigade-combat-team-15-6-investigation.pdf) backs this up with photographic evidence and witness testimony.  The Apache team was made out to be war criminals and the incident was used by insurgents and terrorists as propaganda to further fuel hatred and attacks towards America and its allies. 

War isn’t clean, it’s messy and everyone gets hurt. The Apache team did what they thought was best given the information and situation at hand. They aren’t cold blooded murderers and the whole incident was turned from an unfortunate horror of war into a propaganda piece for anti American incentives."

It is even better if traveling is meaningful. You are not in another country simply to consume their food for a week. But maybe you have a job or something meaningful to do there. This is real traveling. This is a real travel experience.

18,2022-08-27,"CMV: the US university system would be better if today's four-year colleges/universities only did the last two years, and the normal path was associate's then bachelor's.",u/quantum_dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wzb81b/cmv_the_us_university_system_would_be_better_if/,changemyview,"Edit: deltas awarded:

* Funding and costs could be problematic with reduced economies of scale and alumni having two schools to donate to.

I'm imagining a system where bachelor's-granting institutions have an associate's degree as an admission requirement, and, while they could offer such degrees themselves as well, the norm would be to do an associate's at a community college and then go for a bachelor's (like today's typical bachelor's/master's/PhD system).

My argument, in brief, is that this would:

1. Address some current logistical problems with the typical US four-year trajectory
2. Open more opportunities to combine study + practice
3. Improve students' ability to choose field + institution and reduce the penalty for choosing wrongly at first
4. Institutions could specialize more in their program implementations

Note that I intentionally phrased the title to avoid suggesting a direct transition; I'd expect the logistics of a switchover to be very challenging, but that's not immediately relevant to my view.  Consider this in the context of a fresh start without existing structures in place.

Of course, this trajectory *can* be done under the current system, but it'd be more likely if it was more normalized, and four-year programs could avoid expending resources on lower-level coursework at all.

I think this works great as implemented at higher levels already: students build a broad background (bachelor's), then have the option to specialize further and go into greater depth if it makes sense for them (graduate degrees), often working in between.  Outside of specific fields, there's no notion of a ""standard path"" past bachelor's that people get stuck on.  Meanwhile, each degree level is able to specialize in a particular approach.

Expanded arguments:

# 1. Logistics

Key failings addressed here:

1. Spending a lot of money on tuition is much more of a problem if the student drops out (losing most of the income advantage); this would make the likely ""maybe this isn't a good fit"" window much cheaper, and provide a clear exit-with-some-advantage point (just the associate's).
2. Under the current system, students who want to attend a more selective program are evaluated under a substantially different educational and life context, and have to make - and stress over - such decisions in that context, with very limited information and experience.  I'd argue that this isn't healthy, and it'd be much better if they were choosing programs and being evaluated while already in college, knowing more about their field and with a realistic reference point.
3. The current system sharply separates trade/degree paths, so that there's much more switching to do if the student changes their mind.  Under this approach, students start out in a position to go either way (with applied associate's and similar) with much less cost to changing their mind.

# 2. Study + Practice

Internships are already a useful thing, but in this approach there'd be a great window to spend a year or two doing entry-level work in between degrees.  A student with an associate's would have enough background to intern, without any ongoing educational commitments, so they could stick around long enough to actually learn the job properly before potentially - if they choose - going back for a bachelor's to get more advanced.  They'd return to school more knowledgeable, more mature, and in a better financial and professional situation, and could even be able to do so with their employer's support.

# 3. Field/Institution Choice

Associate's degrees are less specialized, so a student would be less committed to a narrow field, though admittedly this isn't usually much of a problem with the coursework in the first two years.  They could use free electives, and later the experience from (2), to try out and narrow down their choice of fields, and only then commit.  They'd also be choosing a four-year institution, if any, with much better knowledge of their field and their preferences and with more access to advice from professionals in the field (faculty and industry).

# 4. Institutional Specialization

Currently, a four-year institution has to offer all levels of coursework, from your massive freshman-level lectures through to tiny, highly-specialized senior-level electives.  They need the resources and the faculty to operate the full range.  At the same time, community colleges are offering overlapping coursework for the first couple of years with a different logistical arrangement; in my experience (which is limited and may not generalize), that tends to mean smaller classes and more teaching-focused professors, with the tradeoff of less specialized courses, fancy labs, etc.

Which is a perfectly fine tradeoff, because sophomore-level physics lab doesn't need to be all that fancy or specialized.

With a standard associate's-bachelor's sequence, four-year institutions wouldn't need so much capacity for huge lectures and introductory coursework, leaving faculty and resources to focus on smaller, more specialized courses that are more valuable later in the degree.  Meanwhile, students would get their introductory education cheaply and from often excellent professors at community college.  Community colleges would need to expand their introductory electives offerings for this to work, but they'd have the student numbers for it to be doable.

---

To illustrate, I'm imagining something like this (I'll use a field I'm familiar with for an example):

1. Student interested in engineering - they don't need to know what kind - goes to get an AS degree at the local community college.  They take their core math and science courses cheaply and in relatively small class sizes, and they take electives introducing them to software development, circuits, surveying and infrastructure design, and dynamics.  [Current system: they might well be admitted to a specific major; they'd also be getting their intro coursework more expensively in huge lectures, and may not know about or be able to take such a range of intro electives, which also might not be available at community colleges with today's smaller student bodies.]
2. Their favorite elective was surveying and infrastructure design, so they spend a few years working as a survey technician and learning about CAD while they're at it.  [Current system: summer internships and possible part-time work.]
3. They decide they want to move on and become a civil engineer, so - drawing on their industry connections and past experiences - pick an institution that fits them well and has a strong, well-known civil engineering program in their specialty.  They only pay full tuition for two years and know how to network and maintain industry connections.  [Current system: just keep plugging along in the same program.]
4. They graduate with a large network and a few years of professional experience, and are in a great position to look for a job.  [Current system: they still probably do well, but are looking with much less experience.]

This mirrors what someone might currently do if they worked after their bachelor's and then went back for their master's.

---

I'll point out a few avenues I'm aware of to potentially change my view:

* Demonstrate that any of the listed advantages wouldn't actually work out.  (Any single lost advantage won't be a complete reversal, but it'd be delta-worthy.)
* Demonstrate that either half of the system wouldn't be able to function as I'm anticipating.  (My experience with community colleges is quite limited; I've only taken a few classes at one.)
* Demonstrate a severe logistical problem with the system as proposed (**not** with a transition from the current system; the feasibility of transitioning is not relevant to my view as stated).
* Demonstrate a major advantage of the current system that I've overlooked."

I am a 16 year old girl who should (hopefully) be starting lower sixth form (grade 12) in September and it got me thinking about age gaps below 18.

My standard before this was two years below and three years above (14-19).

Then I rembered being in the eleventh grade (I mean I just left it) and looking at ninth graders and thinking, ""Wow, so young!""

Despite them being 1-3 years younger than me.

It got me thinking, a 15 year old ninth grader makes me think ""child"" but what if they were in another grade?

**My Main Point**

The grade you are in greatly affects your maturity level and life experience which is why I believe school relationships should focus on grade rather than age.

As an 11th grader, I had to worry about exams, graduation, college prep and university while 9th graders had to worry about none of that.

It's also why I feel that I have way more in common with a 19 year old upper six (grade 13) than a 15 year old ninth grader.

Similar experiences heavily depend on grade.

**Conclusion**

I don't really have one but I hope that this is coherent enough."

8,2022-08-27,CMV: Memorization in school for certain subjects is no longer needed due to technology.,u/myersdr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wzfgu1/cmv_memorization_in_school_for_certain_subjects/,changemyview,"My example is in Chemistry and the periodic table.  What valid reason would a person need to memorize the periodic table?  The amount of websites dedicated to the periodic table and everything about chemicals is all someone should need to begin their knowledge in school.  Memorizing the chemicals is not important when on any electronic device we can simply bring up the answer within seconds.  I grew up in the 90s, had to use an encyclopedia or the library for information, and enjoyed the wonders of dial-up internet.  I am retaking some classes to change careers. However, I can't for the life of me understand why we are still teaching our younger generations to memorize information that is available in seconds.  Back then, it made sense since the information wasn't as easily accessible, now the information is, and we are wasting time memorizing it when that could be two weeks of practicing calculations and mixing chemicals and getting better at doing something.  I believe even the most experienced chemist may need to review the table from time to time to ensure they have inputted the correct information into their calculations before mixing chemicals.  Of course, the difference between a chemist who has years of looking over the periodic table and has damn near burned an image into their brain is highly different than a college student in their first two weeks of chemistry.  There is a big difference between using the same information repeatedly and learning for the first or second time.  There are other examples, and while I will accept the argument that it is potentially helpful for your mental health to memorize things, my concern is over something so complex that may take years to fully be ingrained in someone's memory who doesn't have the natural ability to memorize quickly only by reading.  Essentially, a student who could be great at handling chemicals and doing lab work may end up not being a chemist because they can't remember something that will forever be available to them in a matter of seconds.

Update:  I kind of went off because I have trouble learning through memorization.  It is helpful, but to me is only short-term memory.  Some examples have commented on math and such that I still remember from middle school.  Not because I memorized it, but because I did a lot of math problems, and over time it became long-term memory.  Multiplication tables are remembered because we have dedicated them to long-term memory and multiply things in our heads daily.  In my opinion, short-term memorization is good when someone tells me a phone number, and I can't write it down.  Not trying to remember the abbreviation for Sodium and 80 other elements.  I learn that through continually reading about it.  How many times have you read higher-level books and had to look up a word in the dictionary quickly to make sure you understand the reading?  I do it often, but once I have done it enough, I have now committed the definition to long-term memory.  I can see how the title just looks like I am looking for an easy way out when really I prefer to learn things through doing them over and over again.  If that isn't going to happen, I don't waste time committing that information to short-term memory because it is available due to technology."

**What do I mean by ""elite?""** The requirements to become a teacher should be rigorous. Passing simple certifications should not be enough. Teachers should have a very good understanding of how the learning process in and of itself works. No tenures. Minimum tutoring hours, perhaps even minimum number of reviews (of those tutored, results, etc.) Basically, teachers should be good teachers...really good. The best teacher you've had in your life? That should just be the norm. The bottom line is it should be extremely demanding. 

**What do I mean by ""highly paid?""** Teachers should be within the top 10-20% of income earners in our society. Somewhere around 6 figures in most places.

**Common arguments against:**

\- many occupations don't require much more than a high school education if that

\- shouldn't the best and brightest be working on better things than teaching?

\- we already have a teacher shortage even with low barriers to entry/supply and demand

**My argument:**

**Every aspect of society is improved.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, you don't need to be a super smart guy to be a barista at Starbucks, and our society does need baristas, but just think about this. The number one thing holding us back from advancement as a society is the lack of highly skilled, hyper-intelligent people employed in bottleneck professions. These are the AI developers, cancer researchers, aging researchers, and quantum-computing engineers; the type of people in a position that can advance society. These people are so important, and they can only be produced at the highest level if they are pushed and raised towards that level from birth to adulthood. Teachers and tutors are a pivotal part of this process. These bottleneck innovations take our entire concept of civilization forward. There is no way to account for this cost, there is no price tag that is too high. We cannot afford to waste any talent because they were not sufficiently taught in their development. 

As for the issue of sacrificing talent to create talent, I think the counterpoint is obvious. 1 Genius can not do as much as 10 geniuses. If 1 genius teacher can create 10 geniuses, that is an exponential net value increase for our society.  

Finally, there is a teacher shortage both in quantity and quality because teachers are not respected as a profession, and because they are not compensated, which, is probably because they are not respected enough. Many of the brightest minds would love to be teachers but simply would never consider it due to lack of money and prestige. Education is a domain of the state, and the state can, and should, do what it can to advance the public interest, especially when the pros are so freaking obvious. There is no serious argument for a dumber society."

I know that not everyone who has been abused becomes a serial killer, but it is undeniable that all serial killers have been abused.

Most of the most prolific serial killers were born between the 1930s and 1960s. A time when physical abuse and verbal abuse were glorified as the best way to discipline your children. Sexual abuse and incest were huge taboos and no one believed the few children who had the courage to denounce their abuser.

I am not saying that serial killers deserve empathy. They chose to kill, but their past traumas may help explain what they have become. Look at Ottis Toole or Henry Lee Lucas it's as if their families raised them to be murderers. 


I am convinced that if some of these serial killers had received help as children and had been taken away from their abusive families while receiving psychiatric care. They would never have killed anyone. 




Society is responsible for what these people have become. Responsible for trivializing domestic violence and shaming victims of sexual assault. It is the duty of a healthy society to protect the most fragile citizens. The societies of these times and those that preceded them did not do so."

0,2022-08-28,CMV: the reason mental health issues are so prevalent right now is the lack of discipline,u/idrinkkombucha,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wzt6o5/cmv_the_reason_mental_health_issues_are_so/,changemyview,"Seems like every young person now is suffering from some form of anxiety or depression, sometimes even wearing their diagnosis like a badge of honor and boasting about it on social media for attention. It is now the norm to see a therapist and have fifteen pill bottles cluttering the bathroom sink. Like if you’re not on antidepressants, you’re the weird one in a group.

I think, not for every case, but for many, the reason why mental health issues are so prevalent in the younger population is the lack of discipline. Kids used to have a form of respect. They were disciplined properly by teachers and parents. Sometimes slapped or spanked when necessary (not promoting abuse that leaves bruises or injuries). But they were disciplined and that set them up for a straight path.

When you are coddled and enabled, you become entitled and narcissistic, which is obviously a huge issue in our current generations with social media. Narcissism has been rising over recent years, and you can see it manifested in entitlement and victim mentality and getting offended over everything (hypersensitivity).

Discipline, for lack of better words, knocks the bullshit out of a person, and that is what people today so desperately need. A good slap to the head so all the bullshit can fall out and common sense can come in. People need to be put in their place. They need to understand the world does not revolve around them. That they are not special. 

Mental health issues often arise when a person is not living correctly. It is like a warning bell. Perhaps the answer is more discipline and less coddling.

Edit: everybody is getting caught up on hitting. As I said I AM NOT ADVOCATING PHYSICAL ABUSE. Spanking is not abuse! I am advocating DISCIPLINE which is not just physical but is also moral and encourages healthy behaviors. It is setting boundaries and teaching a child what is wrong, not just telling them they can do whatever they want and they are just perfect.

Edit: I have conceded on spanking. Let’s forget that part of it for now. Because you’re all missing my main point - a lack of discipline is responsible for the rampant narcissism, anxiety, and depression in the population."

The root problem is that the Higher Ed industry is out of control in its ballooning costs. The one group that truly needs the help are people with college debt who don’t have a degree, but that could have been addressed much more equitably by just expanding and improving income based repayment programs. If this issue was important for democrats they could also have fit a bill removing the exclusion of college debt from bankruptcy (which is another part of the root problem) into reconciliation.

Even the Republican tax cuts involved some nominal tax relief for people on the bottom end of the earning ladder. This is a pure cash transfer from the bottom 50th percentile into the top 50th income percentile. I have yet to see anyone who favors this policy address this injustice — all I see is deflection and mockery. CMV?

Edit: a policy I could absolutely get behind in a deflationary or recession environment would be a 10,000 capital debt forgiveness for any earners making under the median income (maybe phased out as income goes up). So any financing of capital expenses that can be shown to be an investment in future earning could be forgiven, eg a food truck, or trade equipment, or even a car to get to work. But in an inflationary environment like the one we are in that sort of thing sounds like lunacy.

Edit 2: So I’ve been thinking about this pretty much nonstop for the last few days, and I had this realization:  I had the thought, “Would I hate it if 15 years ago they said, ‘We are changing the way we calculate financial aid to convert the first 10,000 of student loans into grants?’” I think I would have thought that was totally fine, and this is essentially the same result, outside of some marginal benefits that the hypothetical situation might have had in convincing someone to go ahead and attend who might have been dissuaded by the need to take a loan….

So this inconsistency has led me to seriously doubt that the approbation I feel towards this policy is as reasonable as I was thinking. I seriously doubt anyone here cares or will even read this comment, but I thought I would put it out there anyway."

It judges ground-rope-ball at one star.

But I don't think it would be such a bad game.  You get a sturdy eyelet at ground level, six feet or so of rope, and you are bouncing/rolling the ball somewhat similarly to standard tetherball. Obviously you can't get it rolled around the eyelet like a pole would allow, so the scoring cannot be ""all wrapped up"" but you could get points for hitting the other player or maybe just how many times you get it to go past a certain goal line.

I'm not saying it deserves a full five stars, but I think you could pretty easily get to three stars.  Maybe even four if we have multiple players in a ""Four Square"" type configuration plus the rope."

If Russian history is examined the issues is always the same the western underbelly is a weakness which has been exploited countless times throughout history with Russia suffering each time ie Napoleon,polish Lithuanian commonwealth,world war 2 and to a lesser extent world war 1 

In ussr this was contoured by having the eastern block as a buffer zone which was there to provide shielding to Russia .
If Russia is examined 2013 prior to Crimean annexation finland/Sweden are neutral , Belarus is an ally/neutral, Ukraine is a mild ally/neutral . With Crimea leased to Russian fleet the south is secure. While the rest of the eastern block is mainly nato ie Poland,baltics 

Since nato and the wests only way to Russia is through the baltics a relatively narrow field through which to invade which is manageable. 


With Ukraine looking like they could cancel the port lease and this allow the USA to dock its shop next to Russias southern underbelly which would be a strategic disaster and a major threat to national security (akin to China being able to put its ships Mexico not far from Florida and having USA lose its naval military bases there ) (I brought this hypothetical example up to illustrate the danger this would pose )


Putin acted and took Crimea securing the southern underbelly , now again with Ukraine looking poised for nato membership . He had to act . As having nato troops literally at Russias underbelly is a major security threat imagine if war breaks out nato mechanized advance would be pretty short to reach Russia proper . If nato could put troops there , it increase the trial of if in the event of war and they attack first they could disable many nuclear solos which is the only thing that can garuntee Russia safety from the west 

A solution to this would have been a similar agreement to what Sweden and Finland with Russia and nato (as that took the interest of both parties into account ) neutral Ukraine not demilitarized"

1000,2022-08-28,CMV: Microtransactions and loot boxes are the most reprehensible monetization strategy in video games.,u/MostRecommendation84,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x00ryk/cmv_microtransactions_and_loot_boxes_are_the_most/,changemyview,"In short, I generally respect/disdain monetization schemes on the following ranking: 

1. Base game/expansions-These are games that have a hefty initial price tag, and each subsequent content release is massive and also has a respectable price tag(see: old Blizzard games). I think this is the most ideal for consumers but I understand it's the least profitable for publishers(though it *is* still profitable), so when companies do this they definitely earn my goodwill. 
2. Base Game/DLC packs(Addons)-These are games that are almost always discounted as a base game, because they're hoping to turn out your pockets with modest purchases for an equivalent modest amount of content. (See: The Sims, Anno, Stellaris). I think this is probably the most fair setup for all parties, consumers get exactly what they paid for, quality content sees better sales, shit half-assed content flops and no one gets burned. And yeah it can get greedy, but still I'd rather pay $120 for a full game and that be the end of it than deal with the shit below.
3. Subscription models-This one can be hit or miss, because it really depends on the speed/quality of the dev team to release new content justifying the subscription, but it can work. Games that do an either/or with DLC and expansions(ESO) are fair, WoW for most of its history was good about releasing content, Fallout 76 on the other hand you were basically burning your subscription money. Still, mostly tolerable. 
4. Then, there's microtransactions/loot boxes. The games where you always exchange money in not-quite-right amounts for game currency, the in-game stores with items for $0.99-$3.99, the ones where you can literally spend $10 for 10 chances to win bundles of items you may or may not want. These are shameless cash grabs that have been repeatedly found to essentially operate like casinos(and fined/sued in several countries as such), they prey on dopamine dependency and the sunken cost fallacy to empty out the consumer's pocket. They're predatory and underscore a profound disrespect for the consumer. F2P doesn't excuse this behavior either because it's literally executing the ""first time's free"" strategy used by drug dealers. 

If you can convince me to reorder these in any way I'll award a delta, and while I wouldn't mind having my view changed, I'm at a point where if I find out a game has microtransactions, I won't bother with so much as a trailer or a livestream: it's dead to me. CMV"

But i do believe money does buy happiness. Vacations, experiences, people, food, health, schooling, opportunity, are all things that will allow you to live a happy life and they all in some way require money. Another point is that there IS a difference between being happy and being happy with what you have, aka settling. Todays money is the equivalent of hunter and gatherers food. If you want a happy and healthy tribe you have to bring back the food. imagine how much happiness would be within a tribe that just killed an elk. I feel like this isn’t really or shouldn’t really be an unpopular opinion but i’d like to see if anyone actually disagrees.

Update: I’d like to point out that there are a lot of things that give you happiness, and i believe money is one of the pillars of the structure. without it you can still be happy, but in todays world the structure would be unstable."

My partner wants to start a podcast, met a woman through a friend who has experience with this and asked her to meet for drinks. Before they went, he mentioned it to me, and despite trusting him, I was very uncomfortable with the idea of drinks with what seems like it could be a telephone conversation. 

I don’t want to be controlling nor would I dictate what this grown man can do, but would others feel uncomfortable in my predicament?  I wish he had asked me prior to making this plan. 

I’m a professional myself and would never meet with a male junior to me in my field for drinks as I’d be concerned that wouldn’t come across as professional.  However, I realize how I feel isn’t how my partner or others necessarily feel.

Anything that looks like a date when you’re in a relationship should be a boundary or conversation (to make sure the other person is comfortable)

From attacking the French and English in the west, to trying to subjugate various countries in the Balkans to having the brilliant idea of invading the Soviet Union, the Germans just kept making the war harder for themselves whilst making their goals further and further unreachable as the war staggered on and they were eventually chased all the way back to Berlin.

Not exactly sure what was going through Hitler’s brain at the time or when he ended his life in the Fuhrer bunker though I have to imagine that whatever mistakes he might have wanted to avoid at various points of the war it would still have ended terribly for them.

From the Allies having the control of most of the world’s resources, to the Soviet Union being too big of a block to try and knock down, to the unstable and unreliable allies that Germany had on its side, to the ideological zeal that prevented many alliances that could have taken place simply vanishing into the wind, to the massive industrial output being underestimated by the axis, to the poor planning of certain plans, to the various manpower issues that Germany suffered from, to the poor prioritization in subjecting various “””subhuman””” (their words not mine) cultures or deficiencies of human beings rather than building more war material.

Another issue is that time was simply not on Germany’s side due to all the continuing escalations that were occurring from the Japanese and Italians that various other powers were going to be fighting Germany regardless thereby tipping the scales even if the Germans wanted to keep the war on a small scale. While I won’t say that the Americans or Soviets would inevitably join if the Germans decided to draw the war out, it certainly didn’t look positive for them either. Secondly the British simply wouldn’t have fallen or settled for a white peace as they had the industry and manpower to fight on and had a superior air force to begin bombing Germany itself during nighttime. The Soviets had the manpower and industry to fight on and a massive distance between the German army and the relocated industry in the Urals. And the Americans? Well they had so much that they could sustain a war on two front against two major enemies that Germany itself could only have dreamed of either from the First World War or from the Second World War that they ended up losing anyway.

With all of this in mind, I just do not see a (rational and realistic) way in which the Germans could win. Everything was against them from the very beginning in the invasion of the Second Polish Republic to the scorching deserts of North Africa, to the hellscape of Far Eastern Europe to the collapse of the Reich itself.

It’s not all about burgers and hot dogs.,u/StrangeSPHERE,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x05ebw/cmv_american_cuisine_is_so_underrated_its_not_all/,changemyview,"People tend to immediately gravitate towards burgers, hot dogs, fries, greasy/fatty foods when they think of American cuisine. I don’t understand that stereotype. Sure we love our burgers and hot dogs, but there’s so much more to it that I think many people don’t know of. First of all, we’re a melting pot, which is beautiful. Cultures from all over the world have left their mark on this country and because of this we have plenty of dishes that deserve the light of day when American cuisine is brought up. 

Here’s a few I’d like to list:

1. Jambalaya
2. Gumbo
3. Tex-Mex
4. American BBQ
5. Cajun dishes
6. Creole dishes
7. Philly Cheesesteak
8. Chicago’s deep dish pizza 
9. NYC-style Pizza
10. NYC Chopped cheese
11. Boston’s Lobster rolls
12. Sloppy Joe Sandwich
13. Pulled pork BBQ sandwich
14. Soul food (Don’t tell me this is just a mix of foods put together. It’s still a popular combination dish that originated in the south. The same argument can be made for many dishes around the world that combine multiple foods together) 
15. Spaghetti and meatballs (Yes it’s American. Italians from Italy do not eat spaghetti with meatballs; they may have meat mixed in their sauce but not with meatballs; this combination originated here)
16. American alfredo
17. American tacos
18. American Chinese 
19. Southern chicken-fried Steak
20. Shrimp and grits
21. Funeral potatoes
22. Peach cobbler
23. Pizookie

I’ll leave it at that in order to spare this post from becoming any longer. 

Some are well known, others aren’t. But that is the same case for every cuisine. Just because some dishes aren’t popular, it doesn’t change the fact that the USA has it’s own cuisine inspired by cultures worldwide. 

Another point I’d like to make clear, some of these originated in America while other dishes (ex: jambalaya) are twists; that still doesn’t disqualify them. A lot of countries  have their own twists of a dish that you see everywhere in other cultures (ex: paella). 

Some cultures even have dishes that they’re not aware of their origin (ex: the Dominican kipes, which was introduced by the Lebanese [kibbeh). At the end of the day, kipes are still Dominican regardless. So the point I’m trying to make is that we all have dishes that are inspired by others in some ways; The USA is no different and deserves more recognition when it comes to its’ cuisine.

Edit: Updated the list. 

Also, some of these dishes are fatty, but that’s not the point I’m trying to make. American cuisine is usually ONLY regarded as fatty foods, which is NOT always the case at all. It has some greasy/fattiness to some dishes (as do other cultures btw, it’s called comfort food), but not all the time. Please focus on changing my view that America has a proper cuisine which is underrated, not that ""all"" foods are “fatty”."

Committing crime / not working and claiming from the state goes against that and causes more problems for people who were born in that country and pay taxes. 

Where I live, the right to a private and family life means that a criminal can move to my country, kill, rape or even beat someone up and rob them, and as long as they had a child before committing this crime, they cannot be removed. So we are saying, coke, have a child and then do whatever you want. Does their right to a family life, extend so it has to be in the country they moved to and committed crimes in?

This post assumes that the person in question has permission to work when they come to the country, IE, they are a legal immigrant.

Edit: Forgot to add they should have to serve their sentence first, before being deported

From my own experience you have 2 classes of dangerous; the aggressive speeding drivers who have no concern for anyone on the road except themselves. Dangerous for obvious reasons. Then the overly cautious, scared and clueless drivers who don’t know basic traffic rules. These people THINK their being safe drivers when in reality I think they cause more harm than the latter. Merging into highways at 40mph, driving way below the speed limit, not knowing how a yield sign works. Put a camera at a round about for one day and you’ll have all the evidence you’ll need about needing drivers education. Not to mention the amount of daily accidents I almost get into from elderly drivers. Strict traffic law enforcement and more drivers education could limit the daily driving problems we experience.

1006,2022-08-28,"CMV: Americans are many things, but being exceptionally racist isn’t a one of them",u/cheeseattractedwoman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x0d56g/cmv_americans_are_many_things_but_being/,changemyview,"I’ll start off by saying that, I’m not denying racism doesn’t exist in America. Racism, in some form or another exists everywhere. 

Also, I don’t live in the mainland US. I’ve visited the mainland US a few times, and have interacted with plenty of American tourists and Americans.  I wasn’t born in the USA, and I’ve traveled internationally as well. 

What I am saying that, is that, racism in America isn’t really especially rampant, widespread, or really uniquely an American issue at all. 

America, in the modern sense, is an INCREDIBLY tolerant society as a whole. 

What I see blamed on modern racism, such as high incarceration rates for the black community, police brutality, income inequality, and more, are really the results of generational poverty in the black community, which is the legacy of racism, slavery and Jim Crow. It is the direct legacy of racism, but it is not “direct” racism. 

You can see similar issues in poor white communities that are also the victim of generational poverty due to other reasons such as an industry in the area ceasing to exist. 

In recent times, many efforts have been put forward to try to combat this, such as affirmative action, but, it takes a long time to heal this pattern of generational poverty and the lifestyles that occur from being in these generationally poor, income restricted communities. 

But, America, in the modern sense, is not a “racist” country. India is a racist country. Russia is a racist country. Ukraine is a racist country. China is a racist country. America is not generally a racist country. 

In these countries, chanting the n word at black people and spitting on them is acceptable and encouraged. The average person does not condone interracial or intercultural marriage. The average person in these countries doesn’t even view other ethnicities as fully human. 

Americans on an individual level tend to be quite accepting, and the racism Americans usually demonstrate is more classist at and not actually geared towards the race or ethnicity of the person. 

It’s more subtle because racism is so taboo. And even that subtle, classist flavor of racism is widely condemned in a way that the similar flavor of racism towards the Romani is not. Racism in America is structurally based, not originating from regular people. 

Americans, are also way more anti-racist than most other western nations. 

They protest over things happening because they care, and people of all colors join such protests. 

In America, you regularly see groups of all colors making friends, dating, and hanging out. You see successful assimilated immigrants living in nice neighborhoods. 

A lot of countries do not take race and ethnicity related data, which effectively hides the problems of racial relations within these countries. 

A great example would be Brazil, which was seen as a colorblind utopia until a political dossier was published in the 1980s examining internal race relations in the country that pretty much threw that idea out the window. 

Similarly, many European countries do not collect racial inequality data. They pretend not to “see color”. 
 
When I visited France at the age of 15, even I as a teenager could see something fishy was going on for a supposed post racial utopia. 

Outside of the city center, were grey, drab run down buildings full of black and brown people. 


In the city center, pretty much everyone was white except for “the help”.  It was a very segregated society and you could see that it wasn’t exactly a unified place.

And unlike the U.S, which also has poor minority areas, you don’t nearly see nearly the same level of successfully assimilated immigrants and people intermixing socially. 

Social cohesion is quite rough in many parts of mainland Europe. 

In France, they outright ban the religious freedom of Islamic women by prohibiting what garments can be warn at swimming areas, effectively banning them from those areas. These is a blatantly racist and xenophobic policy, and not a classist one. 

In America people would not be happy at all about this, but in Europe this kind of act is condoned and supported because someone feeling comfortable with their customs apparently violates those around them. 

But, if someone is offended by European customs, such as Zwarte Piet, they get told that they’re overly sensitive. 

Cultural chauvinism is huge in Europe, and a lot of Europeans are proud of their country’s former colonial endeavors. 

Could you imagine Americans being proud of slavery? How much backlash that would cause? 

Americans accept differences a lot more readily than other developed nations. 

Other developed nations, minus Australia and Canada tend to either try to force you to assimilate but will never truly accept you. 

Personally , I’m maybe a bit biased because I am a woman who has posted her photos online. 

Whenever I receive racist comments online, 99% of the time it isn’t American people. 

It’s so much so, that I actively hide my identity on my art accounts because in the past I’ve gotten many many racist comments usually from Europeans when they see what I look like. 

Ironically, despite Europeans saying that they don’t believe in the one drop rule, even though I am obviously mixed, they seem to only see me as black. 

I’ve been called an American abomination for being mixed race even though I wasn’t born in the U.S., and have found my photos posted by Europeans on 4Chan as an example of a dysgenic, mixed race abomination. 

Similarly, I’ve only been racially profiled by recent immigrant bosses at work for being the wrong ethnicity. 

Just thought I’d share my views. The USA is a mess but exceptionally rampant racism in the modern sense isn’t a one of them. The USA is actively trying to work on the legacy of its racial issues instead of burying its head in the sand.

I can solidly say, I’ve never met an openly racist white American adult. Americans have no idea how privileged they are in terms of acceptance."

There should be a requirement of minimum time worked in the field of study, so that people actually make reasonable investments into their future and the government isn’t wasting money on 5 years of enjoying student life that end with a completely useless degree, or with a person who has learned so little that they are still not qualified to work in their chosen field or with someone who ends up opting out of the workforce right after finishing their degree. 

To be more concrete, student loans should only be forgiven after someone has actually worked for at least 5 years in a job that requires or at least typically expects a degree in their field of study. If you study art, you can get loan forgiveness after working as an artist or art teacher for 5 years, but not by working at a fast food restaurant. As a computer science student you can get your loan forgiven by working as a software engineer but not as a cashier in a supermarket. 

There would have to be an exception for disabilities acquired after beginning one’s studies, that prevent a person from getting a job in the field, but other than that I cannot think of any necessary exceptions."

Doesn't seem all that useless to me.

Prices must drop to (virtually) zero thanks  to massive improvements in productivity, and **we can all sit and get fat without doing any work**. I would assume this is the holy grail of economics.

But  to achieve this, we need massive deflation. The end goal is for us to  earn enough money working one hour every year, so we can afford  everything and then **relax for the remaining 8,395 hours.**

But  everyone talks about deflation as if it's a terrible thing, and I know  all the arguments why. So how do we achieve ""good"" deflation so that we  can make meaningful progress towards utopia? And **we need to work towards full unemployment too!**

**Definition:** I've often  heard economics defined as the process of allocating limited goods in a  world of unlimited wants. So the goal is to eliminate this gap as much  as possible so that we have virtually unlimited goods. Only then can we  sit back and relax and let our robot servants take care of us!

**Wage Price Spiral Makes this Impossible:** To achieve our goals, inflation is fine as long as wages more than increase to make up for it, so that we have effective deflation and people can work less. But in classical economics, the wage/price spiral leads to ever increasing inflation.

**Conclusion: We are doing economics wrong.**"

2314,2022-08-29,CMV: It is a fantasy that the US government could be overthrown by civilians with the small-arms allowed by the 2nd Amendment,u/phileconomicus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x0rmie/cmv_it_is_a_fantasy_that_the_us_government_could/,changemyview,"It seems to be a widely shared belief that civilians armed with the kind of weapons - pistols, shotguns, semi-automatic rifles - permitted under the 2nd amendment could successfully overthrow the US government (and that this is a good thing because it keeps the US government from becoming a tyranny). I don't find this credible since the US military is so large, well-equipped, and trained that it seems obviously capable of defeating a bunch of civilians.

The main counter-argument I have come across is ""Look at Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. Clearly the US can be defeated by lightly armed but highly motivated rebels""

But I don't think these examples demonstrate that.

1. In all those cases, the rebels were supported by hostile neighbouring countries (N. Vietnam even got MiG fighter jets), so it wasn't true that the US was fighting the rebels alone. This would not be the case for a US rebellion. (In addition, such external support and safety allows insurgents to organise themselves and thereby become far more effective than a bunch of similarly motivated fighters would be.)
2. In all those cases, the US government was defending non-vital interests, and withdrew when it was clear that the cost of defending those interests was greater than giving them up. In contrast, a domestic revolution threatens the very existence of the US government so it would not have the option to walk away. (Compare with the US civil war, in which the US government was prepared to pay, as a proportionate of the then population, more lives than all America's other wars put together. Also contrast with the success of the US war of independence - Britain walked away from a war of choice when it got too expensive.)
3. (I put this last point in parentheses because it relates more to the claim that the second amendment protects against tyranny. The central strategy of all those rebel groups was terrorism against other civilians. They challenged the ability of the local government to protect civilian populations - especially outside cities - from political violence, and thereby undermined the legitimacy of the official government. Essentially this is a strategy of mafia-like extortion rather than liberation.)

Have I missed something?

*Note: I am focused here on disproving the specific claim that civilians with small-arms could overthrow the US government. I won't engage with commenters regarding the wider issue of gun control unless it is relevant to that.*

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are referencing the Jan 6 insurrection as an example of an almost successful armed civilian overthrow of the government. But this did not come close to overthrowing the US government (or rather, overturning the will of the democratic majority to end the Trump government). Furthermore, it would have been even less successful if it had succeeded further in either its more violent aspirations (by hanging Mike Pence, Nancy Pelosi, etc in the Senate chamber) or its more pseudo-law aspirations (make Pence sign something that declares Trump the winner). This is because none of those 'successes' would have weakened the power/authority of the US government one jot, but they would have provoked a far more unified and severe response.

Edit 2: I am finding a lot of wishful thinking in the arguments being brought here. In particular, many arguments seem to depend on the US government occupying an improbable sweet spot where it is sufficiently tyrannical to inspire very large numbers of civilians to risk their lives to overthrow it, while also not being so tyrannical that it would use its resources as ruthlessly as [real tyrannical regimes do](https://mwi.usma.edu/dont-underestimate-the-bear-russia-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-effective-modern-counterinsurgents/) when suppressing uprisings. For example, people keep repeating the claim that US soldiers would refuse orders to shoot at US civilians because they swore an oath to  justice or something. Or that the US government would find it politically embarrassing to kill large numbers of rebel civilians. I call this wishful thinking or fantasy because it offers a defense of the effectiveness of 2nd amendment remedies based on assuming very specific and convenient conditions (often apparently only to be found in the case of America).

97,2022-08-29,"CMV: ""A woman is a woman because they identify as a woman"" is not a compelling argument for the sake of affirming transgenderism and actually harms the trans movement",u/Friedchicken2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x0stgi/cmv_a_woman_is_a_woman_because_they_identify_as_a/,changemyview,"I want to clarify a few things first.

1. I believe transgenderism to be a real phenomenon that can be truly measured (by doctors, gender dysphoria, etc)
2. I support transitioning as long as we're following what the data and medical professionals are saying.
3. This is a long post so bear with me. I also understand that I'm NOT a professional in any regard on these issues so I could very well be wrong on a lot of this.

My issue is with how far the current social and political climate has taken what it means to identify as trans. Transgenderism is measurable. It's measurable most notably by gender dysphoria (diagnosis), but it can also be measured through other means of testing by medical professionals (psychological analyses and so forth). Transgenderism generally implies that to transition to something there must be a difference between those two things. In this case, there are very prevalent features of MALES and FEMALES that can create gender dysmorphic feelings. This includes depression, anxiety, and discomfort that stems from feeling like the individual has the wrong genitalia. In addition, hormones and puberty can also fuel the pain and discomfort as the individual is experiencing many changes (sex-specific) in a body that they do not want to be in.

With all of this said, it seems like we've begun to blur the lines between what it means to be a man or woman. Personally, I didn't really have an issue with this, as it generally attacked the concepts of gender roles or other social prerogatives that don't exactly need to be there.

The problem is that the phrase ""a woman is a woman because they simply identify as a woman"" is commonplace now in trans discourse. This defeats the entire purpose of what it means to be a transgender individual. Transgender individuals almost unanimously (I know not all but most) experience gender dysphoria. As mentioned before, this implies a deep discontent with their current sex and body. The phrase I mentioned seems to ignore the fact that there are distinct differences between men and women, physical and mental.

Now, considering that transgender individuals don't always receive surgery for entire sex changes, my affirmation of transgender transition is not reliant on genital change. It's reliant on all the other proclivities that encapsulate a transgender person after their choice to transition. That is what affirms their transition. The way they present themselves, the way they speak, the bathroom they go into, the job they seek, the relationships they create, etc, can all be a result of their transition (as well as alleviation of gender dysphoria).

From what I understand, some transgender individuals describe their transitions as a ""new life"" given to them. They finally feel like the other gender, but they also adopt the social and (in many cases) biological behaviors of the other gender. This is important because stating that a woman is a woman because they identify as one negates the harsh reality that transgender individuals do NOT just identify as their desired sex. Along with their identification they experience intense scrutiny, inner turmoil, and confusion on their path to be themselves. Real, medically documented turmoil. This phrase is unhelpful and trivializes their experiences. In addition I think as a byproduct it may produce individuals who aren't actually trans but lead them to believe they're trans because they sort of ""feel"" like they are without medical opinion, and therefore will identify as trans.

My other small point includes the strangeness of the phrase ""a woman is a woman because they identify as a woman"" because it's inherently circular in nature. The premise is obviously true so the conclusion must be, right? The issue with circular definitions is that they suspend judgment. This phrase is absolute, prompts no further discussion, and doesn't actually get us any closer to understanding gender constructs or ideologies in a healthy way.

I think what I'm ultimately trying to say is that simply stating that you're a woman is not enough imo to be treated as one. There are many more social and biological realities that encapsulate that definition."

2,2022-08-29,"CMV: The loan forgiveness bill might help a little, but doesn't seem to be as ""generous"" as it is being described and could actually result in no financial benefits to those with loans forgiven.",u/nhlms81,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x0t0xw/cmv_the_loan_forgiveness_bill_might_help_a_little/,changemyview,"I did a little analysis on the financials. the inputs are based on the generally available averages.

total number of people w/ federal student loans: \~45M

average amount of student loans: \~37k

average number of years to pay off loans: \~20 (this is the actual avg to pay off, not the avg length of the loan at inception)

average interest rate: 5%

average college grad income: 70k

average forgiven amount: $15k (range is between 10-20, so just picked 15).

w/ these numbers in mind, the average college grad will pay about $1,777 / year in total loan payments, $711 towards principle, and just over $1k in interest. that's a monthly budget of about $150 / month to student loans. this is a derived number, as the when googled, the average is listed as about $400. i arrived at about that number when i used the average duration of the loan (10 years) as issued. however, the actual average duration to pay off is about 20 years, which i suspect the google answer didn't account for.

if we discount the average borrows loan burden by 15k, the average owed amount goes from \~35k to \~20k. Across that same 20 year period, this forgiven borrow will pay about $1k / year against his / her loan, \~$400 in principle, and about $600 in interest, for a monthly budget of about $90.

bear in mind, i'm assuming the total student loan burden is 100% federal. this isn't the case, but the amount of private vs. federal is relatively low and its just easier to assume the total burden is homogenous across lenders,  i'm assuming every single borrower gets federal student loans forgiven (which won't happen as some will exceed the income requirements), and i'm assuming every borrower is paying monthly minimums, i'm assuming they haven't consolidated, etc. etc. its not meant to be perfect, more directional.

This results in a net monthly savings of about $60 / borrower, and a total monthly savings of about $3B. the total monthly is a big number back into the economy, but the per individual savings seems less exciting. its about one tank of gas. not meaningless, but probably not life changing.

the other dimension that is somewhat concerning is the taxable income question. the federal gov't has indicated they will not tax the forgiven amount, but the states still could. this basically means the average taxable income of new college grads, across the 42 states w/ income tax @ a 5% average income tax will now have a tax burden of $85k instead of $70k. this would result in about a $28B new tax levy (again, at the state level, not the federal). if the fed changes its mind, it would obviously be different.

this is where i want you to CMV. in my back of the napkin analysis, the total annual savings per loan forgiven would be about $750. guess what the average new tax liability would be per person if the states tax the forgiven loan amount? about $700.

TL / DR: w/ analysis, the actual impact of federal student loan forgiveness seems to be fairly small / certainly not life changing. additionally, if the states decide to tax the amount forgiven as income, it looks to me like the additional taxable income negates the gains to the individual.

to change my mind:

1. show me **catastrophic** math errors (as in existential threats to the analysis that make it off by orders of magnitude). i'm not claiming its perfect, and i'm dubious we're going to internet sleuth together the ""accurate and precise one"". each analysis we do is going to be directional.
   1. **EDIT**: and, as hoped, a number of people have pointed out one existential error is that the taxable burden happens ONLY in Y1, meaning, for the remaining duration of the loan, the $750 annual savings is fully recognized by the borrower. i gave out a few deltas for this already, so i'm considering this ""tapped out"" re: changing my POV. 
   2. if there is a publisher / journalist who has already done this and it substantially contradicts the above (and its not obviously pro / anti), that works too.
2. convince me that all 42 states w/ income tax have no intention to tax this as income."

Specifically, FtM transgender people use testosterone for its virilizing effect. Testosterone is naturally extremely low in females compared to males (in the magnitude of about 15 ng/dL vs. 500 ng/dL), so they need to inject supraphysiological amounts to induce changes to the body that would be impossible otherwise.

Another similar condition is bigorexia, which is a kind of body dysmorphia that often affects bodybuilders, and makes them feel uncomfortable in their body because they want to be more muscolar or bigger.
People with this condition find comfort in the use of testosterone or other steroids, but have to resort to illicit ways to acquire them, since their body dysmorphia is in some way seen as less important (or more as a mental illness that as a disorder) relative to the first type of body dysmorphia that I mentioned.

I think if testosterone (or other virilizing hormones) are too dangerous for bodybuilders, they are also too dangerous for females wanting to transition; and if they are mild enough for females to transition, then they are also mild enough for bodybuilders wanting to get bigger.
I would be ok with either way, but I don't understand why a type of body dysmorphia is glamourized and the other is shamed."

Ever since I found out about the fanfiction site AO3 and its anti-censorship of fiction stance, I have had no problem with stories and such featuring elements like non-con, loli, and pretty much everything else morally dubious. I fear this is a problem because Im in a very small minority here, and whenever I run across art of “problematic” ships or themes, everyone else will go nuts calling out that type of content and saying things like this should be illegal, especially in the case of loli drawings, but my attitude is almost always meh its just pixels nobody was hurt and as long as the artist/writer isnt glorifying said content or normalizing it, I have zero issue with it existing and think art shouldnt be ripped down because its morally wrong by real life standards. In the case of loli/shota content, if the characters are realistic i.e resemble real children anatomically and not anime proportioned, and act like real kids then that is a different story, but chibi characters and stuff like the MHA fandom is fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I dont want to confuse being okay with problematic content existing and actually liking it, I have read some fics on the AO3 site that made me press the back button and never read it again. Do I personally find loli/cub/non-con/incest etc content weird? Yeah a lot of the time, but I would never go so far as to harass or threaten the creator, or even post a comment saying how much I dislike it. I also want to point out that I noticed is that this guttural reaction of disgust upon seeing controversial content is largely a Western thing, as in Japan with animanga you will see a lot more of this stuff, and what they consider ok to include in fiction is a lot broader than in the US and other Western countries. I just feel like the people who say fiction affects reality are no different than the boomers that say video games cause real world violence, despite the multiple studies done saying there is no correlation. Any and all discussion is welcome, and anyone who changes my view will be awarded a delta.

EDIT: This post blew up, I wasnt expecting that. A lot of you brought up some very good points. This post was mainly about fanfiction and the war vs pro and anti-shippers. However, stuff like Birth of a Nation can definitely have an effect on reality, though not the intention of this post. I made this in reponse to anti-shippers sending death threats and doxxing people who write this kinda stuff or who have problematic ships in a fandom. I do agree that kids and teens shouldnt be reading smut or looking at porn, and well, its minors a lot of the time who act like this, but I suppose thats because they are young and impressionable, and being minors they dont yet fully have a grasp on the difference between fiction and reality that a mentally healthy adult would"

Fashion aside, I understand that the iconography around the transfer of power, by the act of transferring the sash, would become a visible norm and tradition, which is harder to break than the simple act of a white house visit, as it is done today.

I believe that the presenting of the sash, from the current President to his or her successor as part of the official inauguration ceremony, would lead to a more stable transfer of power in the US. This will diminish the idea that someone did not actually win the presidential race.

*Edit: I agree with a lot of points here. It would not be of so much help. My views are basically changed.*

*Edit 2: Except, I do not agree with the ones regarding the sash being ugly (as that is a design question, it does not have to be), or itself being a monarchical symbol, as the numbers of republics that use it, in the Americas alone, are in the high digits.*"
0,2022-08-29,cmv: The only problem with America is the voting system.,u/collateralaoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x12nx6/cmv_the_only_problem_with_america_is_the_voting/,changemyview,"The biggest problem with America is the voting system, and in consequence, the two party system. Abolishing the electoral college, instant runoff voting, approval based voting etc seem like good solutions. The big institutional problems with America (and other countries for that matter) usually can only be solved by a governing entity, everything else is not a problem because it can't be solved. 

One of the main reasons a two party system is problematic is that voters often times vote based on what political parties they don't like, a huge amount of voters vote Democrat simply because they don't like Republican.

Another is (I sort of thought of this myself), is that in a two party system, different political parties tend towards similar values and ideals to appease the most people, especially with the fact that you are encouraged to vote. This can be demonstrated with Hotelling's model of Spatial Competition. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jILgxeNBK_8&amp;ab_channel=TED-Ed) is a simple 4 minute ted ed video showing this. You can imagine two parties placed on a political compass (left/right, auth/lib) and how they naturally tend together.

In a free market, unregulated monopolies are negative for the market, as there is no competition, they can charge what they want for their product, and the quality of the product decreases, this is especially bad a political system as it is an all or nothing type system, as the party with the majority will hold 100% of the power.

Of course, a different voting system would be quite hard to implement, as it would require a fundamental rework of the mindset of the majority of the American population (Republican vs Democrat) as well as the fact that it would go against the governing parties, as more smaller parties would lead to less power to them. The only way this could be feasibly implemented would be by large scale protest or something. But that seems rather unlikely for the time being.

I might have been slightly misleading in the title but imo if you take any large-scale problems (climate change, wealth inequality, etc), and think, ""why haven't these been solved yet?"" it is most likely because of the political party, which is because of the voting system."

0,2022-08-29,CMV: it makes practical sense that we should only fundamentally value what is within our volition.,u/quantum_dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x1330a/cmv_it_makes_practical_sense_that_we_should_only/,changemyview,"For context, this is a Stoic (the philosophy, not the character trait) principle, but I think it makes sense with or without the exact Stoic conception of what a good volition is. I'm reasonably confident in my reasoning, but it actually *isn't* a widely-held view, so there's a good chance there's a good reason for that.

To clarify in detail what I mean:

* ""Practical sense"": there is no reasonable advantage to alternative approaches
* ""Fundamentally value"": it's necessary and reasonable to prefer and seek/avoid things outside of our volition, but they shouldn't be seen as fundamentally good or evil in themselves
* ""Within our volition"": our beliefs and judgements, including the judgement that it is appropriate to act in a particular way

The argument:

All of our causal influence comes through our volition; we have no other mechanism to voluntarily impact anything. Therefore, to the extent that any desirable outcome is caused, or undesirable outcome is avoided, by us, it is specifically the result of something within our volition. This implies that valuing ""having a volition that does the thing"" can be just as effective as valuing ""doing the thing"".

However, when we value something, we're also emotionally attached to it, which opens us up to anxiety and suffering. If that doesn't make us act more effectively or convey further advantage*, then it doesn't make sense to risk it.

A key assumption here is that humans can, to some degree, choose what to value and that our emotions follow. I think that's borne out empirically.

So, to outline the argument:

1. All voluntary impacts result, to the extent they are voluntary, from something in our volition. Therefore, fully effective action is possible entirely through our volition.
2. We should only choose to experience suffering (to the extent that we have a choice) if there is an advantage in doing so.
3. If we place fundamental value on things outside our volition, we open ourselves up to more suffering.
4. By (2,3), we should only place such value if it has an advantage.
5. Such placing of value does not have an advantage by (1), so we should not do it.

An important clarification here: the agent who only places fundamental value in their own volition is still quite capable of things like joy and love. One can strongly prefer another's well-being for its own sake, and take joy in things like being a good friend/partner, working hard for the common good, and so on. We're not discussing an uncaring robot.

*There could be an argument to be made that experiencing fear and suffering and so on makes for a fuller life, which would be an advantage. I don't find that convincing on the face of it, but there's room for a compelling argument there.

The obvious argument I can imagine to change my view is to argue that there is an advantage - either in practical action or in living a worthwhile life - to fundamentally valuing things outside of an advantage. That's not to say no other line of reasoning will be convincing, though.

I am empirically confident that humans can choose what we value and that that does influence our emotional state, so challenging that won't be convincing."

I'm seeing it more and more with athletes, starting with Simone Biles during the Winter Olympics, and now celebrities are canceling their own tours. What irks me more are the people defending -- sometimes praising -- their actions when others are affected by them. Don't get me wrong, people should be able to get the help they need but running away and letting down not just fans, but organizers and workers of those events is not it.

These celebrities get away with it because people allow them to. Nobody will punish them because they're scared of the backlash they'll receive for supposedly not caring about their mental health. They have a great opportunity, and sure it comes with hardships, but they can afford to take the hit financially. Meanwhile, those below them are working hard to get a spot on the Olympics team or an opportunity to perform in front of large audiences.

I think people's mental health should be taken more seriously, but it shouldn't come at the expense of others relying on them to do their job. I also have a problem with celebrities not showing enough emotional resilience because it sets a bad example for the public, who can't escape when they have an episode of severe emotional distress. Instead, these celebrities need to show themselves powering through these events and receiving the help they need. Again, this only happens because people allow them to get away with it. But that's why we need people, especially other celebrities, to stop supporting them when they pull out. This really shouldn't become the norm.

Edit: To be clear, I think celebrities can and should be able to take breaks, but not when they are committed to an event that others rely on them for."

I am interested to hear from anyone, especially someone who works in SAAS sales, who believes differently and can offer a compelling argument that SAAS serves the end user better than traditional product sales.

Software companies have always been very protective of their profits. They gave us licenses and activation keys. That I can understand. I just have a hard time seeing how they’re convincing people to pay more (but slowly, over time!) for their products."

I mean think about it. When is it normal to ask someone to live with a bunch of complete strangers who maybe didn't even get background checked? I mean the only situations I can think of are if they are desparate for housing or in the military. But the military (in the usa at least) background checks people first. It is very thorough. My brother-in-law got denied entry due to something he did in 7th grade that wasn't even that bad. College is worse though, I mean you could have a fresh out of high school 18-year-old living with a 25-year-old and like 3 other people. This is ridiculous! Not to mention you often have to share a bedroom with one or two other people. Imagine sleeping in a bunk bed with a complete stranger just a few feet above you. Crazy. Dangerous. What happened to stranger danger? I mean unless you are lucky enough to already know someone going to the school, such as a friend, with whom you can live. That actually sounds like fun and not dangerous. I mean the most likely bad scenario is you get on each others' nerves. 

It is not fair when the only on-campus housing is multi-occupancy. So only people willing to live with others can get the convience of living on-campus? Can't they make studio apartments, or suites (bedroom &amp; bathroom) or at least dorm rooms that are single occupancy?"

I think this can lead a person to become arrogant and selfish. Firstly they will develop a view of themselves as better than others (this is most evident among successful professional fighters). Secondly, they will be so focused on themselves and thier achievements they will become more selfish.

945,2022-08-30,CMV: The government should get out of the student loan business entirely,u/jessebwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x1ida5/cmv_the_government_should_get_out_of_the_student/,changemyview,"Sorry! Have to repost since there was a similar post “about student debt” a day or so ago. This is similar, but a very different idea than just “cancelling or not cancelling student loans is good/bad”.

I’ve seen posts here about why we should or shouldn’t cancel student loans or relieve a portion of them, but not just about taking government loaning out of the equation.

1.	It seems like government guaranteeing and lending out student loans has given colleges the blank check to increase college tuition prices
2.	It encourages predatory colleges that don’t supply their student group with useful majors that know they’ll get their money regardless
3.	It encourages kids to just do whatever their heart desires, instead of what is financially responsible because they feel like they have a blank check from the government and don’t necessarily understand debt.

It seems like a good solution to this would just be to privatize student loaning again, with specific government projects for a select group of students who aren’t going to major in traditionally lucrative, albeit societally useful majors.

1.	Students should be able to declare bankruptcy on these private loans. The loaners take out this risk and should assume it.
2.	Loaners now have the liberty of deciding who they loan to depending on their intended major and previous educational grades, projects, etc. you are not guaranteed a student loan.
3.	Government can keep some amount money to pay for amazing students to major in traditionally not lucrative majors in non STEM fields.
4.	If your parents are loaded, pay the price out of pocket and you can major in whatever you want — even something not useful/lucrative. In the end you’ll just be transitioning money from someone not productive (yourself) to others that are majoring in more productive things, which seems like a good thing.

It should eventually also lower costs of college and make sure people that go are majoring in societally beneficial and lucrative majors.

I want to point out these few things:

1.	I understand that this system wouldn’t be fair to children of low income families. No system ever is or has been in the modern world, and the current system certainly isn’t all — saddling low income, low earning major students with insurmountable debt with no guardrails to taking out that debt — id argue this is even worse. But I fundamentally disagree with the notion that loaners WOULDN’T loan to low income people. If you’re a promising, smart student who is going to major in law, engineering, or some other lucrative major I think the data would show that these are not risky loans, regardless of your parents’ financial state. And especially won’t be as risky when prices of schooling drops due to the privatization of loans.
2.	I don’t know the the solution is for the current debt crisis. I don’t necessarily think a loan you agreed was unbankrupcyable should now be able to be dismissed, but this is another topic entirely. I’m thinking about the ideal state.
3.	I understand the in-between time transitioning from our current model to a private lender free market one would be painful. Schools would need to reorient, lower costs, remove unnecessary administrators, increase class sizes, target students who want to major in lucrative majors. Don’t really know how this could be a soft landing.

A major factor in this is my belief in the power of ritual to change a person - virtue is achieved through practice, not mere understanding. My idea isn't to indoctrinate them into a major religion and force them to get baptized. Instead, at the age you'd normally take them to Sunday school, I want to start taking them to the Sunday school for all the different flavors (Mosque, Church, Synagogue, Buddhist temple, Baha'i center, satanic temple, wiccan lady that sells lots of sage whatever). 

Before everyone starts giving me stats on how religion causes all the evil in the world, don't waste your breath. I know it has lead to all sorts of problems, but broad stats won't convince me because I'm confident that I can do it better than the average religious person for many reasons - not the least of which being, I don't believe in the supernatural components of these things myself. I have many logical reasons for this, but one personal one that I'll share because I must acknowledge the possibility that my biases may be blinding me: My father died when I was a young, but he taught me how to extract wisdom from spiritual teachings before he died. In his absence, I had a way to read and learn and guide myself (much harder without the right books and the skills to read them). I want my kids to have a form of guidance I can trust, and the skills to filter the crap from the good stuff. I don't have the skills to develop a good Sunday school lesson plan (nor the money and time to get a degree in education) nor the discipline to maintain it in my own home without a structure, like church, to hold it in place, nor conveniently available communities of (mostly) good people whose purpose is to become more virtuous and less vicious. 

In discussions with some wise and trustworthy friends, they seem to think it's a terrible idea. They grew up without religion, and I grew up with it. Most of their arguments have boiled down to ""you can have good kids without teaching them religion"", which is obviously true. But is it easier? is it more likely? Is that technique more or less reliable if my kids end up alone? 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple things that might convince me:

\-Show me how a well managed religious education for my children has major drawbacks I didn't consider

\-Show me how a purely secular upbringing can teach all the important qualities religion can instill, while not overcomplicating our lives

\-Another angle I've not thought of"

While this issue plays well in Democratic strongholds, Democrats do not need to do well in their traditional strongholds. They need to do well in a few swing districts and perhaps take a district or two where a conservative Democrat is running against an unpopular Trumpist GOP candidate.

This gets into the traditional discrepancy between urban and rural politics. Democratic gun owners may not care much about ""AR-15s"" in aggregate. But, rural gun owners are different than urban gun owners in their priorities, and [highly prioritize gun rights in a way urban gun owners do not.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/10/rural-and-urban-gun-owners-have-different-experiences-views-on-gun-policy/) This difference cuts across party lines. The reality is, [as many have noted for years](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WB-37232), cultural and demographic differences lead to different outcomes and experiences.

In order for Conservative Democrats to win those contested seats, for Dems to keep control of the House, the Democrats need a high level of turnout in those rural districts. To achieve that, they need to not convince the voters of those districts that turning out to vote is a waste of their time. Motivating rural voters' touchpoint issues is a sure way to demotivate Democratic voters in two ways. First, it convinces them that they will be outvoted by their more motivated GOP neighbors. Second, it demotivates them to vote for Democratic candidates because doing so threatens an issue that is important to them.

While few voters are truly single-issue candidates, Democrats have not, for decades, really spoken well to rural voters' interests -- which extend well beyond purely economic and cultural concerns and tend to feature on interests related to property rights, agricultural concerns, and controls related to leveling the playing field against big Ag business (who the Dems have largely been backing for over small farmers in the policy arena for a long time).

Biden's promise is going to do more harm than good. While it may turn out urban voters in much larger numbers, Democrats are already winning urban districts. Although it may poll well in aggregate, it will not increase results in the specific districts where Democratic performance needs to be increased in order for the Dems to win or maintain the House. Indeed, it will actually actively harm performance in those districts. Again, motivating the opposition and demotivates Democratic voters. While that harm may not by itself be enough to move the needle, the impact won't be a net positive for Democrats overall."
1982,2022-08-30,"CMV: Children should be entirely banned from social media, and most social media services should switch from advertising-based revenue to subscription based revenue.",u/RightersBlok,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x1nkd0/cmv_children_should_be_entirely_banned_from/,changemyview,"There are two things at play here. I've provided a TL:DR of my thoughts on each section, and a breakdown of how to CMV at the bottom.

**Banning Children:**

**TL:DR 1: The short-term impacts have been extremely negative for mental health, the long-term impacts are entirely unknown, and there is no good rationale for the use of Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.**

There is a staggering amount of evidence that social media usage in children is linked with extremely negative mental health outcomes. Gen Z is the first generation in history in which pre-pubescent children had essentially unrestricted access to the internet, and it's successor generation (Gen Alpha) are the first in which introductions to tech and the internet more broadly has been occurring since babyhood in many cases. If nothing else, **we should be proceeding with extreme caution off the simple basis that no one knows the long term mental effects** of this open access, and yet most people seem to feel comfortable with the same ""Safe until proven otherwise"" mentality. I'm not going to discuss the entire internet, but rather focus on social media specifically, but I feel as if the case could apply there more broadly.

There are very few reasons for children under 16 or 17 to be on social media. It's certainly a bottomless source of entertainment, but it's indefensible to claim that it's the ONLY source of entertainment and that the lack of it has harmful effects. **You'd never say ""Kids should be allowed to drink alcohol as much as they want because binge drinking is fun"", and should likewise be unable to claim ""Kids should be allowed on as much of the internet as they want because the internet is fun"".** The adverse affects of underaged drinking on the developing mind are well studied, and we can say conclusively that it's negative long term. Likewise, with each passing year we get stronger and stronger evidence that social media usage on the developing mind has severe impacts, and so just as it's illegal to willfully provide access to alcohol to children, it should as well be illegal to provide them access to social media. *Note: I'm not claiming these things are interchangeable, or that the immediate affects are comparably severe, but it makes for a useful analogy. Please don't tell me about how it's impossible get twitter poisoning and die.*

**The usual reason kids want access to social media other than ""it's fun"" is that ""everyone else is doing it""**, and I'm not going to break down why that's a bad rationalization. In fact, anecdotally this is the much more common reason for young people that I've spoken to about this, and I just don't believe that these two reasons together hold enough water to rationalize facing the mental health risks. There is very little evidence which supports that social media is actively good for kids.

**When I say ""Social Media"", I'm largely referring to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.** TikTok is somewhat more grey, for reasons I'll get to in a minute, and YouTube with the proper safety considerations is probably okay. The reason those last two are different is because they're in many ways simple creative outlets or educational resources in which a case can be made for their exploration. That isn't to say that they can't be dangerous, only that they have a much higher potential for good. By comparison, Twitter and Instagram and Facebook are environments far less conducive to education and creative exploration and contribute extreme risk for exposure to inappropriate ideas, false worldviews, misinformation and indoctrination, extremism, and so on.

I suggest everyone explore sociologist Jonathan Haidt's breakdown of this topic on his site, where he links sources studies related to these ideas: [https://jonathanhaidt.com/social-media/](https://jonathanhaidt.com/social-media/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Paid Subscription, not Open Advertising**

**TL:DR 2: A subscription breaks the social media reliance on hours of engagement being the golden metric. Once that's done, changes can be made to the service and algorithms which govern them to try to maximize actual human enjoyment and utility over pure time spent looking at ads.**

Ask yourself: when it comes to social media, what is the product, how is it being sold, and who is it being sold to? In the case of more conventional entertainment, you might answer ""Movies"", ""Through trailers, posters, name recognition, quality, etc."" and ""Moviegoers"". However, if your answer to social media is ""A social experience"", ""through the quality of the service"", and ""users"", I would have to very strongly disagree. **YOU are the product, being sold to ADVERTISERS, by way of aggressive social programming and algorithmically driven engagement strategies.**

Any company wants to make money, and there's a near infinite way of doing this. Many companies strive to create a quality product or service and get the word out, so that they make money when someone decides they need the product or service more than they need the money that it costs. However, social media costs no money. Why? Because it's users are the product, not the consumer. Advertisers purchase the attention and information of these users and THAT is how these companies do business. It's a subtle but crucial shift in dynamic, and de-incentivizes ""quality"" in it's traditionally recognized definition as a metric to strive for. Social media companies don't want quality, they want addiction.

Despite the fact that most users who try it continue to keep trying it, heroin is not generally considered to be good for human health, and quality of experience is not what most producers strive for. They don't need quality of experience, they need to program your brain to want what they sell. Social media companies sell advertising based on total impressions, and so they work on developing techniques to try to get you to stay on their platform as much as possible. It's not enough to make a Twitter account, they want you to spend every waking hour scrolling through Twitter and seeing ads. Rather than saying ""We would be content if each user of our product uses it in whatever way we see fit"", the goal is ""there is no such thing as too much usage"". Forget custom experiences where enjoyment, happiness, interest, or education are promoted depending on the user's desires. This is why it's much easier to become ""twitter famous""  by being a screaming political polarist rather than a comedian or painter or educator. **Anger, division, fear, and other strong negative emotions have proven time and again to the metric to amplify if your end goal is raw human engagement.**

So why subscription? Would it solve this issue all at once? Probably not. Certain cultures are so ingrained in various social media platforms that it's unlikely for them to go away altogether, but raising the cost of entry would likely result in a reorganizing of the entire model. **Suddenly, users are the customers again. The product is the service itself, and quality becomes a serious consideration for increasing the userbase.** This won't mean the downfall of those algorithms to increase engagement, but it might allow positivity, creativity, and education to compete with hatred and division for keeping people on the site.

It will also likely result in fewer people on these platforms, and there's real arguments to be made against limiting services by way of financial barriers especially in an era in which access to social media isn't just personal use but genuine connection and community, but it's the best idea I've heard for tacking the aforementioned concerns.

***Changing my view would require a legitimate argument for why the benefits of children's use of social media outweigh the risks, or why it's impossible/immoral in some way to limit their access to these services, and why the current model of maximizing engagement over enjoyment is the best possible outcome. I am also open to other realistic business models for social media apart from advertisement engagement and subscription.***"
92,2022-08-30,CMV: Consumers are better off without new car dealerships,u/ConditionLopsided,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x1o00u/cmv_consumers_are_better_off_without_new_car/,changemyview,"I want to be educated more than anything else on this topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the car buying experience is awful. I know there are a few great dealerships below that many customers love, but in my personal experience, any time I've even attempted to buy a new car from a dealership, it has been an awful experience. Today, it's even worse - with countless dealerships marking up their vehicles (new and used) over 30%.   


Besides having a nearby-maintenance facility to work on my vehicle, what are the true benefits of selling through a dealer vs. direct to consumer? I know dealerships employ a ton of people, but how many of them have very skilled jobs that offer true value to the consumer? I would argue that besides mechanics and technicians, no one at a dealership is truly providing consumers with ground-breaking services that would require dealerships to remain intact they way they are currently today. 

I also feel like state governments are keeping these institutions afloat because of various state franchise laws. So many states make it illegal to sell directly to consumer, which seems anti-capitalistic in our country (USA). I just have a hard time understanding it. 

We no longer have horse and buggy drivers, switchboard operators, or lift operators. Technology disrupts shit all the time. If solar power and renewable energy tech continues to excel and prove to be our saving grace, are we really gonna keep coal workers intact, just to save jobs? Saving jobs cannot be the SOLE reason we keep dealerships intact. Why can't they transition to maintenance and service centers? Why can't consumers buy directly from the OEMs if that is what OEMs want to do? Why do we have franchise laws? I don’t mind used car dealerships, but do we really need new ones? 

I just feel we'd be better off as consumers if we let OEMs sell directly to consumers. Even if we have to suffer through a few growing pains before the OEMs get their service centers in check.

I think the extremes we witness in America and how easily we access these extremes online and on social media makes it so that if feels we’re experiencing them first hand. E.g., there are many uk people who felt personally effected by the roe V wade ruling, despite it not impacting us at all. 

This easy access is polarising our left and right and creating more hostilities than if we didn’t see what was happening in American quite so much. 

The lack of reconciliation between republicans and democrats is leaking into our own politics - where previously I think there was more room for debate - I think American influence is making this less and less likely as time goes on.  This is because many equate the tories with the republicans, when actually I think they are far further in reality. Similarly with some of the extremes of democrats to our Labour Party (but to a lesser extent)."

I understand why people are upset with corporation greed from an emotional point of view. But it's completely illogical. Is the Reddit demographic too young to understand corporation and shareholder laws? 

Corporation is legally obligated to be as greedy as possible. Sharedholder demands that corporation be as greedy as humanly possible. If they are doing some immoral but legal, you should not be mad at the corporation. You should be mad at the SYSTEM that allowed for this corporation to exists. 

I am also well aware that the system is also far from perfect. You could say there's too much lobbying or too much bribe in order to prevent corporations to do the evil things they do. And I agree. But even then, the hate should be on a broken SYSTEM. A flawed or corrupt SYSTEM. You can't hate on the players in the system when it's literally designed to do that one thing."

A) Young

B) Attractive

C) Fertile

To get an immigration visa. Nothing is required of them. They can get married and have kids. Or they can just get an education and get a job. Do whatever you want.

The idea is you create a ton of competition for local women. Which makes life a lot easier for single guys. The dynamics of the marketplace would shift tremendously. It would create a sort of ""equality"". Where now if an American woman wants to get a man. She has to do the approaching the cat calling. All that good stuff that only men have to do (for the most part anyway).

I do see how this would turn the dating market into a shitshow for women. But I still think any woman who is actively trying to get a man would have no problem doing so. She just would be forced to choose between career and a man. Where's nowadays they get to have their cake and eat it too. 

The issues this would fix:

Declining birth rates. (not interested in discussing overpopulation. I think that is a gigantic horseshit myth).

Male loneliness. Which I think is a big problem for a capitalist economy. Males with no family tend to become lazy apathetic fuckers

Some benefits for women too. They would get cat called much less. Less sexual harrassment. Less sexual attention period. Women always complain about that stuff. Men would be too busy trying to holla at all the new arrivals. 

Anyway I am 100% certain I didn't think this through. This is mostly a fun post. I hope I didn't offend anyone lol."

To some extent you could say that having most pets are cruel but I’ve focused on birds because I think it’s one of the worst ones. But trying to convince me “well pet dogs are cruel too” will not convince me because I already semi think that, plus it doesn’t make pet birds any less unethical.

**My reasoning:**

Most bird owners trim the bird’s feathers so they can’t fly. This seems extremely cruel. Most birds don’t walk super well (not like dogs who can run) and flying is obviously their main mode of transport. Plus, it’s so wonderful to be able to fly! As humans a common superpower that people would say is we wish we could fly. How can we take that away from a creature without it being cruel??

Most birds are also kept in cages almost all of the time. I also think this is very cruel. 

I think both are unethical individually and together: It is unethical to have a pet bird that can’t fly *even if you let it run around your house*. And it is unethical to keep a bird only in a cage or within a house *even if you let it fly tiny distances around the cage/house*. (Unless your house was like… a Kardashian villa.)

There are other things that I think are cruel, like getting a social species of bird and only having one. Or getting a super smart bird and not giving it enough stimulation. But these don’t always apply to all pet birds so are less relevant.


**Note I’m not including:**

- Cases where the bird has already been forced into this situation and the human is now just trying to help them. So like rehab facilities or taking care of injured birds who can’t live in the wild for some reason, or adopting a bird from a shelter that has only been raised in captivity so can’t live naturally now — as long as you make sure it does not have babies that will then be pet birds.
- Birds who have an active, flying life — for example I think some people train hawks to go fly around and come back. That seems ok to me if the bird is having a lot of freedom to fly around and is not kept in a cage all the time. (Plus the bird is choosing to come back… although idk if that really means much, since pet birds might also choose to walk back if they can’t get food on their own or whatever.)"
0,2022-08-31,"CMV: If someone doesn't text/call you for over a few days, it's not because they're busy (if that's what they're saying), but because they forgot about you or don't want to talk to you",u/forestshadows6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x2e259/cmv_if_someone_doesnt_textcall_you_for_over_a_few/,changemyview,"Firstly, I'd like to say that there are a few obvious exceptions to this. One being severely sick people who don't have the energy or the ability to communicate with people, and two being people who work unreasonably long hours; certain residents who work 110-120 hours a week for example.  
Most other people do have the time to talk to you after school or work is finished. This is made evident by their actions after school/work is over. Of course, they would do their necessities, like showering, changing, eating, napping, but after that? They'd kick back and watch some TV, maybe call some friends, play video games, go to the bar, and what have you. They had the time to commit to these leisure activities after work was finished, and this is the case for most people who have a 9-5. If they have a lot of business to take care of at home too, then maybe they'll only scroll on social media for 10-20 minutes a day instead of dedicating hours to leisure time like most 9-5ers, but in those 10 minutes, they didn't want to text or call you because they preferred scrolling through social media. It always boils down to them forgetting or not wanting to, ""I'm too busy"" is, more often than not, a lie, either said intentionally or out of habit (being used to saying it when you were simply preoccupied with anything, even if it's unimportant). 
I'd like to see other perspectives on this.

EDIT: This post is not in any way saying that just because you don't want to talk to someone, it's because you don't care about them, you're not a good friend, or that you have to. It is simply saying that, for whatever reason, you do not want to text them even though you're able to and not preoccupied with necessities."

That is already a disadvantage. But I don’t think people can compare having children by chance with having children by choice, regardless of the number of people having the child. 

The amount of people that have chosen the route have some sort of financial stability and have created their village, which is pretty much enough for a child. When there is love, I don’t think there’s much else you can ask for."

We've probably all heard this phrase a million times, when screwing in a screw, turn it to the right to tighten, or the left to loosen it. This has a lot of issues, which I've listed in order of biggest to smallest.   
First off, it's ambiguous. The screw isn't moving left or right, it's moving down. For every part moving left, there's another part on the opposite side moving right. Why we chose the top to be the most important, and not the side closest to you, is a mystery, and could've easily gone the other way.    
Second, it doesn't work at strange rotations. If a bolt is upside down or sideways and you have a bad angle, the only way to remember is to mentally rotate everything in your head.     
Thirdly, it's not that good of a mnemonic, it mixes rhyming and illiteration, and requires ""ey"" at the end of tighten to make it work.    
Finally, it only works in English. I'm not sure what other languages use but this specific rhyme only works in English.    

So what do I propose to replace it? The right hand rule. Take your right hand, point your thumb in the direction you want your screw to go, curl your fingers, and now your fingers point in the direction you rotate. Works in, out, sideways, upside down, unambiguously, in every language, always. It is far superior in every way to anything else. CMV."

""Choosing to believe"" is therefore impossible.",u/Kwahn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x2lvfv/cmv_belief_is_not_a_choice_choosing_to_believe_is/,changemyview,"Belief is defined as the acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists.  (There are slightly varied definitions, but almost all should work for this.)

I have never chosen to accept something as true or that something exists.  Anything I learn, I automatically and subconsciously evaluate as part of an extended set of heuristic analyses that I've been building over the entirety of my life.

This is true for the big life questions - I have an extensive history of having been lied to as a kid about mythical beings, and so my brain decided to categorize any allegory that was told to me that imposed some sort of morality or lesson as similar fiction.  Others have learned about religious systems and have a heuristic that places greater emphasis on the beliefs that others hold (or publicly claim to hold), or they did not have the mental framework I had subconsciously developed to automatically disregard specific claims, and therefore may have processed the same information I did and come to radically different conclusions.

This applies to even the most basic predictive decision-making, such as an ice cream example I saw once.  When I am choosing between chocolate and vanilla, I am subconsciously consulting a heuristic that evaluates every time I have made this choice in the past, the outcomes, my current state of being, and countless other micro-considerations.  That process forces me to come to the conclusion that chocolate is better (though sometimes environmental factors force me to ""choose"" vanilla!), and I go stuff my stupid fat face.

Yet I hear people ask me to ""Choose to Believe in Christ"".   If my heuristic decision-making processes aren't able to turn non-belief into belief without outside stimuli (that is, evidence), how am I supposed to force it to happen?

I have a few stacked beliefs to unwind in here, so I'll tl;dr what to actually argue against:

**I do not believe that any person is able to ""choose"" their beliefs.**   I know that I cannot see into other peoples' minds, but I have not seen any evidence that indicates that people are capable of believing things by completely ignoring what I see as a base human heuristic process.  They can claim to, and I'm no stranger to that, having pretended to be devoutly Christian for several decades, but that doesn't make it genuine.  This may be impossible to prove, and I apologize - but I am genuinely interested in changing this belief, because if I can learn how to choose my beliefs, I could do a lot of good both in my life and in general.

**All people process information through a heuristic framework of some kind, though they can be radically different.** No one just believes things in a vacuum, and therefore,

**All people are incapable of changing beliefs without external stimuli.** Whether that be a ""spiritual experience"", a ""coming to faith"", or another such moment, it always seems to be precipitated by some event or outside force that resulted in a radical adjustment to their heuristic model.  I do believe it is possible for people to have their heuristic models radically shifted, sometimes in extreme ways, but they are always caused by external stimuli (or a torturous and specific lack of external stimuli).

Therefore, **asking someone to ""just have faith"" is asking for the impossible.**  Asking someone to choose to believe is asking them to, without any external stimuli, without any change in information to process, come to a different conclusion than their automatic, subconscious processes already led them to.  It is to ask them to stop operating as every single human on this planet does."

View this graph and consider this, only 14% of global CO2 emissions come ICE vehicles on the road, with 25% coming from energy and 21% from industry.

2) Global Co2 emissions from transport: 
https://i.imgur.com/CyDGnCc.png
As you can see, 45% of the transportation sector mentioned in the former graph is YOU, consumer ICE vehicles on the road, driving to work, in traffic. That means globally, less that 7% of total emitted greenhouse gases come from you. A person driving a gas powered car.  with the other 93% coming from other sources. 

If everyone in the entire world switched to EVs right now, don't you think a majority of that 7% would simply move to industrial and energy sectors? The energy used to create the electricity has to come from somewhere. And i'm not saying it's all going to come from fossil fuels, but you have to think a majority of it is. The oil trade will remain healthy it will just move to other sectors of the economy. Why are we mandating against ICE cars and not industrial and power sectors  and the other 93% of the problem? Why are we blaming average joes and consumers for this when it is clearly a business and government issue. 

There's also data that suggests that total CO2 emissions didn't change much in 2019 when the pandemic first hit and most cars were off the road.

Then there's the fact that EVs batteries have to be changed out every decade or so of use, leading to a large build up of useless dead lithium batteries in landfills. Not to mention it is a conflict mineral.

Don't get me wrong, the horrors of the oil trade is just as bad. And i'm not so ignorant that i think ICE cars have no impact on the environment, but this rush to get them out the door and destroy the entire gas powered infrastructure is silly.

And if you want to see why switching to EV trucking is going to devastate the economy and drive up the price of goods, watch Adam something's video on Tesla's electric semi trucks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__a8EcM2jI The technology simply isn't there yet and the freight industry simply cannot afford to switch over to these. It would literally mean billions of revenue lost for companies.

Don't give me wrong, i like EVs okay. They can make good practical vehicles and i look forward to them becoming more affordable. But i don't want to get rid of ICE vehicles. They offer more off the grid freedom and honestly... They just have soul. They're fun to use and drive.


**EDIT**: a lot of great comments, i like this conversation. I think to address the issues with the data i linked. I am going to say i am unclear if the first graph posted is applying specifically to consumer ICE vehciles or transportation industry as a whole, i figured it was industry as a whole, i was trying to extract from that percentage, a percentage of emissions that come solely from consumer vehicles. It is hard to find that data, and as  you can see the second graph says total transportation industry accounts for 24% (i've heard this number applied to US transportation). But as you can see, it is quite difficult to really know the exact percentage of CO2 comes from us everyday people driving cars. If you try to apply that 14-24% onto everyday people driving cars you might be making a mistake. I was trying to argue that it may be lower than people expect, and that the amount that doesn't come from your car far outweighs this. I'm still not 100% on this point of view so if anyone has some real data on this, i'd be interested."
0,2022-08-31,"CMV: People who don't like soccer haven't tried to understand it. Imho, it's the most entertaining sport in the world.",u/imHereJust4This,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x2my8z/cmv_people_who_dont_like_soccer_havent_tried_to/,changemyview,"NOTE: Maybe a slightly biased opinion because I'm from the UK (hence why I reference so many English games), but I'm happy to change and discuss other sports.

Here are a few reasons why I believe this:

\- The momentum of the game can shift at any second. Even a penalty to one team can lead to a counter attack goal by the defending team. Red cards and injuries can happen at any phase of play and change the entire dynamic of the game.

\- The fact that there's only one way to score a point (get the ball over the line) and that each goal is only worth 1 point means unless the score becomes 3-0 in the 85th minute or something similar, means that the game is never settled. The recent Manchester City vs. Real Madrid game is good proof of that. Even if a team is leading 3-0, conceding a goal could change the leading team's strategy.

\- The difference between a good league team and a ""bad"" league team really isn't that big. For that reason, competitions like the FA Cup and EFL trophy bring in upsets all the time and fans are happy to support their local teams rather than a big team. A 9-0 win is rightly considered a domination, but when you think about it, that's still only on average a goal every 10 minutes. Few games end with a difference of more than 5 goals anyway. Back in 2021, a game between Tottenham and Marine AFC (160 places further down the league than Tottenham) only ended 5-0. Underdog teams go in wanting a victory because they know anything can happen. 

\- It's all tactics, and the manager plays a much greater role in the game than any other sport. Everything is about answering to what the opposition is doing. While watching a team passing it around the back isn't the most entertaining to watch, the other team have to decide if they want to commit bodies to ramping up the pressure on the attacking team, or let the other team run down the clock. 

Going back to the example of underdog teams, the team have to decide if they want to spend most of the game defending and try and steal a goal in far fewer chances, or go all in and try and match the opposition's attack. Both of these decisions can backfire horribly. Tactics and formations can change at any point in the game, and it's all about how well the entire team follow this new set of instructions and work together to get a good result. 

Everything matters, pace, accuracy, passing, strength, and the game is mostly decided by what kind of balance the managers think is the right strategy. If you understand that strategy, watching the team try and follow it makes the game far more interesting."

""Women would never compete at a high level""

99.9% of men don't compete at a higher level either.   

This is the same argument behind men having all the money, 0.1% of men have all the money. Most men have as much money as most women. The biggest reason billionaires are rich is not because they are men.

Besides women would still be able to compete with men at their level. Maybe the top league in sports would have 1 woman to every 10,20,50,100 men depending on the sport.

Now why do I say society is sexist?   
It's the reason why the main argument is used.  
""women would not compete at a higher level"".

Why is this a bad thing?  

The reason this is a bad thing is because we think girls and young women can only identify with other women!   
But that's not true, women can identify with men and men can identify with women and black people can identify with white people!  

You hear it all the time! There are no female role models! There are no black role models! 

I think a little girl that likes physics can identify with Einstein or Hawkings. 

I also think a little girl that likes swimming is able to identify with Phelps. So if there were no female swimmers in the olympics she wouldn't be discouraged.

I would like to add that I think women have advantages in some sports, like some branches of gymnastics.  
Women tend to be more flexible and have more coordination for some movements.   
So I also think we'd see new sports show up or have sports where women generally outshine men grow in popularity.   

Also some part of the difference between men and women in sports is caused by gendering sports. 

A really good girl at sports will have way less support and competition than boys. 

I'm not sure if there are studies about the difference in little kids sports vs adult sports when comparing genders. But could be interesting to see how much of a percentage the difference between the genders comes from this aspect.

Edit: I never disagreed that women are much worse than men in general at sports. And at a high level that's even more evident. In many sports the world record for women having been beaten by hundreds or thousands of men. If your argument is just that it's not gonna change my view."

1629,2022-08-31,CMV: Ceaselessly Hate-Sharing the Posts of Our Political Enemies Does More Harm Than Good,u/nickvonkeller,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x2ptoc/cmv_ceaselessly_hatesharing_the_posts_of_our/,changemyview,"I'm from the US and personally lean pretty far to the left, so my Reddit feed includes several left-leaning subs, and some days it feels as though my feed is dominated by reposts of tweets from Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Stephen Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Lauren Boebert, etc. I like to laugh and gape at the dumb things they say as much as anyone, but at a certain point it feels like the sheer amount of signal boosting we do of extremist and troll voices does more hard than good.

First, I want to acknowledge the one positive that occurs to me (there maybe be others) - 

1) **It gives us a window into the opposition's thinking.** However stupid these beliefs may seem to me, they're held by millions. And while some of these people are just troolish pundits - Crowder, Kirk, Walsh, etc - others are actual members of the US's national governing body. So however much I might cringe at what they're saying, it might also be important for me to hear it so I know what I'm up against.

But I personally just feel that the downsides are stronger - 

1) **It feeds the troll.** These people go out of their way to post the most incendiary possible version of their beliefs specifically to garner attention, both good and bad. They want to rile up their base, but also to rile us up. All press is good press if you're a scumbag, and they seem to take pleasure in our frustration/horror/mockery. And even if we're just reposting a tweet, inevitably that's going to lead more people to the original tweet. 

2) **It makes us believe that everyone on their side agrees with them.** In the same way that delving into abortion statistics reveals that the conservative (and liberal) rank and file have far more nuanced views than their most extremist flank, I find that talking to just about any conservative is more complex (and genuine) then the gotcha jabs and distorted statistics and extremist takes that people like Greene and Shapiro post. Yes, plenty of people agree with these crazies, but plenty don't. 

3) **It makes us dumber.** Some of our beliefs might really benefit from some scrutiny. Some of our positions might be opposed by real evidence or persuasive rhetoric that's worth hearing out. But we'll never believe that as long as we mostly share and engage with the stupidest voices on the opposing side. I don't believe in a false equivalence, or endless devil's advocates, or needing to defend every belief, but I do think we can end up more smug or arrogant than we deserve if we only engage with moronic trolls.

4) **It makes us defined by our opposition.** This one's a bit more nebulous, but we know we live in a time of record ""anti-partisanship,"" where more people than ever before vote to stop the opposition's agenda rather than to advance their own. This usually encourages a type of legislative paralysis where we end up celebrating the status quo, because the goal was ""beat them and stop negative change"" instead of ""enact positive change."" I think we'd just be healthier if we spent more time upvoting those we support and trumpeting their words and deeds rather than trashing those we oppose. 

Anyway, that's all. I'm excited to hear the thoughts of others."

Both of these lines are from the same rapper. I will give this person some credit because In the second song he acknowledged the hypocrisy and claims there’s a difference between the “streets” and innocent people but I take it back because because he also had a group of people jump another rapper at a restaurant (and somehow still came out the clown)

These Rappers idolize drug lords, crime bosses, and constantly talking about killing, robbing and shooting people. But then turn around and make a song calling out the same issues they’re perpetuating. I’m a huge fan of rap but I’m seeing the damage it has on youth. 

The reason a song like this is made is because you know the power and influence your words have on the people who listen to you...and money. So you must also realize the power all your other songs have. 

So for these specific rappers, I don’t believe they have any moral footing to stand on when it comes to social justice and actually think less of them because of it. To CMV prove to me it’s somehow different"

I think certain markets and companies definitely need to be monitored by the government and regulated accordingly. Basically, I support the current mixed-marked economy the US has.

However, I believe that such a mixed-market economy should be primarily dominated by capitalist markets and use socialism as little as possible. In general, l I think the government's primary involvement in the economy should be to tax negative externalities and subsidize positive externalities. (Example, carbon emissions should be taxed and education should be subsidized.)

Also, there is currently a strong focus to create health care, I am all for that as I also think health care exhibits positive externalities for society. However, I don't think it should be a universal/single-payer system, and I am against people who want to socialize other corporations and industries such as tech, manufacturing, etc.

Edit: Just to elaborate a bit more on why I prefer capitalism. 

1. It has pulled more people out of poverty than any other economic system in history 
2. Its design incentivizes efficiency and innovation. 
3. It is based around the freedom of individuals to do as they wish, (ie. Free-market)"

i just learned what that means from twitter because of hunter schafer, but i really don’t see how transmedicalism is bad. it follows the medical model of all diseases and is what is most consistent with how we treat diseases in this day and age. personally i think it’s a little irresponsible of physicians to be giving physically altering medications that are irreversible to people just because they want it, but i think gender affirming psychological care is perfectly fine. i think changing the way a person thinks (as long as it’s done by a professional) using techniques such as cbt to come to terms with and be more comfortable with who you are is always a good thing, regardless of the situation, but actually having medicines that produce irreversible changes is a little irresponsible for physicians specifically to be administering, especially if there is little evidence on which to create a treatment plan. if you can get ahold of it against physicians orders then hey, more power to you, but personally i don’t think physicians should be giving out medications without a generally understood reason. 

i had someone explain to me that it doesn’t encompass everyone’s identity, but at the same time, nothing ever does. i think transmedicalism is just a response to the way our medical system exists and how it interprets treatment, not meant to invalidate people. perhaps things will change in the future, but currently, this is how our medical model is set up and i really think it does indeed help people who may not understand get why it’s so important for trans people to get hrt/surgery for free and why it really is a lifesaving treatment. i think transmedicalism is just trying to establish a common definition of a very broad topic. 

i don't mean any disrespect, i just want to hear why so many people are against it and .. i guess to change my view!"
