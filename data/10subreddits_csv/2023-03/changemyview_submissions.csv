345,2023-02-28,CMV: True Crime biopic/shows need to end,u/ceh2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11eogya/cmv_true_crime_biopicshows_need_to_end/,changemyview,"The fact that these shows are even in existence at all is insane. It takes away from the victim(s) entirely and often showcases these serial killers and monsters in an empathetic manner. To me, there is something truly sick about some committing these unspeakable crimes, and then 30 or 40 years later, Hollywood decides to spend millions of dollars producing a show entirely about that person.

I am not doubting that these shows don't sometimes portray them in an accurate light, but I also think that often times, the filming style still reads as ""look at this badass, kicking ass and taking names"", and even if they are portrayed accurately, as a fucking evil loser, I just don't understand why it needs a feature film/tv show. It also doesn't help that sometimes, these victims family are furious that their loved ones death is a plot point in a production that they didn't even consent to, that retraumatizes them, and goes on to win awards and praise. I truly believe this is why many people advocate to not show pictures of mass murderers/school shooters on the internet, because it is exactly what they want, to become a ""personality"" or house hold name, and maybe one day Evan Peters is going to play you on TV!

(Just for clarification, I am not referring to documentaries/ Dateline style shows, I don't necessarily agree with those either, but I am referring to acted shows)"
0,2023-02-28,CMV: We don't need oral arguments before the US Supreme Court anymore because it's a sham and we know the votes will be along partisan lines.,u/Disagreeable_Earth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11eqogc/cmv_we_dont_need_oral_arguments_before_the_us/,changemyview,"The Supreme Court is quite partisan as of late, which is eroding the public's trust in it as an instutition. It should, in theory, focus on interpreting existing laws from the standpoints of legality and precedent. Oral arguments help the court understand whether a lower court reached an incorrect decsions, or whether the legislature overstepped its bounds. 

Lately, we see the court become far more partisan than it ought to be. Normally, justices will try to set aside personal beliefs and biases and do the job of interpreting law, instead of trying to force their own beliefs from the bench. 

I understand there are many different ways to interpret laws, and the Constitution. Original/founder's intent, modern, and strict textualism to name a few. I believe that is fine, valid, and necessary. Even though some may argue that we should not care what the Founders wanted 200+ years ago, many feel we should not deviate too far from the fundamental principles that are the foundation for this government. Having a justice with this perspective ensures these voices in the country are represented. 

Today, though, the court is almost entirely partisan and votes rarely change. Instead, justices practically ignore oral arguments, precedent, and their duty and instead try to force through their personal vision of what the law should be (i.e., they legislate from the bench). Based on what we saw with Justice Thomas and his wife, it is also somewhat corrupt and untrustworthy (I somehow doubt Thomas and his wife are the only ones engaging in this behavior, they're just the ones that got caught). 

We should do away with the pretense that the court cares about oral arguments and just skip that alltogether, so we can get to the point where they inevitably vote along party lines."

In most cases the targets reported are civilian objects. From the reactions in pro-Western mass media it appears that a good portion of people believe that these attacks are carried out by Ukraine. I don't think this is so, because:

* While most of the time the attacks are said to be carried out by Grads (not-so-precise multiple rocket launchers), quite a few reports mentioned HIMARS and other precision artillery. Makes no sense to waste these targeting private houses.
* It seems that it would be feasible to cover the most targeted areas with anti missile defense systems, or *something*, but I don't see anything being done.
* Most importantly, there's no point in attacking civilian targets. This is not a show of power since Ukraine is not advertising or even admitting the attacks in any way, and the opinion that the attacks serve as a means of intimidation is hard to take seriously.

Now, it's fair to ask, if not Ukraine, who is bombing Russia? Well, it's hard to say what exactly is going on given the one-sidedness of the reports. But these attacks serve as a major point of internal propaganda. I've heard opinions like, “I had no opinion about the war until they started attacking us... When they started bombing Belgorod they became our enemy”. So it would make sense for Russia to stage the attacks on its own territory, but maybe not even that would be necessary. What you need is not actual explosions or casualties, but pictures of destruction, butterfly mine sightings and perhaps loud bangs."

The US should do something similar. Misinformation is a huge problem, and people with high follower counts can be perceived as trustworthy sources when they can just as easily be lying about their credentials or education.

**Social media should have a system for verifying a persons' qualifications and making them prominent, so you can see if a person giving medical advice is actually qualified to talk about this.** I think this would visually be similar to Twitter's verification check mark. 

A user submits their qualifications, things like degrees or professional licenses, into an internal system.  The only information that is revealed to the public is the qualification.   
This would be a voluntary decision if you want the qualification to be visible.

If the system was enacted, I think it should start with just subjects like medicine or  finance that have a higher risk of harm caused by misinformation. 

To clarify, I do not think the focus should be on content moderation. Its not about prohibiting people from talking about certain things, its not about moderating what people are saying, its not about enacting a professional consensus on a subject. Its just a system so that you can see if your information is coming from a person with qualifications.

Its not a perfect solution but I think it would help crack down on misinformation, especially among those who want their information coming from direct sources.  I'd be interested in seeing other's opinions on this"

I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies even after death. 

I dont really see it as mattering to family members not involved in the agreement as it is similar to Muslims and cremation. Some people in the family could be against it(cremation), but it was not their wishes so it does not matter. 

This doesn't necessarily have to stop at just necrophilia either, if the person wanted to be eaten, or dismembered those should still be allowed, as long as they consented to it before death. 

In terms of legality I do think it should be allowed but I see there being a hard time allowing that to happen due to the fights that already happen over family deaths, So I would be willing to settle for it is okay morally but can never happen legally."

135,2023-03-01,"cmv: Executive pay does not make up a meaningful portion of most large US companies' budget, and thus cutting it would do little for the average worker",u/JJakk10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11fpggi/cmv_executive_pay_does_not_make_up_a_meaningful/,changemyview,"When discussing the topic of equality in the US, I often hear record-high executive pay mentioned as one of the primary reasons why wages have remained stagnent while productivity has increased.

To look into this more, I decided to create a spreadsheet of 45 companies in the S&amp;P 500 divided evenly among all major sectors. For each company I measured, it's total number of employees, total executive pay (by adding up the pay of the executives listed on Yahoo Finance), annual dividend payout, and annual share repurchase spending. Upon recording these numbers for each company, I created these three metrics which ended up having the following median values:

Annual executive pay per employee -&gt; $227

Annual dividend payout per employee -&gt; $39,606

Annual share repurchase spending per employee -&gt; $29,093

As you can see, executive pay per employee equates to only about 3 days of minimum wage work per year, whereas the median dividend payout per employee is actually higher than the median annual salary in the US. That's not even to mention that the median share repurchase spending per employee is just shy of the median income in the US.

(**Note**: In my findings most companies had a high dividend payout, and significantly lower spending on buybacks, or high spending on buybacks, and a significantly lower dividend payout. So, looking at the median for both could create the misperception that companies are spending a lot of money on both, when in reality most companies are paying mostly one or the other.)

Seeing this clear disparity leads me to believe that the discussion around executive pay is pointing at the wrong thing. If workers want a stake in the profits of their company, the bulk of the money is clearly in dividends and share buybacks. I realize that rich executives flying in private jets as their company lays off workers isn't exactly a great look, but the numbers seem to imply that that isn't making a big difference. In my research, I found that executive pay was consistently measured in millions of dollars, whereas dividends and buybacks were usually measured in billions, and as the saying goes,

""The difference between a million dollars and a billion dollars is roughly a billion dollars"""

24,2023-03-01,CMV: Radical Political Factions in the US Will Dominate the Future,u/somethingfunnyPN8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11fqgos/cmv_radical_political_factions_in_the_us_will/,changemyview,"Radical (defined as seeking radical change to the status quo in the US) political factions in the US will dominate the future in the short and long term because:

TLDR: economy is going down, polarization is going up, moderates and their influence is draining away (slowly). Strong leaders that want to change things greatly are needed or at the very least will be perceived as being needed in order to help the US adapt to turbulent times. 

* First, the economy has nowhere to go but down in the status quo for the majority of the population. My understanding of the status quo is that it is a sort of compromise between [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism) and [modern liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States) in moderate Democrat style (free trade, freer immigration, limited regulation, progressivism/egalitarianism) or a sort of compromise between neoliberalism, [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism), and liberal conservatives (meaning classical liberals who pro-police, imprisonment, socially conservative) under a Republican style (privatization, deregulation, substantial lowering of taxes for the wealthy and corporations, conservatism). This system causes economic problems for the majority of the population because of the increasing level of competition from industrializing countries and the inability of the US government--with a moderate Democrat controlled, moderate Republican controlled, or divided status--to be dynamic enough to keep up with changing and challenging conditions in the US/world.

(CMV) It could be argued that one of these ideologies (neoliberalism, modern liberalism, liberal conservatism, classical liberalism) is particularly good and/or appealing and thus will become dominant over the others and create a new but somewhat moderate status quo, or that I have misconceived the political system in the US.

* Second, the moderates in each party, who are currently dominant politically, will do wildly unpopular things or popular things that are harmful in the long run in a desperate effort to hold onto their current power, which is naturally fading because of how much radicalism there is in the US and how it grows every single year. This includes but is not limited to: simply not changing enough, which is the tendency of moderates in the US today ([this will be unpopular because increasingly, younger voters are demanding a more activist government](https://ibb.co/WypX9c4)), climate change / environmental issues denial or lackluster response to this issue, endorsement of anti-LGBTQ views ([approx 20% of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ, this number has not stopped growing yet](https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx)), endorsement of racism, suppression of current democratic elements and proposed ones, allowing government positions to remain dominated by the wealthy, bad policies in cities caused by NIMBY (not in my backyard) Democrats and competition with suburbs, suburbs themselves in their current state being vehicles of depression and inequality for the majority of residents, etc.

(CMV) It could be argued that any of these aspects are not really an issue (but if you mention one issue to get a delta you should back it up with evidence properly), particularly that I have a misconception on local politics in cities or suburbs, providing significant new info on rural area politics and status). I wouldn't advise arguing that there is a large moderate faction that is capable of not doing dumb things, because simply by their nature they are in opposition with the majority of ""activist"" millennials and zoomers, BUT if you see an error I have made logically there, then you have a CMV case to make.

&amp;#x200B;

(that was a ton of writing, may add more sources or bullets if I think of new things but I think this is plenty to discuss).

&amp;#x200B;

Generally my conclusion is that the radical factions will fight and one will eventually rise to the top. The options are:

* Social democrats like Bernie Sanders, likely in coalition with democratic socialists and those even further left.
* Dog-whistling to or open alliance with right-wing evangelicals, those against egalitarianism generally, and confederates/neonazis/fascists from right-wing populists like Donald Trump. Right wing populists could go in the direction of protectionism or simply continued tax cuts, though I don't see how even more tax cuts can be supported without the US suffering catastrophically.
* Not libertarians, because they are not ""activist"". Unless things are going radically downhill and championing basic liberties becomes exceptional (hoping I'm not jinxing things here).
* You can add factions to change my view :)
* Another big final CMV could be that the US is strong enough in its current state / naturally as a nation that moderates like Biden, while potentially not being super popular or effective, could decrease radicalism simply by making modest improvements that allow the US to perform efficiently enough to stay stronger than other nations. Counterpoint: there will be development that could be harmful to much of the working class in South Africa, Nigeria, that Eastern African Union, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Latin America."

The willow project assists in avoiding dependence on foreign powers who have shown they are willing to support Russia and manipulate fuel prices for their own benefit. While there will be more supply of oil, it won’t mean that much more oil is used as petroleum is a rather demand inflexible product.  In the borough it affects most (North Slope) there is a majority consensus about that project (source: Nagruk Harcharek), and the drilling content has made proposals that are less likely to harm local Caribou. I also think we should look at what we are supporting if we don’t go forward with the project; right now there the deadliest conflict in europe since world war 2 happening, and we would be supporting the aggressor by supporting OPEC.

My argument has NOTHING to do with ""ethics"" and ""religious views"" because that changes from person to person. My argument also has nothing to do if the woman shouldn't have sex or not because there are many women who need abortions on a wanted baby due to medical reasons. There is also the fact that men will S/A women and get them pregnant.

My point is, if they wanted more women to give birth and keep their baby ""like how they're supposed to be"" instead of forcing them, (ie: make them into a life support for something that isn't alive that CAN kill said life-support), they would at least make it easier to raise a child?

For example, many places get extended pre-natal and post-natal care for the mom for wayyyy cheaper than the US, this includes counseling because who knew that your whole mental state is altered. Furthermore, women in the us sometimes barely get 6 weeks off maternal leave (half the time it's unpaid, yet necessary in the healing process).

So shouldn't we lower the cost of medical if not almost get rid of it because you want people to have babies that are healthy while keeping the mom alive right? But she can get hurt or even die from pushing herself just before or after giving birth, that's why leave is necessary, but yet many have to skip it/cut it short because they cannot afford it and will be out of a home. Thus the government taking the baby. unless we make mandatory paid maternity leave longer (paternity if father is single and has full custody).

Additionally we should also have immediate public housing for pregnant/just birthed moms that are trying to get up on their feet (for the most part clean/sober just hit hard times expesh if they got fired early pregnancy and couldn't work and/or no one would hire them). this will help alleviate stresses that CAN affect the fetus and child after it is born. because we want both the mom and child to be alive and happy, not just exist right?

Contributing to that factor is childcare, this includes schools, programs, daycare, nutrition supplements, clothing, and medical.

While yes we do have help, (ie churches that want you to convert to get said resources even though they can and actively pursuit harm to other people including lgbtqia) discount daycare, public schools that are already shitty, food stamps that pro-birthers often fight against, and medicaid - medicare and cash assistance.

They almost always have a cash cutoff that's far below the poverty line and need to be raised so that a family can take care of all needs instead of worrying for the light bill or a weeks worth of food. the Medicaid and Medicare NEEDS to be improved and less of a hassle. schools need more funding that goes to anywhere and everywhere but sports.

Lastly, many women DO keep their baby after the father says he'll stay, but walks on out of their lives. in order to support her family, she needs to work a singular job that pays bills, but now and days it's not enough so RAISE minimum wadge.

This part is BEFORE their even pregnant:

Make rapists have harder jail sentences

Give PROPER sex education (not abstinence)

Don't shame women who come forward with a rape story (the odds have risen it's 1in4 and that's JUST the reported)

Don't downplay married rape/cohersion

stop making it about purity culture

Make it easier to get sterilization for women/bc

Don't just blame the woman and blame it ALL on her, it takes two

take domestic abuse Seriously

COMPLEATLY reform the cps, adoption and foster system (everyone knows it's a HORRIBLE system)

Fix inflation

Fix the current housing situation

This is not asking for pregnant women and women with children to get handouts, more that it is unreasonable to expect women to have children when they can barley support themselves. Many countries do not have our issues as bad (not including rape/domestic abuse) and get along fine. and if you find that fixing (at least SOME things) as i said in above unreasonable then you are not pro-life you are just pro-birth. you do not care about the woman, nor what happens to the baby after it is born. but if you agree (at least a little bit) then you should also see as that will automatically (if only slightly) decrease the amount of abortions.

I do know that i left many out that can be added/fixed/tweeked

&amp;#x200B;

***EDIT/CONLUSION:***

Everyone is ok with abortions just being restricted and this is the solution that answered the hard question

&amp;#x200B;

Pro lifers believe that a fetus no matter the state deserves life.

(a good portion of prolifer's) it's the ""payment"" for ""messing around

(if i have this right let me know but) :

most pro-lifers are ok with abortions ONLY if it is medically necessary ***or*** from rape

(one or two pro-lifer's) are ok with aborting EARLY (like in the first five weeks)

(a few pro-lifer's) are in support to help said moms give birth and ultimately to a more increase of wanted pregnancies.

they do support mom over fetus, as long as it doesn't kill/severely maim the mom, the mom should push through it.

&amp;#x200B;

I as a pro-choicer believe that:

fetus shouldn't have a right to life until viability outside of the womb, before that it is the choice of the mom because it is not alive, but at that state of time it ***could*** survive

Right now we are the  55th, falling behind Russia which has a maternal mortality rate of 17 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births

I  feel like this shouldn't be as much of a problem as long as healthcare improves and hire more people, put until then it is a concern to not have at least have restricted abortion

I feel like better sex education is key in preventing a lot of pregnancies and that the ""payment"" or blame falls too much mainly on the woman.

&amp;#x200B;

***Final result:***

Until medical is better for women who are pregnant, we need at least a restricted abortion acceptance. for non emergency medical condition concerns

it should be available until the fetus is viable outside the womb (just because it is human, it is not A human. it is more like trying to give someone's lung a right to live, unless that lung is viable outside and can live on its own)

Rape reasons should always get a pass for abortions, along with medically necessary abortions

better support for women in certain areas will further the want to have and continue a pregnancy

Lastly it shouldn't just mainly fall on the women, a proper sex education is required to prevent many unwanted pregnancies it also isn't a ""punishment""

Do people agree? let me know

it is the best i can come up with"

It's a forced buzzword that people say to gain instant 'mhm, yes'.  Like saying 'me like long walks by beach'.  It's a cliche.

World ""peace"", to me in reality, is TERRIFYING.  A government able to fully immerse itself in its own land now has the ability to focus on ways to control its populace.  A society not distracted by war now has more time to innovate and create technology, which governments will use to gain control.  Governments can't control if they're distracted by nuclear war.  They are too busy to enforce zoning laws.  They are too busy to enforce drug laws.  And they are too busy to find ways to tax people.  They cannot allocate resources to give local authorities more equipment to assert authority.  Every country worldwide, not distracted by nuclear war, not needing resources to fight, uses those resources inward.

As bad as it sounds, war is a necessary horror that distracts governments.  They can't do EVERYTHING, they have to allocate resources.  The more nuclear explosions, the less resources governments can use.

Peace, ideally, would be a world where everyone is positive and doesn't create these evil laws or use technology to enforce laws.

But because humans are parasites (I use this term technically and not like a 1990s edgelord, because, let's face it, we DO act like parasites on a global scale), we choose to ruin things.  Nuclear war makes this slightly more difficult due to the fact that we now have less equipment to do this.

Of course, this is a conclusion I've come to and I really don't like it, which is why I'm looking for a view change.  But I am terrified of a world where the government and people innovate and create new ways to control and screw over my life.  I feel like nuclear war would solve that problem (I am PERFECTLY fine dying in it, I either die instantly or I get to enjoy a few months of traveling and then die a rather painful and horrific death, but a death I understood nonetheless.).  Maybe I'm just a very messed up selective pessimist for what most people see as a positive, and a very messed up selective optimist for what most people see as a negative.  

If peace made it IMPOSSIBLE for this, I'm down!

102,2023-03-02,CMV: Basketball should replace free throws with 30-second penalties,u/Flumberbug,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11g3khi/cmv_basketball_should_replace_free_throws_with/,changemyview,"Free throws are insipid. Basketball needs a way to punish fouls that doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes with a melon baller.

In other sports, giving the aggrieved team a free shot on goal isn't boring at all. Penalty shots in sports like hockey, lacrosse, and soccer are gripping. Without a goalie, the drama of a free shot plummets.

Basketball also uses penalty shots (free throws) far, far more than other sports. In soccer, there's a penalty shot [once every four games](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308873835_A_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Penalty-Kicks_in_the_English_Premier_League). In hockey, there are only [40-70 in the entire league each season](https://hockeyanswered.com/what-is-a-penalty-shot-in-hockey/). Basketball games average [over 40 free throws per game](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/free-throws-attempted-per-game)[\*]. This is absurdly high. [Over 15% of all scoring comes from banal free throws.](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/percent-of-points-from-free-throws)

It's clear that free throws are a cancer on the entertainment value of basketball. But how else can you punish fouls?

Hockey solved this problem long ago with the penalty box. When a player commits a foul in basketball, they should have to leave the court for 30 seconds, giving the other team a 5-on-4 power play.

This would be far more exciting than free throws. Instead of pausing the game to bore fans, a 30-second penalty would create a temporary imbalance of power, which is the easiest way to generate excitement and drama.

Is 30 seconds the right amount of time for a penalty?

I'm not sure. Maybe it should be 60 seconds. Maybe only 20. Experimentation would determine the optimal penalty length.

Would shorthanded teams simply hold onto the ball when they get it and wait for the penalty to expire?

This is part of the reason I suspect the optimal penalty length is about 30 seconds. This isn't much more than the length of one possession, so the percentage of penalty time where the shorthanded team has possession would likely be small.

It's possible the power play team would try to score as quickly as possible to maximize the advantage they can get from the penalty. But then I don't think it would be wise for the shorthanded team to wait out the penalty, since they won't want to be left with only ~10 seconds on their shot clock when the power play ends.

Even if shorthanded teams find time-wasting tactics, that's a tiny downside. First, this would still be less boring than free throws. Second, we could solve this by switching from a penalty lasting a set length of time to making it last a set number of possessions—probably one or two, but maybe three. Then the incentive to waste time would be gone.

Would penalties have any negative effects on how games end?

Basketball should adopt [Elam Endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam_Ending). But whether or not this happens, I think penalties would have positive effects on the final minutes of games. The risk/reward calculation for intentional fouls would be much less tempting, so games would end with teams playing real basketball instead of taking a plethora of free throws. And if you dislike Elam Endings for some reason, penalties would fix many of the problems of basketball game endings while preserving the current timing system.

Free throws are excruciatingly boring. Basketball should replace them with a penalty system similar to the one that's worked well in sports like hockey for a long time. But I'm going to bet lots of basketball fans disagree with me, so I'm willing to change my view.

[\*] This chart lists free throw attempts per game in the 20-27 range. I believe this is on a per team basis, so the real average number of free throw attempts per game is double this."

Introducing contractions in writing gives the writing more of a flow, allowing the reader to enjoy the content for what it is instead of being distracted by the choppiness of an ""it is."" It's clear to me that some contractions in writing can make text feel much more natural, but I'm looking to see the rationale behind the other side of the argument."

Ensuring the rights of women that have been gained is critical and pushing for more strides is needed. I am also sympathetic to antinatalist thought so the discontinuation of births is not really a crisis for me beyond its potential economic implications. 

However, it has occurred to me over the recent discourse about birth rates that if we take the facts that: 
1) Liberated women generally enter the workforce. 
2)Entering the workforce generally requires interaction with the demands of capital.  
3) Success in capital generally requires the internalization of capitalist ideology. 
4) Capitalist analysis under industrial or “developed” material conditions generally paints children as a net negative to the parents interests under the ideology of capital. 
5) People generally act within what they perceive to be in their interest.

Therefore: The introduction of feminist thought into developed society will lead to birth rates falling below replacement. When all genders are in the workforce child rearing become a societal afterthought. This is corroborated from everything I’ve seen out of the parts of the developed world I keep an eye on (mainly the Anglo-sphere, Europe, and China, Korea, and Japan in intensity of tabs keeping in that order). 

TLDR; Would love to have my mind changed on feminism combined with the ideology of capital being incompatible with continued human existence."

0,2023-03-02,"CMV: Even though I’m an atheist, I think casual sex is wrong",u/SoccerSkilz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11grlcl/cmv_even_though_im_an_atheist_i_think_casual_sex/,changemyview,"Two arguments have led me to this conclusion, even though I’m not religious: first, that the casual view of sex makes it hard to explain the special wrongness of rape, and second, of adult-child sex. The “love” view of sex does a better job of explaining our moral intuitions in both cases. (My method is John Rawls’ approach to [applied ethics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_equilibrium) known as reflective equilibrium — see the link for an explanation if needed.)

1. The first argument: A Casual View of Sex cannot account for the special wrongness of rape:

Most people think rape would be wrong even if the victim was unconscious and never found out it occurred. What this means is that the wrongness of rape cannot be entirely explained by an appeal to its harmful effects on utility. Also, if the perpetrator of a rape derived more utility from the rape than the victim suffered in disutility, the rape would still be wrong. Finally, if the rapist were to make the victim better off all things considered by donating to the victim afterwards the rape would still have been wrong (even though the victim wouldn’t have been harmed on utilitarian reasoning, since they weren’t made worse off). 

The special wrongness of rape cannot be explained by its infringement of our bodily autonomy consent rights because equally bodily/consent violating acts are not as bad as rape. For instance, most people have the intuition that if I non sexually shoved a tomato one inch into an unconscious person’s mouth without their consent, and the only way to stop me from continuing to do this for the next five minutes was by lethal force, you would be wrong to deploy lethal force to stop me, but if I did the same with my penis, lethal force is fair game (or at least severe punishment is fair game, putting me in the company of murderers). This shows that the special wrongness of rape is not a matter of bodily autonomy or consent rights, since the tomato example includes these features **without being as wrong or as bad as rape.** [people seem to not be reading this part carefully: I’m not saying it’s okay to forcefeed a tomato to someone, just that it isn’t as wrong as rape, even though both rape and forcefeeding equally transgress the bodily envelope and act without permission, which means we need an additional factor to account for our judgement that rape is worse, which I propose is the love view of sex.; **also, to clarify, the mouth is the point of ingress in both cases**]

So: what explains the special wrongness of rape? I propose it’s that rape is made additionally wrong because sex is supposed to be an expression of love. If sex has no more value than eating a tomato, being purely a means for deriving pleasure, then rape is like forcing someone to eat a tomato. But rape is clearly much worse than that. So sex must be more morally significant than that.

One implication of this view is that casual sex is immoral, because sex shouldn’t be practiced without love, and everything that entails: commitment, mutual understanding, etc.

2. Argument 2: the same, but with pedophilia.

Most people think (myself included) that pedophilia would be wrong even if the child were an eager participant and made no worse off by the experience in terms of utility. I propose that adult child sex is wrong because sex is supposed to be an expression of a rich loving relation between persons which requires a level of psychological maturity children do not possess: they don’t understand what the act of sex means or enter into a romantic relationship with the adult on anything resembling equal terms. 

We may try to explain the wrongness in terms of a consent violation, but children’s consent is violated all the time by their parents. For instance, mom and dad force little tommy to stay over with his strict aunt while they attend a wedding so that, among other things, the parents may have sexual intercourse. They know that Tommy will have a lower lifetime net utility as a result, but they don’t care. Even if you don’t think these parents have a right to do this, I seriously doubt you think it’s as wrong as raping their child. And yet they violated their child’s consent-regarding interests for the sake of sexual gratification with harmful net results for the child. So, consent violation cannot provide a complete explanation for the special wrongness of adult child encounters, whereas the view that sex must be an expression of mutual and informed love can.

I will just mention here in closing that there is another factor which my love hypothesis explains which secular sexual liberalism doesn’t: the fact that people seem to often report that casual sex feels degrading, cheap, regrettable, unsatisfying, etc."

And while I can see their perspective, in that the night sky is pretty and fun to look at, changing urbanization shouldn’t halt for that alone. Another thing is that I’ve seen people complain that we will see more satellites than stars soon, but again that’s almost entirely an aesthetic problem. Satellites are made to for long distance communication and surveillance (which can be considered a different problem, not one I’ll discuss here) and I think it’s a net good for human progression. Again I don’t see a huge population of people saying light pollution is a huge problem, but I still think it’s a bit of a basic problem that we can largely ignore. 

That being said I don’t want to pollute the atmosphere with unnecessary satellites because they will only increase the risk for other satellites and orbital structures.

Edit: all current replies are about the disturbance to circadian rhythm for animals around urban areas. From the two articles I’ve read the effects, while defiantly not ideal, are relatively minor: [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/light-pollution/). This article also talks about how some cities are able to restore bird migration by encouraging more blue lights during migration season.


Edit 2: upon closer consideration I think it is more of a problem than I originally thought. We obviously shouldn’t halt our growing urbanization (well not for this specifically at least), but there are other solutions we can use with relatively minor cost that will help the environment a decent amount."

30,2023-03-03,CMV: Most chain restaurants should implement the “Run Forest Run” System,u/jasondean13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11h2795/cmv_most_chain_restaurants_should_implement_the/,changemyview,"  

**What is “Run Forest Run”? –** If you’ve never been to a Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant, there are [two signs](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3de7d0982815942c27c42267494ed43f?rik=Zvx1UYOXmlF1ew&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2f2.bp.blogspot.com%2f-kctVmhd7CNQ%2fTiAlkrWNWhI%2fAAAAAAAAAGo%2fVEqy5UjDDyU%2fs1600%2fforestsign.gif&amp;ehk=sBlRRGQJCRoLGKvvHb0LzWvIPRdiDVGhM9k39IQnrN0%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0) on all the tables. One labeled “Run Forest Run” which is displayed when the customers at that table do not require any assistance and “Stop Forest Stop” which is displayed when the customers need something like putting in an order, wanting to pay the bill, refills, etc. The idea is that when the stop sign is displayed, the first available server will address your needs.

**My proposal** – Most chain restaurants (for example Applebee’s, BWW, Chilis, Outback, etc.) should implement a similar system where customers can easily denote whether they need a server’s attention and once the “Stop Forest Stop” equivalent sign is displayed, the first available server will help them. 

In my mind this has a few benefits including: not wasting the server’s time checking in on tables that don’t require assistance, increased table turnover from customers spending less time waiting for the bill/ordering, less variability in service quality since you’re not dependent on an assigned waiter, and most importantly getting rid of awkwardly trying to make eye contact with the waiter to get their attention.

There are two complications I can think of if this system was implemented. First is with tips which in my opinion should be pooled if this were to be implemented. This would incentivize everyone to turn over tables quickly and respond to stop signs promptly. While there may be an issue with freeloading from some staff, a manager noting which servers tends to stop at tables more frequently and addressing the issue with the offending employee should offset that issue. 

The second complication would be with large parties (7+ people) where waiters may avoid serving due to the extra amount of work. In the case of large parties, while the signs would still be at the table to address small items like issues with food and refills, waiter(s) would be assigned for things like taking orders and they would receive at least a larger portion of tip left by the large group.

Full disclosure: I’ve never worked at a restaurant which is why I think my view may be flawed in some way."

As a first hand victim of school bullying(2 years in a row) the reason the bullies weren’t punished was because of a “lack of evidence” and frankly security cameras are not enough as they are normally low res and don’t capture audio/ unable to capture audio because of how loud a classroom is. Allowing these small recording devices (implanted in hats, glasses and stuff) will prevent bullies from bullying as the victim now has concrete evidence to report and get the bully properly punished. If I was allowed to carry around recording devices when I was In school I would’ve been able to successfully report that student, get that student punished and removed from the classroom. What happened instead is he didn’t get punished and I was stuck with him for another 6months of constant bullying. If a student is not comfortable with that then they should switch to online class or homeschooling where bullying can be tracked with very hard to erase evidence or bullying doesn’t happen at all. And since everything already does get recorded in society so why should it be any different in schools

199,2023-03-03,CMV: Rebuses are a crutch used by lazy crossword creators to cram in otherwise-crappy words whenever they're not crafty enough to fit them into their puzzles crisply.,u/Fleckeri,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11h4hd6/cmv_rebuses_are_a_crutch_used_by_lazy_crossword/,changemyview,"Now I don't want to come across as cruddy or crass, but just completed yesterday's  NYT Thursday crossword and now I'm critical of any crossword that requires rebuses to solve correctly.

For those unaware, a rebus is a ""creative"" tool used in crossword puzzles where several letters are [crammed into a single square](https://i.imgur.com/CRwampR.jpg) to make two intersecting answers work that wouldn't otherwise fit together. (A [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/crosswords/yes-you-can-write-more-than-one-letter-in-a-square.html) provides additional explanation and examples.) 

While in theory this could be an interesting new element for inveterate crossword puzzlers, in practice it's usually more frustrating than challenging. After all, nothing's more fun than wracking your brain for a particular six-letter answer that actually turns out to be eleven letters fit into six squares. And because rebuses are only in a small percentage of crosswords and rarely hint that you need to use one, it's always much more likely that you just can't think of the right answer rather than that you need to treating some of the squares like goddamn clown cars.

Now I acknowledge that some people manage to find rebuses fun, in much the same way I imagine as people who have fun playing Calvinball, or slamming two dozen Carolina Reapers back-to-back. I realize there's no accounting for fun, but that's not what I'm arguing here: my position is that, fun or not, rebuses detract more from crossword puzzles than they add.

For what it's worth, many rebuses will attempt to at least use the same cluster of letters in both answers (for example, [using a `JACK`rebus](https://i.imgur.com/h19lMMO.png) to make LUMBER**JACK** and **JACK**STRAW fit together), but others don't even bother to do that much. Instead they just jamb their conflicting letters over one another ([like this one](https://i.imgur.com/gMwGXoZ.png)) in the same way a kid might ""solve"" their sudoku puzzle by squeezing two numbers in one box because they can't figure out how to make the rows and columns fit together. 

While some rebuses may be better executed than others, it doesn't change my opinion that relying on rebuses to complete your crossword is analogous to relying on scissors to complete your jigsaw puzzle: fun perhaps and maybe even a little clever at times, but a cheap and inelegant way to go about a puzzle. 

In my view, one of the most important aspects of good crossword craftsmanship is being clever and concise enough to weave a large number of wildly different answers into one another seamlessly, especially if you can do so with a consistent theme throughout. This is the reason Will Shortz is arguably the greatest alive, and I consider it a shame when he wedges the occasional rebus in because I know he's capable of so much better.

____________________

# TL;DR

* Rebuses are a cheap challenge that break the flow of crossword-solving, but they're not included frequently enough to make them feel like part of the rules.
* Squeezing a bunch of tiny letters into a tiny box is weird and harder to read, especially when done in writing.
* Rebuses are used as a crutch by puzzlesmiths when they can't figure out how to make things fit together neatly, and make the puzzles inherently less impressive from a craftsmanship point of view. Crosswords with rebuses are almost always lower quality than rebus-free crosswords.
  * This is especially true for rebuses that don't even bother to use the same letters for the intersecting answers.
* I'm not arguing people can't like or enjoy rebuses in their puzzles, but rather that they generally detract more than they add and should therefore be omitted wherever possible.

For  example, if I'm writing a book that might be controversial and trigger  people politically, having a deep profile of information that people can  weaponize against you is risky. For example, looking at my profile, the  stuff I've saved, said, posted, gives a pretty clear view of my private  life, thoughts etc.

You have to get a job to pay for some of your accommodations, food, gas, rent, ect. When the time comes to apply for a job in your major and all you did was fold sweaters or flip burgers your chances of getting a job are lower then someone that has some relevant experience, it say on resume what experience you have that is relevant to the job. 


Think about it. For example you are going to school for hair and makeup. You have a job as a manager at a chain retail store let’s Walmart or Ross. Why not get a job in a hair and makeup store like Sephora, Ulta, Sally’s.  Working at Sephora would look better on your resume not managing being a manger at Walmart. 

There are all these jobs that need to be  filled but there not being filled because people don’t take the time the time to get the needed experience. I understand people sometimes need to do what they need to do and get a job to pay bills.How when the time comes to apply for a job in your field if you can’t check off most of what is needed to do the job you are not getting it."

9,2023-03-03,"CMV: Mansplaining as a term is overused, if it even deserves to exist at all",u/Fyrekidd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11hkiwr/cmv_mansplaining_as_a_term_is_overused_if_it_even/,changemyview,"I think that the term mansplaining is just a copout term that lets women shut down any man they perceive to be condescending. This term is defined using very subjective wording and intention; to someone with a victim complex, everyone is condescending, but a self assured and confident person sees nothing as condescending (examples, don't use them as hard references). 

Masculine communication style is characterized by a fact based approach using data, statistics, and clear statements. This style also tends to be or seem more dominating or assertive upon presentation. Women could be in conversation with a man who uses this communication style, who may genuinely not know the woman's depth of knowledge on any given topic, and still claim mansplaining because of the man's direct and flat approach to the engagement. 

I know there are times when a man could know full well they know nothing about the topic compared to the woman, and still try to be a dick and talk over them. The problem here is that they can also do it to a man as well, just as a woman can exhibit this behavior to either sex. 

Its not mansplaining if the guy was using a masculine communication style, had good intention, and was simply ill-informed without knowing he was. People make mistakes, everyone's wrong at some point, why do some women shriek mansplaining any time they perceive a man to be trying to maliciously correct them? 

Not everyone you think has bad intent really does, and its just as likely for a woman to feel offended by a man who's just trying to engage in conversation in the way he does with other men. The people who genuinely ""mansplain"" are usually not actively singling out women; they're probably just narcissistic (not saying they are true narcissists) and feel that most people are less qualified than they are. The remainder are sexist,simple. Just call it sexism and stop using extra terms for already established concepts.

EDIT: ""When the goal is independence, members of this speech community are likely to communicate in ways that exhibit knowledge, refrain from personal disclosure, are abstract, are focused on instrumentality, demonstrate conversational command, are direct and assertive, and are less responsive. Showing knowledge in conversation gives speakers the opportunity to present themselves as competent and capable. If someone has a problem at work one might respond, “You should do this …” or “The best way to deal with that is …” This strategy is sometimes referred to as a “communication tool box.” While some may interpret this as bossy, responding in a manner that tries to fix a problem for someone you care about makes a lot of sense."" This is from [here](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-introductiontocommunication/chapter/are-there-really-differences-in-gender-communication-styles/), hence where i got the masculine communication thing

EDIT: It didn't take long to realize a lot of misinterpretation has happened. I know sexism exists, i know it's been a pervasive problem in humanity since forever, i know not every male has this communication style, and i'm not trying to explain away sexist behavior.  I'm not saying you can't be narcissistic and sexist. The examples i gave were examples, not the hill i'd die on using for every instance. I'm aware theres different factors that attribute to it's use, that's why i gave factors that support the idea that it's being mis/overused in the first place. 

To summarize everything, mansplaining as a term shouldn't be used at all because of how easy it is for people to misunderstand its definition, and use it for their own agendas. No, not everyone misuses it for their own agendas. I can't just list every single reason, but a few more are that it's also used simply as an insult, to shut down a conversation, to have control over a conversation for whatever reason, and/or to evoke unnecessary negative emotion. This list was not exhaustive.

Final edit: i found alot of interesting and earnest responses, to which i am thankful for the opportunity to read and reply to. Unfortunately, there were enough responses filled with their own share of condescension and insults to prove to me more that this as a term is ridiculous. A noticeable section of support for its use comes from people who are hardly mature enough to refrain from blatantly cursing me out, but not enough to think without emotion clouding their views. 

I guess my view was changed in a way, because now im certain that mansplaining as a term is unnecessary and just adds fuel to a fire, that fire wont be explained because at this point its painfully clear that most of you will assume what you want anyway. This was disappointing. I wont be responding or humoring this anymore, but i hope it stays up for future readers to use as their own reference, whether it be for or against what i've learned through this headache of an experience."

2,2023-03-04,CMV: aliens exist,u/iloveturkeyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11hqcmb/cmv_aliens_exist/,changemyview," . Everyone’s entitled to their own beliefs ! 

  I think the possibility of there not being life beyond earth to be more scary then the thought of aliens. We think of aliens (at least I used too) as ET ass mfs. But it could be a tree. There’s this particular planet [Kepler -186f](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2081/where-the-grass-is-always-redder/)( similar enough to earth that has a different star then we do, meaning the lightwaves would cause the trees in the planet to all be red instead of green. Doesn’t that observation alone prove the existence of aliens??? Aliens could be bacteria or tiny 1 cellular organisms , this is where I get into conspiracy mode . The 4th dimension , and beyond that is physically impossible to conceptualize to 3rd dimensional creatures such as us. Learn more here, video is very interesting. [here](https://youtu.be/JmvHNatZgVI) so
I wonder , what could live in the other dimensions alone? And sticking to just the 3rd dimension, scientists believe life needs the same basic ingredients (organic matter, water, and to be in the habitable zone of its star) and that’s just a hypothesis. How do we know other planets don’t have elements we don’t have ? We can assume the planets in our solar system are mostly composed of the same compounds in different amount’s  because the collision that caused our planets to be formed pretty much just shot into huge chunks that over time turned into our planets and moons. But way beyond our galaxy is there not a possibility for more elements to exist ? And these elements could potentially play much different roles in evolution then the elements we have here on earth. Maybe I’m a huge dummy but not believing In aliens seems more probable than them just not existing. I feel like perhaps we’ve found evidence of aliens and we condition ppl into not believing people. I mean think about it, when have u ever heard someone say “I saw a ufo” and your first reaction wasn’t “this bitch done lost their mind”  there have been sightings( supposedly, but hey some have weight to them imo) even on live footage sense before smart phones and digital editing. But take that with a grain of salt, this isn’t contingent to my argument I just find that there have been too many sightings for a couple to not be somewhat accurate right? But I’ll admit I’m reaching on that one. So basically I fully believe in aliens and maybe 5% think we’ve spotted them, or      entered our planet. Like how can they just not exist?



The article I listed doesn’t say there ARE plants on that planet, when I wrote this I remembered it wrong. We don’t know for sure there is plants on Kepler 186f and that was my Trojan horse so, yeah I still believe in them
but just wanted to make sure y’all know I wasn’t intentionally misleading anyone"
2,2023-03-04,"CMV: Cis heterosexual’s men public lack of attraction to trans women is social, not biological",u/lcespice,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11hqkoy/cmv_cis_heterosexuals_men_public_lack_of/,changemyview,"To start off, you’ll often hear and read that only gay men can be interested in trans women, and a straight identified man who is honest about their attraction to one is a lying bisexual or closeted gay man because that attraction is inherently homosexual. I disagree and I think the aversion that heterosexual men in the west tend to have towards trans women publicly (because many will admit it in private) is due to society and how their culture has shaped their understanding of sexuality along with stigmatization

[Attraction to trans women is gynephilic in nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27858199/), and the men who are *mostly or exclusively* attracted to trans women show arousal patterns that align more with heterosexuality. I think heterosexual men can **naturally** be attracted to trans women like [Bailey Jay](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/bart_calendar/8134480/107163/107163_600.jpg), [Kataluna Enriquez](https://people.com/thmb/uLAmgMVeljBv1VslKYYkKTVsjeM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(490x205:492x207)/miss-nevada-5444748d1fbc45a6ad6ab0cf208f21ae.jpg), [Amiyah Scott](https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amiyah_Scott_Feature_Image.png), and if they possess a penis then they might be deemed **less** attractive than a cis female that’s equal to them in looks, but the attraction doesn’t die completely because they still possess a phenotype that leans far more female. Losing all attraction upon learning trans status is socially influenced 

I believe that attraction in general tends to be to a combination of things like phenotype and gender expression : 

- For much of human history, and prior to christendom in the west, it was normalized to have sex with feminine males. It wasn’t deemed gay nor was it stigmatized, and as a result most heterosexual men would partake in this

- In American Samoa there is a third gender category called fa’afafine who are comprised of feminine males. In that culture fa’afafine are well accepted, and not only do most people claim to be friends with one, most of the men in that culture have had sexual relations with a fa’afafine. This is not considered gay nor is it stigmatized

- In Oaxaca, Mexico among the Istmo Zapotec, there is a third gender category known as Muxes which is comprised of feminine males. These feminine males do not have relationships with each other but exclusively date and sleep with men that are considered straight. This is such a normalized practice that these Muxes are seen as legitimate competition by heterosexual women for male attention. [Up to 85% of Istmo Zapotec women have reported to have competed against a Muxes for a man](https://newslinesamoa.com/canadian-university-study-looks-at-sexual-competition-between-samoan-women-and-faafine/)

Taking all of that into consideration, the unattraction and at times even repulsion to trans women that western straight men in particular express is influenced by their culture due to how sexuality is constructed in their society, as opposed to being some biological reaction because they’re not gay. Heterosexual men are responsive to both sex and gender (fem/masc), so I do believe in general they’re more physically attracted to cis females, but they’re not naturally unattracted and repulsed by a trans woman, especially one who is post-op and is externally phenotypically female. Attraction to trans women is not inherently homosexual"

One of them is that consuming blood in any form is prohibited e.g. you can't eat nor can you get a blood transfusion.

The why is as usual in religious people that it's written somewhere in their scriptures, ""that you shouldn't be consuming blood"".  

The main hypothetical to defend the view that blood transfusion and consuming alcohol was this one:

""If your doctor gave his patient the order that you shouldn't be consuming alcohol, instead now he injects it into his veins, you would still be arguing that he is consuming it""

Another colleague of mine interjected and said that that's comparing ""oranges with apples"" that blood is vital for life while alcohol isn't, so it's a false equivalency.

But I don't think that's relevant to the point.  
The hypothetical just wants to show that injection is still a form of consumption, it's rather irrelevant what  you inject. 

You can replace alcohol with anything and it still would be valid argument.

To CMV you would just have to prove that it is indeed a false equivalency.

My view is that these discussions should be contextualized by the reparations the US government actually paid to Japanese who were interned in camps during WWII. 

The simple fact is that nobody who is alive today in the United States was enslaved. Neither were their grandparents, or their great grandparents, or their great-great grandparents. That is not a wrong that can be effectively redressed today simply because nobody who is alive today was directly affected by it. 

However, there is very real systemic racism that occurred recently, in the 1960s federally and several years afterwards in individual states. 

Reparations are not something that I was initially receptive towards, but I have conceived a path forward on this matter. 

Japanese internees during WWII were paid a total of $1.6b in 1992. Adjusted for inflation, this amounted to just over $41,000 for every living person who had been interned. 

I don't know about you, but I personally believe that being interned by force in camps trumps anything black people encountered in the 1960s and beyond. So giving every black person alive today $40,000 is an insult to the Japanese internees. I don't think we can seriously say that being ripped from your home and forced into camps is better than being segregated by race. It's not in the same ballpark, and it's the closest this country has gotten to slavery since the Civil War. 

I would propose that every black person alive today be given a cash amount between $10,000 and $20,000. I've heard crazy proposals of giving black people $5 million, and I've of course heard arguments that no reparations are necessary. This is my compromise. 

And one could say that we shouldn't use the Japanese reparations as a baseline, because the Japanese internees should've been paid more. On that I agree. However, even if we had paid Japanese internees more, I don't believe that would raise the bar for black people subjected to segregation all that much. The simple fact of the matter remains that internment is a hell of a lot worse than segregation. 

So I would support $10,000 to $20,000 to every living black American today. I, who up until very recently thought reparations as a concept were absurd. 

I don't think you can find many people who would truly support more than that, nor is it even feasible to pay more than that. If you think inflation is bad now, just wait until 33 million people have an extra $10,000 in their pocket all at once. That would actually hurt the people reparations are trying to help in the long run."
12,2023-03-04,CMV: Student loans should not be forgiven.,u/space_force_majeure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11hybxq/cmv_student_loans_should_not_be_forgiven/,changemyview,"I have been following this topic on Reddit, in the news, and with friends, and have yet to hear a compelling argument for why student loans should be forgiven. I am a Democrat and will vote blue regardless of how SCOTUS rules, so please trust me that I am arguing in good faith. I also want to add that the wording of the 2003 HEROES Act ***does*** give the Executive branch the authority to forgive loans this way, regardless of my feelings. Let's dive into it. 

First off, student loan forgiveness fixes nothing. It will result in colleges realizing they can take in even more profit because these are guaranteed loans and eventually the government will take care of it anyway. There will be a huge financial incentive to increase education costs. 

Student loan forgiveness is also simply unfair. Nearly 90% of Americans do not have federal student loan debt. This action would be the most expensive executive order in history, and it helps an extremely small minority of people in America. That small minority is also statistically better off financially than their less educated fellow Americans. This does not help poor people, because the poorest people in America do not go to college at all. 

Let me also state that the current higher education system needs reworked. I wholeheartedly support some level of free higher education as part of a K-12 expansion, as ideally it would be used to encourage people to go into fields where there are major shortages (healthcare, education, etc). But that would be a future fix, not a retroactive fix for debt and terms that were already agreed upon. 

Here are some of the common arguments I've heard in favor of loan forgiveness and why I disagree. 

**1) We were told college was the only way to be successful, and loans were the only way to afford to go to college.** 

In America, people are considered adults at age 18. They can drive, vote, and convict fellow citizens as part of a jury. If 18 year olds are trusted to make these critical decisions, surely they can see how their choice of major affects their future earning potential. Also, basic economics is taught in all 50 states starting around middle school. There they explained basic compound interest and what principal is, and how the two effect each other. 

That being said, I would agree that a reduced interest rate cap, tied to the Federal Reserve rate, would be a good compromise to help struggling borrowers while still providing a guaranteed return to loan investors. 

**2) Student loans are predatory to young people because of the interest rate and the inability to discharge the loans in bankruptcy.** 

The average student loan rate is 5.8% according to the Education Data Initiative. That's on par with most mortgage rates from the early 2000's, and no one has said those rates were predatory. 

Student loans are unsecured debt, and bankruptcy only remains on credit reports for 10 years. Given that most student loans are expected to have terms longer than 10 years, there would be a huge incentive for young people to take out their loans and then immediately file for bankruptcy. With no collateral to repossess, no institution would provide the capital for these loans at all if they could be discharged. 

**3) Student loan forgiveness will boost the economy.** 

[***edit here:*** I'll leave my original wording below so everyone can see it, but a few commentors below have made good points specifically about my economic argument. The negative economic impact of 43 million of people being unable to save for future expenses/retirement will result in more than $10k worth of cost to all of us, if they end up forced into poverty and using other government safety nets.

I am still not convinced that we should forgive student debt, but I acknowledge the economic argument was flawed.]

I argue it will actually hurt the economy by making inflation worse. 43 million people will now have a sudden increase of hundreds of dollars per month in disposable income. Companies will know they can start charging more, because people can and will pay for it. This isn't just ""deleting"" debt, it is the equivalent of giving 43 million people a government funded pay raise. A penny saved is a penny earned after all. 

**4) Student loan forgiveness will help the Democrats politically.** 

Most independents and Republicans are staunchly against debt forgiveness if there are impacts to inflation, tuition, or increased college degree requirements. There is even a sizable segment of Democrats who are against forgiveness as well. Again, nearly 90% of Americans will get no benefit from debt forgiveness, and people are frustrated about that. To put that in perspective, nearly 27% of Americans are on Medicaid, more than twice the number of federal student loan borrowers. It seems to me this is a bad political policy. 

Sorry this was so long, but I look forward to hearing some well thought out arguments in favor of SLF. Thanks."

12,2023-03-04,"CMV: Forcing artificial intelligence to pay or have someone else pay for it to view a dataset without imposing the same rules on organic intelligence is hypocritical, selfish, and likely comes from ignorance about one’s own nature as an organic machine",u/Esperling30,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11hzeth/cmv_forcing_artificial_intelligence_to_pay_or/,changemyview,"I realized at the center of ai art controversy, there is mostly money to be found as the reason for said controversy. Every video or story I’ve heard is about how the art belongs to the artist and AI should pay to train on it. 

It feels as if there is some level of correlation in these claims to those claiming non-fungible tokens are valid and copying them should be illegal. If a person views 5 different nft’s, learns the art style, and opens commissions for making similar art, should the nft creator be paid? Better yet, if an internet service provider allowed access to sites previously unreachable to the artist, but charges most of their income for it, leaving only room for payments of whatever the artist desired, should either of them be charged?

And what happens when general intelligence is developed artificially? What of the biocomputers that have already been proven to function? Eventually the argument of “the intelligence isn’t human enough to count” will prove itself useless. And even though the intelligence is leagues behind ours, why does that allow for discrimination? We are just machines, certainly better than current ai but not forever. Do dumber things get special treatment because they are dumb, or rather, vastly inferior in every way but one? If so, why?

The one argument that comes close is the human artist’s need for money, but that’s a capitalism problem, not an AI problem, and crippling AI won’t solve it, just temporarily prevent exacerbation of the situation.

I am in a position where in order to pursue a dream, I need art. And to get the art I need from humans, I need money I don’t have and can’t get due to a crippling disorder. This is likely a source of bias, but I can’t find where it influences my logic to the point of invalidation. Hence my post.

tldr: I just think artists can’t have it both ways without hypocrisy. Training with art made by humans for free while forcing non-human intelligence fractions to pay to train with their art seems hypocritical.

Follow up question: if the developers of the AI only charged humans using the AI for the storage, power, and upkeep of the intelligence behind the art, would that make it more palatable?

0,2023-03-04,"CMV: Online ""thots"" (as in seductive TikTokers, streamers, etc.) can be good wives.",u/My_Wholesome_Acc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11i0c7c/cmv_online_thots_as_in_seductive_tiktokers/,changemyview,"When I'm scrolling through comments in these girls' profiles in social networks, I often read demeaning comments saying that these girls are ""high mileage"" and that they have no value as potential wives and will eventually get old without anyone by their sides.

I think this argument is completely nonsense. First because showing your body online as a hustle does not imply having a multitude of sexual partners IRL.

As a matter of fact, most online ""thots"" are in the game for the money, so it would not make sense for them to be having sex with a lot of men for free. And even though there are escorts that decide to also become online ""thots"", many girls who work with sex online do so because they'd not be comfortable having actual sexual intercourse with clients.

So, this whole ""sexual exposure"" is a money thing: It does not relate to the ""thot"" wanting to fuck several guys, let alone to develop emotional bonds with 'em. Therefore, her online ""thot"" hustle wouldn't necessarily imply she given you less attention or cheating on you.

Actually, she can likely give you more attention than the average woman, as she has a higher ""pay received to time worked"" ratio than the average individual.

And given that many of these online ""thots"" make big sums of money by themselves, they have less reason to try to ""marry up"" than a housewife or the typical working class girl — so they actually have lower odds of being ""goldiggers"" or cloth chasers than people who have no gold or cloth by themselves.

Actually, I've been friends with several in person sex workers in my life and they're often the ""providers"" in the relationship. I can't see why that wouldn't apply to online ""thots"".

...

Therefore, up until now we can conclude that online ""thots"" aren't necessarily more promiscuous than any regular girl, that they have more time available to devote to your relationship with her and less reason to be a golddigger and more means to provide you nice experiences with her money.

...

Now, let me address one of the counterarguments that you may bring: ""they may have mental health issues"".

As a matter of fact they can, but so can the average person. Anxiety and depression are commonplace in the modern world, and it is understandable, given that most people have to work long stressful hours and can get little sleep — plus, we usually have poor family education and don't properly handle bullying in schools.

The online overexposure of the ""thots"" can bring them mental distress, but they're also less likely to face some of the stressors that other people face.

And even if you could prove that on average the ""thots"" have worse mental health, that would not mean that there aren't some online ""thots"" that are mentally healthy and just chose this career path as a way to maximize their economic return in a though economic environment.

Last but not least, for those who'd argue ""What will our child think?"", ""Our son you will be bullied!"":

If people are judgemental towards ""thots"", that's on their own stupidity.

A properly raised son won't resent a loving and caring mother because of her career choices. And a properly raised son will learn how to defend himself and his family from insults, not letting himself be oppressed by the opinion of those that are ignorant and biased. This experience, as a matter of fact, may help him become a much stronger man in the future.

...

PS.: I never said that all online ""thots"" must be good wives. But I argued they aren't by any means worse options in comparison to other women, and even have some advantages in relation to them, especially if they're successful in their field."

Modern social media revolves around getting users addicted so they can spend the most time possible using them and seeing ads, because that means more money. These companies have developed algorithms and methods so effective it pretty much feels like they hack your brain, I'm sure most of you have been in the situation where you grab your phone and instinctively open instagram or whatever without even thinking of it, you could do it with closed eyes because your finger already knows where it is, and you probably had something else in mind when you picked up your phone but forgot about it once you opened instagram and started mindlessly scrolling. It's become a great excuse to never ever feel bored and never ever be alone with your thoughts, and I feel like we need time with our own brains.  
Now, it's not just that we open those apps without thinking, the content itself can get very problematic. The algorithms have gotten really good at showing you the exact content that will keep you engaged, regardless of what impact said content may have. it doesn't matter if you're engaged because you're happy or because you're angry, what matters is you're engaged, and that often leads to you only seeing questionable content such fake news, outrageous extremist views, unrealistic expectations (such as life goals or body image), among other things. These have brought very serious real life consequences such as increased polarization due to people never leaving their online bubbles (sometimes going as far as actual violence being pushed by social media, seriously, it sometimes feels like some people stop seeing those that think differently as human beings at all) and all sorts of mental problems such as depression and feelings of isolation.

And speaking of isolation, it feels like we're lonelier than ever, turns out replacing such a big chunk of our social interactions for likes, shares and status updates does not actually improve the quality of our social connections, it just makes our junky brains go brrr because someone clicked a button when they saw our post, but then you see an old friend in person and there's nothing to catch up on because you already know everything new in their life since they publicly share all of it."

But I very much disagree with this idea. The vast majority of criminals, victims of violent crime, victims of workplace accidents, and homeless people are men. Statistically, men are twice as likely as women to be sentenced after a conviction, and receive sentences that are over 60% longer, which is even worse than the disparity between black and white people.

Women outnumber men by an astounding 50% in higher education; if these numbers were reversed, you would already hear calls about ""sexist higher education institutions."" Study after study demonstrates that boys are underachieving in high school and that many teachers have an implicit bias against them in the humanities.

The thing is, for every sexist assumption made about women, there IS an opposite assumption made about men. If women are ""weak,"" then men must be ""strong."" If women are innocent, men are *less* innocent. If women are judged by their looks, men are judged by their paychecks. And when these things happen, we don't call it misandry, we just call it a ""side effect of misogyny,"" which IMO is disgusting. Control the language, and you control how people think.

Even worse, some people seemingly acknowledge that these issues exist, but then turn around and say something like ""well men dominate the halls of power so clearly it's their own fault for oppressing themselves so I don't give a fuck hahaha."" Now, to be clear, I'm not here to play oppression Olympics, and I certainly wouldn't take away from the trauma that women have gone through and still go through under our historically patriarchal society. But in the modern Western world, I feel like it's high time these issues are finally acknowledged."

If the 'devil's influence' is the reason for things that aren't in accordance with Bible principles, it sounds like heaven would be boring as hell (hehe). We hear about eternal damnation and hellfire and all that, but:

1) The only accounts we have of what hell is supposedly like is from the opposition. That's like saying the Cowboys suck because a 49ers fan told you so

2) If it was the devil's influence, why would I be punished for doing his bidding? If your mom tells you to wash the dishes and you go wash the dishes, she's likely not gonna punish you for it

3) The Bible highlights things such as eternal life and no sickness in heavy/paradise earth, but even if those things aren't absent in hell, what's it gonna do, kill you? 

It may sound childish, but I'd rather spent an eternity living in a setting that would likely equate to that of a GTA character. Eternal peace is great, but like anything, once you achieve what is desirable, you're gonna get bored. Maybe in your senior years, you'd like to sit back and watch a lion sleep on the back of a hippo, but if I'm to have the health of a 20-year-old for eternity, at some point I'm gonna want to see a pack of lions dismember that hippo

tl;dr: eternal paradise sounds boring. I'd rather get shot in the face and respawn in a strip club

Edit: to be clear, I'm not religious in the slightest, and don't believe in the teachings of any holy book. I'm simply picking a religious doctrine that I have some knowledge of--having practiced as a Jehovah's Witness in the past--and challenging inconsistencies

VIEW CHANGED: This post was based on the mainstream idea that Satan is ruling in hell and that's where his followers will be, but seeing as the Bible is the only representation of this, and it states that it was created by God as a means of punishment for Satan, there is no room for interpretation here."

One side can say that guns should require insurance, registration, and safety requirements, plus a licensing system.

118,2023-03-04,CMV: Drug decriminalization without legalization is dangerously illogical.,u/robinfranc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11ikjtw/cmv_drug_decriminalization_without_legalization/,changemyview,"By ""decriminalizing"" drugs *while keeping their production and sale illegal* you are simultaneously reducing the costs of drug consumption while keeping all of the negatives of the drug war. 

First, ""decriminalization"" without legalization ensures those drugs will be sold by and directly profit the most violent criminal gangs on earth. By definition, it ensures no non-criminal will be able to produce or sell drugs. Besides foreign drug cartels, domestic gangs that cause the large majority of murders in North America will have their monopoly on a massively profitable business. 

Beyond the literal mass murder these gangs commit, keeping the supply of drugs illegal ensures they cannot be regulated in any way. That means keeping drugs far more dangerous than would be due to unknown potencies and adulterants, which we know contributes largely to drug overdoses.

That also applies to taxation, which cannot be done on illegal transactions. As a result, we all lose out on tens of billions in lost tax revenue that instead goes directly to criminals and mass murderers. We also lose the ability to reduce demand through taxation, as we have done with cigarettes and alcohol. 

Every piece of economic theory and historical evidence has shown that going after suppliers simply makes it more profitable for the more ruthless violent cartels that remain, and pushes users towards more dangerous drugs. The current overdose crisis is a direct result of the government going after prescription opioids, which pushed pill users to unregulated heroin and eventually fentanyl.

Reducing supply artificially just makes it even more profitable for those that remain by driving up the price (and incentivizing new entrants). We've done that so successfully that there are almost no criminal gangs on earth not involved in the drug business. 

The only countries that have largely eliminated drug use are places like Singapore, China, and Saudi Arabia. These places are differentiated by going after drug *users* with extreme punishments, which reduce demand for drugs and thus the profitability of selling them. This makes economic sense: reducing demand makes it less profitable for sellers, though it's probably political infeasible. By contrast, decriminalization *reduces* the effective costs of drug consumption, even if only somewhat. 

Given all of that, I think decriminalization is at best ineffective and at worst will increase drug use, while ensuring those drugs remain extremely dangerous and sold by violent criminals."

Whenever you make a choice, it comes with some degree of responsibility for the outcome. If the people of a nation are given the choice over who serves in their government, voters have some degree of responsibility for the actions of the government they chose. 

When Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, the rest of the world rightfully rolled their eyes at the US. Do the millions of Americans who voted for Trump not hold some degree of responsibility for such a backwards move in environmental protection? They willingly voted for a man who bragged about his plans to leave the agreement.

If a government does something wrong, like wage an unjust war or deny its involvement in war crimes, it reflects on the will of the voters chose them in the first place.

For example, Denmark deployed troops in the Iraq War. If you consider the invasion of Iraq to be unjustified, do the Danes not have some degree of responsibility for electing a government that decided to join the Iraq War? Denmark is not like Russia, a country where elites decide everything. Denmark is one of the most democratic countries in the world, so doesn't the actions of the government reflect the will of those who voted it into power?

Another example, Japan routinely elects politicians who like to deny war crimes. The late PM Abe had close ties with Nippon Kaigi, an organization that claims Imperial Japan was a ""benevolent"" force for ""liberating"" Asia in WW2. Perhaps his original constituents in Yamaguchi liked him despite his war crime apologia, but doesn't this reflect the priorities of his voters? When his party elected him prime minister, doesn't this reflect the fact that Japanese voters think that war crime denial is justifiable as long as Abe delivers economic and military reform?"

Every time the researchers seem to be mystified: why aren’t people having kids??? And then I read the comments and a lot of people chime in with “well it’s because of expensive housing!” Or “it’s because of climate change!”

So. Speaking as a very financially stable American woman in her 30s: I can totally afford kids. I just don’t WANT THEM. At least not now. They are annoying, interrupt my peaceful life, and put a huge drag on my career ambitions. I am EXCITED about other things I can do in my life other than having kids. Will I have kids at some point? Maybe but I keep on postponing it cause it just straight up doesn’t sound like a good time. 

My theory is that a lot of people feel this way too. Back when we had NO CHOICE whatsoever and no options, sure people had 5 children because what else was there to do? We were socialized into it and believed it was our only choice. 

But now that people know they can have a fulfilling career and make good money and travel and live stress free, suddenly raising children isn’t as attractive a lifestyle option.

So imho governments can hand out as many financial incentives as they want- unless it’s a stupid amount of money (say an extra $100k per year per child) it won’t move the needle. Cause it’s not the fact that people are missing an extra $3k (Japan latest incentive) to have a kid- it’s the fact that people now (especially women) have so many more things to do that having children is simply not as exciting."

In many countries, prostitution is banned. Even in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most states. But we have to face these questions: Why are we banning prostitution? Is sex one of the basic human rights? Is banning prostitution the right thing to do?

First of all, I can guess that some people (especially women) will say: if sex industry is legal, human trafficking will be a serious problem. I disagree with this view. For example, as long as a country allows people to use cars, there must be traffic accidents in this country, right? So, should we ban cars? The answer is of course no. So, if you think the problem of ""human trafficking"" is going to get serious, then you just need to step up efforts to crack down on traffickers, not ban prostitution.

Then, some people will say: prostitution insults women. Or to put it another way: The porn industry doesn't respect women. Please, it's really hard for me to understand why you guys think this way. Isn't it fair that a whore has sex with me and I pay her? It's as if you go to work in a company and the boss pays you, it's the same.

So, I can't think of any reason to ban prostitution at all.

More importantly, having sex is one of the basic rights of human beings, and banning prostitution is a blatant violation of human rights. Can you imagine? A 20-year-old guy lives in pain every day because he can't have sex with girls (for various reasons, like he's too shy to approach girls). Do you think all this suffering he suffered was necessary? If he had been born in a truly free country (like Holland) where prostitution was possible, he wouldn't have suffered these things. I want to say that his country has violated his human rights, and such a country should be sanctioned by the United Nations. I hope that such a country will perish immediately.

So let's all work together to legalize prostitution in every country! Hats off to the Netherlands!"
71,2023-03-05,"CMV: Politicians should travel as little as possible, and do almost everything from their offices.",u/ButItWasMeDio,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11j7eml/cmv_politicians_should_travel_as_little_as/,changemyview,"Anytime a politician visits near me, or an event I also attend, I consider it a hassle. Why? Because they are going to be surrounded by a security detail, probably barricade streets and overall make the place harder to navigate for everyone else.

For context I live in France, where this sometimes happens, and worse: in defiance of freedom of speech, the police/security guards remove mocking or critical posters or shirts on the politicians' path so they don't have to look at anything they don't like.

In the age of information where means of remote communication are more widespread than ever, politicians causing disturbance by leaving their office seems redundant most of the time and is often only done for the sake of optics.

For example, in the past year world leaders such as Biden, Macron, Scholz, Draghi and more traveled to Kyiv to visit Zelensky. Was it worth the hassle for a few photo ops when they could have had the same conversations remotely? On that topic, everyone seems to praise Zelensky for staying in Kyiv during the war but that just seems like an unnecessary risk unless he's somehow unable to command troops remotely. General De Gaulle fled to London during WWII and not many people hold it against him nowadays.

There is also the topic of campaigning: for example, people held it against Clinton when she didn't visit Michigan. But why? Her policies are on her website, why do you need to see her in person? And if you don't trust her, she can lie to your face the same way she can on TV.

There's also the issue of pollution caused by private jets. Of course relatively few people use them in the first place but even little bit counts, and if citizens are expected to pollute less, politicians should lead by example.

Now to address a few counterarguments:

1. Communications can be spied on or hacked. Sure, but they can be encrypted too, and if it was that big of an issue world leaders could NEVER talk on the phone, which they do.
2. Are politicians not allowed to visit their families, or go on vacation? Sure but that shouldn't be anyone else's problem. If it's too risky for them to go without disturbing everyone else with a gigantic security apparatus, it's to risky for them to go period. Or they take on the risk personally: people criticized former president Hollande when he went to visit his mistress on a bike, but at least he didn't blockade Paris for that.
3. Conspiracy time: if they don't appear in public, what if they are just figureheads and get replaced by someone else behind the scenes? Well politicians can be manipulated without the need for that, as shown by the South Korean president and her guru. Plus since officials have no legal obligations to uphold their program, you're not guaranteed to get what you voted for either way.

On that last point, it's a bigger topic, but if politicians were more beholden to their program and could be swapped out for someone else applying the same program, there would be little point in assassinating them in the first place. But I digress"

Basically, it’s so linguistics know exactly what sounds others are talking about, with having to say “eh” or “a as in about” when every single dialect is different.

And, a lot of the time, there are people who are saying “how do you pronounce this?” And everybody says keh-sih-tuh or something stupid like that, instead, you could use the IPA! And as long as you learn that script you can be exact.

Now, I’m just making this clear, I do NOT think we should use ipa as an actual writing system, it’s incredibly stupid, and if you want reasoning check out K. Klein’s video on it.

The IPA isn’t really even that hard for people to learn! Most of the sounds are the same as in Latin, like /t/ is the exact same as the English “t”, then you just have to learn a dozen or so new symbols from the Greek alphabet and maybe some rotated letters, and boom, and sometimes if you don’t know how to pronounce it and you aren’t a linguist, you don’t need to learn the sounds that aren’t in your language."

Yes, that includes drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine and fentanyl.

While I am aware of the argument that many of these other drugs have caused many deaths yet no deaths have been ""directly attributable to marijuana"", I believe that there are other dangers that are often ""invisible"" and not taken into account when considering the harm that a drug does to society as a whole.

First, I want to begin by stating that I believe the widespread availability and social acceptability of marijuana potentiate the severity of marijuana's adverse effects on society because it discredits the seriousness of the drug's consequences (the following of which have been researched and evidenced). This is a significant factor in my view because I don't see how it doesn't open the door to widespread marijuana usage turning into what happened with cigarettes (with society widely accepting it as safe, only to regret it and deal with disastrous consequences decades down the road)

\- Students who smoke marijuana have poorer educational outcomes than their nonsmoking peers

 \- Those who use it regularly may be functioning at a reduced intellectual level most or all of the time.  

 \-&gt; Regular marijuana usage during periods of development in the adolescent brain has shown to be able to cause drops in IQ

\- Heavy marijuana use has been linked to students being less likely to graduate high school, enroll in college or trade programs, and more likely to not want to seek employment. 

\- As perception of harm decreases, usage continues to increase.

I believe that marijuana has robbed our collective society of so much productivity while also robbing its users of their potential. I can't help but imagine that out of the millions of people who have fallen victim to marijuana's consequences, society may have missed out on people who had the potential to accomplish things such as finding cures for rare diseases or cancers, but instead have had their futures stripped away from them by marijuana.

I believe that these factors, along with the social acceptability of marijuana causing such factors to be exponentially more dangerous, are reasons to believe that marijuana is more dangerous to collective society than any other drug.

so signing this space agreement where the Us is a huge leader would mean access to better tech and space innovation than india has right now

this is important because in the future, space mining (from asteroids) is going to be a huge thing, its expected to bring in quintillions of dollar. india needs this if theyre going to be a country w any bit of power

things that could change my view: 
if people in india are negatively impacted by this, but i dont see how this could be the case as joining the agreement promises them riches in the future from the asteroid mining

For counterarguments:
1. i know people might say that india needs to focus on other issues, but as far as i know, joining the records doesnt really require anything

2. also to people that are going to say that russia and china will be angry w india joining - china is already acting aggressive with their cyber attacks. and if russia does anything then the us would intervene, as india is already one of their allies

from this i dont see why india should not sign this space agreement, since it will be benefitting them a lot - people who think differently - what are your thoughts?"

Even if you expand to allow sequels, only 5 of the top 40 are sequels (Avatar 2, Top Gun: Maverick, Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, Pirates of The Caribbean 2), and 3 of those are nostalgia sequels (Avatar, Top Gun, and Incredibles) that came out at least a decade after the original.

With the massive success of franchises, there is no need to create an original character, plot, or setting, as you will be outcompeted by a generic Marvel movie or Disney remake. Also, many recent movies have been much worse off because they hunt the moneybags from cinematic universes (The Mummy remake, DCEU, Dracula Untold), instead of just trying to make an interesting story. Franchises also create the problem where no character or world can be threatened as that would end the franchise

If franchises are bad, then remakes are even worse. A franchise can get by with very little new content, but a remake, by definition, usually adds nothing at all. Spin-offs can vary from just leeching off of the original (Minions) to actually pretty good (Logan), but generally don't add more than an original story would have.

I am willing to concede that sequels give the original more incentive to succeed and allow a successful original to get the resources it needs to have a fuller story. I also fully admit that there are some good movies in franchises, like The Batman. However, as a whole, I believe that franchises do more harm than good for creativity.

Edit: OK, I will say that a complete story that is simply too long to fit into 2 movies (like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) could be acceptable, as long as it is one large story, rather than something like a Marvel or Pirates of the Caribbean movie that is a series of individual stories.

497,2023-03-06,CMV: Jews have no legitimate claim to the land of modern day Israel. A two-state solution is already a major concession made by the Palestinians.,u/HuangHuaYu49,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11jt0fl/cmv_jews_have_no_legitimate_claim_to_the_land_of/,changemyview,"After reading about the Israel-Palestine conflict, I was shocked at how rarely people point out the flawed logic behind pro-Israel arguments. I do not believe Jews have a meaningful claim to the land of Israel, and a ""Jewish state"" should have never been established in the region. I will be debunking common arguments for a Jewish state of Israel below, and will gladly respond to any others that are brought up to this post.

1) The Jews deserve a homeland because centuries of history have shown their safety is never guaranteed in non-Jewish countries.

I agree, Jews have every right to establish their own country so they do not have to worry about being a persecuted minority. However, Jews do not have a right to establish a Jewish state over a region that is already inhabited by non-Jewish people. If the principal concern is establishing a country where Jews can be safe, why does it have to be established in a region that is majority Muslim? There are other regions of the world with unoccupied land, but Jews insist their nation be established over the historic land of Israel. In this case, the ""Jews just want a homeland"" is a red herring to avoid the issue of a Jewish state being established over a region occupied by Arabs for centuries.

2) Jews legally bought land in Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Yes, Jews legally bought land during both the Ottoman and British administration of the region. However, these were regarding private ownership of the land, which is different from sovereignty of the land. Many Chinese people buy real estate in Vancouver, but it does not mean Chinese people buy the sovereignty of Vancouver. The land is still legally the territory of Canada, Chinese people cannot establish a ""Chinese state"" because they bought real estate in Vancouver. Therefore, Jews legally buying land in Palestine does not mean it gives them the right to establish a Jewish state on that land.

3) Jews earned the right to establish a Jewish state in Israel after it negotiated the Balfour Declaration from Britain.

This was a colonial era document. If you think colonial territory agreements should be maintained, then you are against the independence of Korea, Vietnam, India, etc. The British should have never made such promises on the first place, especially considering they made overlapping promises to the Arabs in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence. A similar argument is that Jews earned the land after winning a war instigated by an Arab coalition. This is right by conquest, which has no longer been recognized by international law since the resolution of WW2. 

4) Jews made better use of their land than the original Ottoman/Arab landowners. ""Israelis like to build, Arabs like to bomb and..."" Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, where gay people can have their relationship legally recognized.

People bring up these points because they believe Israelis have made ""better use"" of the land than their Palestinian Arabs counterparts, therefore Jews deserve the land. This is not how sovereignty works. Imperial Japan was famous for using this argument to justify the annexing/colonization of Okinawa/Taiwan/Manchuria/Korea/etc. This was almost universally condemned, and Imperial Japan is nothing more than two mushroom clouds over the ash heap of history. Even if Japan made greater crop yields/repealed some antiquated practices/provided industrial living conditions to these colonies, doesn't change the fact they were occupying land and people against their will.

5) Arabs live much more peaceful and prosperous lives in Israel, compared to life in Palestine. Israel grants equal rights to it's Arab citizens, many of which are part of the Israeli government.

Just because you give equal rights to Palestinian Arabs doesn't mean you are entitled to their land. By this logic, US can annex even more of Mexico, so long as it offers the Mexicans in the region full US citizenship. It also doesn't solve the issue that the Arabs cannot truly be equals when a Jewish state occupies a majority Muslim region. If you believe in truly equality, you would not need to enshrine Israel as a ""Jewish state,"" this is just to hedge against the fact the region of Palestine is majority Arab Muslims.


6) Jews were the original inhabitants of the region, Jews have maintained a continuous presence in the region of Israel throughout history.

Regardless of who the original inhabitants of the region were, the majority of the region has been inhabited by Arab Muslims for the past few centuries. If you believe being the original inhabitants entitles you to the land forever, does that mean the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand have to return the land to the indigenous population? These indigenous groups were displaced within the past 5 centuries, with some regions still being majority indigenous until the past 2 centuries, whereas Jews did not administer the region for over a millennium. I understand this is a very serious part of your identity, with the name ""Palestine"" already being a huge scar in your ethnic history, but we cannot undo these tragic events in your history. America is named after an Italian explorer, our capital is named after a colonizer and a slaveowner. The Jews are not the only ones who have historical trauma.

7) There was no such thing as a ""Palestinian"" identity until recently, they were just Arabs. Arabs have 22 countries, why can't they accept there being one Jewish state?

Most serious people are not saying there cannot be a Jewish state. They are merely arguing that you cannot establish a Jewish state over land that is already inhabited by Arabs. Just because Arabs have a lot of land, doesn't mean you are entitled to some of their land. By this logic, Korea is entitled to some of China's land, Bangladesh is entitled to some of India's land, and Mongolia is entitled to some of Russia's land. It doesn't matter whether the Arabs considered themselves distinctly Palestinian, they are not Jewish and do not want to be under a Jewish state.

8) Israel has always been willing to give concessions for peace, but the Palestinians always reject peace treaties.

From the very start, these peace proposals have been favored towards Israel. The 1947 borders gave the Jewish minority sovereignty over the majority of land in the region. Other sore spots include Israel wanting sovereignty over East Jerusalem, and Israel wanting their borders to encompass areas with arable land and water sources. A two state solution is already a large concession for the Palestinans to make, Israel should offer more concessions.

9) Israel wants peace, but the Palestinians choose terrorism. Israel has no choice but to make ""hard decisions"" for its own security. The Arab League/Muslim Brotherhood/Iran all want us blown off the map.

Palestinians had no interest in being under a Jewish state, yet it was imposed against their will. It is not unlike the Macabbeans, who revolted against their Seleucid occupiers. You can't occupy/displace people and then be shocked when they fight back. Israel is not a perfect victim, it exacerbated the problem when it bankrolled extremists groups in Palestine in order to destabilize the opposition. While I acknowledge Israel has legitimate security concerns from hostile neighbors, what did you expect when you displaced Muslims to establish a Jewish state in a region dominated by Muslims?



Ideally, the region of Palestine should have been one state, where the rights of the Jewish minority would be enshrined in its constitution. Ultimately, I recognize that Israel has existed for almost 75 years, and at this point the one-state solution is no longer viable. Most of the world has made the right steps in accepting Israel as a member of the world. I wrote this post because I wanted to point out that the framework of the two state solution should have never been used in the first place, and the two state solution is the consequence of the UN's failure to objectively solve the problem in 1947."

If people care about animals, to the extent, that they don’t want them to suffer- they should just stop eating meat, or at least stop lying to themselves, because, this stance is just paradoxical.

I know it’s just a way for people to feel less guilty about themselves, and this is a corporate strategy to retain consumption.

For me-I eat meat, so I can’t pretend to have the ethics.

Moreover, as seen in the US, it effectively gives lobbyists for corporate interest more influence in the government as they have buddies that they know would be there for a few years or so.

I know that political terms are usually done in years because in the past, communications is an issue, hence the need for terms lasting years to supervise and implement governmental policies. But with the internet and modern communications shortening time and in a sense automating political process, I think we can work with much shorter political office terms such as terms measured in minutes at least or weeks at most (and once per lifetime) to prevent backsliding of an elected government into a dictatorship and entrenchment of power."

There are several key terms in that thesis, which must be explained:

* ""Scientific theory"": A scientific theory, as I am using the term here, is a theory about the natural world that the overwhelming majority of the scientific community says has been established beyond a reasonable doubt using the scientific method.

* ""Wrong beyond a reasonable doubt"": A reasonable doubt is a doubt that has some actual, substantial basis in fact or argument. I used this term rather than the term ""certainly wrong"" because I don't want to get into philosophical questions about whether absolute certainty is possible. ""You might be in the Matrix"" does not count as a reasonable doubt.

* ""Studying it"": As a bare minimum, I want to say that you have to be able to accurately summarize the theory at a college undergraduate level, as well as the principal lines of evidence in its support, to dispute it. I am not saying everyone above that cutoff has the right to dispute the theory, but I am saying nobody below it should believe that the theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. (I am also not literally saying you must enroll in a college class.)

As a clear example of what I'm talking about, consider someone who watches a creationist video on Youtube and decides that the theory of evolution is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. This person is not being reasonable, provided that they know that they're disagreeing with the consensus. They shouldn't think the scientific community is wrong about evolution with that much certainty without really knowing what they are saying or why.

I am really interested to see how people dispute my thesis here! CMV."

They are more expensive because people buy them, not sexism.
I believe that the statistics show that these companies are sexist, but sexism is unprofitable.

Market forces cause this as there used to be a reason because gender norms were more highly enforced.

And to go on a bit of a tangent. racism is unprofitable as well, as the slaves required housing and other things that had to be paid directly by the owner.

To change my view, you must, prove that market forces aren’t the reason for higher costs for what are considered “feminine” products."

0,2023-03-06,CMV: Missing free throws can cost you wins.,u/Mach68IntheHouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11k9del/cmv_missing_free_throws_can_cost_you_wins/,changemyview,"Greetings everyone. As a fan of basketball I need to get this off my chest. I'm curious as to how folks will take this point of view. 

One of my favorite parts about basketball is the buzzer beater. Having watched a multitude of buzzer beaters, I noticed a pattern. Maybe it's just me, but I've seen most teams win on buzzer beaters after their opponent misses either one or both free throws. In some games, a team misses the second free throw on purpose to run down the clock. It may make sense in that you want to give your opponent less time to heave a 70 footer, but what if the 70 footer miraculously goes in before the buzzer? Then the team missing the free throw either has to play overtime or outright loses! Players should always make their free throws! 

I can give an instance back in 2010 when Chandler Parsons won the game for the Florida Gators against the NC State Wolf Pack. The Wolf Pack intentionally missed a free throw before CP25 drilled a 70-footer. I was thrilled that the Gators won, but the announcers puzzled me when they said that missing the second free throw was a wise move on the Wolf Pack's part. The game would have gone to overtime if the Wolf Pack made the second free throw. 

I welcome disagreements and counterarguments with open arms, eyes, and ears. If anything, I would appreciate if there's another reason to miss free throws."

They paint themselves as a country who only defend themselves, never the aggressors. But history says otherwise. They have a history of ""purges"" of those inside their country who disagree with the status quo, even among their own (back in the Soviet Union, so many purges and harassments of people who were forced to leave).

That leads us to only conclude they're terrible allies, and you best not disagree with them.

And then there's China. They clearly want revenge on the world due to them being basically enslaved and humiliated due to the opium distrubition and nation wide addiction inflicted by the British centuries ago.

It's quite clear they as a nation decided to rise up and conquer the world, grab it by the balls, make everyone DEPENDENT on them. Criticized them? You won't get your products. They've masterfully done it by creating cheap labor and industrial products and easy shipping, attracting the greediness of capitalism.

I dislike them, I get angry just to hear about them - they're always on the news because they're important, of course.

What pisses me off sometimes is that they have made themselves essential for humanity. If all Russians and all Chinese suddenly vanished, the rest of the world would crumble.

Plus, it borderlines xenophobia and other extremist thoughts, to which i've fantasized a lot, which is why I want to get my view changed."

34,2023-03-06,"CMV: Christianity as an ""organized religion"" is fundamentally flawed, cultish, fake, and full of liars",u/justa_Kite,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11kcd8x/cmv_christianity_as_an_organized_religion_is/,changemyview,"The idea of Christianity as ""organized religion"" sees it is, by definition, cultist. The word *cult* has a negative connotation, but by it's black-and-white definition, it falls into that category: *n. a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.* Anyone who associates with organized religion or ""the church"" falls under this category, regardless of which definition they decide to worship or which denomination they fall under.

I do believe in a ""god""--but the existence of such cannot be proven nor disproven. It is entirely unknowable, by my beliefs, and to ""prove"" God exists (Christianity's God, here, as that's the subject matter) would invalidate Christianity, as one of the basis for the entire religion is that God *cannot* be proven, and thusly requires blind faith to follow. The ""what if it was proven that God exists"" argument is one of the main reasons I left the church; the argument itself is self-destructive and paradoxical.

The Bible physically cannot prove the existence of God. All we know is that it's a collection of religious writings that has, shockingly, been able to evolve and adapt with the evolution of mankind. But mankind still wrote it. Take the Flood: we have scientific evidence that the Flood occurred. We have historical evidence and texts. But we also have *other* religions claiming the Flood happened, and it was also caused by their God. So it alone cannot prove the existence of God. Nor can the ""Pontius Pilate"" stone. Okay, so Pontius Pilate existed. That still does not prove the existence of God.

More people use the name of Christianity to justify horrible acts than those who use it to facilitate good acts. Two examples: all of the LGBT+ hate, and obfuscated racism (Jesus constantly depicted as white and refined when he was a Middle Eastern carpenter, as an example). On a more surface level, take anyone who drives a car with the symbol of their church on it. In my experience, those people are some of the worst drivers and road ragers I've ever seen. I'm a full-time delivery driver; I see a lot of them.

The Bible is more a wholistic guide on how to be good and treat others with kindness, in my opinion. Perhaps it was spoken to us from a higher being, or perhaps mankind wrote it themselves with a guide to ""be better"".

What kind of God threatens eternal agony and punishment for those who don't love him? That's not love, that's forced subservience. ""Love me, *or else.*"" And if ""hell"" is simply separation from God...well that doesn't seem to be too bad, now does it? Will I look up to ""heaven"" and feel jealous? Maybe. But if I get punished for trying to be a good person and constantly improve myself, and simply not believing in a deity, that's not a God I want to worship.

I'm an agnostic theist. Feel free to cite any sources, I'm curious to hear what you all think!"

I changed my view on many topics regarding personal freedoms,especially since as I said before,i grew up in a conservative house

the topics I mainly changed my view on are the following:decriminalisation of drugs,abort,trans rights,now i am an advocate for these rights after i did my reaserch

this brings me to the main topic,for the reasons above,i think a well constructed discussion could easily change my view,also i prepared a list of pros and cons i could find by myself:

P1)the government could tax prostitution more heavily than other businesses,therefore giving more money to the government and less to traffickers

C1) however this could also be a con since a taxation would incourage more people to turn to traffickers and the dangers that come with them

P2)the industry could be better regulated to reduce the risk of transmitting STDs and the violence that goes towards prostitutes

C2)i personally don't think a regulation will be enough since this will turn even more people to traffickers for obvious reasons like higher cost to start the business

P3) as much as it pains to admit this,these are still extra jobs for jobless people and a valid alternative to getting the bare minimum from the government every month

C3) only some people will be favorited in the business,wich means even people who work at these places won't have a stable income


C4)this isn't really legal,but more of a moral principle for me,as this will most definitely make the adultery rate rise,and in a country like italy, families falling apart is a hit to the population growth

P.S and Notice well,i am not a politics expert,so don't take what i said like absolute truth,i am probably wrong on some aspects"

Also, I'm analysing this from the perspective of the movie's universe own rules and events, not movie rules, so ""if he didn't do it there would be no movie"" won't change my view.

Maybe I'm missing something (it's been a while since I watched the movies), but it seems like at this point Wick is just messing up with a, uh, perfectly organised network of assassins and crime syndicates because of his personal vendetta. His actions have just become increasingly unjustified with each movie, compared with the first movie.

Yes, Santino was an asshole in the second movie, but not for requesting Wick's help, but for asking for the murder of his own sister. I don't remember if Santino immediately tells John of his intentions and it's because of that that he refuses, but the fact is, a marker is a marker. And that is further established when John himself makes use of a marker to force Sofia to help him, so we can't really hold Santino back for that (there's the fact that John could instead just killed Santino instead from the get-go, buuut this is not about plot consistency).

Also, if I remember it right, Wick wasn't banished for killing Gianna, and it was just Santino ""avenging his sister"" and not the High Table going after him. He was only truly banished and made a public enemy when breaking the rules of the Continental, something he could've perfectly avoided.

And then, the High Table is posed as the ""big bad guy"" in the third movie, but we haven't seen anything that really make them look bad. It's a world of criminals and assassins, after all, and they haven't show us anything that make them out to be any worse than all the rest. They are just the overseers of the system, which seems to be working just fine. The Bowery King mentions the ""corruption"" of the High Table iirc, but what corruption? He's just another guy with a lot of power that doesn't seem to like to submit to others, and for the entire third movie they are just following their own rules and Wick and his friends keep bending and breaking.

Granted, I do think that the array of overlapped systems create confusion and loopholes, like assassins having to honor a Marker that will break their own rules, but that just seems to be the way it goes -- John himself abuses of this system in the third movie, putting a lot of other people in danger, and then the High Table does what is expected of them -- punishing and going after the people who help John."

All too often, I'm in the men's restroom, and someone goes from the urinal (or, worse, a stall) and straight out the door. And this is in *University -* I mean, these are teens and young adults. I should hope that the people around me are at least mildly familiar with how illness spreads. 

And I want to shame them as they are leaving, ""Hey, you forgot to wash your hands,"" but am kind of afraid they might spit at me for saying that. 

I mean, maybe they are just selfish people who do not care about getting others sick so long as they believe they have a ""strong immune system."" They are completely shameless, doing it in a room with me and others besides. 

If you have some sort of skin condition (my hands literally bleed during the winter) why not use lotion? If your hands literally cannot come into contact with water (very rare), why not use some alternative? There are vulnerable people out there, and handwashing has been proven to protect them. And unlike wearing a mask, washing your hands doesn't impede your day-to-day life. 

So, people who do not wash your hands, why? Is it just laziness, or is there something else going on? As it is, there are far to many of you to make ""forgetting"" a reasonable excuse."

Instead, companies often invest heavily in marketing simply to keep up with their competitors. This creates a situation where the focus is on outshining others through advertising, rather than creating truly innovative products or services.

If companies were to decrease the number of engineers or programmers they employed, the impact on innovation and progress could be significant. However, if companies were to reduce their marketing budgets evenly, it would not have a negative impact on society. In fact, it could even be positive if the resources and talent previously dedicated to marketing were instead put towards more meaningful and beneficial work.

A little marketing can be justified but the sector is seriously bloated, currently.

Edit: I don't want to change my original post but I probably should have said advertising instead of marketing."

0,2023-03-07,CMV: It makes sense to judge people for promiscuity and to judge women for it more than men,u/PurplePeopleEater325,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11l46za/cmv_it_makes_sense_to_judge_people_for/,changemyview,"If I hear that someone has had an excessive number of sexual partners, yes I am going to judge them for it and think less of them for it and I will apply this more to women than men. I don't think this is bad or misogynistic.

Having sex is inherently risky behavior even when using ""safe"" sex methods. Every time someone has a new partner they are taking some risk of getting permanent, life-changing diseases. They are taking some risk of either getting pregnant themselves or getting someone else pregnant (for heterosexual encounters). And going home with strangers all the time carries some risk of being raped, assaulted, robbed, or murdered. The only reward for taking these risks is pleasure so in this way I view promiscuity similarly to other risky behaviors like gambling or impulsive shoplifiting. I will conclude that people who engage in it lack self-control and the ability to consider the consequences of their actions. While this does not make them inherently bad people, it means they are likely not people I want to be friends with or in a relationship with, and I don't see anything wrong with this. Judging others on some level is absolutely necessary even though it does have negative effects.

As for why I judge women more, it's because all the risks I mentioned affect them more. Many STDs have more severe symptoms in women, pregnancy is a much greater burden than getting someone else pregnant, and women are more vulnerable to being attacked by their partner. Therefore a woman who has had a certain number of sexual partners has taken even more risk than a man who has had that same number.

Two caveats to this: some people have a genuine addiction but I think this is a small proportion of promiscuous people so I assume it is not the case. And people having sex with others of the same sex are taking less of a risk, but they are still taking risk. In this case, promiscuous homosexual women are only slightly more risk-taking than promiscuous homosexual men.

I don't see this as misogynistic because it comes from real differences between men and women and not some kind of stereotype or bias I have. But since this is considered an old-fashioned view that is discouraged by many people nowadays, I want to know if there's something wrong with it so I am posting here.

Usually, in addition to fluently speak their language, live and work there, you need some sort of historical tie to that country. One of your ancestorn being from that country is the most common example. In most of these cases, you can also apply if you marry a citizen.

And this is just silly. People living, working there, filing their taxes there and yet they are not citizens. And not being a citizen comes with various disadvantages for no real reason. It gets so stupid in some countries that an immigrant family's childrend can't get citizenship, even if they were born in that country.

In conclusion, this is how it should work: If you lived in a country for a certain amount of time (different for each country depending on circumstances), pay taxes there, and speak their language, you can attempt the citizenship test.

My parents are from Mainland China and I have some relatives there. I’ve visited China several times and I enjoyed it a lot. It’s a great way for me to learn about my “home” culture, history, language, and people, and forging vital connections to my roots and identity.

I’ve never been to Taiwan, but I don’t see why I should go there instead of China. Taiwan simply doesn’t seem to have much to offer that China doesn’t have already - or even better things. Why go to the Taipei 101 when the Shanghai Tower or the Shenzhen Ping’an Financial Center are taller? What’s the appeal in Sun Moon Lake when Jiuzhaigou is much more scenic and colorful? And isn’t most of “Taiwanese cuisine” just ripped off of Fujian’s and Guangdong’s? China has more culture, more history, more development, more opportunities, and more relevance than Taiwan. Taiwan is just a minor offshoot of Chinese civilization that has been influenced by foreign powers like Japan and the US.

Now, I do admit, I’ve heard defensive apologetic arguments from certain Taiwanese, saying that “Come to Taiwan because Taiwan is where all the *real* Chinese culture survives and thrives, since we didn’t have Communism or a Cultural Revolution etc., and overall everything’s more free.” And I have to ask, don’t these arguments honestly sound more politically motivated than anything? Culture evolves over time and varies widely across different regions, and is not set in stone. In fact, right now, especially when talking about the younger generations, Mainlanders are more patriotic and conscious of their culture and history than their Taiwanese counterparts.

As for the censorship issue and so on, it’s honestly overblown, and as long as you don’t get too involved in the local politics or directly insult the government, tourists should be fine. And yes, the Internet is fairly highly restricted, and not everybody might want to use WeChat or Baidu, but even so… You're going there to experience the real China and its rich and diverse culture, not to surf the web all day. You can use local sources or talk to people directly. And for all the horror stories people tend to highlight about controversial acts the Mao and the Communists might have done in the PRC, it’s definitely worth mentioning that Chiang and ROC aren’t exactly squeaky-clean either. Yellow River Flood, 228 Incident, White Terror… Deng Xiaoping started opening up in the 1970s, while Taiwan remained under martial law all the way until 1987.

But I digress (and this shouldn’t be a political debate and I don’t want it to turn into one). To be clear, I don’t mean to sound like I’ve anything specifically against anyone from Taiwan or who likes Taiwan. It’s a nice place with nice people. It doesn’t “suck”, and I’m skeptical of the Mainlanders who say stuff like “Taiwanese people are nasty towards Mainlanders, especially southern Taiwanese”. But considering I’m an Overseas Chinese with plenty of heritage from one China and none from the other, I don’t see any compelling reason to visit the other China instead of, you know, China.

So, what do you think? If you live in Taiwan or have been there, what do you like about it?"

0,2023-03-07,CMV: ALL the Yakuza games have bad combat,u/BigBoiKry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11lar13/cmv_all_the_yakuza_games_have_bad_combat/,changemyview,"I've been exploring subreddits, videos, reviews of the Yakuza franchise and one thing I see people praise is the combat (except 3 because of enemies stunlocking the player). But I'm sorry, the world building, story, characters, environment, side stories are all great but I just can not get behind the idea that the combat is great

Reason 1: No Telegraph

Let's take Dark Souls for example now I know you are already gonna go ""their different games stop comparing!"". I think the Dark Souls (for the most part) perfected fair combat and I want to use it as an example so stop complaining and listen. Usually when you die in Dark Souls, it's your fault not the ai. That's what is so appealing about dark souls is because you actually learn to evade enemies, attack at the right time, use strategy to win. In Yakuza, bosses give like 3 frames MAX per attack basically guaranteeing damage and when you attack back they can dodge, block, counter with ease. To me, as someone who doesn't use Adderall, monster energy and rise pre workout to play a fighting game, can't see that bullshit and people will always respond with skill issue even to someone who has 700+ hours across the whole series because they refuse to think a game that hasn't changed it's combat system since the PS2 version is outdated

Reason 2: I don't care if you hit me with a chainsaw, I have I Frames while standing completely still

In dark souls, enemies get I Frames just like you and both you and the bosses have a fair amount of I Frames. Usually most bosses get I Frames during critical hits or dodges and since they have limited stamina, they can only dodge so much just like you. In Yakuza however, some of the main story bosses and any side story bosses will break that fairness in half over it's knee. The enemies can freely block all the damn time with forearms of steel but when you try and block it's broken in 3 light attacks and your dead. They will get I Frames from standing still and when you are out of punching reach the enemy magnet towards you and guarantee a hit. I'm sorry, but if you have guaranteed hits in your game, that's bad game design and artificial difficulty.

Reason 3: The only way to win is Cheese

Once you have given up and become mentally exhausted, you probably found a way to cheese the fight using heat actions (especially bad in Yakuza Kiwami 2). Now yes Dark Souls did have cheese, but most of the time the bosses you fight really have to push you over the line before you make that choice and sometimes getting the cheesy weapon is sometimes even harder than the boss itself. But in Yakuza, it's just XXY, Heat Action, Repeat but if the enemy has bullshit I Frames, just pull out a weapon and repeatedly use Heat Actions and Stamina Royal to win. That's not even taking to account fucking tiger drop. I'm sorry but if the combat is made to be cheesed, that's bad game design

I love Yakuza but holy shit is the combat exhausting and makes me want to quit the series. I'm trying really hard to find what's so great about it that people praise it but the only thing I see is the over the top heat actions you will see 500+ times over the series because SEGA reuse so many assets you'd be convinced their running a money laundering scheme.

If someone could please help me understand, I am willing to listen but holy shit is this bad"

But if the reason why you are protesting is popular with the majority of the population then there should be no need for a protest. As an example, French air traffic controller and railway worker tend to strike more compared to those of other European nations. They usually demand better salaries. 

If their demands were democratic (backed by the majority) there should be no need for them to protest, since politicians would agree to their demands without a strike. 

As another example, since many 16 year old want the right to vote, what would be more ""democratic"":

-That they wait until the majority of the electorate support a Congress that passes a Law that lowers the voting age? Or votes for a referendum that lowers the voting age?

- Or that the nations sixteen and seventeen year old protest in front of Congress until their demand is met?"

In the CMV section I am referring to words that were created from a place of hate. 

Ultimately language only has the power we give it. If I use a term with no malice behind it and the person I’m talking to takes no offense, is it pejorative/negative/offensive/hateful? Why can’t we all just not use words with malice and then consequently no longer take offense to words. We could end almost all political, racial, and gender based division in this country if we stopped using words pejoratively and if we stopped taking offense. We need to stop putting hate behind our words and also stopped taking offense every time someone uses a word we deem offensive regardless of intent this world would be a lot happier. 

To CMV:
Provide reasons that normal terms that are currently considered offensive should be offensive. Excluding race, gender, or sexuality based terms that were created out of hate like the N word and f*gg*t (typing that out made me feel sick, but I couldn’t just say the F word) because there are no ways to use them other than pejoratively.

Because this type doesn't represent the average woman and is for some an unattainable goal, it causes many women to feel bad about themselves.    
High fashions and haute couture shows should be relatable and make everybody feel better about themselves. If an online fast fashion store can show women of all sizes and shapes, why can't high fashion? Especially when women of different sizes and body types can see how the clothes would look on them!  

There should be different body types. There should be a variety of plus size models, dwarf models, handicapped models etc. The typical model look is so uniform and it's boring to have everybody look the same. It would be so much better if designers made clothes for different types of the individuals, not just the very typical Barbie look with the same proportions. 

Why can't curvy women walk the runway, what's wrong with a bit of fat rolls, big thighs etc? The designers should represent that better! Why can't short women walk the runway, there should be more pieces designed especially for those who have shorter limbs and a more compact body type! Not every woman is lean and statuesque."

My view is no it’s not wrong, I do it to some of my favorite historical figures. But I’ve heard people say this reflects badly on who I am.

Here’s some context. I recently got into an argument that often happens when praising historically great men. Being a fan of Hannibal Barca (the Carthaginian general), I retroactively admire his war against Rome. And in particular I said I was somewhat happy and felt it justified that Rome was eventually destroyed (pillaged) hundreds of years later as retribution for Hannibal’s loss. However, someone responded saying that it was wrong to praise the violence incurred on a city just b/c of my admiration for a once enemy of that city.

In another example, I once made a post about Julius Caesar, praising him as a great polymath (which he was) and significant person. But people, admittedly truthfully, pointed out his brutal violence against innocent people, his sexual deviance, etc… and that he is not worthy of praise. And so praising figures that one would obviously not want to emulate today is a wrong thing to do.

I can’t argue that these past figures didn’t do bad things, but I still admire and glorify these  individuals regardless. Does that mean I’m wrong and this reflects badly on my character (and anyone who does a similar thing)? I don’t think so, but I want to get to the bottom of this."

I'm generally annoyed if anyone makes these noises.
So, my apartment is basically quiet and even small noises are amplified. Given my roommates do not care whether they are making any noise while chewing or slurping.
How do I tell them to chew with their mouth closed or drink without making a slurping sound. I'm afraid if I tell them this they would be offended.

Also, in general how common is making chewing and slurping noises. Both of my roommates make the noises and they don't seem to mind each other as if it is very normal. This was something that was frowned upon in my house atleast"

De-carbonization is just the easiest attainable goal without having to make secessions to consumerist lifestyle. 
But the damage done has already set off effects we don’t see yet but are not avoidable anymore either while still being prisoners to the way we organize human life, the structural dependencies of food chains, (I.e. destroying nature to feed many), etc. 
Democracies do not seem viable in the long run because they rely on consumerism and the promise of wealth, the basis for both of which it undermines by externalization of real cost. 
I believe the scarcity that our children are likely to face will drive them to destroy the democracies by vote once it simply can’t deliver good enough organization of life anymore because the material means have run out to feed the voting majority. 
Not to mention the mental health burden of living in such a structurally sui*dal mess."

They are for all intents and purposes the same calendar, and to me at least, BC and AD don’t hold a religious connotation anymore. They’re just the years to me. From my point of view, it seems a bit pointless to change the name of the calendar, when it retains the same root. CE and AD are the same thing in all but name. The common era still comes from the biblical date for Jesus’ birth because it is based off of the Christian calendar. Is the reason people use common era dates not because of a religious reason? I understand that AD stands for Anno Domini, Latin for the year of our Lord. Is this seen as too on the nose for some people who are either atheists or believe in another religion? I don’t think the majority of people know about the Latin meaning of AD, and I can’t see a reason why CE is preferable to AD when they hold the same meaning in practical terms. Again as much as I understand that BC and AD used to hold a religious connotation, I don’t think that is relevant to the modern world. Perhaps that same reason compels others to adopt the common era naming system, but again to me it seems a pointless gesture. At least to me, it has lost its religious meaning. It’s just the date system that we use. To me it’s like how “committing suicide” has lost its old meaning as a crime against god, it’s just what people say when referring to the action of taking your own life. It’s lost all religious meaning in the modern day, and I think BC and AD are the same, and therefore I can’t see a reason to change the dates I use."

Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective knowledge.

So. How does this apply to filmmaking? Well. For starters they're increasingly not written by a person, but a committee. There are also notoriously a number of boxes to check. And each person is looking at a very specific aspect of the story that they think is the most important. While ignoring an overreaching central vision. Since films are consumed by one person, these disparate views create films which are flat and predictable.

Another contributing factor is that filmmaking has become more democratic. A Kubrick film looked like a Kubrick film. A Tarantino movie the same. Now a James Cameron film just looks like... What? To me its just pandering to the lowest common denominator and you can no longer see the hand of the director in the work. Now. There are exceptions of course. Todd Phillips Joker would be one of them. But, it's also worth noting this was a low budget film. Costing around 55 million to make. But grossing over a billion. Why? I'd say a large part is due to the fact that Phillips vision shaped the film into something of his own and audiences crave that. However taking a risk on a small budget film like this isn't a sure thing for investors, so they're more likely to just put their money on avengers and be assured they can get it back."

1. Oral participation was just as important as tests/exams. Meaning, 50% of your grade was determined by your participation in class, inlcuding answering teacher's questions, presenting your homework, volunteering for tasks...
2. We had quarter-yearly reports on our grades within a single school year, which we could use as a standard for payouts.

The most obvious benefit is that students will pay more attention in class to get their financial compensation. A lot of young children don't even get allowance from their parents, most teenagers all the way to high schools don't work any jobs.

Another, albeit less obvious benefit is that we're teaching students how to be financially responsible at a young age. This ties in to the second sentence of my previous point.

I can give an example model of how this could look like:

1. Students, when enrolled to middle school, are taught about the model, rewards, and the such, so that they're motivated right as they get in.
2. Both oral participation and tests flow in equal measures towards your grade.
3. At the end of a quarter, schools write a quarterly report and immediately hand out money associated with the grade. The conversion from grade to money is explicitly shown.
4. Example, C -&gt; $1, B -&gt; $5, A -&gt; $10, A+ -&gt; $20. These numbers can or should probably be adjusted from school to school, depending on local climate and how well it is receieved.

The grades aren't attached to a specific grade of a test or anything, it's the combination of both oral participation and written tests that build up to your final grade on your school year certificate.

There are some ideas here that I'm not entierly married to. We can probably adjust the rate at which payouts are given, and the exact amounts in $ can be quibbled over.

**Edit:** After reading some of your comments, it appears my perception is biased towards German school systems. 

For those of you saying that ""only the smart kids from advantaged backgrounds are going to get good grades"", we have different types of school forms that students are sorted in after elementary school.  This way, students of all ""groups"" are segregated in a way so that they can still get good grades.

The introductory paragraph of this Wikipedia article sums it up nicely.

First, I think the whole process is a hassle. Getting the ironing board out, waiting for the iron to warm up, and then having to make sure I don't iron any wrinkles *in*? 

And then the whole idea of a non-wrinkled shirt being a sign that someone is professional. If you won't hire a person who is otherwise qualified because they don't look ""professional"" in your opinion, that tells me you're more into vanity than the actual skills needed. And I'm not saying this as a ""pick up someone who looks like they absolutely don't care about how they look"", but a shirt looking slightly wrinkled isn't the end of the world (especially if under a jacket or sweater). I've had plenty of jobs where even if my shirt isn't ironed I'm still overdressed compared to some coworkers.

Maybe I sound crazy saying it, but I needed to say it and I'm willing to hear your thoughts on the matter.

However, many pro gun-control groups are pushing for another ""Assault Weapon"" ban, just like the one we used to have 20 years ago. In the 1994, there was a federal bill passed, and then sunsetted, that banned ""Assault Weapons,"" which included AR-15 style rifles, and most groups pushing for assault weapon bans seem to want to import the definition from this bill.

The bill in question banned the following rifles:

*Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and has two or more of the following:*

* *Folding or telescoping stock*
* *Pistol grip*
* *Bayonet mount*
* *Flash hider*
* *Grenade launcher*

The bill also banned some other forms of ""assault weapons,"" however this is the part of the bill that would apply to AR-15s. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is not with people saying that AR-15s should be banned, my problem is fact that this bill made no sense. 

On one hand, this definition allows to much. According to the bill, a gun can have a detachable magazine and a grenade launcher, but still not be considered an ""Assault Weapon."" I for one think that any gun with a grenade launcher is more dangerous than need be, regardless of if it has a pistol grip. 

On that note, this bill's definition also banned things that really have no bearing on how dangerous a gun is. For instance, why should a pistol grip matter? Or, why should a telescoping stock matter? I fail to see how adding a pistol grip to a gun makes it anymore dangerous. 

Basically, my problem with banning ""assault weapons"" is that it really doesn't change anything. Very dangerous guns are still able to slip through gaping loopholes and the guns that it does ban are not really any more dangerous than the ones that it does not. 

Also, conservative groups have pointed these facts out. While I tend to disagree with the NRA, they are very much correct when they say that a Semi-automatic gun with a pistol grip cannot do any more damages than one that has a traditional handle.  

For these reasons, I don't think that pro gun control groups should be pushing for another assault weapons ban. Or, at the very least, they should not be pushing for the same definition. Instead, they should focus on things that actually make guns more dangerous. For instance, a better definition would ban all guns with grenade launchers, but allow cosmetic changes, like pistol grips.

I spend a lot of time on the Internet in places where people hold views antithetical to what I typically see on Reddit. The resounding sentiment in these places is that people who don't have children past a certain point will end up frustrated, lonely, and unfulfilled. When I see this view being espoused it makes me a bit angry because I never really wanted kids, and I've been brought up to believe a person can find satisfaction in life through personal achievements.

I’ve checked elsewhere online to find accounts of people who regret having children. Parents said they missed career opportunities, lost all their free time, took on tons of stress. But I found a recurring theme in these stories – that the parents loved their kids more than anything and wouldn’t trade them for the world. That doesn’t really sound like regret to me.

One thing I don't think I can change my view on is that some people just aren't suited to have kids. But do those people deserve to be unfulfilled, then? For those of you who do believe having children is crucial, what is your solution to this?"

And that’s only if we haven’t already changed, given that a particular type of environment must have caused smartphones to emerge, which means we have likely already deviated  from humans that existed before smartphones, let alone humans that existed outside of civilization/specialization/domestication. 

Given that social norms, order, functionality, and mating rituals all revolve around intense and complex algorithms, modern human beings should no longer be considered the same as our ancestors.

* Reason for pay gap between genders: [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/#:\~:text=In%202021%2C%20full%2Dtime%2C,occupational%20segregation%20and%20work%20experience](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20full%2Dtime%2C,occupational%20segregation%20and%20work%20experience). Which is caused by factors such as education and the job itself. Men are more likely to go into higher paying jobs.
* Issues for women: [https://www.un.org/en/desa/world%E2%80%99s-women-2020](https://www.un.org/en/desa/world%E2%80%99s-women-2020)

So, what i'm trying to say here is not ""Bro, fuck feminist, we got issues"" but more of ""Hey, that's cool, but I've never seen a man cry in like ages. Are we actually tough or just ""oppresssed""??? I think it's amazing that we want both genders to be equal, because let's be real, we all have hearts, minds, cognitive functions, etc. We're the same but one has a banana and the other a hole. Not a big deal, really, so why ignore men issues and just focus on one gender?""

In summary, I may have skipped a few points, but what i'm trying to understand is, what inequality is there really? Wouldn't inequality on one side means that one gender is living life in a golden mansion and the other ones starve? We both have our struggles so why make this one sided and not just understand and help each others?

0,2023-03-08,CMV: the fact that the term “incel” has now evolved to mean specifically a small sub group of involuntary celibates who are resentful and hateful etc - should have everyone enraged.,u/newsround1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11mbxpa/cmv_the_fact_that_the_term_incel_has_now_evolved/,changemyview,"Let’s be very clear. Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Meaning you are celibate (don’t have sex) and that it’s involuntary (meaning you didn’t choose to have it that way. You want to have sexual connections but for whatever reason can’t) 

So just today, chatting on a different post, I learned that incel now officially refers to a group of criminal hateful misogynists. Apparently so much so that many of them become school shooters and serial killers. 

So now I can’t use the term incel not knowing if I’m referring to some innocent dude who’s struggling to find sexual connection, or if I’m referring to a mass murderer who thinks they are owed sex or whatever. 

When did this transition happen? And why isn’t everyone up in arms about it? 

Isn’t it like saying black people are all violent gang members? Or Arabs are all terrorist. “Oh yeah Arab used to mean someone from the Arabian peninsula but yeah it’s evolved now. Now Arab means terrorist. It’s the same thing” 

This seems like a really dangerous path to go down. 

On a side note, I’ve never actually met an incel (evolved definition) in real life. But I do know dozens of incels (original definition) and they’re all pretty cool people. 

(PS I’m not an incel. I’m young and single and do very well in the dating scene. Even if you don’t believe me please just assume that it’s true because I don’t want this to turn into personal attacks against me rather than debating my point of view)."

0,2023-03-08,CMV:National Patriotism is illogical. No one should be proud of their country.,u/EthelCummings00,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11mdj1f/cmvnational_patriotism_is_illogical_no_one_should/,changemyview,"Patriotism is completely illogical. I will mostly be talking about patriotism in regard to the United States because I am from here, but I think there is no sense of being patriotic regardless of where you are from.

First, no one chooses where they are born. Why would you be proud of this genetic lottery? You wouldn't be proud of being born in a certain hospital building right? ""Fuck yeah, I was born at John Hopkins!"". You’d be laughed at if you said that because it’s illogical and strange.

Second, most first-world countries have a history of conflict and war crimes. In America, there existed centuries of slavery, genocide against Native Americans, segregation, lynchings, etc. Obviously, no one who is alive today participated in those things. But these were policies perpetuated by our government and under our constitution (the very same constitution we are currently operating under). No one should feel shame for those act since no one alive today carried out those acts (except for segregation as people from that era are still alive). But we wouldn't feel pride either right?

Oftentimes you will hear conservatives say that we shouldn’t feel shame about slavery because it was in the past. So if we shouldn’t feel shame about our past mistakes, we shouldn’t feel pride for our past accomplishment either right? And even if you did contribute to those things indirectly (taxation funding NASA), it's not like you CHOSE for your money to go to the funding of space exploration. Your money went there because our (largely-undemocratic) government said it should go there.

What about the good things ""we've"" done. Moon landing, spreading democracy (very arguable), stopped fascism in Europe. No one alive did any of those things (unless you are a WWII veteran). ""We"" didn't land on the moon. Engineers and astronauts worked for that to happen. They are entitled to feel pride because they accomplished that. Why should the rest of the country feel proud? I was born 30 years after that happened. Why should I feel proud about that? I didn't contribute to any of those things.

Being proud of personal accomplishments is perfectly logical, but being proud of something simply because someone in your country did that? It makes no sense.

 Let's say I lived in an apartment complex called ""Oak Forest Apartments"". Then I hit up my city hall records office and found out that 20 years ago, a gold medal olympian lived in my exact apartment. Would it make sense for me to say “Oak Forest fuck yeah! Oak Forest pride! Oak Forest pride! All Oak Forest Apartment residents are Olympians”. I would be ridiculed if I did that. How is national patriotism different? These are arbritrary geographic lines.

Don't get me wrong, I understand why people are patriotic. We are prone to all kinds of illogical behavior. I just don't think it makes sense when you really sit down and think about what patriotism is based in."

I just don’t see any flaws in Singer’s argument to be honest and it basically means we’re all terrible people.
For those not familiar I’ll give my paraphrased version of the argument

1. If we can prevent something very bad from happening without sacrificing anything of moral significance we are obliged to do it. His example is, you see a child drowning and you can save him but it will ruin your clothes. The cost of your clothing would not be of moral significance so you are morally (not legally) obligated to jump in and save the child. We would probably view someone who didn’t as a bad person.

2. Famine, preventable illness, death etc. are very bad things

3. Organizations like unicef, against malaria foundation etc prevent the suffering described in premise 2

4. The luxury goods we buy on a daily basis are not of moral significance. I don’t need a cup of coffee in the morning, or a new shirt, or a new car if mine still works, or tickets to a sporting event etc. insert your favorite luxury item here

Therefore we must donate the money we spend on luxury items to relief agencies 


The only premise that I feel like might be subject to criticism is premise 1. But maybe I’m wrong."

For nearly everyone the main expense they have is housing, for most people it consumes between 20 and 50% of their income. This really cannot be changed, especially in major cities where there is a very real lower limit to how much rooms, apartments, and houses cost, even in ""undesirable"" areas.

[Americans are increasingly burdened by rent](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-burden) and with skyrocketing housing costs for many it's the only way they can get housing.

But marriage, or a significant other you live with, is a big help to this on an individual level. Each partner cuts their rent expenses in half once they move in with each other, many stop needing roommates entirely because 2 people can live in a studio or one bedroom apartment. There are people who are able to live with multiple people in one bedroom apartments using bed sheets as walls, however, this is illegal in many jurisdictions due to zoning restrictions. 


With (roughly) twice the income, and twice the necessities, married couples often can better utilize buying in bulk, without worrying about food going bad prematurely, or that 18 pack of paper towels being enough to overdraw your bank account. This brings the cost per unit of necessities like groceries down as well. Buying in bulk has such a drastic effect on people's finances that it's been cited as a factor that [keeps poor families poor](https://www.wpr.org/study-low-income-households-miss-out-savings-because-they-cant-afford-buy-bulk)


I cannot think of anything that gets *more* expensive per person when one gets married, due to the simple fact that combining resources is so effective at reducing costs."

That makes sense.

If you cause an accident and someone else dies, but you were sober while behind the wheel, as long as you didn't do something egregiously negligent, I get it. It happens. It's unfortunate, but it happens.

HOWEVER, I am certain that 99% of people who drive drunk drank voluntarily and voluntarily got behind the wheel knowing they were drunk. Factoring that into consideration, if you cause a fatal accident when you voluntarily drank and voluntarily got behind the wheel of a two-ton machine while you knew you were drunk, you are the literal scum of the earth and a selfish irresponsible human being.

Because you put yourself in an inebriated state ON YOUR OWN VOLITION and while in said inebriated state got behind the wheel ON YOUR OWN VOLITION and caused a fatal accident, your charge should still be vehicular manslaughter, but your prison sentence should be the same as if you committed 1st or 2nd degree murder."

I’ve heard people say things like “dogs don’t really love you, they just love that you give them food.” And I guess I just don’t really understand because we could do the same with humans if we applied that logic consistently. 

“Oh, you don’t really love your family. You’re just conditioned to show them affection because they raised you and gave you food. You’re biologically wired to stick close to them because often times that would have given you a bigger chance for survival in the wild.”

Why are people so determined to separate themselves from animals? Sure humans are different from a lot of other species in the world, but every species is unique. If the affection shown by animals isn’t indicative of love, then how can we say that the affection we feel and show is? 

I guess I should clarify I am not speaking about all animals here, but mostly about mammals who have an amygdala. 

If we’re willing to call our own biological feelings “love” then I don’t get why we can’t call that of animals the same.

Edit: I’ve gotten some great responses here, thank you all. :) It’s true that I don’t think that all animals express their emotions in the same way that humans do. I guess I should clarify the reason that I think about this sort of thing is because I am concerned about animal cruelty and I have heard people justify hurting animals with the excuse that they don’t feel things like we do.

Edit 2: I think I understand where the idea that animals experience emotions differently than us is coming from. Now I’m more curious about finding out exactly how animals experience the world. Thanks you all!"

I'm a huge believer in self-determination on scales as small as the individual and as large as nations. I generally think that groups of people should be allowed to determine who they are and how they want to show themselves to the world. Of course, we can never control other people's perception, but we can self identify and try to shape that perception. 

In recent years I've seen a lot of people (mostly on the internet) arguing that referring to the US as ""America"" is a misnomer because ""America"" refers to a continent (or two continents, depending on your worldview). I think this argument often comes from people living in Latin America, but there could be others, I'm not certain. I've seen some people argue this from a linguistics standpoint, like calling the US ""America"" is a grammatical error, and I've seen others make an anti-imperialist case, arguing that Americans (or United Statesians, maybe) are trying to assert themselves as the masters of the Western Hemisphere.

I think policing language is often (though certainly not always) unproductive. It seems to me like this is a case of outsiders (people not from the US) trying to police how people inside the US describe themselves. I think that Americans should be allowed to call themselves whatever they feel. Beyond this, I think the linguistic argument just doesn't work. Most North American english speakers don't think of ""America"" as being a word for a single continent, they think of ""North America"" and ""South America"" (or maybe ""The Americas"").

**EDIT:**

The original post above is unchanged for transparency's sake, but I want to make a few follow up points:

* I use the word ""right"" pretty melodramatically here. I'm a melodramatic person. I don't think this is a life and death issue. I'm not advocating for this to be enshrined in law or whatever, and I thought the body of the post was decently clear on that.

* A lot of people are pointing out that ""US"" instead of ""America"" reduces confusion when speaking with non-Americans/non-English speakers, and I 100% agree. But the core of my question assumes no ambiguity; it's about the fundamental nature of the name of the country and its people."

0,2023-03-09,CMV: I don’t think most suggestions on gun control address the underlying issue &amp; therefore I am against most suggestions that are offered.,u/-UnclePhil-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11n0ecv/cmv_i_dont_think_most_suggestions_on_gun_control/,changemyview,"Over 40,000 dead. Over half a 1,000 mass shootings.

Something needs to be done and usually what I hear does not seek to rectify the underlying problem. Instead it would just make gun ownership more difficult for the vast majority of civil people who have a right to own one.

I think most suggestions on gun control stem from two types of people.

1) Those who are just ignorant about the situation and agree on what sounds good.

2) Those who ultimately want to eliminate private gun ownership regardless of a constitutional right and know they need to take baby steps to slowly get rid of it. 



Here are some things that people usually get wrong when it comes to guns and why I don’t think suggested legislation doesn’t address the underlying problem.


1. Suicide: A majority of gun deaths come from suicide. Trying to make it harder for people to get a tool to kill them selves does not address the underlying problem. People are still getting to that place where they wish for death instead of life. THAT is the problem. So even if you still have people living, what quality of life are they going through? I would like to point out that Japan has next to eliminated private gun ownership and they have a very high suicide rate. A firearm is not needed… again, that doesn’t address the problem.

2. Mass shootings: Most people think mass shootings are a white male in a place with a lot of foot traffic. That’s incorrect. Most mass shootings are actually black on black violence. I’m sure people would never believe that due to the way the media really focuses on a certain type of mass shooting. Most mass shooting stem from a generational cycle of poverty &amp; poor education. Lots of the time in those situations, these people are repeat offenders and or the firearm was procured by illegal means. Varies from place to place but upwards of 80% in some areas. 

3. “Assault Weapons”: People who know the truth try to ban “assault weapons” first so they can eventually an handguns. People who don’t know think “assault weapons” are more dangerous and used in most mass shootings or shooting period. That’s absolutely not true. “Assault weapons” or AR15 variant rifles, AK variant rifles of rifles period are one of the LEAST used firearms in crime period. They are not the most used in suicides, murders or mass shootings. The percentage is tiny and I’ll leave it at that. Handguns are the most used for suicides, mass shootings and murder all together. So for those who know, they want to ban rifles first and then handguns because they know the numbers won’t change. 

4. Loose gun control laws in other states: Some people think if the whole country followed NJ, NY or CA when it comes to gun control, the country would be better. First, those states have far too restrictive gun control measures. Second, those measures actually show it’s the people who are the issue, not the guns. Takes Texas for example. Texas usually has 2 or 3 of the safest cities in the country. Texas has “loose” gun control. But then certain parts of Houston are horrible. Look at California, some of the safest and richest towns there… then there is Compton. They all live under the rules of their individual states but the outcome is different in certain areas, why is that? I assure you if you look up median income, percent of people who have a college education, two parent homes and high school graduation rates of the different areas… they would be quite different. Points to what is the underlying cause… poverty and education. 




So in short, I believe poverty, mental health &amp; abysmal education are the underlying issues for a majority of death when involving a firearm. I don’t see how most legislation looks to address those problems. Most of the time it’s trying to treat the cough and not the lung cancer. 

So can someone give me a federal law or proposed bill that would actually address the root cause of most gun violence and simply not make it more difficult for most good people to purchase a gun?"

My main reasons for believing this is:

- We could separate our economic, social and political (For political I mean things like foreign politics) beliefs, so that someone who is, for example, socially conservative and more left leaning economically doesn't have to decide whether he values more his social or economical beliefs.

- As I said, we wouldn't have to trade our social or economic beliefs for their counterpart: this way, we don't risk being stuck with economic or social politics we don't like just because in that moment we value more the other one (I see this all the time: some people dislike most right-leaning social beliefs, but much prefer their economics).

- In my idea, there could not be any crossover between economic and social parties: this would make parties less divided and much more focused on their objectives, without the need to balance social politics and economics. Parties would also need to cater to a smaller audience, so that their beliefs would be a little less nuanced and less diluted.

Obviously, I recognize how some issues may arise from this:

- Some economic and political doctrines are somewhat incompatible with each other, making it harder for the two parts of the government to cooperate

- There isn't a hard divide between economics and social politics: they are extremely connected, to that also makes it harder for the two parts to cooperate. Defining what is the field of the economic government and what is the field of the social government could also be difficult.

However, I'd expect that it would be hard for completely opposite social and economic doctrines to find themselves in the government, as social beliefs are connected with economic beliefs and vice versa, so that I wouldn't expect, for example, to find democratic socialists and hardline conservatives together in the government. 

I'd also put an executive political figure that would try to unite the two parts and help them cooperate and harmonize their different beliefs (It could be an elected president or, as I would prefer, a monarch, or anything else.)

Why CMV: As much as I am interested in politics, I am no expert, so there is likely something serious I'm missing that would make this system crumble completely."

Correctional Abolitionism is a rapid-growing ideology in today's society. Past social media and advocacy, the concept of abolitionism has entered law school forums and the legal curriculum itself. See from [Harvard](https://harvardcrcl.org/a-safe-and-flourishing-future-one-law-students-case-for-abolition/); [Columbia](https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/abolition-practicum); and [UCLA](https://law.ucla.edu/events/abolition-legal-field-discussion-about-abolitionism-classroom-and-beyond). (Note: These examples vary in approach; my argument will not be focused on these contents' paradigm.) As a personal anecdote, having attend various legal panels and seminars hosted on law school campuses, abolitionism seems to be more ""trending"" now more than ever.

This is not to say there are not issues with the current criminal law system and certain laws. For example, Three Strikes law still exists in California. There are many good arguments against it. But that point also envelops the solution: the law is constantly changing, and its amenable nature makes it imperative to work within its system to progress change rather than deconstruct it entirely.

I have had plenty of debate with abolitionists, from formal to informal settings, who have focused on various issues, i.e. racial disparities or the private prison complex, to justify total abolitionism. While these concerns have merit for discussion, these do not warrant the ""total abolitionist"" ideology. Instead, I see these abolitionists as highly opinionated and critical of the correctional system, but I do not believe any ""total abolitionist"" believes what they are claiming.

The ""total abolitionist"" perspective I am arguing against: ""**Abolition rejects the expansion of** [**all aspects of the prison industrial complex**](http://correctionsproject.com/wordpress/portfolio/prison-maps/#jp-carousel-644)**.** **This means eliminating prisons and police as well as removing “policing” from society.** ""

I do not believe any abolitionist truly believes in eliminating prisons, outside of it being a talking point. I am open to having my mind changed as I truly want to be convince of at least one reasonable argument. But I have yet to discover an argument consistent with viable solutions and incorporate enough nuance that merits any legitimate considerations. For my mind to be changed, I'd love all three premises to be reasonably challenged (in the context of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.)

**Context**

I am aware of people having tough times and making difficult life decisions / mistakes, and the importance for rehabilitation. Thanks to the correctional system, they gain vocational skills, college educations, and much needed self-help trainings and programming (i.e. CALPIA) to re-enter society. Another underrated aspect is developing suitable parole plans: Once they get out, where will they stay? Do they have a support network? Will they have work to sustain themselves? Will they be in the best position possible to not revert to criminal behavior? These are all services that my State provides to the inmate. These are measures so a former criminal who committed lewd and lascivious acts against a child do not get tempted when they see a child on the street. Someone who murdered someone for rejecting him develops the self-control needed to not do it again.

**Premises**

I believe abolitionists, specifically in California, who are against the correctional system are very uneducated on the subject; in fact, I truly believe **they don't believe** what they are arguing. The main premises for my position:

***1) Regarding total abolitionists - those who believe in fully abolishing the prison system - do not have viable nor practicable solutions for malicious crimes.***

The premise explains itself. Someone murders twelve kids. How does an abolitionist suppose we deal with them?

***2) The argument that criminal punishment should only focus on rehabilitation rather than be punitive unjustifiably undercut theories of retribution.***

Why should your ""perfect world"" views take precedent over hurting victims and their families who want to feel relief and justice? If it was my wife badly beaten and assaulted, I would want them to receive punishment. You would the same if someone kidnapped, assaulted, and murdered your nephews and nieces. Why do your outside feelings take precedent over those directly impacted?

***3) Our current system, and improving this system, is the best way to rehabilitate inmates.***

It's hard to see **how or why** an abolitionist would disagree with CDCR's approach. Rehabilitating and reducing recidivism is exactly what states have been doing through proper programming. A total abolitionist view seems more argumentative than substantive.

I'd include that in my State we are accommodating inmates more than than necessary -- in fact, we even allowed inmates to create their own podcasts distributed throughout prison radios. The State provides inmates commissary catalogues, allowing them to buy Nike shoes, watches, etc.

**Conclusion**

I think I made my points clear! Tl;dr total abolitionism / eliminating the prison system as a whole is more argumentative than substantive. It 1) does not provide practicable nor viable solutions for malicious crimes 2) rehabilitation &gt; punishment does not fit the script for every crime and is unfair to victim families and 3) our current system and improving it is the best balance between punishment and rehabilitation and the best way to rehabilitate inmates already. Withstanding these three premises, it is impossible for someone to truly believe in total abolitionism.

Edit #1

Thank you for the thoughtful responses. I have a motion to prep so I will respond later.

Edit #2

It seems my post is not clear. Here is a revised title to help clarify my position: “People who believe in total abolitionism have no viable nor reasonable solution”. Please present a viable or reasonable solution to replace the California corrections system. Thank you."

A government has the responsibility of enforcing any restrictions on freedom of speech on its own citizens. I don't have a problem with them enforcing their rules on people but don't make a social media company do your police work .

To me this seems like common sense. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me as well as a lot of governments. I would like to better understand another perspective. To be clear I'm not stating that I think people should be able to say anything they want to I am also not sharing my perspective on freedom of speech.

Just because we do something good and it makes us feel good doesn't mean it was selfish.

a. That isn't necessarily WHY we did it

b. It's not PLEASURE when we feel good in this case, it's aesthetic from the moral situation. Therefore, the DIRECT reason, at least, is that that is the moral state of the situation. Why you want that moral state? Fair, it could be selfish, but still, my point stands.

Now, a common argument:

Evolution: First of all, evolution can't think. It can't be selfish. Second of all, it is an ECOLOGICAL process that determines WHICH ORGANISMS DOMINATE, not why the individual organisms are like that.

1. Gender Identity is a form of freedom of expression, does not need to be logical.
Gender Identity from Oxford dictionary:
""a person's innate sense of their gender""
Additionally, It is often aligned with one biological sex, but it might not be the case and can be ""trans"" during one lifespan.

Since it is based on one feeling, it is purely subjective and does not need to be logical.

2. Gender Identity should be a protected form of expression everywhere.
To have and be proud of oneself gender identity WILL NOT BE harmful to others.
Therefore, gender identity should be protected everywhere.
By everywhere, I really mean everywhere, not just specific countries.

My Limit,
to change view #1:

let me hear the reason on why gender identity needs to be logical, not your own personal reason, more like government reason, or study reason with cause and effect.

the reason should be strong enough so the definition from the dictionary needs to be changed/enhanced.

to change view #2:
preferably With a cost-benefit analysis of protecting gender identity.

104,2023-03-10,CMV: Financial incentives will not solve decreasing birth rates,u/HuangHuaYu49,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11nggty/cmv_financial_incentives_will_not_solve/,changemyview,"A common reason I hear for decreasing birth rates is that people can no longer afford it due to increased cost of living. I disagree, I believe the main reason birth rates are decreasing is because people are simply not interested in having children.

Many countries have tried providing financial incentives to increase birth rates, (China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc). All of their birth rates are projected to continue decreasing. Even countries with the most generous child care subsidies, like the Denmark and Luxembourg, have below replacement fertility rates. 

If even the Nordic countries, which subsidize child care, high quality public education, college expenses, and healthcare (reducing the financial burden of raising a child) cannot bring their fertility rates above replacement level, it suggests that financial incentives are not enough to meaningfully increase birth rates.

I believe the biggest reason for the decrease in birth rates is because more and more people don't see children as necessary to having a meaningful life. It's no coincidence birth rates decrease as a country develops; more people (especially women) are able to be educated and find careers/afford pastimes that provide them a sense of fulfillment. This would explain why people with higher incomes/education have less children: there are more options to life.

Societal values have shifted. Back when women were discouraged from pursuing higher education and professional careers, a lot of them followed societal expectations of ""women are supposed to be mothers."" Now that the societal pressure has decreased, it's only natural that less women choose to follow the traditional lifestyle that was once pushed onto them. We see women are having children at later age, and having less children overall.

Children are a lot of work. Even if you paid me to be a parent, I wouldn't be interested, because it is a huge time commitment, it can be emotionally taxing, and can sometimes require sacrifices in our personal goals.

There was an interesting observation made on Chinese social media. The post stated that for a long time, men never understood how difficult parenting can be, since they dumped all the heavy lifting of childrearing onto their wives. Now that women have more opportunities in life, the father has a greater role in childrearing, and many Chinese fathers are realizing it was much harder than they initially thought.

After you finish your 9-5 job for the day, the second shift begins. Tantrums in the early years, worrying about your child's academic performance, making sure your child has good values and stays out of trouble, requires a lot of quality time. Considering all the implications parenting has on your career, the decrease in free time for yourself, the emotional toll of seeing your child go through hard times, I'm not surprised more people are choosing to embrace other lifestyles like DINK, being a Disney adult, or raising a pet.

Unless societal values experience a DRASTIC change, or we enter some utopian post-scarcity society where people have too much free time on their hands, I believe fertility rates will remain below replacement level."

Please let me know why it shouldn't be.

1. I assume that collectively, humanity as a species wishes to survive.
2. Humanity can be likened to a parasite and our host is Earth\*
3. It presently appears that our parasitic nature may cause ecological collapse that would in turn destroy ourselves.
4. The only way we might survive this is to either: (a) build successful colonies off-planet; or (b) find ways to live sustainably on Earth, i.e. live in symbiosis with our host.
5. Even if we achieve 4(a), failing to achieve 4(b) will mean that we will need to continuously jump planets.
6. Thus, preferably we achieve 4(b) so that 4(a) is optional... barring non-human threats like the Sun burning out.
7. Assuming 1-6 is true, we all really need to wake up to do whatever we can within our individual power to make 4(b) possible.
8. Ideally 4(b) can be done with kindness and inclusion. Eg. EV cars made from forced labour cobalt mines are not ideal.

Notes:

* This is about humanity's #1 long term goal, not Country X, or John Doe individually. I'm sure the top goal of a starving person is to eat, not question whether the food is from sustainable sources.
* This is a bloody idealistic post. I have no answers on how we may achieve it, and  I acknowledge that tradeoffs may need to happen against other goals of humanity. But I stand firm that this should be our **#1 long term goal.**
* I include the words 'long term' as I recognize short term crises may arise (eg. covid) that steal attention from the long term. I feel though that short term crises never end. Like whack-a-mole, one will always pop-up after the other, so we really need to be managing short term crises **while simultaneously** progressing towards our #1 long term goal.
* I have assumed that humanity deserves to exist and even expand, the validity of this could be discussed in a separate topic in itself.
* I have made assumptions that things more or less stay the same until we achieve that goal. However, who knows, something more pressing to human survival may crop up in between, like a giant asteroid, or Skynet.
* \*Sorry for the negative connotation of the word 'parasite'. I mean it in a most neutral way. I don't think it's morally wrong. I don't think parasites are ""Evil""."

0,2023-03-10,CMV: Minorities should NOT be allowed to have institutions that only use their own language,u/Tourqon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11nlugy/cmv_minorities_should_not_be_allowed_to_have/,changemyview,"Pretext: I am a Romanian citizen of Romanian-Hungarian descent and I live in Romania.

I think it is detrimental to both minorities and the majority to allow minorities to have institutions that are exclusively or primarily using their native language.

They should, however, be allowed to use it as a secondary language and to use it in any other private or public context.

For a real life example, I will use public schools. Currently in Romania we have schools that explicitly teach only in Hungarian and we also have Hungarian sections in normal schools that only teach in Hungarian. I think they should be taught in Romanian, but they could have extra classes for Hungarian language, literature, history, etc. 

Reasons:
1. Minority children that go to such schools often are completely or mostly illiterate in the majority language. Anecdotally, I can say that I know plenty of Hungarian kids(including relatives) that reach the age 18 without the ability to communicate in Romanian. This might mean that they fail their finals(which are at a national level, thus in Romanian) and that their opportunities are severely limited(in terms of education and employment)

2. It contributes to cultural segregation and xenophobia. Again, this is anecdotal, but being part Hungarian myself and coming from a town with a high number of Hungarians, I've noticed Hungarians that are educated outside the Romanian system tend to be a lot more xenophobic and they also tend to be supporting separatist movements(they'd like the Ardeal region of Romania to join Hungary)

Conclusion:
Minorities should be forced to primarily use the majority language in public institutions in order to ensure they are integrated into society.

Notes:
1. I think they should be able and even encouraged to maintain their culture and language through other means. I don't have children yet, but when I do, I'd like for them to retain our Hungarian culture as well

2. I've written this because I've heard plenty of Romanians complain and say that we shouldn't be helping Ukraine because they started forcing Romanians within Ukraine to have schools in Ukrainian, which they consider to be cultural genocide(I obviously disagree)

Updates:
1. I have decided that trying a softer approach by forcing Hungarian schools to at least teach their language and literature classes in Romanian primarily, rather than the whole curriculum, could be a better solution."

0,2023-03-10,CMV: Gary Lineker should publicly apologise or lose his role at the BBC,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11nyz6c/cmv_gary_lineker_should_publicly_apologise_or/,changemyview,"To give some background:
- For those who don’t know, the BBC is the appointed national broadcaster, which role is to give British people impartial access to news.
- Gary Lineker is an ex-England footballer and is currently a BBC Sport presenter
- Gary Lineker has come out on Twitter actively criticising the government’s new Immigration policies on illegal immigrants (being denied asylum by default and permanently banned if they come to the UK illegally).
- He went a bit far and compared the current policies to that of pre-war Nazi Germany

Now, I’m not saying I’m in support of the UK policies but I think it’s largely irrelevant. Taking a position with the BBC, employees are bound by that same impartiality. It’s a choice to work with the BBC, there are many other places Gary Lineker can choose to work and have public opinions…. but the impartiality of the BBC is brought (further) into question if it condones it’s employees actively opposing the government.

I don’t think this is too far different from any employee causing instability for the company they’re working for. For example, let’s say I was known for working at company X advocating for legalising marijuana… that may reflect negatively upon the company and they would have a right to take reasonable actions. Like it or not, you’ve voluntarily entered a relationship with a company and are responsible for upholding their reputation or risking consequences. 

The main arguments I can see for a Gary Lineker are:
- Freedom of Speech. I would argue he still has freedom of speech but, being paid as a celebrity, he doesn’t enjoy the same privacy and people know the organisations he represents. The BBC still have reasonable ground to take action against him and he’s still representing the BBC in some way, even if it’s just their hiring policy. 
- “The greater good”. He may be on the right side of a political debate and want to do good… but that’s what this is: A POLITICAL DEBATE which he’s precluded from engaging in as a BBC presenter. It also doesn’t mean he has complete immunity to the repercussions. That’s why people who take this stance are enshrined in history as they faced the consequences. 
- The BBC aren’t always impartial and have slipped up on a number of occasions. Although this is true, I don’t think there’s a lot of strength to say “well it’s not perfect. We may as well continue and sweep new instances under the rug”. If anything, I would argue this justifies an even stronger response to squash future claims.

I wanted to hear others thoughts; maybe there’s another way around the issue or I’ve not considered an angle! So, CMV!"

Usually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women (e.g. college enrollment rates, suicide, homelessness, loneliness) and say that efforts should be made to address them, the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups. I'd argue that feminist groups shouldn't be left to solve them.

It seems to me that **most** feminist groups only care about men's issues if they affect women. Recently I saw [this article linked](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/) and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely. The article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated. That these men are miserable is an afterthought.

Similarly, boys who start to be exposed to Andrew Tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women. Incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that they're lonely and miserable is ignored. Usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students, it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that they're more likely to struggle with student debt.

It seems that if men would only be miserable, lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women, these groups would be perfectly happy so I don't trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected.

**EDIT: For all the people saying ""this is like asking the NAACP to care about anti-semitism"", I'd argue feminism portrays itself as fighting sexism and gender inequality, not a group for one demographic like the NAACP.**"

4,2023-03-11,CMV: STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice.,u/pipocaQuemada,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11ookx0/cmv_star_voting_is_superior_to_instant_runoff/,changemyview,"STAR voting is a voting system where you give as many candidates as you want a 0-5 rating.  Then,  there's a stimulated runoff between the two candidates with the highest average ratings.  The candidate who is higher ranked on more ballots is the winner.

For example, if you give Alice a rating of 5 and Bob a rating of 4, you count as a vote for Alice in a runoff between Alice and Bob.   If you gave them both a 5, you'd count as an obstention.

This is a useful deterrent to certain kinds of strategic voting.  For example, suppose you're voting in a presidential election, and you're trying to maximize the chance of Bernie Sanders winning.  Naively, the way to do that is to give Bernie Sanders a 5 and everyone else a 0.  However,  the problem with that is if the runoff is actually between Elizabeth Warren and Trump, you've abstained even though you presumably prefer Warren to Trump.  Likewise if the runoff is between Warren and Biden,  Biden and Kasich or Kasich and Trump.  If you want your vote to count in the runoff, voting honestly is a far superior strategy than bullet voting. 

Instant runoff voting is a voting system where voters list their first, second, third, etc choices.  Then, if there's not a candidate with an absolute majority of the remaining votes, you eliminate the candidate with the lowest vote total and reallocate the votes to their next *remaining* preference.

In IRV, your second place selection gets no support from you until your first place is eliminated, assuming your second place wasn't eliminated first.  This means that compromise candidates with a lot of second place support could easily be eliminated early, and that election order is very important.

Instant runoff has some really weird edge cases because elimination order is very important to the results.  For example, in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, the Progressive candidate won.   However, Republicans could have caused the Progressive candidate to lose by having the right number of Republicans put the Progressive as their top choice, or by staying home.

IRV makes it so that voting for additional candidates can't hurt your favorite, but at the cost of making it riskier to support your favorite. 

[Ka Ping Yee has an interesting voting system visualizion, coloring in a 2d political compass by the color of the candidate who would win if the center of public opinion is within that area.](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/)  Most systems produce sensible diagrams, but IRV produces the oddest looking diagrams, with shapes that make no sense.  STAR isn't on there, but it shouldn't look too much different from approval. 

[An important way to look at voting systems is 'Voter Satisfaction Efficiency'](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic), a measure of how happy people are with the results.  IRV is slightly better than plurality, but significantly worse than approval voting, STAR or 3-2-1.

There's no such thing as a perfect voting system, but IRV makes a worse set of tradeoffs than STAR."
0,2023-03-11,CMV: No objective prescriptive statement or objective moral framework is supported by reality.,u/UselessTruth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11op8n0/cmv_no_objective_prescriptive_statement_or/,changemyview,"Status: minor change on all claims I completely in case 1 &amp; 2 I have completely changed my mind on claim 3)

I believe no objective moral framework exists, and only subjective meaning exists.

Following the previous conclusion, I also believe objective prescriptive statements do not exist. By this, I mean any statement like: “if you want to have blue hair, you SHOULD dye your hair blue.” Although this statement is logical, I believe the objective “should” is never justified. This chain of logic obviously feels very unintuitive to me, but considering that I believe there is no objective meaning or actions that should be taken It seems only logical that prescriptive statements are always subjective.

To this end, I will make several claims for two cases.

If a god does not exist:
1. An objective moral framework does not exist
2. All meaning is subjective 
3. All prescriptive staments are subjective 
4. Good and evil is entirely subjective

If an all-knowing god exists:
1. No noncircular explanation for an objective moral framework exists
2. No non-circular explanation for the existence of meaning exists
3.No non-circular explanation for the existence of objective prescriptive statements exists.
4. No non-circular explanation for the existence of objective good or evil does not exist.

Edit new stance on claim three: At least one objective prescriptive statement exists

Edit minor change: I am longer claiming any of these points with certainty, that I am claiming they are more likely to be the objective truth. You must now prove it is likely, rather than possible for me to be wrong.

An example of a circular argument would be: an all-knowing god exists, it knows killing people is wrong, and therefore it is objectively immoral to kill people. You must prove how the conclusion can be reached by a method other than knowing it is true. 

*Additional standards I will hold myself to on CMV.*

If a comment causes me to change anything about any claim I made, that will award a delta, but if I simply need to modify the logic used to reach my conclusions, my mind hasn’t been changed.

If I have not replied to your comment and you have read through the entire thread and believe your argument to be sufficiently different and/or better than any other comment please repost it as a top level comment if it isn’t already and start the comment with (unique) and I will make sure to eventually get to it. (If people start to abuse this I will remove this rule)

To that end, I will try to reply to as many comments as I can. Additionally, all my responses will be the first of these categories that occur and state the category.
1.  clarification 
2. Off topic
3. Similarity: I have already addressed a similar argument 
4. Delta: It changed my mind
5. More-info: their argument seems convincing, but more information is needed to change my mind
6. Logical fallacy: Addressing why I believe there to be a specific logical or factual inaccuracy in the comment. This does not mean your comment has a logical fallacy just that I am unconvinced of your argument due to some specific (non-personally relevant)inaccuracy I believe it to have.
7. Non issue: why their statement dosen’t actually imply any of my claims false
8. Initial assumptions. I don’t believe the initial assumptions needed to make their claim or the argument does not apply to my claim.
9. Contested info: Why their claim is contested information (information that experts reasonably disagree on or are unsure about the conclusion) 

*reasons for wanting view changed*

Universally: although it isn’t my only aim in life, one of the things I want to peruse is finding truth and holding informed opinions. While I do consider my viewpoints I am far from infallible and even some of my most well reaserched or thought out opinions might be false. Whenever I learn new information that changes my mind this marks an improvement in the truth of my opinions and beliefs.
Post specific: not believing in prescriptive statements feels like cognitive dissonance or something. It’s kinda exhausting whenever I think about it.

Edit: I didn’t award a delta for changing my option on claim 3 because I don’t know which comment changed my mind. It happened about 2 weeks after reading making this cmv and was mostly through introspection but was probably triggered by this discussion."

I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want to make people who know me hate me over this. I'd like to preface by saying I consider myself to not be right-wing, nor do I think I lean right at all; I'm not conservative. I'm also horrible with words, so I hope I'm able to have the intended meaning of my words come across properly.

I don't think trans people are evil, that they should be punished or that they should have mean words thrown at them; this is not what this is about.

For some reason, I get this visceral reaction when seeing that someone's trans online or irl; I just grimace internally and am like ""It's probably not a good idea to interact too deeply with this person."" While this isn't the case for other LGBT people or most leftists, it is the case with radical feminists or people you'd see at FDS. And for trans people. I've got a few trans/gender-fluid acquaintances, and sometimes it's like they're all the same person. I'm not sure if this is some actual pattern recognition or just confirmation bias, but I swear I can sometimes actually predict what their thoughts on random stuff like music will be. I don't think I've met a single transgender person that wasn't autistic or had some other sort of mental disorder either.

This is all based on personal experience and I've got no studies to back my thoughts up other than that one time where I read somewhere that said transgender people are five times more likely to be on the spectrum. ...But there's a clear pattern here. I see conservatives sometimes make similar claims that there's a clear correlation between being transgender and having mental issues... but people just dismiss them as being lunatics, like they're intentionally trying to distort the original person's claim.

I'm not saying they should be forced to detransition or whatever, nor do I think they're actual menaces to society or something, but just like it's \*weird\* to walk on all fours around the mall, it's \*weird\* to buy into all the rhetoric, partake into cancel culture, have pronouns in bio, all that stuff. Like, I get it: gender roles suck. I actually wish I were born a woman myself 'cause it'd affect how people treat me and shit. But I wasn't, I'm not, and I frankly think it's a bit, well, grimace-inducing to think you've become a woman or a man or some new sort of individual just because you decided to start/stop wearing makeup or dress like a 70-year-old grandpa. I once read a story about a happily married straight couple that was perfectly average until one of them realized she was a lesbian and the other one that she was a woman. And then they're happily married lesbians. ...And to me that makes no sense! Sexuality isn't a switch you can flip!

0,2023-03-11,CMV: The Federal government should not handle social issues,u/Every_Baseball,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11osg0v/cmv_the_federal_government_should_not_handle/,changemyview,"It seems I can't edit the title, but upon receiving feedback a better title for this post would be the following: The federal government should not pass legislation that only applies to a specific sub-group of people until majority of states have passed the legislation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not taking any stance on any particular social issue for this argument, but it is my belief is that things would be much better and much less divided if the federal government handled only economic,  and defense issues, among others and not social ones (such as lgbtq+ issues and race based issues). This does not mean they should ignore discrimination against a particular class, but their role should stop at ensuring that the government treats all INDIVIDUALS equally, rather than trying to effect things like trans people in sports and rates of employment for particular classes of people, for example.

I'll make two arguments for why I believe this:

1. The Federal Gov can only do so much, and has it's hands full already without taking on complex issues of race and identity politics. We would have better outcomes in the non-social areas if the political discussion and elections at the national level avoided focusing on social issues.

and

2) Social Change happens much better and faster if it starts locally and then moves to state level, with any federal legislation being done only after the issue has been worked out at the more local levels

I will use gay marriage vs trans sports inclusion as examples:

Imagine if in the 90s the congress had passed a law mandating states accept gay marriage. There was much less public support at the time, so this would have cause states to rebel and challenge this with state laws and supreme court challenges, and had it been forced through it likely would have led to a more conservative congress and president being elected in the following cycle, who would then overturn the legislation and possibly pass legislation banning gay marriage that would then be harder to overturn. The way it happened was a much better outcome than this (I am of the opinion that allowing gay marriage is absolutely the right thing to do, as treating gay people differently than straight people is unconstitutional and wrong, but this is just an example for the purpose of this post), and by waiting to pass federal legislation protecting gay marriage until after the public opinion was swayed, we got to a better outcome quicker with less chance of it being reversed.

The trans rights issue is a counter example, where the Biden admin mandated that trans athletes be allowed to compete as the gender they identify within high school sports. (I am not taking a position on whether this is the right or wrong policy, it is a complex issue but it is beyond the scope of this post).

We are now seeing backlash against this and other trans issues, and ultimately it seems the pushback is favoring the opposition in popular opinion.

I believe that this approach will lead to a result that is counter to the result that those who believe it is the right thing would want, ie more backlash and more power going to politicians that oppose the rights that those in favor are pushing for.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I think forcing social change at the federal level is counter-productive to the goals of said social change, and it also distracts the public, allowing special interests to essentially sneak by other legislation that very few want that hurts everyone (except the very few who want the legislation).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: It's been made clear that I need to define my position more clearly.

I believe that the federal government should not deal with/debate issues that address a specific racial or social group until the majority of states have reached a consensus, they should only deal directly with issues that affect all individuals.

For example, they shouldn't make a law or executive action that says ""people of X gender must be treated in such and such a way"" they should only pass laws or actions like ""ALL people must be treated in such and such way"". In the gay marriage example I used, the federal government passed legislation specifying rights for a specific group (gay people) only after the majority of states had passed the same legislation. I believe this is much preferable to the other way."

To further my point, bees can relocate whenever/wherever if they do not like being in said area is in some way or form of consenting. They have in fact, left bad beekeepers, but stay with good ones.

So it is to say, that bees and beekeepers have a symbiotic relationship. The bees consent to the harvest of honey (by not relocating). Often then not, beekeepers give them safer homes, prevent death in winter months by providing sugar water if necessary. (beekeepers do more then just that)"

If you don’t know, the largest bank for tech companies and venture capitalists, Silicon Valley Bank, just went under. Many of these VCs are calling for the government to step up and pay depositors back their money beyond the insured FDIC $250K.

I don’t think taxpayers should be forced to bankroll rich, Silicon Valley executives, most of which are tech bro white men from rich families and networks who could easily make up the funds lost privately.

I’m a founder of a tech startup. I have raised money from investors. I have learned the ins and outs of my industry and have lots of fellow VC-backed founder friends. 

But I don’t think the general taxpayer should be responsible to pay back private deposits that were lost due to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank’s management and the VCs who caused the bank run that led to its demise. If it were me, I’d figure out a way to operate within the insured amount of funds or put my money in various banks for more security. 

The same VC investors who are so gung-ho about capitalism and have no qualms about screwing the poor and middle classes for their own wealth are now expecting the government, and the general population, to bail them out of something they brought upon themselves.

Yes, some of these startups will have to shut down as a result. But being an entrepreneur is about being able to be scrappy, manage resources effectively, and operate in times of uncertainty. Those that fail due to this SVB situation probably were not using the capital efficiently anyway (maybe that private jet and those fancy dinners weren’t the best use of funds, eh?). 

Startups fail all the time because of forces out of their control. This is no different and it shouldn’t be taxpayers’ problem.

CMV!

EDIT: 

1. I’ve gotten a lot of people who assume I don’t know anything about how companies, startups, or VC funding works. I do. I own a tech C-Corp and have a cap table with investors. We run payroll and have multiple business banking and credit accounts. We are early stage and have not raised hundreds of millions of dollars yet, but I understand how it works.

2. I want to clarify that I don’t think these startups should automatically fail. But I think this ‘bailout’ should be dealt with using private funds vs a government purchase or agreement requiring general taxpayers - especially from groups that are consistently and systemically discriminated against by the very investors crying for help right now - to foot the bill for SVB’s collapse.

EDIT 2: 

Parts of my view have been changed - I do think the depositors should be made whole to pay employees and so businesses can continue operating. However, the part of my view that still stands is that US taxpayers should not be responsible for it. These are things I still believe can be fixed with private funds: additional venture capital infusions, loans, corporate buyouts, whatever.

A lot of interesting comments and conversations are happening here, and I've replied to a lot of them. But I'm going to sign off of this thread now :)

The Democratic party mantra to me is nothing more than hypocrisy ""Oh yeah, we hear you! We believe that everyone deserves rights and we will fight for the working class!"" Then they stab the working class 37 times in the back and then virtue signal some more.

For example, they'll how much they support George Floyd and other minorities, but then do nothing but wear african garb on the senate floor and support the institutions that led to his death. They'll talk about how they support the working class and unions, then shut down a railroad strike where they wanted sick days.

Democrats co-opt issues I care about and then either do nothing about them, or enable the republicans when they inevitably strike back.

I want my view changed because I would like to feel less annoyed that I have to support such a party to even have a chance at getting legislation I care about passed.

I disagree. Sure, AI might be able to do some basic stuff &amp; sound very convincing at it, but even with seemingly simple stuff (like planning a trip), it’s missing the distinctly human touch. For instance, it can find popular destinations and list information about them, but will it ever truly understand the nuances of what a human being wants to experience through travel?

A large part of my job is talking to customers, asking them about themselves, &amp; getting a feel for their travel preferences. There is so much human connection that goes into planning the perfect trip for them. I don’t think AIs will know what to ask people. I don’t think they can have that “human connection” with travelers. There’s just something about sitting across from a real human, who you know you can trust to make your trip extra special, that makes this process so much more enjoyable for travelers.

I have tried some of the “Virtual Travel Agents” online &amp; they seemed to have proven my points. Talking to a chatbot just seems awkward, untrustworthy, &amp; fake. Maybe I’m just getting old, but is there not something special about having a human on your side that can step in if something goes wrong, that can listen to you, &amp; personalize your vacation?

Is it true that people don’t care about that “human touch” anymore? Is there something I’m not getting about AIs?

**Edit(s):**

Cuz ppl asked, **these are the sites I am referring to** (copied from comment)

I tried a couple of AIs that claim to be ""the future of travel:

* Stravl ([www.stravl.com](https://www.stravl.com/))
* OpenAI or Chatgpd ([chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/))
* and a couple more (will edit in)

They seem fun to use, but not serious travel planners. More like something cool to try out and show a friend, but not something that will actually plan my trip imo.

Also, I agree that AIs will become better, but **mainly question their ability to gain people's trust compared to a travel agent**"

Such behaviour is a form of sexual harassment of children who are not free to leave the person doing this, and who are not free to complain about the behaviour without a risk of reprisal from an individual in a position of authority.

Working in a workshop while wearing gag breasts poses a risk of an accident which may injure the teacher or possibly someone else. While some may not care if the teacher injured themself, part of OHS is forbidding workers from working in an unsafe manner.

Persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding is disrespectful to students and other teachers, and is disruptive to a school being a place of learning and personal development. It also promotes disrespect towards women when schools should promote respect for diverse groups of people. (If you’re female and you don’t feel offended, that’s fine, but that doesn’t mean others aren’t offended)

If the teacher claims that the breasts are real, the teacher, possibly during paid work time and paid by the employer, should have a doctor certifying that the breasts are real.

If the teacher is wearing gag breasts because of a mental issue which is not their fault, then they should be removed from in-class duties until their issue has resolved.

If they can’t remove the teacher because of a teacher shortage or restrictions on disciplining teachers, fix the shortage or labour regulations.

Schools should forbid inappropriate clothing for teachers and other staff, not just students.

The school should not wait several months to act, or only act when international media gathered evidence that it was a charade. It should try to avoid punishing students for photographing the teacher - only doing so if it’s to prevent a lawsuit against the school or if the photography is disruptive or endorsing the teacher’s inappropriate behaviour.

It should go without saying, but I’m using “they” because it’s about a hypothetical teacher who may be male or may be female, not because I’m asserting that the teacher is non-binary. And my view is about the school’s handling of the teacher, rather than about the teacher themself.

I'm convinced that this movie may be evil. A great point some users picked up on was this:

1. POC of girl is subservient to a white patriarch. White abusive love interests who she changes herself to appeal to rather than love herself. Her mother is gone and her father is a hispanic white passing male. This all perpetuates the white male patriarchs. 

2. Asian women as one of the main casts and other POC of women. But lack of black and Asian men. Asian men are typically invisible in American white media, but blatantly so in this movie. Black men are typically portrayed as funny tropes similar to Asian men but zero to be seen. Except Sebastian who is played by Daveed Diggs. 

3. Potential male romance role is once again a white male. While black, asian, and other POC of males are shafted. No black Eric. This could reinforce white patriarchy and white male worshipping while POC males are shafted, either played as joke roles or not at all


Movie is very concerning now. May have to really reconsider my position and view. Hopefully the movie doesn't perpetuate white male worshipping and white patriarch. Shame disney.

[ORIGINAL POST]

Working with children in a very diverse area. It's nice to see better representation for children of color. Ariel is a good step in the right direction, it's not about us old timers anymore, it's about the children. 



Think about it like this, while it's nice to see white men in there 30s heavily concerned about the race of a mermaids in a children's movie. Growing up, it's always this:

White man saves the day, is the hero, is the main character. 

White female is the princess, the main character, sometimes hero, center of attention, is the main character. 

But we hardly see much positive representation of people of color, only recently changes have been made, but with a lot of push back. 

Black men? Often times portrayed as male thugs, gangsters, needing a white savior, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Black women portrayed loud and obnoxious.

Asian men? Weak, feminine, thugs, or smart but expendable resources, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Asian women are made to hate the Asian men and worship a white man, while hating and denouncing Asian heritage and culture.

These things propagate into our real world through in a sense manipulation and have extremely negative consequences. 

So I'm happy for this movement for better representation. Is it perfect? Nope. But I'm optimistic and think our kids will have a bettee time with more relateable and positive role models through the media."

2,2023-03-12,cmv: neoclassical economics should be discarded as a field,u/Agentbasedmodel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11pifts/cmv_neoclassical_economics_should_be_discarded_as/,changemyview,"Neoclassical economics (econ) purports to describe how people make decisions around allocation of resources. But in both lab and real world settings it has been proven that it does not. It is therefore a broken field of inquiry, pseudo science, and should cease to be taught or researched. 

In the lab:

- copious behavioural research has demonstrated that people do not think or make decisions the way econ thinks they should. Moreover people do not behave 'as if' they were econs - the outcomes of their decisions are different.

In reality: 

- in my own field of environmental and climate economics, neoclassical assumptions have been profoundly damaging. They consistently suggest absurd decarbonisation pathways that rely on rates of land use change 3x faster than any observed in history. Such transitions are not only implausible, they are highly undesirable. The rapid pace of soybean uptake, e.g., has led led widespread spillover deforestation in the amazon. Econ denies such problems by assuming perfect policy oversight and an absence of counterproductive decisions. 

- more absurdly still, econ suggests 4degrees of warming is compatible with a growing economy, and indeed is the optimal tradeoff between costs of decarbonisation and climate damages. 4degrees of warming is borderline incompatible present day human societies. 

Therefore, neoclassical economics is not only false, but profoundly damaging, making absurd and unworkable policy recommendations in important areas of work.

It should no longer be taught or researched."

I when I say Nature I mean genetics you are born with &amp; Nurture is anything to do with environment. 

Edit: Extreme cases like any form of handicaps are obviously due to genetics. Those are exceptions &amp; not what I am referring to. This post is referring to average people that represent the vast majority of our population.

This has been a topic of interest for a very long time &amp; have been researching it for a while. When I say ""research"" I mean watching documentaries on serial killers upbringing. Listening to neural scientists &amp; psychologists speak about their experience/opinions on this topic and reading articles.

To be clear this topic is heavily debated in psychology/neural science, both are a factor it's a question of which one is bigger. However it seems that the more modern the studies are, the more it points to environment being the biggest factor.

Explains why almost every serial killer (if not all) has had a very troubled past. Even ones that people used to believe had a normal upbringing, like Jeffery Dahmer. Turns out after looking into what he claimed was ""normal"", was actually twisted. 

Explains why criminals of all degrees were usually forced into their life due to environmental factors (such as poverty).

Explains why in American style prisons the return rate is 76%, while in Denmark where they have much different prison environments, the return rate overall is only 27% &amp; in open prisons the return rate is 19%. Keep in mind that the open vs closed prison are in Denmark, so that percentage difference is due to environment. Denmark figured out that if you treat people like humans/give help while in prison &amp; more importantly out of prison. Then those people are much less likely to commit crimes.

Explains why when there was a case of identical triplets being separated at birth (documentary is called Three Identical Strangers). Even though they were all genetically identical, raised in the same country/state (which is a big deal actually), they all came out very different. I mean people were really trying to force them to seem alike &amp; even then it was clear how different they were personality wise. One of the brothers specifically was so damaged from his past, that he ended up committing suicide. 

Explains why depending on the country you were born in, that your IQ varies. I mean it varies by A LOT, even just a 15 point different in IQ is huge. Yet as it turns out, countries with IQ average above 95 are mostly wealthier nations (compared to the world). While countries that are very poor, rank low in IQ, many in the low 80/mid 70 IQ range &amp; a fair amount in the 60 range. Some countries like Nepal and couple others were in the 40 IQ range. 

Source: https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country/





Please include this specific point when providing a counter argument:

Also something that has to be explained if the belief that genetics plays a bigger role than environment. That something is the IQ gap not only in poorer countries, but minorities in America vs White people. There is a significant IQ gap between the average Black American vs a White American. If the the belief that genetics plays a bigger part than environment. Then by default the explanation for IQ gaps are due to genetics, therefore you would also have to say that minorities are less intelligent than white people genetically. 

With the big racial discrimination implications aside, I find that explanation hard to believe. Because even asian countries like Nepal scored very, very low on IQ tests, as well as African, middle eastern and so on. What those countries &amp; the minorities in America have in common is their wealth (aka environment), not genetics.

Source: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-black-white-test-score-gap-why-it-persists-and-what-can-be-done/amp/

So again, I believe that the environment plays the biggest factor in peoples outcomes, compared to their genetics. However I am always challenging my views &amp; am interested to hear why you may believe the opposite."
271,2023-03-12,CMV: there is no argument that sufficiently overrides a students rights explaining why a student(in the USA) must recite the pledge of allegiance.,u/doge_gobrrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11pkq2d/cmv_there_is_no_argument_that_sufficiently/,changemyview,"im going to start by addressing some of the primary arguments for it

1. its to honor people who died for you/ your country.

the students in no way likely compelled or asked said people(soldiers) to die or fight in a war. additionally most wars in modern history fought by the us have not been fought for the sovereignty or preservation of the USA as a country but rather for political gain and posturing. compounding this the student in question(assuming they are a k-11) has no ability to directly change political policy or if a war is fought or not. lastly the person in question could have easily have been born anywhere else and did not willingly decide to be born in a specific country or location.

2. its respectful

it is inherently disrespectful to mandate that a student say any set of words or phrases against their will especially if they are of a different religion and do not agree with the under god part of the pledge of allegiance. to further back this claim the pledge of allegiance is allegedly a symbol of american values/policies like ""freedom and the constitution, given that the constitution contains the first amendment its disrespectful and mocking to the student to utilize such a symbol as a method of depriving said student of the rights said symbol represents.

lastly punishing students for not reciting it is essentially punishing a thought crime."

Privacy is important.

I see a bunch of CMVs about how all the new things about AI aren't that bad, implying that they think it's bad, just not \*very\* bad. Me, I think it's not bad at all. I actually think it's \*good\* and I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.

This is not the first time we see people lose their jobs or worry about losing their jobs because of new technology. It happened with the Industrial Revolution when dozens of farmhands got replaced by a single tractor, and countless of other examples out there.

It's not the first time something gets called ""not art"" because of how a machine was involved in its production. Back when photographs were new, people were malding about how photographs aren't real art, you just pressed a button and hurr durr I'm an artist. Nowadays we know better and professional photographers who do the photograph thing way better than I can exist and are paid for it. Although someone who can paint a picture manually tends to still be, to me, more impressive (when it comes to their skill) than a photographer who managed to take an outstanding picture.

See that previous paragraph? I believe AI artists work the same way. It's not easy to make AI art -- I've tried to do it and by god, is it tough. You need to choose the right words, find the right prompts, pick the right seed -- sometimes even different AIs (compare a different AI with a different camera) because NovelAI is good at a specific thing while, say, character dot ai is good at another -- and then you have to comb through several pictures. Like with being a photographer, it takes effort and it IS fascinating to see what people can do, \*even\* if manual pictures are still more impressive. ...Just like fabric, too! I love me some industrial clothings, but if my mom makes something I can buy on the store with her own hands? Holy smokes.

I don't think people losing their jobs for AI is an actual bad thing at a societal level; sure, it sucks for them and it'd suck for me if I were one of those people, but it's necessary (perhaps even healthy? God, imagine having to pick cotton all day in the sun -- thank goodness for tractors). I'm not losing my job yet as a programmer but I eventually will, just like cars did to horses, and that's alright. Humans need not apply."

Whenever I converse with Christians, it seems that many Christians have not delved deep into their religious text beyond simply reading scripture during Bible study. 

I am an agnostic, so I'm still exploring my own beliefs, but even if I were to believe in God, I don't think it would necessarily align with the Christian conception of a deity. Another reason I am reading through the bible is that many video games and media entertainment have religious references. For example, Assassin Creed: Odyssey and the God of War series made me more interested in studying Greek Mythology. I started to study Christian Mythology and have encountered interesting stories like Paradise Lost and the Tower of Babel, which had created a lot of insightful discussion with experienced Christians.

The Bible contains material that is fundamental to Christian belief, and it's generally considered important for Christians to read the Bible at least once in their lifetime. Many would argue that it's a crucial aspect of their faith. I estimate the Bible to be the length of about two Harry Potter novels, and many people in the world have read the Harry Potter series. 

Anyways, if they truly have faith in a deity, then why wouldn't they invest the time on learning about such deity? It doesn't make sense to me."

I came here when I was two and grew up in this country (US). I went to school here. I work here. I pay my taxes. I do my part as a human of this planet to give back to charities and organizations that better the community, the world, and the earth.

What I am currently seeing by way of political rhetoric is that China is bad. And I recognize the US and China have had economic/political competition for decades but it seems now things are more tense than ever. I see it both from the left and the right. On Reddit, I often see 'fuck china' this and 'fuck china' that - even for non-political posts. It's pretty intense.   


Given the political climate, and angry rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum, along with some of the shit I have seen on Reddit, it has created some level of anxiety in me - both for traveling purposes and just being more apprehensive about acknowledging a part of me that is outside my control. I guess we generally use 'fuck (country)' colloquially to mean fuck that country's govt but now it seems that phrase has expanded to create a suspicion and hatred towards Asians.

I've travelled to different parts of the country and in predominantly white states, I get stares but I have not explicitly experienced any racism or prejudice - so far. That being said, I am a bit more apprehensive and cautious more than ever about traveling to certain parts of this country due to the rise of Asians being targeted with assault, etc, so it's definitely happening.

I'd like to think most Americans can separate hatred of the Chinese govt from Chinese citizens or Chinese people living in this country but I am not always confident in American exceptionalism due to some of the angry rhetoric I have seen in the news and media. Culturally, I am assimilated into the American experience with minimal exposure even to my own background, but no matter what I say or do, I ultimately have no control over my physical ethnic traits and how strangers might perceive me based on their own political views.

I fear that the lack of constant reminders from the news, politicians, social media platforms, means more people will blur the line or end up holding irrational prejudices against Chinese people - especially in America where people sometimes struggle with separating personal political values from an individual - sometimes even deliberately targeting Asians due to one's own political views. Even if one does not personally hate Chinese people, using language like 'Fuck China' seemingly only risks potentially extending that hatred beyond politics. We have seen this quite a bit with members of other minority groups. Since East Asians are distinctly and noticeably different compared to members of other groups, it is not easy to simply ""blend in.""

I suppose hating the CCP isn't anything new and there are many reasons to not like the CCP but with the rise of media coverage on Asian people being targeted, and politicians not seemingly doing enough to remind people to separate govt from the people, there seems to be an immediate negative reaction when people drop the word 'China' and often people can find it difficult to separate hating 'The Chinese (the govt)' from hating 'The Chinese (a chinese person)'

My take is that both the left and right politicians are not doing enough to remind people to adopt rhetoric that might be more appropriate such as expressing hatred towards a political party or politician instead of a whole country. 

Saying 'Fuck China' and 'Fuck the Chinese' seemingly encompasses the people, the culture, the good **vs** 'Fuck the Chinese Govt' or 'Fuck the CCP' 'Fuck Xi' which makes it far more clear that one's discontent is not with the people but rather only with the government.

Politicians and the news media can do more to help change the rhetoric and remind all of us to separate politics from the people. We all say we know it but it doesn't seem to be emphasized enough. I believe we should adopt an approach with the way we use our language that minimizes risks of people letting their political views against a government transfer to become prejudice or even racism against someone who might be from a certain country. Not just for China but with Iran, with Russia, or any state that we have deemed to be antithetical to America's values.

Some may argue free speech but I'd challenge these people if we can be more precise in our language if it means it can minimize potential fueling of hatred and racism, etc.

Someone who gives a good vibe and people cherish when they're around?

That's me.

But what's the problem in all of this?

Perhaps it's because my social circles nearly have no single girls, but I think i'm seen as a mascot. Childish, potentially. But people like me. So i'm a mascot. Everyone is dating except for me. I'm often jealous of my friends who have nice girls to build a life together. I've given up on sex totally - with guys or girls. I'm bisexual. It doesn't interest me anymore after years of not having anything at all, not even a kiss, and when I was lucky, it was a mess because I ended up with people with no experience like me and it was just messy due to the lack of experience of us both and therefore not satisfying to neither.

What do I have to do? Get a sign on my head that says ""i'm single""?

So this is why I say i'm a real life mascot. He's pretty, he's cool, he's nice to have around but he is undateable. ""unsexualized"", unable, simple as that."

Rural lifestyle, conservative politics, all that. It's always been a bit of a resort town, and then a few years ago a huge number of celebrities bought vacation homes here and drove thousands of people to move here.

I'll preface the rest of this by saying I am *not* a Conservative and my ideology aligns with very few of my neighbors. I'll also say that while I'm specifically talking about my city, this has happened to any notable city in the West, including Montana, Wyoming, Utah, smaller cities in Washington and Oregon, and so on.

In my area, there's always been a general dislike among locals towards people who move in from other states, namely California, Washington, and Oregon. A lot of that dislike was/is based in the idea that people from blue states would somehow corrupt Idaho's politics, which wasn't, and isn't, the case.

The other reason people have been wary of outsiders is because we know they're bringing big money with them. Even before the pandemic, people were selling their homes in California and building McMansions worth five times the median home price here. Obviously that helps the economy of the city and state, but it has driven a huge increase in the wealth gap here for over a decade. 

However, it wasn't a *significant* problem until 2020, when the widespread adoption of work from home policies led droves of people to move to more ""affordable"" cities, especially those with excellent outdoor access and reasonable proximity to bigger cities. I'm sure part of that is driven by the new-ish trendiness of ""wellness"" and the general fetishization of the aesthetics of outdoor, healthy life. There's a cryotherapy spot downtown now, a few vitamin IV places, countless juice bars, and *so much yoga.* I'm not saying I hate these things, but nobody I know who's from here is into that stuff. I also don't hate the people who move here - I totally understand (and unfortunately now empathize with) the idea of moving to a more affordable city.

Anyway, my rent has literally doubled since the pandemic. My parents' house's value doubled. Hotels were booked out because people trying to move here were waiting for a home to buy or rent. Several friends and coworkers were priced out of the city (population 55,000, I might add). Property taxes have become untenable for some. The second an older home goes on the market, it's bought and flipped. There's no opportunity for upward mobility for almost any local. There's no affordable city to move to within a few hundred miles, because people from here fled to them and most of them were equally affected by the crisis.

I know that work from home isn't the sole reason for the housing crisis (which has affected most of the US), but I strongly believe it has played a leading role in the problems we now face. People like myself, my family, my friends, my neighbors, who used to be able to lead a comfortable, affordable life, have been squeezed out of the middle class (which, I know, has been shrinking for decades) to the point of near-poverty. The income gap here is unbelievable now, and I'm sure it's the same in many other cities. Remote work made up 61% of work in 2020, and now sits at 29%."

Sitting in our fancy cars, gridlocked on the freeway, every single day. To go to work for a job we don't like and get paid barely enough to get by. Too much to think about, too much to manage and it all feeds into the human negativity bias. Less to think about is better.

It's like we're all in one big pot and over the years the chefs have brought us to the boil and left us there, forgetting entirely about his priorities.

0,2023-03-13,cmv: I think that the existence of closed spaces exclusively for people of a marginalized identity is not inherently a bad thing.,u/Vicar_of_Dank,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11qdd2f/cmv_i_think_that_the_existence_of_closed_spaces/,changemyview,"There is this ongoing discourse about the existence of closed spaces for members of specific marginalized communities and a lot of progressives will say this is “self-segregation” or regressive. Let me say that I know there are people who, because of trauma or past experiences or honestly because sometimes people are just shitty, are way too eager to turn the tables and exclude the people groups who previously excluded them and I agree that insofar as that is the motivation, it is not something I support.

However, there are plenty of legitimate reasons why marginalized people would want to have spaces primarily or even exclusively designed to cater to their needs and shared experiences because the wider world is still not safe for them. 

People from more mainstream identities (read: cis/het and white) may get legitimately upset by feeling excluded (exclusion is an ugly feeling), but they inhabit a world that is mostly built to cater to their needs and shared experiences so it’s not like they don’t have anywhere else to belong. Plus, a lot of times these spaces will welcome people outside their in-group so long as the guests don’t take up too much physical or emotional space in them. Maybe the most I am willing to sympathize with their perspective is that closed spaces not be intentionally hurtful when establishing and protecting boundaries.

I think a lot of the discomfort from (mostly) white, cis/het progressives is that they are afraid that bigots could use similar rationalizations to try to re-establish whites-only, or straights-only spaces or whatever, but truth is:

1) these things already exist (how many Black people do you see at country clubs, or how many gay people can be themselves openly at evangelical churches?) 

And

2) marginalizing someone because of their identity is NOT the same as having a space that caters to people who share a common experience of marginalization.

EDIT: I am surprised by how aggressive the backlash against this post is, especially since most people seem to be upset by something I explicitly said I was not endorsing.

I literally said on the post that I do not support vindictive discrimination against people from the majority identities (e.g. white people, straight people, cis people, etc.) and that when I was talking about ""closed"" spaces I did not mean people weren't allowed in because they didn't belong to the specific marginalized identity, but rather that the space was specifically built to cater to the specific identity and that people outside that identity who chose to enter should be mindful to not take up too much physical (i.e. numerically overwhelm) or emotional (i.e. try to police the expression or embodiment of the people for whom the group was created) space.

I will say there were a few comments which introduced nuances and arguments that were not already addressed in the original post, and to those few commenters I will say this:

I think you convinced me that creating closed spaces for marginalized identities can open the door for discrimination to occur between marginalized identities (e.g. homophobia in Black spaces, racism in queer spaces, religious discrimination, etc.). This is actually a real problem and I need to become more informed about what can be done to prevent this from happening or if creating rigid boundaries around group identity will inherently lead to this problem. Thank you for bringing this up.

Another concern I found compelling was the ability for potential allies to the marginalized group to experience camaraderie with marginalized peoples is minimized if they retreat into safe spaces which do not allow for much interaction with allies from the majority group. I think this is more something to look out for in specific instances than a problem at large since people of marginalized identities are often also part of diverse spaces (e.g. workplaces, schools, fandoms, etc.) to where it is very unlikely they will not build relationships with people outside their groups, but with the Internet and the increasing ability for people to retreat into echo chambers, I still think this concern is worth keeping in mind.

Lastly, for those of you who immediately jumped into accusations of ""racism"" or ""segregation"" or bringing up examples of how ""white nationalists are marginalized, should they be free to create their own closed spaces?"" I will say this:
Do you understand what racial segregation in the U.S. was like historically? Do you know how many Black churches and businesses were bombed and burned to the ground by the klan? How many activists and organizers were killed in cold blood, lynched, or otherwise had their lives ruined? How many murders of innocent Black people happened at the hands of police for ""crimes"" such as ""loitering"" or ""speaking to a white woman,"" or ""trespassing"" on public property?

Do you know that until the 1960's, the U.S. had laws which prohibited certain nationalities or ethnicities from coming into the country legally? And how if people from these countries or nationalities came here illegally they had absolutely no legal protections because any attempt to try to advocate for themselves would get them deported or worse?

Do you know that in the Southern border of the U.S. it is a crime to leave out food or water for migrants crossing the border? And that border patrol agents routinely search and destroy rations left out for migrants in the desert South of Arizona, New Mexico, and California? Or that one third of all agricultural workers in the U.S. are undocumented migrants who are payed well below the minimum wage, and are often turned in and deported by their employers after the harvest season is over and they have to cross the border yearly? Or that the reason they go through all that trouble is because American corporations have basically purchased the governments of many Latin American countries and absolutely destroyed their economies and any kind of labor protections? And that the U.S. literally had a military academy that taught fascist authoritarians how to overthrow democratically elected governments through military coups?

Did you know that until the 1970s, being publicly gay or trans in the U.S. would get you forcibly sterilized, and in many cases also would get you imprisoned or institutionalized? Did you know that Ronald Reagan ordered the CDC under his administration to halt any mitigation efforts or research into treating or preventing AIDS because he viewed it as a divine punishment from God on the queer community, and it wasn't until the late 80's when straight white women started contracting the disease in significant numbers that he lifted that order? or that to this day, most states still accept gay/ trans panic as a defense for murdering queer people? or that recently leaked emails between Republican politicians and conservative influencers shows that part of the reason for all the anti-trans legislation that is getting passed right now is explicitly to cause more trans people to off themselves?

Did you know that during the westward expansion, the U.S. military literally waged a war of extermination against Native Americans? Did you know that Native Americans have fought and won Supreme Court cases to prevent being forcibly relocated after surrendering to U.S. troops and the U.S. government relocated them anyways? In blatant violation of the Supreme Court! Or that some tribes were relocated multiple times because the land to which they were first relocated to was later found to have gold reserves, or oil, or simply to be desirable farmland, so the Native Americans who were forcibly moved there were again forced to relocate to basically wastelands? And that today, even in those badlands, the U.S. is still allowing businesses to build pipelines and other hazardous infrastructure through Native land without and against Native Americans' consent?

So please, please, PLEASE, unless you can point me to examples of similar atrocities happening to the same scale and with the same impunity to white/cis/het people because marginalized people want to have localized closed groups for their own enjoyment and safety, PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU do not DARE compare the two. It's not the same. AT ALL."

0,2023-03-13,CMV: People make too big of a deal about tipping culture,u/MissHannahJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11qfogm/cmv_people_make_too_big_of_a_deal_about_tipping/,changemyview,"I get it, you’re already spending seven dollars on a coffee but if you’re doing that you probably have a dollar or two more to spare, however that’s not even my main point.

So often I hear people saying, “tipping culture has gotten out of hand.” I don’t agree with capitalism or the way we currently treat service workers and agree that businesses should 100% foot the bill to pay employees a living wage. However, that is not the system we currently live under and in the real world today, most service workers do not make a living wage and rely heavily on tips.

Here’s my thing; nobody is making you tip. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But it irks me when people are anti-tip but try to spin it into being a workers rights thing. No, you’re not tipping because you believe employers should pay their workers more and you think they deserve a living wage. You’re not tipping because you simply don’t want too. That’s fine, but don’t try to make it sound like you are some kind of pro-worker amazing person. When you don’t tip a server you are essentially screwing them over in the current system because nobodies rising up to change how restaurants pay them. 

I get it more for other businesses but again, nobodies making you tip. I think it’s good that more businesses are offering tip options. Should it be necessary? No. But in the system we live under I think it’s great that there’s an option, option being the key word, for a barista or cashier to make a dollar or two more during a transaction. 

If you feel like it do it, if you don’t then don’t. But when people just outright dismiss tipping as a whole it makes me think you just don’t want to feel guilty for not doing it and you put that higher than the positives it can bring for the worker. I think it’s good in todays system for there to be an option for people to make a little more money.

Edit: I’m not saying people who don’t tip don’t actually care about workers rights but choosing to not tip a service person seems like an odd way of showing support. I get the idea in theory but let’s be honest, the tipping system isn’t changing anytime soon and you not doing it is not making some big statement to big business it’s just not giving extra money to a single worker, which is fine if you don’t want too. 

I guess it just bugs me that people act like them not tipping is some big act of rebellion against big business, they don’t care and the workers are the ones feeling the brunt.

Edit 2 - I almost put in the US in the title because I figured people would assume since tipping is much more of a thing here than other places but yes, I am specifically talking about the US."

0,2023-03-13,CMV: we should not be blaming Tems for obscuring people's views at the Oscars with her dress.,u/Square-Dragonfruit76,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11qi10i/cmv_we_should_not_be_blaming_tems_for_obscuring/,changemyview,"Social media was crazy this morning blaming Tems for her huge dress which may have blocked the views of people behind her. And people are being really aggressive about it on Reddit and Twitter. This aggression, in my opinion, is unfounded. What's more, I think it is premature to blame her at all. Here's my reasoning:

1) If she was given the design beforehand, there is no reason to assume that she knew better. This is her first year being well known, whereas previously she was an unknown musician from Africa. I don't know anyone who has ever worn a dress that has a collar higher than their head. It's not exactly a common thing. So would the average person be able to immediately see from a design that that would be obstructing someone's view? Hard to say. Especially if you are not used to wearing performative pieces and going to events like that. If you were exceptionally tall, or usually wear hats, then maybe you would think of it. But as it stands, I have yet to be convinced that the average person would anticipate this.


2) Once she got the dress, if she noticed it was too large, that would have been too late. For the most part, actresses do not wear dresses that they own to the Oscars. They sign a contract with a designer to showcase a dress. Often these dresses cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make. So at that point she couldn't have just not worn it and could even have been sued for doing so. 

3) Lastly, some people have commented online that Tems should have pushed the dress down or changed seats. You don't know if either of those were actual options. Changing seats probably would have been impossible for an event like that, and pushing the dress down could have damaged it. Plus, it's not even clear that the people behind her even _mentioned_ to her that they could not see. That is just pure speculation at this point"

The people and bots that highlight automated repost bots are providing a public service and that’s good. 

What I mean is on the larger random-post subs like r/NextFuckingLevel  or r/IdiotsInCars  or whatever there is very often a top comment that is “I thought it was my turn to post this” or “This is the third time this week” or something. 

These comments serve no purpose. Either people have seen the previous posts, in which case your comment doesn’t do anything or they haven’t in which case they’re redundant. 

There is an edge case where these comments may cause a poster to check more carefully before submitting a post. But even so, a lot of people don’t browse specific subreddits but rather rely on their subscription feed. Reposts are good - or certainly ok - for these users because they can just scroll past stuff they’ve already seen and they’re less likely to miss good stuff that they haven’t seen. 

In conclusion, these repost hounds who leave comments moaning on popular posts are just - ironically - creating repetitive content and providing no significant benefit to offset the harm they cause. Goddamnit."

It seems most people didn't even read the bill or understand why it was recommended by researchers at Harvard Kennedy School (people much smarter than that orange baboon). This was done for reasons outside MAGAland.

Since the Dodd-Frank Act got passed all banks with more than $10 billion in assets were treated much the same way; this is good right? All banks get regulated? Well, there were more second-order effects than regulators realized; these banking regulations were applied to tiny, regional, and commercial banks even though they had nothing to do with the MBS shenanigans that resulted in the financial crisis.

**Regional and community banks had nothing to do with the financial crisis.** These are the banks that service communities and sectors that high finance regularly avoids. They did not have capital markets desks that traded MBS or speculated in OTC derivatives. They were focused on lending to mom and pop shops and helping fund their local communities in rural, more agriculture focused areas. For example, over 50% of small business loans made in the US were serviced by these community and regional banks and over 70% of agriculture loans were issued by regional banks. These banks only hold **20**% of the total capital in the financial sector. These banks focus on places that JP Morgan and Goldman don't give a shit about.

Regulations were killing small banks' ability to compete and were leading to a rapid concentration of wealth among the biggest banks;

JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, etc.

Regulators and researchers feared that having most of the wealth in the country concentrated in these banks would lead to increased wealth inequality as the regional and community banks were the only banks available in low-income communities, historically disenfranchised communities, and agricultural communities that did not have access to these financial giants.

The regulations crippled small banks' ability to compete with large banks in a number of ways: One is that the vast number of regulatory compliance that Dodd-Frank enacted required massive compliance departments and legal teams that banks like JP Morgan could stomach the costs for, while a smaller bank would be completely gutted by. For example, hiring just two compliance officers **reversed** the profitability of a smaller bank.

JP Morgan has over **4 trillion** in assets. *A smaller regional bank would have less than 1% of that.*

The SVB debacle was caused by rising interest rates making the bank's HTM securities hit badly; SVB wasn't trading Dogecoin or some other random nonsense; it was holding a variety of low-default risk bonds and securities. This was a Black Swan Event not caused by simple deregulation, but rather a lack of analysis by the government and poor management by the bank caused by a decade of low rates and optimism. SeekingAlpha and short seller Marc Cohodes rang the alarm on SVB months ago, why did the government not step in a long time ago, isn't that their job?

LCR requirements were on banks of over $75 billion in assets, shouldn't their liquidity coverage ratio have triggered alarm bells for regulators? Other risk-based capital ratios were also required and SVB was not going under the radar as it WAS a category 3 bank. **This was not a regulatory failure.**

The SVB case would be an entirely different post, looking at their HTM portfolio, balance sheet, and how it created a prisoner's dilemma in which Peter Thiel would trigger a bank run. It wasn't a 2008 situation where the bank did some goofy NINJA loans nonsense and went under.

Big banks WANT regulators to pass more bills and restrictions on regional banks; it hurts their competition and makes capital flee to the big banks. Hurting commercial and regional banks hurts the little guy, and in many ways it might even hurt you, dear reader.

Things like a decrease in general mental health, an abused work force and etc. And I agree with all of it!

The thing I'm on the fence about is ... I don't really see how that's something we can blame on our chosen economic system since... well it was never it's goal in the first place.

Isn't an economics system sole goal to dictate how goods are produced and distributed and attempt to maximize the output? All the economics system I know of have some variance on how this is achieved, but the goal remains the same. The mission statement isn't ""Make everyone happy"" it's ""Make as much product/money as possible"". So that's really the only reasonable criteria upon which  we can criticize capitalism - ""Does it maximize production?""

It doesn't seem reasonable to blame a fruit tree for making a shitty tasting fruit... well yeah, it's goal was never to feed you in the first place... it's goal was to spread it's seed. Can't fault it for making a fruit not edible to humans.

TLDR 

My POV is : you can't blame XYZ economic system for being shitty based on societal issues, it wasn't designed to handle those issues. You can't blame Capitalism for being shitty to people, if it's goal was never to \*not\* be shitty to people."

To me this is no different from using a calculator, the internet, or going to the library and getting help from a librarian. Like it or not AI is going to become a mainstream tool and we should be embracing the tools that will be used as society progresses. 

So if AI assist people in learning, banning it from usage means you just want to make things harder rather that assist the person in learning to me."

This argument was probably already said before. But organ donation is something I feel like everyone should do. I know some hard opt-out policies infringe on individual body liberties and choices(government taking) and also religious complications. It was stated that 95% of Americans are in favor of organ donations, but only 58% are actually registered (Donor Network West 2023). So how do we get the 37% of people to register to donate? A Soft Opt-out organ donation system, where everyone is defaulted “presumed” to want to be an organ donor. Those who do not want to donate would be able to opt-out easily through a nationwide website registry. Under this opt out policy:

* Those who are above 18 will be automatically added to a donor registry
* Those who are under 18 will still need parental consent to be added to the donor registry, but will automatically be added once they are 18.
* Individuals who are unable to make their own decisions will still be added to the donor network registry, but their Next of Kin or legal guardian can opt-out for them.
* To be added to the registry you need to be a US citizen or have a SSN
* Anyone during anytime can opt-out of becoming an organ donor
* During a death of a patient who did not opt-out, a representative from a donor network will talk to the family and “authorize” the default of donation in terms of the status quo. This gives the family an opportunity to ensure the potential donor’s preferences are regarded, in the event they have not opted out for whatever reason.

I feel like this is similar to the current opt-in system. Where if someone dies, whether they are a donor or not, a representative from a donor network still goes and asks about organ donation. But in the opt-out system, a representative goes and authorizes the default decision of organ donation if the person did not opt out. This principle goes on the assumption that people will just go with the default choice on what society normally does. By normalizing organ donation, we can increase the number of organ doners.

It can make the Next of Kin less stressed during this time because they do not need to think about what person actually wanted, because if they didn't want to donate they would have opted out. In the event the Next of Kin does not want to donate(and the deceased did not opt out), then we would go by what the Next of Kin wanted (similar to the current organ donation process). I feel like this would be the best of both worlds policy. It may increase the organ donation pool in a sense that people will want to go by the status quo, but still take into consideration family and religious views, so they can opt out for the deceased.

Would there be any downsides to this policy?

Edit:
Interesting point of views. A lot of comments mention that it may be hard to opt out. So my plan would just change it from

""Please check this box if you want to be a doner."" 

To

""Everyone is automatically registered to be a donor. If you do NOT want to be a doner. Please check this box.""

If they didn't check the box, they can always visit a website to be taken off the registry. The point is its just as easy to go off the list compared to opting in under the current system."

I think it's really interesting to think about how robots would be integrated in our society, from the most basic ones to complex IAs that could perfectly mimic human behaviour. It's an interesting thought-experiment that can also serve really well as social commentary.

But that's what it is for me: fiction. I can't take the idea of robots having rights seriously. A robot, no matter how advanced, complex and human like, would be nothing more than a home appliance. It would be a human creation, just like cars, not a human, not an animal, they wouldn't even be sentient, just lines of codes mimicking human behaviour and thinking, depending solely on our tendency to anthropomorphize non-human things. Giving robots rights is no different than giving an intelligent fridge rights.

I often see discussions about robots popping up here and there, with some fervent defendants that they should have rights as long as they reach the point where they ""act just like humans"" (which is a problematic view for whole other reasons, like ""what does acting like humans mean? So less intelligent robots that couldn't pass as humans wouldn't have rights? Why not?""), but for me a robot with human like intelligence still holds less value than a fly (of course, I'm talking about the ""value of life"" here, not monetary or personal importance)."

I think EVERYTHING can be funny if the joke it told the proper way. I would even say I’ve probably heard/seen something funny about every serious, sad, horrific and distressing subject matter.

There is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about. 

* Time &amp; place: I don’t think unsolicited jokes will be received well and that’s understandable. In passing, on the street, at work, at school or even among friends. If someone comes to a show or chooses to watch/listen to media with jokes, I think that those are the few places where *everything* is okay to joke about. Telling a sexist joke to someone while they are looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time. 


So given the proper time and place, I think everything has the green light. I am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way. I’m not saying no one will be offended, doesn’t make it less funny for some either. 

There is nuance, there is talent when it comes to jokes. Not everyone can write and or perform them as well as others.

So let’s see if you can come up with something that I have not found humorous. Give me a topic. If I’ve never heard something humorous about it, we can discuss why it isn’t okay."

Many critics of the latest few Marvel/MCU movies (e.g. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thor: Love and Thunder) have left reviews along the lines of ""there are too many Marvel movies, the tropes are tired and the beats are predictable"". 

Is this a valid opinion to have? Yes, of course. 

...Is this a useful criticism of the 35th installation in a superhero movie franchise? I would say no.

My opinion is that MCU movies reached a point (probably after the Infinity War saga*) of being nerdy enough that the only people in the public still watching them, are people that have watched all/most of them, enjoy the superhero trope, and appreciate the weird universe-expanding format.

At this point it's like a comic franchise... imagine if critics reviewed each new Marvel comic by saying ""there are too many superhero comics, the tropes are tired"". That's not a fair criticism of a Marvel comic, so should it be of a Marvel movie?

The critics' Rotten Tomatoes score of Quantumania is 47, and the audience's score is 83. This to me perfectly illustrates that the consumers of Marvel movies are generally much more bought into the format, than the average critic. People who are sick of superhero movies are no longer watching these movies, and will not go see the next movie depending on critics' opinions.  

So to round up my opinion, I think that most critics should stop reviewing most MCU movies. Maybe some stand on their own as fun stories and can be watched in isolation, but the more world building weirdness there is, the worse this will get, and at one point critic reviews will be completely useless."

When there isn't an external enemy they just fight each other, making their planet not have one single tree up because of wars - resource mining and battles making creation of wildlife impossible.

Not to mention they're expansionist and only stopped doing that because they got bigger problems. Or else they would just dominate other planets, because they're violent.

And each time they get rightfully obliterated - because they're dangerous - they get more extreme. Can't take your helmet off, can't do this, can't do that, like a damn cult.

How the hell am I supposed to like a culture, a group of people, who are based on violence?

And is the average fan just so much into them for cool armor and cool looks, not realizing they were warmongers and violent people even before the equally warmonger and violent Empire?

10,2023-03-14,CMV: Joel made the right choice in the last of us finale,u/whiskeywisdomss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11r38p6/cmv_joel_made_the_right_choice_in_the_last_of_us/,changemyview,"Firstly, I’d like to say that I believe Joel did the right thing in a general sense. Not the right thing by the world nor by Ellie.

Sections of my reasoning: 

1.) “First, do no harm” 

2.) Reliability and probability

3.) Who will be in possession of the resulting vaccine. 

4.) Choice 

“First, Do no harm” 

This is the first phrase that new doctors recite when they become Medical Doctors during the Hippocratic oath. This phrase comes from Hippocrates work “Of the epidemic”. In this work, among other things Hippocrates states: 

“The physician must be able to tell the antecedents, know the present, and foretell the future—must mediate these things, and have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm” 

The key take away from this is that no modern physician weighs the good of many more than the good of a few. If this weren’t the case we would kill hundreds of people a year to save thousands waiting on the transplant list. Hippocrates states “Know the present, foretell the future” which leads me to my next point. 

The probability that the operation that kills Ellie results in a vaccine is unknown. While the firefly surgeon is hopeful that it will be a positive outcome, they have no way of knowing what the actual result would be. Could the vaccine actually be made? Could it cause a mutation that would be worse? Could it all be for nothing if cordyceps evolves to counter the vaccine? With so many variables, the only thing that is a sure thing is the death of Ellie. The surgeon is ensuring death of his patient for the small chance of ending the apocalypse. The surgeon is violating the sacred oath he took. Rationally, it makes no sense. 

Secondly, let’s say that the operation went through, Ellie died, and a vaccine was successfully made. Who has possession of it? The firefly’s, who for better or worse are just the apocalyptic version of the Taliban. A terrorist group using indiscriminate explosives to wage war on a regime in the name of freedom. Do you think they’d sing songs with FEDRA while equally giving access to the vaccine for everyone? No, probably not. they’d use it as tool for their own personal gain. 

Now, let’s say that FEDRA, The firefly’s, and every other group all got along and wanted to disperse the vaccine. Looking at Covid, do you think that the remaining survivors would openly agree to a vaccine? I don’t think the vast majority of them would even consider getting the vaccine, let alone even allow people close enough to them without violence. Even if the vaccine was created, and that’s a huge if, the distribution and handling of it would never work.


Lastly, Ellie deserves the power to make the choice for herself. 

Before Joel and Ellie reach the hospital Ellie directly states plans for after she “saves the world”. Which if I’m not mistaken didn’t include dying less than a few hours later. This shows she had no intention of dying as a result of the operation. 

Marlene decided to not tell Ellie that she would die as a result of the operation, she lies to her in order to “protect” her. Then, when Joel requests to see her he is threatened with violence, told he can’t see her, and is escorted at gun point off the property. 

If Marlene had told Ellie the truth, and she agreed to it, Joel most likely wouldn’t have gone nuclear and smoked the entire crew.

Despite Ellie’s feelings in the future, Joel gave her the opportunity to decide. 

Damning the already damned world for someone you care about isn’t wrong, even more when the likely hood of success is close to zero.

TLDR: 

Killing Ellie for the slight possibility of creating a vaccine the apocalypse taliban would use as a weapon is completely stupid. See you in hell, fireflies

Are the industries where this cannot happen greater than I can imagine? Would, perhaps, the effects on the job market create an effect where wages grow to compensate and I just don't see it?

1,2023-03-14,CMV: Fighting serves no purpose in hockey anymore and should just be banned.,u/DJJazzay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11rahdu/cmv_fighting_serves_no_purpose_in_hockey_anymore/,changemyview,"I grew up watching and enjoying fighting in ice hockey, but over the years I've come to find it to be a bit of a sideshow. Hockey is a sport that rewards speed, coordination, reaction time, and physicality. The idea that you're just going to stop that game every now and then for a bareknuckle boxing match -when you really think about it- is kind of absurd. 

The typical argument you hear in favour of fighting is that it serves as a form of ""self-policing"" among players. Outside of a few anecdotes, I'm not sure this is supported by any data. Leagues where fighting isn't permitted don't have a higher incidence of violent, illegal hits. In my experience, it's leagues where fighting is more pronounced that have a tendency to be more goon-ish in general. Just look at the old NHL. I don't think anyone would suggest that since the NHL made fighting more rare, the league has become more violent or dangerous. Quite the opposite, it's proved that a different approach to officiating can ensure player safety without fighting. 

If anything, it's clear that fighting is more of a hazard to player safety than anything. How many guys end up with serious health issues stemming from that repeated head trauma, to say nothing of those who have actually been killed on the ice?

It creates a race to the bottom, where teams feel they need to have players on the ice whose value is derived from being obscenely physical. Since the opposing team has one of those players, you need one too, and so on. Then there's a critical mass of players on either team who can't really contribute beyond their ability to potentially hurt other players. It's just an arms race. 

I think the real argument for fighting is that some fans enjoy watching it. It's not about player safety. It's not about the 'code.' But if you want to watch a fight, watch MMA. The NHL's rule changes that have greatly restricted fighting have also allowed it to become a more graceful, skillful game. I'd rather see the Cale Makars and Connor McDavids of the world do what they do then see a few guys who can barely skate rearrange each other's faces a couple times a game."

25,2023-03-14,CMV: Vinyl is an objectively bad audio storage format when compared to digital,u/noljo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11rhdia/cmv_vinyl_is_an_objectively_bad_audio_storage/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I'm not an audio engineer, scientist or audiophile. I don't own any vinyl records. I'm a relative layman, and my primary interest is computer science, but I'm looking to learn more about audio formats.

As you might know, vinyl has been going through a resurgence in the last decade or so. I don't have issues with that, and I'm indifferent to people buying vinyl to collect physical media or for nostalgic reasons. However, I do take issue with some people claiming the vinyl is ""simply better"" than any digital audio formats, saying that there is something irreplaceable with vinyl sound and that it's simply the best format for storing audio. Here is why I disagree:

1. **It distorts the recorded sound:** in my mind, an audio format should have only one primary goal - to be able to reproduce a recording that was put onto it as closely as possible. Now, vinyl was a good and cheap solution for its time, but in comparison to modern technology, it seems very outdated. Think of the stereotypical ""vinyl sound"" - the hissing noise with scratchy, cracking sounds. I've never heard a vinyl recording that didn't feature these distortions, and it points to an inability to record clean-sounding audio, which is bad. Add to that the potential distortion from other sources (like a turntable not spinning at precisely the right speed), and it feels like analog formats like these are just.. worse. I'm not saying these are major factors that everyone will care a whole lot about, but reciting the first sentence - if the goal is to reproduce recorded sound as closely as possible, then I don't think anything can rival a digital recording. With a digital format, the only difference between the audio you have and the audio that the music producers had is the equipment that you play it on.

2. **It's not really subjective:** a fairly common argument to give credence to vinyl is that people simply experience music differently, hence why the artifacts and noise in a recording might actually be enjoyed by someone. But why should we want that - and more importantly, is this unique to vinyl? Seriously, to offer a comparison - we're pretty decent at grading and comparing, for example, monitor color reproduction. With that industry, there is such a thing as simply being better - a monitor having better brightness, contrast, color accuracy, etc. If no one wants to view everything on a distorted monitor, why would anyone want to listen to distorted music? And.. speaking about these artifacts, couldn't they just be reproduced digitally if needed? Since it's all just sound, I don't see what would stop someone from recording a vinyl to digital, or making a digital filter, and getting the exact same listening experience.

3. **It seems extremely fragile:** ideally, a storage format should be fairly durable. Digital is perfect, or almost perfect, with this - if you record digital data, it will always stay identical, no matter how much you access it. This, of course, excludes the possibility of the actual storage medium (like a hard drive) degrading and breaking down, but even then, the digital data can be easily duplicated indefinitely. The 10000th copy will be identical to the first. On the other hand, not only will analog recordings degrade in quality as they are copied, but vinyl just seems extremely fragile. Even in the audiophile circles, there seem to always be discussions on keeping records dust-free, clean, temperature-controlled and so on. But even then, temperature fluctuations and just mere normal use (with the needle scratching the record's surface) will eventually wear it down. How is this not viewed as a major flaw of the format? If I had a record that I knew was going to wear down quickly just by playing it, I'd probably not play it at all to avoid damaging it. When comparing this to infinite replayability of a digital format, this seems like a no-brainer to me."

Looking at the data, it's so hard not to be pessimistic about the future of civilization. As Harvard projects, close to half of the USA's population will be obese by 2030 (1). I'm not going to trying to convince people that they shouldn't be obese, that is a personal choice someone is going to have to make. I'm also not going to tell people that they shouldn't love who they are or be happy with themselves.

However, what I do think, is that America has a serious problem and its stubbornness is not helping. Before I start my rant in the title, let me go through a few points that I think are very important. Nutrition education in America is absolutely terrible in the public school system. I could go on and on about how lobbying has destroyed every iteration of the ""food pyramid"" or now it is called ""myplate."" If you wanted to do your own research on that I highly recommend (2). From my personal anecdotal experience, I hope some of you can provide your own; outside of elementary school, we were not taught anything else about nutrition. (I was taught the food pyramid, which said you should have 6-11 servings of carb filled foods everyday). It's no wonder that people don't understand much about nutrition. It's taught to you at an age that you don't even know how to cook or even close to being able to understand your body. What they teach you still doesn't teach you what the different macronutrients do, why you need them, and why is it important at all.

I'm not going to say that parents aren't to blame, but they are also just products of a country that prides its freedom and profits over longevity and happiness. Semi-rant over.

I recently got introduced to Dr. Fatima Cody Standford (a health expert on the Biden administration) from her 60 minutes (3). In this interview she claims that the leading cause of obesity is genetics and that it is a brain disease that causes their body to not be able to lose weight. I was a bit stunned as a knee jerk reaction, as I'm sure most people were. After thinking about it and reading a few other of articles in which she is interviewed, I still disagree.

I'm not saying she isn't partially right, however, I think you can't realistically say that obesity is mainly caused by genetics, at least statistically. There are a few things I would like to point out.

1. If obesity was majorly caused by genetics, then you would expect that obesity levels would have always stayed around the same, however we are not seeing that as the obesity levels are rising every year at dramatic rates (4).
2. If obesity was majorly caused by genetics, you would expect Europe to have similar obesity rates to America, we don't see this at all. I think these statistics are a bit outdated, however, it can be seen that in Europe, generally is about 10% behind America in obesity prevalence. (5). Most American's lineage derives from Europe. If obesity was majorly genetically linked we would expect that Europe would have about the same obesity prevalence as America.

In another article Standford claims that ""This is the largest chronic disease worldwide, not just here in the U.S. Yes, everybody assumes it's a U.S. issue. We're actually ranked number 14 out of 200 countries. So we're not award-winning, we're not number 1, but we're behind 13 other countries. So this is a major, global issue."" (6)

What Standford fails to mention is that that 12 out of the 13 countries above us are island nations with insanely small populations and the only one that is notable is Kuwait, which has a population a little over 3 million. No where close to the population of the USA. This is such a lousy argument and seems like she is coping with how bad the problem has gotten in America. I'm not saying that obesity isn't a global issue, it most certainly is. However, we are the LEADING first world country of obesity. I think dismissing this and saying ""Oh we aren't number one"" is so ignorantly dismissive and loses credibility towards her arguments at least for me.

So where does this leave us? Well, I'm glad you asked. In my opinion, obesity can be attributed to a lot of different aspects of our lives. The list is long. Genetics, Processed foods plague America, loads of sugars are caked into everything, children adopt the diets of their parents, there isn't enough proper education of nutrition, and the number one reason of all; personal choice and the fact that most people simply just don't care about their health. (It can be an entire other post about this, so I'm not going to go into it). At some point for an individual, this spirals out of control and becomes chronic obesity in which there isn't much that can be done to help an individual besides medications or surgery and to the point in which Standford calls a ""brain disease.""

I don't think we can sit there and point a finger at one specific aspect of obesity and say ""this is what is wrong!"" It's not different than what we have done in the past, blaming fat or blaming carbs on people becoming unhealthy. None of these macronutrients are harmful by nature, but too much or too little is.

\------

Now this is when I get a little angry. I'm sure most people have seen the recent craze about Ozempic (generically called semaglutide). As many of you probably already know, this is a drug to treat type 2 diabetes, but has the side effect of losing weight. Dr. Standford is pushing this drug heavily. She consults pharma companies and touts this drug heavily while also being apart of the Biden administration. She claims in this news interview that these medications are making people realize that their weight changes ""are not all their fault."" While I have read up and have seen the benefits of this drug and it does work (albeit with a lot of side effects), it doesn't change the fact that once these people are off the drug, they will just regain the weight the lost.

As this article from The Journal of Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism says ""One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health."" (7). This article states that Ozempic is only safe to use up to 68 weeks (8).

I think Dr. Standford is being a shill for these pharmaceutical companies. Promising a miracle drug that will fix your problems. I agree with her that how we think about obesity is wrong, but I think she's is going down the wrong path by scapegoating genetics instead of trying to help fix a systemic, multi-faceted issue.

Anecdotally it seems that most people want simple solutions to complex issues in all aspects of life.

Let me know how you all feel about this issue, I would love to hear personal anecdotes and direct criticisms of my logic.

Thank you all for reading.

1514,2023-03-14,CMV: There Is No Moral Justification To Not Eat Dogs That Doesn’t Also Apply To Cows And Pigs.,u/mossimo654,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11rl6ub/cmv_there_is_no_moral_justification_to_not_eat/,changemyview,"Edit: Sheesh sorry for all the negatives in the title. I think you get what I’m trying to say but man I must be tired lol. 

I say this as someone who owns a dog (and could never imagine eating him!!) and eats beef and pork. 

But I’m trying to think through my relationship to animals and food.

I know I would have a very hard time eating a dog because:
-I’ve grown up with a taboo around eating them.
-I see them as pets and have developed deeply personal relationships with multiple dogs. 
-*Their expressions of what are clearly the dog versions of excitement, fear, and pain* provoke empathy within me.

From what I can tell, there’s really no substantive difference between a dog and a cow or pig when it comes to the italicized parts of the above. It seems entirely reasonable to assume that mammals raised for food’s internal lives and inter-species relationships are just as vivid as my dog’s. 

Everything else has to do with my personal relationship to dogs. And I’m not sure how my personal relationship is a very morally consistent reason why they should live or be killed.

Is there a moral reason why other mammals should be raised to be killed for food and not dogs? 

Note: please don’t say that dogs have evolved alongside us to be companion and working animals. I don’t think that’s a moral justification to raise other animals for meat and not them.

Edit: maybe instead of moral I mean ethical?"

0,2023-03-15,CMV: Veganism is a radical ideology similar to a cult that is not really defendable rationally.,u/Snoo_3546,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11rmoz2/cmv_veganism_is_a_radical_ideology_similar_to_a/,changemyview,"EDIT 1: I meant it figuratively, yeah, the title was rather clickbaitry, sorry about that, but I still think most (not all, of course) vegans are inherently very strict in their values and guidelines, much more than the more vast animal-eco-friendly community of Vegetarians. I myself like the practice of pescatarians.  


EDIT 2: I have seen many people calling me out for strawmaning and also people arguing that there are many more important reasons to be vegan apart from the philosophical/ethical one . It is my fault for not being clear enough that I'm all in for the environmental and harm reduction aspect of VEGETARIANISM and even VEGANISM which just want a better world. But my main point was to try and present a counter argument to all the times I tried to ask vegans why not eat humane-dairy, or pound fish or shrimp and only heard the aforementioned ""it against what it means to be vegan"" or ""causing pain to an animal with nervous system is wrong"". By all mean I know not 100% of vegans think like this, but I dare say the majority when confronted with some more ""specific questions"" would resort to some pre-made answers without puting much thought about it. 

\-----

\-----The reason is that every discussion regarding health and environment can be eventually dealt with moderation and a model that reduces animal suffering but don't completely stop using their products all together. The problem with veganism is ultimately its central dogma that can be summed in a single sentence:

""All suffering of sentient beings must be avoided by humans if possible even at high cost"".

This is further extrapolated as follow:- If an animals possesses a nervous system, no matter how simplistic it is, then it needs to to have equivalent rights as humans because by having nervous system, such animal is thus ""sentient"" and thus ""capable of suffering"".

This line is extremely arbitrary, by a simple philosophical and neuropsychologic point of view, this extrapolation of the definition of ""suffering"" is absurd. Like a small child that covers their teddy bears with a sheet so they can be more comfortable, Vegans, are people that seem to have confused empathy and projections to how actually emotions are formulated on a human brain. Nevermind the fact that vegans try to preach this dogma and all the full set of rules of how to live like a cult-like religion, and fail to understand that moral is relative. If a group of people fail to impose their moral view to other group, they are the one seen as immoral by the other group.

\- This is also another point I often seen being misused a lot lately: Not understanding the difference between moral and ethics, and how moral is relative to specific set of values of a group, and not necessarily superior to a different group's set of values. Only religious people deals in absolutist morals, secular people trend, however, with a more logical approach in the field of formal ethics. Sometimes we see vegans trying to arguments about how ""harming another animal is unethical"" and that is also a misconception that I'll deal ahead:

Returning to the problem of suffering, one can draw several deconstructionists rhetorics to dismantle the need of veganism in the first place:

a) How can one objectively define SUFFERING from simple animals such as insects, bees or even fish? If you consider the concept of qualia in philosophy, the answer is pretty simple: It can't be. it is all subjective projection from human perspective. Thus the second point:

b) Why avoid negative neurological stimuli at all? Why is it so bad? Isn't pain part of life? Would a pup deprived of all negative stimuli in all of its life even mature properly?

\- Stating that ALL negative stimuli should be avoided at all costs is, again, ARBITRARY. Why stop at natural life and neurons? Modern A.I. simulations can be based on two types of simplistic stimuli to evolve a neural-network: avoidable and pursuable stimuli equally to a simple insect, in fact there are computer simulations more complex than insects currently running in many Tech universities around the world, shouldn't anything causing negative stimuli be avoided at all costs even in artificial machines created by humans?

c) Even if you ignore the concept of qualia or the definition of suffering, why draw the lines at neurons specifically and what kind of neurons one must possess to be considerable negatively enough of a stimuli? Nociceptors? - Plants also act according to positive and negative stimuli in nature (heat, cold, sunlight and even pressure-sensitive receptors i.e. Carnivore plants).

d) If you must avoid ""negative stimuli"" of all animals possessing a nervous system, then shouldn't people also stop washing their faces altogether, as doing so kills hundreds of commensal mites that live in your eyelashes known as demodex? This is an example of how extremely low this line has been drawn and how ihenrently an appeal to emotion it is.

In fact as someone with a Neuropsychology background and following the concept of simple negative stimuli being simply a biological mechanism that doesn't generate suffering in itself, suffering is a far more complex HUMAN concept, and extrapolating it to any simple negative stimuli is a misplaced empathy projection at best. I can say with certainty that not only insects can't actually ""suffer"" like humans do, neither do other creatures such as crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks or even fish. Any attempt to try and compare a fish splashing on a deck to a human experiencing all the emotional trauma of suffocating is ludicrous.

Allowing fish to ""feel pain"", or bees to work more for producing more honey to replenish the ones we take will not cause a quantum disbalance in the subatomic scale that would rip the fabric of space time apart or drag your soul to hell like your dogma makes people think it will. ""Pain"" does not annihilates gluons. This is just arbitrary oversensitivity nonsense that won't make you morally superior than omnivorous,

There is however a much more complex discussion to be made about if higher mammals like pigs, dogs or cows actually experience ""suffering"" like humans and if self-awareness and consciousness are needed for that. I personally would draw the line in not causing suffering to animals with consciousness like great apes, cetaceans and some birds (no, chickens definitely do not have enough telencephalon to have consciousness even if they do feel pain), you can try and bring the bar down to cows and pigs too and I'd gladly bring qualia back again to justify how without consciousness this is only projection and oversensitivity, but that is a much longer discussion and also, irrelevant, because fundamentally vegans only bring the suffering of pigs dogs and cows as an appeal to emotion of how much they suffer compared to our precious little pets, the inherent fundament of Veganism has already been deconstructed above. You can chose to not eat cows or pigs because you personally feel bad about then, that is absolutely fine, But there is absolutely no logic in refraining from eating shrimp, tuna or honey. Because there is no reason to follow an arbitrary line created by a cult-like pseudoscientific dogma.

Now, one may extrapolate and try to ignore the moral core of veganism and try to formulate environmental and health arguments, but for those, you aren't trending within the veganism radical bonds anymore and we can start and construct a more sensible argument in favor of more sustainable and ""humane"" pecuarian production instead of completely and nonsensically getting entirely rid of it."

Note that this is not a positive claim of ""there is no god"", I don't know if there is one or not (that's the agnostic part) but I don't believe any one exists (that's the atheist part). There are some gods that I actively believe don't exist (like the god that answers every prayer immediately by doing what the person that prays asks for, since I just prayed for a sandwich and didn't get it), others I don't believe exist merely by lack of sufficient evidence or clear definition. Finally, there are what I call ""left-big-toeists"", who define something that exists as a god so they can claim god exists - pantheists who don't think the universe (as a whole) is conscious, sun worshipers, ""god is a feeling"" people, etc. I am sorry, but in order for something to be eligible to the ""god"" label in  my eyes, it has to at least be able of independent thought and action that disobeys the usual laws of physics (those are necessary, but not sufficient, requirements). Left-big-toeists don't convince me.

&amp;#x200B;

For the purpose of this post, I'll consider ""religious claims"" only claims that would detectably contradict a naturalistic model of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been active in religious discussion / debate communities for years now, before I discovered reddit even. When engaging with theists of different flavors, something stuck me. Most of the arguments theists use to justify why *their* god(s) exist(s) and matches the description their religion makes of it can be applied equally well to gods the theist making the argument does not think exist. The theist making the argument has to apply different epistemic standards to their god than to the other gods in order to believe in one but not the others. As an outsider looking in, that smacks of either hypocrisy or ignorance and ruins the credibility of the argument, and therefore of the religion. If one religion is right, it should have *better* evidence than the wrong ones.

Lately I feel like i just don't believe that people are smart enough to argue anymore. People are too stupid to understand simple things, people are misinformed, critical with information they don't agree with and yet at the same time those people can't view some other information critically. 

People are divided, unteachable, unchangeable. It doesn't make sense to sway people in the ""right"" direction by talking to them, trying to change their view. It is far easier to manipulate the masses and ignore the individual. They will follow, or maybe they won't - they are only one in a hundred.

Politicians are just saying the same phrases over and over without engaging in meaningful conversations, the public doesn't think, neither while criticising nor while praising said politicians. People just go with their gut, people love to think they are smart, and most of the time they are not. People are simply to stupid and there is no sign of change if we don't go with the populism route, doesn't matter if we sway them to the left or right, in the end they didn't understand, they just believe.

Everyday is see more and more idiots, i am at a point at which I think way over half the population of my country is too stupid to grasp simple concepts. I don't expect everyone to study every topic that the general public discusses, but maybe, just maybe people should at least lean their individual bias towards the opinion of experts that know what they are talking about. 

All of this includes me. I am no better. I am an expert at some things but I want to discuss all the things. I can be manipulated and I probably will be in the future. 

All of this leads me to believe that people are too stupid for almost anything. 

Trust me, i want my mind to be changed, i want to be able to believe that people as a whole can become informed again. People will learn to use the digital inventions as tools rather than a weapon. Misinformation and manipulation of the masses will be stopped. But right now, I don't believe that. 

(Quick heads up, i would like my view to be changed regarding a big group of people, i am aware that deep meaningful conversations can happen at a personal level, we can't go around and ""enlighten"" everybody one by one though, and who would I be to assume that my way of thinking is superior? I don't want to push my view onto other people, i just want everyone to have a view that they can argue with facts and a solid fundament. Not with the 5 sentences they hear repeated over and over on television)

TLDR: I believe people don't know anymore, don't think anymore. They just believe. Therefore they are to stupid to be trusted with important stuff like voting or whatever. I believe this is true for all ends of the political and social spectrums. The incredibly small minority that actually tries to inform themselves is neglectable in the context of whole countries.

Edit: I don't want to overfocus on the voting part. That's just one of many things people are simply not smart enough to do."

I have a bit of experience living in USA too. So that's my perspective.

I think sex education is really bad, even nowadays with all the talk about being the importance of being open with feelings and good communication.

Sex will always be somewhat embarrassing to talk with our parents, it's not an easy subject for sure. Nonetheless, I think it is crucial to talk with kids about it.

The school is a place that should give life skills, in addition to profession skills like mathematics and English. If it wasn't saw, you might as well argue to also cancel the humanities in school (though a small portion of society can earn a living from it - academia, writers, etc.). 

Hence I believe that a crucial aspect of human life like sex should be talked more about, even if it's very embarrassing. Of course, rules should be enforced so discussions don't slide to problematic areas. 

As a teenager, I had a class on sexual education. It went like : 1. use condoms. 2. sexual diseases. 3. sexual harassment, consent and rape.

As many before me said, it's important to speak of the importance of pleasure for both; the importance of feeling good with your body; toxic relationships (for men and women, in hetero-relationships or gay, etc.); the anxiety it might provoke and how to live a good sex life."

In democratic countries, low voter turnout is a serious problem that cannot be ignored. [According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, more than 70 countries around the world hold elections where less than half of eligible voters actually cast their ballot.](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout) The United States is a perfect example of this. [In the 2016 presidential election, voter turnout was only 55.7%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=McDonald's%20voter%20turnout%20data%20for,VAP) - that's less than 6 out of 10 eligible voters who actually took part in deciding the future of their country. How can we call this a true democracy?

That's why I firmly believe that mandatory voting is the solution we need. Mandatory voting would not only help ensure that every citizen has a say in their government, but it would also encourage greater civic engagement and political awareness. Critics argue that forcing people to vote is a violation of their individual freedom, but I call BS on that. In reality, not voting is just as much an act of political expression as casting a lottery. When people choose not to vote, they're effectively letting other people make decisions for them. And let's be honest, those people are usually the ones with the most money and power. If we want to level the playing field and make sure everyone has a say in government, mandatory voting is the way to go.

Now, you might argue that forcing people to vote will lead to uninformed or careless voting. But let me tell you, this is not the case. Look at Australia, where voting has been mandatory for decades. Their voter turnout consistently hovers around 90%, and there's no evidence that people are making random or careless decisions at the polls. In fact, mandatory voting has actually increased civic engagement and political awareness among the population. In Brazil, where mandatory voting was introduced in the 1930s, voter turnout is around 80%, compared to the 40% seen in the US.

mandatory voting is just one of many factors that affect voter turnout, and it can't be expected to solve all the problems on its own. But we need to start somewhere, and mandatory voting is a no-brainer.

Some opponents of mandatory voting may argue that it is difficult to enforce, and that people will simply show up to the polls and spoil their ballot. However, there are ways to address these concerns. In Australia, for example, those who fail to vote without a valid reason are fined. And in Brazil, voters who fail to cast their ballot without justification can face a range of penalties, including being banned from getting a passport or a driver's license.

So, what's the holdup? Let's make voting mandatory and ensure that every voice is heard. And don't give me any of that ""freedom"" nonsense – the freedom to stay home and do nothing is not a freedom worth fighting for. The benefits of mandatory voting are clear: higher voter turnout, more representative governments, and greater civic engagement. If you think you can change my view, you better come with some real facts and figures. Because mandatory voting is a no-brainer, and it's time we made it a reality.."

63,2023-03-15,"CMV: Whilst learning about lived experience is important, deferring to people for answers on what one should or shouldn't do, purely because of their unchosen characteristics, is illogical and ironically bigoted.",u/H0w-1nt3r3st1ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11s1yy2/cmv_whilst_learning_about_lived_experience_is/,changemyview," Hi All, 

I appreciate getting feedback from people who are involved in an issue, but there's a worryingly ever growing trend of deferring to people purely because of their unchosen characteristics, instead of the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning, and that's what we should always be basing our decisions off of, not the speaker's characteristics, etc.   


(For those who don't know, unchosen characteristics refers to any aspect of a person that they did not choose; e.g., sex, race, sexuality, birthplace etc.).   


After all there is no universal consensus on *any* issue on the planet held by such groups, and if someone assumed otherwise, that would be incredibly bigoted. 

  
As there is no universal consensus, there will always be disagreements that require additional criteria to discern the quality of the argument; e.g. ""Two X-group people are saying opposite things. How do I decide who to listen to?"" And the answer is: the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning. Which of course means, that often the whole exercise is a pointless one in the first place, as we should be prioritising our capacity for understanding logic, evidence and ethics, not listening to X person for the sole reason that they have Y unchosen characteristics.   


I think that listening to lived experience is important, re: listening to lived experience (e.g. all X groups experience Y problem that Z group wasn't aware of); but that's not the same as deferring to people on decision making because of their unchosen characteristics.   


I try to have civil, productive discussions, but that's getting harder and harder these days.   


For those who appreciate civil dialogue, feel free to skip this; for those who don't; I humbly ask that you refrain from personal attack (it's irrelevant to the question), ask clarifying questions instead of assuming, stay on topic, answer questions that are asked of you, and as the above points to:   


\-Provide evidence for claims that require it   


\-Provide logical reasoning for claims that require it   


\-Provide ethical reasoning for claims that require it   


I will not engage with uncivil people here."

What started on 4chan or 8chan and seems to most outsiders to be a LARP of a ""Q-level clearance"" government operative spilling state secrets (but was determined to be an account that near anyone could post upon for an unverified amount of time) and pointing a finger at a global takeover by literal Satanists had spiraled into a few offshoots with varying levels of wacky conspiratorial flare.    


A) Trump was still the president, there was a legal doctrine declaring him as such.  He was going to come back into power with a military coup.    


B) Same as A, but his VP of his new world was going to be a resurrected JFK Jr.???  


C) A few more believable theories that simply state that the democrats are trying to eradicate American culture and Trump, and consequently a fascist regime by the political right, was the only answer.  


Now, for a time, I thought this was dumb luck.  Some right-leaning people with a flare for manipulation of the more mentally ""follower"" minds found their niche.  But over time, and with whispers of ""Russian bots"" influencing elections and certain right-wing talking heads (senators and news anchors) seemingly expounding positive reactions to a White Christo-fascist Russian society with no separation of Church and State made me scratch my head.  


At this time, I genuinely feel there is more to it.  This ""thought contagion"" of QAnon has certainly done some damage to American cohesiveness.  I just want someone to tell me this isn't the case, tbh."
1295,2023-03-15,"CMV: You can be severely depressed and/or anxious without having a blatantly obvious reason, and it’s not because of character or moral defects",u/Successful-Shopping8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11s36k5/cmv_you_can_be_severely_depressed_andor_anxious/,changemyview,"So I just want to start off by saying that I’ve have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression on multiple occasions, and have mild anxiety. I’ve had some small hard things, but for the most part, I’ve had a pretty affluent and smooth life.

I know that I feel miserable, and that I by definition meet the standards for severe clinical depression (x amount of symptoms for most days for 2 weeks that impairs daily functioning). Even with meeting the criteria for depression, I can function somewhat well (I have friends and a job).

I’ve gotten implicit and explicit messages from family, friends, coworkers, and society that mental illness isn’t real. And if they are, that only severely traumatized people get depressed or severe mental illnesses, or that there has to be this big reason for someone to have depression. And if anyone claims otherwise, they’re just lazy/selfish/wimpy. While I think that big life events is a big factor for mental illnesses, the idea of trauma is relative. What’s traumatic for me may not be traumatic for you. So it’s unfair to say that only people who go through “big” traumas can have mental illnesses.

Also, genetics have some impact here. I don’t want to get in the whole nature vs nurture debate, but I feel like it’s fair to say there’s at least some genetic or physiological component to depression.

And lastly, I’ve worked my butt off. I go to therapy multiple times a week, take psychiatric medications, work out daily, have a job, see friends, do daily self help stuff, have hobbies, and eat relatively well- yet I still feel deeply depressed sometimes.

Tl:dr- I want/choose to believe that mental illness is real and doesn’t have to have an obvious cause. This doesn’t make the individual lazy, stupid, or whatever. And depression isn’t just a matter of sucking it up and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Having a mental illness doesn’t have to be justified by some major tragic event, nor does it mean you “failed” at life.





Edit 1
Ok thanks for all of those who’ve replied. I appreciate the feedback and support. I know many of you find this question unhelpful at best and harmful at worst, and that wasn’t my intention when posting. I genuinely wanted (and still do want) to better understand where some of my friends, family, and coworkers are coming from. And if anyone on Reddit had at least a smidge of support for their opinion."

I think this should apply to all who had an impact. That would be CEO, CFO, and any risk management people and possibly board members. 

We need to curb risky behavior and permanently being removed from thier career should be an option. Often times criminal behavior isn't provable, but negligence when dealing with other people money should exclude you from being able to do it again. 

When we look at SVB, we see certain people grabbing their money and running, those seem to have advanced knowledge of a collapse, and there should be punishment to anyone who had insider information and acted as well. 

I support making depositors whole, but people caused this issue and there has to be real long term consequences for them. 

To change my view, why wouldn't licensing solve this? Or maybe a better solution to hold the decision makers accountable."

I feel that one solution might be to return to when it was acceptable to spell things different ways. My theory is that the AI will stick to traditionally accepted spellings and that can create an obvious difference between human generated and AI generated writing. I get that it probably won't take long for the AI programs to catch on, but a temporary solution is better than no solution. 

Also I believe that our insistance on everyone using the same exact wording every time can be distracting. For example, are you still paying attention or were you distracted by the fact that I spelled 'insistence' with an 'a'? Is that level of distraction really the fault of the writer if their point is clear anyway? Yes, their our homophones. But these are usually cleared up by context. See?

Let the AI's be anal and give us our creativity back. If there are many ways to spell ""Shawn"" why shouldn't there be a couple of ways to spell regular words?"

For most of history, “Europe” as a concept has been defined by the Roman Empire. Various states tried to claim themselves to be successors of it, and most states try to trace themselves back to it. The same is true of the states of the Levant, Mesopotamia, and North Africa. Yes, they are mostly Muslim, but besides that they’re far closer culturally to say Italy than they are to Pakistan or Indonesia or even a place like Saudi Arabia. 

They also have deep trade connections to the EU, and make up half of the Mediterranean’s coastline. Economic migrants from these regions also make up the backbone of many European economies, and it’s in Europe’s best interest to stabilize these countries and help them grow economically. With the exception of Egypt and Turkey, they also all have populations less than existing EU members, so they wouldn’t alter the balance of power that much. 

On the subject on immigration, the Sahara Desert is also a bunch more defensible border than the Mediterranean Sea, if you care about that. Culturally, many of these states once attempted to emulate European secularism, but failed, somewhat due to Europe closing them off and refusing cooperation or even harming them. I think opening those doors again and making it clear that the EU values these people would make democratic and secularizing reforms much more popular in the long run. 

I’m not saying that these countries should join tomorrow, far from it, just that they should be given that goal. States like Tunisia, Lebanon, and Israel would be a good place to start if expansion was considered (although again not at the current moment given their instability). I also think that encouraging cultural exchange through programs like EuroVision, NATO, and European sports leagues would be a good first step at improving relations. I think Europe as a cultural zone should end with the Zagros mountains, urals, Caspian Sea, Arabian desert, and Sahara desert, and I think as we move into a more globalized world, that will become clearer and clearer."

However, Hitler could've easily escaped Berlin and lived out the rest of his life under a concealed identity if he wanted to.",u/Weightlossseeker30,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11scx8t/cmv_hitler_absolutely_committed_suicide_in_his/,changemyview,"As far as I am concerned, both of the following statements are equally true:

1. ""Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on April 30th, 1945. The official account of Hitler's death is completely accurate, and all conspiracy theories implying otherwise have been thoroughly debunked.""

2. ""Hitler could have ***easily*** escaped Berlin and lived out his days without being caught if he had wanted to.""

It seems to me that people who believe Hitler escaped fundamentally misunderstand the man and his worldview. There is no doubt in my mind that Hitler did not wish to escape. His ego was too large for him to live out his remaining days in anonymity like many of his Nazi colleagues did. For 12 years, Hitler possessed absolute power and enjoyed a luxurious life of fame and fortune. Hitler was far from the type of person who could just lie low and live shabbily for the rest of his life. Furthermore, Hitler was a ""Darwinist"" who truly believed that history's ""losers"" deserved to die, and that he, if he lost, deserved to die as well. Additionally, teeth found in the bunker perfectly match Hitler's dental records, and there are several witnesses to Hitler's suicide, among other things. There is no doubt that Hitler committed suicide on April 30th, 1945, and theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunked.

Nevertheless, many claim that even if he wanted to, Hitler could never escape to South America and live out the rest of his life undetected like many of his colleagues did. But is this true? While I initially believed this as well, the more research I've done on this, the more apparent it appears to me that Hitler could have easily fled to South America if he so desired.

First of all, during the Soviet invasion of Berlin, Hans Baur ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans\_Baur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Baur)), Hitler's personal pilot, had a plane on standby ready to fly him out of Germany (of course, he declined Baur's offer and chose to commit suicide instead). Hanna Reitsch ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna\_Reitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Reitsch)), another Nazi pilot who could have flown Hitler out of Germany, flew into Berlin on April 26 and returned on April 29, demonstrating that aircraft could fly into and out of Berlin undetected during the Soviet invasion of the city. Hitler had pilots who flew aircraft safely into and out of Berlin during the invasion just waiting for him if he wanted to escape, yet people believe it would've been impossible for him to successfully escape.

Throughout Third Reich territory, there were literally massive tunnel networks constructed for the purpose of allowing Nazis to escape in the event of a defeat. Several countries in South America and the Middle East were eager to assist Nazis in escaping justice by utilizing extensive ""ratlines"" networks. There was a great deal of assistance provided by organizations such as Oddessa and many members of the Catholic Church in helping Nazis escape.

Furthermore, the so-called ""Nazi Hunting"" of the Allies was an absolute joke. They didn't even try to bring many Nazi War Criminals to justice. In fact, they were all too eager to use their talents instead (Operation Paperclip). Many Nazi War Criminals did not even try to conceal their identities, and several Allied governments received information regarding their whereabouts, but did nothing with it.

An example of this is Adolf Eichmann, one of the top men in Nazi Germany. Eichmann didn't even try to conceal his identity. Apart from changing his name to ""Ricardo Klement,"" he did nothing to conceal his identity after fleeing to Argentina. He did not change his appearance whatsoever, all of his family members kept the surname ""Eichmann,"" he literally flew from Argentina to Germany and back several times in the 1950's to meet with old friends and family (and the German authorities did not even give a shit), and his son would even casually brag to others about how his father is the Adolf Eichmann who heroically slaughtered Jews during WW2. And although he made no effort whatsoever to conceal his identity, it took 20 years for him to be brought to justice.

Josef Mengele was also one of the most nefarious players in Nazi Germany, did not make efforts to conceal his identity, and was still never found in his lifetime. His fate was only revealed after his death.

If these men could evade justice without even trying to conceal their identities, why couldn't Hitler have done the same if he had actually tried to conceal his identity? He literally had body doubles who looked very similar to him. In order to prove that ""Hitler killed himself"", the Nazis could have sent the Soviets the dead body of his body double, while the actual Hitler fled to Argentina. It would be impossible to determine his identity if he had just shaved his mustache off. Have you seen Hitler without a mustache? No one would ever be able to recognize him walking down the street because he looks completely unrecognizable.

[https://i.imgur.com/gd9gZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gd9gZ.jpg)

[https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--ktr2QVwFEk/WAwXHdZbryI/AAAAAAAALmk/s4qWC2iiogEBhV2MUBPHABM1fPacU9HDQCLcB/s1600/Hitler\_in\_disguise.jpg](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--ktr2QVwFEk/WAwXHdZbryI/AAAAAAAALmk/s4qWC2iiogEBhV2MUBPHABM1fPacU9HDQCLcB/s1600/Hitler_in_disguise.jpg)

If you saw Hitler walking down the street in regular clothing without a mustache, I guarantee that you would not recognize him. He looks like a completely generic 1950s British white guy without it ([https://ibb.co/zSyQM6Y](https://ibb.co/zSyQM6Y))!

He looks like a completely different person. To be on the safe side, he may have taken more drastic measures to alter his appearance, such as shaving his head bald or dying his hair. There is no doubt that Hitler had the resources and connections necessary to obtain fake identification documents.

Ok, it is true that Himmler did try to disguise himself and escape but was caught. Specifically, Himmler shaved his moustache, replaced his glasses and wore an eye-patch. However, Himmer was picked up by the Allies not because they recognized him but because of his forged papers which identified him as belonging to the field police, members who the Allied MP had standing orders to detain. They didn't even know they had him until he gave his real name to the Allied Commander of the holding camp. If Himmler hadn't stupidly disguised himself as a Nazi field police officer, but instead posed as a regular German civilian, he probably would have never been caught.

Within fairly recent history - and in this media-saturated modern world - we had a famous war criminal Radovan Karadic hiding right under everybody's noses for more than a decade simply by having grown a big bushy beard. The man was living in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. That is the same country where he was president and committed his crimes. *He was living under the noses of everybody in the very same capital he presided over UNRECOGNIZED for a decade.* 

The world is a very very big place and even the CIA would have never found Bin laden if he had just decided to live in a village in Turkmenistan for the rest of his life even with all our 24/7 surveillance tech and billions of dollars. He instead lived in a massive house with dozens of people and was still actively and heavily involved with terrorism.

Overall, I believe Hitler could've easily escaped without ever being caught if he wanted to. I challenge you to convince me otherwise. 

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this."

The drag cars have to drive on the street to each drag strip towing everything they need in a trailer behind them.

Hot Rod Drag Week and Sick Week are some good examples of these kinds of events.

As of right now, it seems like drag and drive event winners are dominated by American cars powered by American V8’s. I think that with a little ingenuity, Japanese and European cars powered by Japanese and European engines can compete with and even beat American cars at these events.

Looking at the results for the Haltech World Cup Finals, there are a lot of super fast import cars that run in the 6 second range like Supras with big turbo 2JZ’s. If those cars can be made to be streetable, they could potentially be a real threat in say the super street small block power adder category for example. Maybe even GTR’s could be a real threat in these kinds of races."

I come from the south and didn't meet my first openly LGBT person until I moved out of my tiny hick town at 19. I used to have weird prejudices and repulsions until I opened up to the world a bit more.

Anyhow, to get to my reasoning. A few years ago, while working at a warehouse, I met my first trans individual. We were the only two people within 20+ feet of anyone else, constantly working together 5 days a week/8 hrs a day. Due to this, we developed a good friendship, added him on social media, and it was kinda my 'woah-this-is-just-another-person' moment, due to the fact we shared a lot of the same interests. The thing is, they never told me, or as far as I know, anyone else they were trans. They were just a man. And that is what everyone considered him to be, even if some small features still retained from their previous gender. They don't have it on social media, either.

Fast forward a few years later, I have a very open-minded (and patient lol) girlfriend and she happens to be best friends with a person who is trans. They're a good person to be around, very funny and laid back. However, they are very loud about the fact that they are trans. she has it on their social media, she brings it up in casual conversation.

Now, of course it shouldn't matter how anyone label themselves. However, what has been explained to me through my own research, accounts of trans individuals on socials like Reddit, and my girlfriend is that (correct me if I'm wrong): They felt out of their body as their assigned gender, and having to act in accordance with the gender roles they were assigned to was torturous. So it is either transitioning, or living life like they are lying to themselves. Which I 100% get and empathize with.

What I don't get is, if it was so torturous to live life as that gender why would you advertise you used to be it and now aren't? Why not just be firm in your stance ""I am a man."" ""I am a woman.""? It feels like attention-seeking behavior to me, and somewhat akin to me saying ""Hi yes, my name is X and I have a penis. What's up?"". Whenever I hear the words or see someone label someone themselves as transgender, I can't help to feel weirded out by the fact they are even saying it.  So, I am hoping maybe if I understand it more, I can get rid of that feeling. There must be something I am missing for something so glaringly obvious.

There are professional body builders, there are people who genuinely enjoy workouts but aren't there to try to bulk up / slim down, and of course, there are people who really don't want to be there but know that they need to do something to get healthier.  The last group, among whose ranks I used to count myself, are often extremely self conscious about just about every aspect of being there.  Not lifting heavy enough weights.  Not running fast enough on the treadmill.  Not looking as good in my crappy sweatpants and stained baggy t-shirt compared to people wearing over $100 worth of athleticwear.  

And then you have people who think that the gym is their personal fitness TV studio.  If you're a streamer who doesn't care about other people in your shot, then great - now my self-conscious ass is going on the internet for all to see.  If you're a streamer who does care - way too much - about other people being in your shot, then you may end up going off on someone for simply trying to use the gym and getting in your way when all they're doing is trying to access the gym that they paid a membership for.

My view is simple: gyms need to stop allowing this.  Obviously outbursts aren't allowed and actively problematic people will usually be dealt with accordingly, but why even let it get there in the first place?  Why allow recording in a room full of self-conscious, sloppily dressed people?  

And let's look at it from one more angle: what about the women who show up in workout gear that is barely more than a swimsuit, because they know they get really hot during cardio and are just trying to stay cool enough to not completely hate their workout?  Maybe they don't want to be shown like that in the back of some guy's gym videos either and become the target of some creep's online harassment.

But if person A orders something hot, and person B doesn’t have their order yet, it is rude to expect person A to wait while their food is getting cold. Then person B is eating fresh, hot food, while person A’s meal is not as good as it would have been. 

I think waiting a minute or so is fine, but if it’s apparent the meal was forgotten or going to take a long time, this applies. Even though I have been in this position as person A, I still wait because it feels taboo, but I think it’s a stupid cultural expectation. If I am the one waiting to eat I always insist everyone around me eats and I think that should be the norm. I am not so important that everyone around me should have subpar food. It’s not like I’m on the brink of starvation, I truly don’t get why this has become expected.

ETA: this is coming from an experience where someone did not and would not allow others to eat even though there was a mistake and we knew their food would take a while. Someone else asked if they minded if we started and they said that it was rude to start. 

It seems the general consensus is that this is rude, but not common. 

I am also not arguing we get rid of all etiquette and social construct, I just think people don’t think enough about it and I find that odd. 

I really appreciate everyone’s very thoughtful responses this is so much more interesting than I thought."

I don't think they want me defending this position, so I will stop aggravating them by ending my replies. Thanks for all the great feedback!!!  :)

&amp;#x200B;

For many people who cannot afford to have children--or simply don't want to have children--it has become too risky to have sex in states where abortion and day after pills have been banned. Some may take the risk, of course, but for many others, such as myself, I can't imagine having sex when it could totally ruin my life (as well as the life of potential partners and future children).

Although I am middle class and middle aged, there is no way that I can afford children---and I've never wanted children. So I simply can't imagine sex being a viable option in my life.

It could be said that contraception is still available, but it's not 100%. Why take the risk when having children would mean raising them in a world where their parents can't afford to feed them and don't even want them?

Another objection might be that technically there is no ban. True! But that's why I said ""effectively banned."" The phrasing is intended to convey the point that the negative consequences have been raised so high---either go to jail or ruin your life with children you can't afford--it's simply unrealistic in actual practice for many of us to have sex as a viable option in life.

CMV!!  :)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Condoms are only 98% effective. Someone in their 20s or 30s having sex a couple hundred times a year really is taking a risk with life consequences.  Also, partners can forget to take their birth control or lie about it to you, which is another risk. And many poor people cannot afford or have insurance for a vasectomy.

EDIT 2 on Deltas: I've awarded 2 deltas so far on insurance covering vasectomies and day after bills still being legal. Great job! Just to be transparent, I'm not going to award deltas for the same arguments..."

I am a firm supporter of abortion for reasons I will not go into in this OP as to not derail the comment sections. If you are pro-abortion and want to enact change, violence is one of the worst things you could probably do it.

There are many reasons as to why abortions are seen as immoral by some. One very popular one is that either embryos or fetuses have reached a stage in life that the same people interpret as a state **personhood** worth protecting. Most states in the United States consider the murder of a pregnant woman to be ***double*** **homicide,** lining up with the type of state of mind that I'm trying to highlight.

Take, for example, **Nazi Germany** when they were genociding jews and other minorities that they deemed undesirable. ~~I can't think of a single person that~~ Most people wouldn't disagree with killing people who were in charge of concentration camps, the guards, the Germans who were executing them.

Racial hygiene and the disposal of undesirables wasn't seen as evil. Nazi Germany wasn't a bunch of villains twirling their evil mustaches trying to spread evil for the sake of evil. They were **convinced** that what they've been doing was good.

Thus, while I think that anyone who murders an abortion doctor for handling abortions should be punished and convicted for murder, I do morally sympathize with their not-so-far-fetched view that these people were committing murder and deserve to be stopped."

**Reading materials:**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_of\_San\_Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Francisco)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing\_Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre)

**Preface:** I believe Japan committed war crimes, up to and including genocide, before and during WWII. I am not an apologist for Japan's actions in any way. The Japanese fascist imperialist state acted in aggression upon other countries.  However, I believe Japan has sufficiently apologized for its actions. Also, I won't downvote anyone in this thread.  I'll be able to spend about 2 hours in this thread and I'll read replies after, too.

**My position:**

Immediately following its defeat, Japanese war criminals were tried, with many of Japan's government executed. Japan paid reparations to the countries it assaulted\* which often totaled several years worth of those countries' GDP in addition to giving land back - though even this amount is low to me, it was an amount decided on by Japan and its peer nations at this time. Since then, Japanese politicians at the highest levels of government have apologized readily, often, and willingly - until recently. As of now, a modern Japanese person is well removed from the imperial era. Modern Japan is a peaceful place and modern citizens shouldn't be made to feel like they haven't done enough to atone for the sins of their fathers.

\*This asterisk is for China, which I will get to later.

**Arguments against my position that have not yet convinced me, but maybe could if people put some additional context/effort into them.**

1. **Some nations have not accepted Japan's apologies, and therefore, the apologies are not good enough.** Not accepting Japan's apologies allows Japan's neighbors to seek additional grievances and make claims against Japan's government that allow politicians to whip up fervor amongst their base. I believe there are incentives for many nations to not accept or downplay Japan's apologies, especially in places where populations believe Japan is beyond forgiveness.
2. **\*Japan hasn't done enough to acknowledge crimes against China and Nanking.** This is a particularly difficult thing for Japan to do because the Chinese government's official estimates of losses and crimes committed against their citizens is inflated. For example, the consensus estimate for the death toll at Nanking is 200,000 people. China's estimate is 100,000 (33%) higher.
3. **The recent Japanese governments, especially under Shinzo Abe refused to apologize, and this indicates Japan as a nation is not sorry.** How I read the situation is that Abe is done with the apologies. Abe's predecessors apologized openly and often, even after Abe was the prime minister. I think if I was in Abe's shoes, I wouldn't apologize either, because the apologies are never good enough. That said, Abe's *denial* of some aspects of the war, eg. comfort women, is unforgivable. Abe is now dead so we will never hear him apologize.
4. **There are factions within the Japanese government and society that downplay the war and other atrocities.** I agree this is a problem, but there are science-denying, history-denying, ultra-nationalist evidence-denying people in every country.

Please help me change my view or add more context to my view."

For those who don't know, set-point theory basically says that once someone has gained a certain amount of weight that has been kept on for an extended period of time, the body will not (over the long term) allow the body to stay at that weight. This relates to metabolism etc. although I don't really understand the biological aspect of it.

I don't think many here would doubt that theres some level of bounce back effect with weight and metabolism, but the question is can that be overcome?

Anecdotally this has been my observation. I've never met someone who was obese and developed into athletic or skinny shape for the long haul. I think at the high ends it can work, like sure maybe a 400 pound person can become a 300 pound person in the long haul, or maybe someone can lose 20 pounds and keep it off but it seems nobody obese can become skinny.

I read one viral clickbait story of a bodybuilder who became obese and lost it as a challenge so he could relate to his patients, but I don't think something like this would disprove it as he wasn't obese long enough for a ""set-point"" to develop.

It's certainly possible that it's possible, but just extremely difficult. The same way 95% of businesses fail, simply because it's hard and not because theres some biological reason for it. But i've yet to see any counterexamples. Does anyone have any? Even anecdotally?

Just try to get the concept here, if you can wrap your head around the concepts then fire away!

Our society propagates extremist feminist narratives that have yet to be dismantled. How are they still here? Any of these examples ring a bell?:

1. A father in a playground with his child? must be  a pedo, call 911!. Thats the default assumption
2. A guy out on the street? must be upto no good. Why is he hanging about? is he a criminal? yet we would never expect a woman to be a criminal. We'd think she's waiting for friends or a uber ride. But a guy alone? He's clearly upto no good and has no friends!  Look at the way he's dressed all grungy but no style ..bet he's shady /s. In reality he just can't be arsed to wear a tipt-top outfit every single day, that's okay, he doesn't have to worry about makeup, and by extension his clothes. Better clothes would be nice, but it's not always a pressing issue to this hard-working man.
3. Ask any real man, he'll have dozens of examples .

This whole CMV would require you to take yourself out of ***your*** ordinary working work environment (where perhaps men and women have no issues talking about all sorts of things with zero repercussions, tension or hostility, due to enforced policy and money at stake) and think about the bigger picture, out on the actual street, what's happening to our culture and people's minds at a larger scale.

* Women at large don't want to understand men, and men gave up trying. There's only so much truth a woman can handle before it bores her. Men learned this the hard way, it's a sad thing but it's just a part of the culture we grow up in.

So what is there left to do? Talk to these forever closed-minded women? If women at large are only offering sex, sex is all the men can look forward to and chase. It's no wonder what men are upto, but it baffles why women are persistently blinded by their own tight-arse,  [frigid](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AJOqlzU4GDf3WfX1JPOHteVN3V658MUUDQ:1679002175060&amp;q=frigid&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLxOLBsuH9AhUFwjgGHWxAARIQBSgAegQIDRAB)  ass ideologies. Then they complain ""where are all the good men"". Excuse me, but ^(what?)

* Common, (especially the go-getter) Women who at the drop of a hat,  fall back on their own beliefs to get in with the seemingly all-powerful (attractive) extremist  Feminists, whenever they feel like it! Whose opinion is summed up as #killallmen. These gross generalizations and sly agendas (regardless of credibility) held by tight extremist feminists fuels our constant inability to calm down in the face of adversity, Problematic for all men and women. Does not encourage casual talking or casual thinking. It enables the flight or fight response, the wrong nervous system is triggered by these heated, one-sided people with a constant chip on their shoulder. and the conversation never amounts to anything good whatsoever but manically pissing everyone  off, making hostile and closed-off minds hardened time after time.
* ***When you put the value of gynocentrism above men, you end up with more Neets and more demand for materialistic women to fill the void, not less.***  Thats' exactly what we're seeing when you take off the blinders. Extremism is doing no favors for feminists either.

Not a feminist. Why is it called feminist, instead of humanist? **Riddle me this**

Now about porn. It's simple. Women are waving their genitals (figuratively? literally!) around in the street but not giving any to 80% of the men so men have to invent more porn to get off. Frigid Feminist Culture encourages porn to get more degrading. It's simple.  When something poses resistance, you have to find another more complex way to let it go. If there's no resistance then there's no need for more porn. If extreme feminists were all killed off tomorrow, the culture would move back in the right direction, slowly. Not hating the extremists feminists themselves, just stating facts. They don't know what they're doing to men."

in the best cases, you might fly a flag that represents your ideals, there are lots of those. they make some sense but even then it is the epitome of virtue signaling. that is to say that flying such a flag does nothing to support that cause, it simply associates you with that cause with almost zero effort or support.

lastly, flying a flag is loud. it is screaming to the world that you are your association and it makes me not want to associate with you even if i like the cause or government but especially if i don't like the cause or government.

now, when i see people flying various flags i cannot help but think that they are people that i just don't want to be around.

pretty much the only thing i like about flags now is the challenge of creating an attractive flag that does a good job of representing a region or idea (assuming a flag can even do that). after i have created the flag i feel icky for having wasted my time. 

in order for me to accept challenges to my view, i must preemptively admit that i could be looking at this wrong and that if i am looking at this wrong it would be better for me to know. 

be kind."

You can only claim national identity if you were born in that country, or are the first generation born to natives of that country.

Too many people (especially in America) try to claim a nationality or national identity based on their tenuous descent from that nationality: if it has been two or more generations since your antecedents were born in Ireland, then you are not Irish. Otherwise, I may as well claim that I’m a Native American, as my great great great grandfather was an Arapaho who performed in Buffalo Bill’s Rough Riders show; or that I am Danish because my mother’s family come from west Scotland, and are descended from Viking settlers.

**Edit**: So, the main view seems to be that saying ‘I am Irish’ is seen as a shorthand for ‘I have Irish heritage and partial ethnicity’. I get that it’s easier to say, but to British and Irish ears, the former is a direct statement taken at face value.

**Edit 2**: A *lot* of responses here boils down to the idea that, somehow, American English language conventions are more correct and more important than actual English language conventions. See edit above for clarification.

**Edit 3**: I will concede that if you have a direct line of Irish ancestry, it is acceptable to refer to yourself as Irish. My initial point about tenuous connections stands, however."

Megamind is one of my favorite movies of all time, and over many rewatches, I’ve cultivated the opinion in the title. I can’t really blame Megamind for lying to Roxanne like he did. A few reasons come to mind:

1. He originally didn’t intend to lie. He pretended to be someone else to covertly blow up the Metroman statue, and ended up rolling with it when he bonded with Roxanne. If he had set out with the intention of getting Roxanne to fall in love with him, that would change my view. 

2. He was right when he said that his blue skin and distinctive appearance would ruin his romantic chances. To me, what Megamind did isn’t much morally different than someone getting plastic surgery and not revealing that history to suitors. I don’t think that’s wrong to do, either.

3. Roxanne (nor anyone else) wouldn’t have bothered to learn what Megamind’s past and true personality were like if they knew they were talking to Megamind (based on his actions of, you know, taking over the city).

I think Megamind was well and truly trapped by his exterior and his persona as “the villain,” and the only way to escape it was to lie about who he was. If you feel differently, please share your thoughts :)

Things that will most likely change my view, though, are going to be evidence against points 1, 2, and 3, though."

To which Gordon answered 'Yes, absolutly . Chef's have a responsibility to do so.'

I don't see why this is the case. Food is food. Just because a culture far away from you came up with a certain kind of food doesn't mean that I owe it to that culture or those people to understand anything, or even respect anything about them.

Much of our modern mathematics is based on thinkers from the Golden Age of Islam, who's work was taken from the greeks, and then would go on to influence later mathematicians. But I sure as heck do not need, nor would anyone say that I am obligated to learn Islamic or Arabic history, learn anything about the Islamic religion, learn any arabic, or even know the names of the specific mathematics who's techniques I'm learning.

I mean sure I know the name Pythagoras, but I couldn't tell you anything about him beyond that he was Greek and probably a pagan. And he's the *only* one who's name I even know. There are probably hundreds of other mathematicians who's work informed what I was taught in school, and I don't need to know about any of them.

Why should food be any different? Why would I need to give a crap about anything regarding Thai history/culture to realize that orange, spice, and cashews are a fantastic combo? Why would I need to learn anything about Italy to appreciate a good pasta and red wine?

I'm not saying it's *bad* to know these things of course. A richer understanding of history and the world around you is a good thing in and of itself. But it's not any kind of *obligation*. So I don't see a problem with a chef cooking 'authentic' cuisines and having zero interest in learning about that part of the world."

It all feels like it's been always given to you. Some people claim that you should not be proud of your Nationality, Gender, Parent's wealth, or whatever. I'd argue that being proud of your own accomplishments such as climbing Mt. Everest, shredding an awesome guitar solo, getting the boy/girl you always wanted, winning the Nobel prize, etc. also lies in being given to you.

People are always born into something/ someone. Not everyone will be born with a sharp mind, healthy body,  a nurturing environment, etc. Just by looking at people, some can be jacked, lift weights, etc. If people are so different in just muscles, how different must they be in minuscule neurons and whatnot in their brains?

This seems more philosophical than it is practical but oh well, have more humility and humbleness I guess. Also, I am referring to 'Pride' and 'Proud' that people seem to throw around all the time, not more of the content, happy with something kind.  


Edit: Looks like I really should have gotten more into philosophy and posted this in r/philosophy. And, I fully agree that people should be happy with their accomplishments, their life choices, ethics, enjoying their thoughts, believing in something, etc. Whether or that that is called Pride, I don't know.

22,2023-03-17,"CMV: The Sonic Adventure games, while admittedly fun, are vastly overrated.",u/HalfofaDwarf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11tztzm/cmv_the_sonic_adventure_games_while_admittedly/,changemyview,"I semi-recently replayed the sonic adventure games. I played the first on a whim by myself, and played most of the second in a Discord call with my friends. I had fun, we all had fun, and that was mostly it. I say semi-recently because this was about a year ago, but the SA games recently came up in a discussion I was having.

I'm not really a Sonic die-hard; I owned the first game when I was younger, handed down from one relative or another, and it was fun if a tad frustrating (I didn't really mesh with the speed and it led to it feeling like trial and error). It's important to know that, because I really, genuinely had no idea the Sonic Adventure games were held up so highly within the fanbase.

And in all honesty.. I simply do not get it. Are they fun? Sure, I'll give you that. But, if I'm being entirely honest, I can't rate them much higher than 'okay'. They aren't particularly challenging, they're graphically competent, and they have good music - the gameplay forms are, well a mixed bag.

The Sonic segments are probably the highlight, but even then they never really escape from what I feel has always been a Sonic problem - in my limited experience - of being wonky to control outside of the scripted 'go fast' sections.

My enjoyment hits a snag there, though, because I don't think the Tails/Eggman or Rouge/Knuckles segments would have been all that enjoyable if I didn't have the ability to quickly look up a guide. Controlling Rouge or Knuckles is an exercise in frustration through fairly uninteresting locals.

The Tails and Eggman sequences are easily my least favourite parts of the games. To be blunt, I think anyone praising them has serious nostalgia blindness. They're pathetically easy, too long for how uninteresting they are, and I'm pretty sure they gave me tinnitus or something.

I won't mention the story much here, as it was not really of interest to me, nor were the characters all that much; it wasn't really what I decided to pick them up for at the time. That said, I found most of the characters fairly annoying and by the time I was done, they were getting on my nerves, Sonic especially. 

I'll totally jam to the music from these games any day, but I don't really see what makes people hold these games up as classic examples of the Sonic games franchise, and I feel like I'm missing something others didn't."

I definitely haven't consumed all books, TV shows, and movies out there, but at least of all those that I have seen and read, The One has the best ending for its hero and villain.

For anyone who hasn't seen The One, the hero and villain are both played by Jet Li.  The villain seeks to kill the last version of himself in the multiverse in order to become all powerful.  The hero starts out not even knowing the multiverse exists, but ends up needing to survive against his other-self.  Both characters are incredibly powerful already because the strength of all their alternate selves the villain killed have been poured into them.

In the midst of the fighting between the two, the hero loses his wife.

Normally in a movie like this, there is a winner and a loser, and in some ways there is here too, but with a twist.  The hero gets sent to a new universe where he appears in a very idealized version of Los Angeles which has clean streets, nice people, and most importantly for the hero, a different version of his wife which he meets at the end, presumably to live happily ever after with.  The villain is sent to a penal colony in a very gloomy and dark world.  At the center of the area is a temple which seems to be the place the strongest criminals occupy the top of.  As the movie comes to a close it shows the unnaturally strong villain character making his claim to the top of the temple as he fights the other inmates while the track ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach plays.

I've never walked away from a show or book thinking that if it continued on that we'd see both the hero and villain living their best lives, but I felt that way as this movie faded to black.  I believe that this is the best ending for a hero and villain duo in any entertainment media, but I'm interested in seeing if anyone can change my view :)"

He keeps a cafeteria style lunch tray in his office. Nearly every day at around noon, he set his lunch out on his tray, takes it into the bathroom, goes into one of the stalls, and does his business/eats lunch over the course of a half hour or so.

I can see under the stall that he has his pants down too, so it's not like he's just sitting in the stall for isolation purposes (which would still be gross, in my opinion).

This is not any sort of personal vendetta and I don't hate the guy. In fact, I otherwise like him. He is good at his job and always does his fair share of the work. In general, he comes across as a kind and generous person.But this habit of his is just plain disgusting.

Eating food in the bathroom is disgusting. I could make a few small exceptions for cases where you already had a piece of hard candy (like a jolly rancher) in your mouth before walking in or something like that, but taking an actual meal in with you and eating while sitting on the toilet is unsanitary and unappetizing."

The sleeper cars are often built from scratch so to speak from very cheap cars.

There have been two times where there have been significant car wrecks during the races because powerful cars lost traction and spun out. One of the wrecks, an electric Datsun lost traction, spun out and crashed into a Mazda RX2, both rare cars. The other wreck a Foxbody Mustang spun out and nearly clipped several other cars before coming to a stop at the edge of the airport strip they were racing on.

If the drag races took place on a quarter mile drag strip that allowed some minor prep work to the track, the conditions would be safer and the chance of cars spinning out and wrecking could be reduced."

I only saw my friends experiencing it. At the same time, my mom never complained about dad's salary which was common in some of my friends family. The toxicity I have experienced is mostly outside

a. Difficult men : I work in IT where majority of the power positions are held by men. So most toxicity I have experienced are from men, met men shaming women who wants to have a career, men who think adult women who are groomed should not be protected by law.

b. Difficult Women : Women who wants to spend all the money on expensive stuffs while they don't contribute much to the family, women who spread hatred against other women, women who always criticize their partner, women who think all men out there are waiting to get them.

\[#2\] When I analyze these people, most are not one dimensional. Some have unchecked bias about one specific thing because it has not been challenged or some other views that is stopping them to see reality. Very rarely they are 360 degree toxic. These are really smaller percentages. say 10/100 people. People who are very close to me over time have changed their views when challenged with some data and given time.

When I come on the internet internet, I see comments that are so one dimensional and it is in larger number. One hating the other gender. And sometimes when I check their accounts, they have dedicated months and sometimes years commenting extremist views. 

So here I am, change my view.

1) Sex refers to the biological attributes of a person.  While typically XY and XX, you can have stuff like Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), SRY transposition, androgen insensitivity, and other items that create - biologically - a variety of possibilities as to what one’s sex is beyond male/female.

2) Gender is a social - not an individual - construct and is how society (not the individual) classifies a person in relation to sexual differences between people.  Gender definitions can vary from society to society and time period to time period.

Where people get mixed up is believing that their individual gender identification has a bearing on how society constructs their gender.  It is asserted frequently that it does (see various definitions online that assert gender identity has a bearing on gender), but there is scant evidence that society agrees.  Recent polling, from Pew back in 2022 shows that an overwhelming and increasing majority of Americans (60 vs 38 percent) say that whether a person is a man or a woman is determined by what is assigned at birth as opposed to something that can be changed later.

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/

So what is the implication?  If society does not believe one can change being a man or a woman from what you are assigned at birth that means the society views gender as immutable and also as independent of one’s gender identity.  Moreover, it is some indication that society views gender as binary or at most binary with a neuter option.  And if sex is more complicated than three options and gender is at most three options with it likely being just binary then you end up with the following:

Unless society recognizes a neuter option: gender is what you are assigned at birth and is narrower than your sex.

To change my view on this I would need to see evidence through polling that a society in question currently regards gender as determined at least in part by self-identification.  Legal fictions and dictionary definitions that were created without examining the social construct do not count in my eyes."

I imagine the same thing will happen to banks eventually, instead of having lots of different banks they will all share a building and, you, would, be able to visit different areas of the building to access different banks, and although people might think that it’s strange I imagine people had similar reservations about the supermarket before it became as popular as it did."

I am from eastern Ukraine (the type of Donbas that was occupied in 2014), and also I have a an uncommon brain type and used to have a lot of physical health problems as a child which made raising me exhausting resourcewise and difficult. I think these are things affecting my judgement.

So, the collision I'm experiencing is that now I live in one of the most developed and peaceful countries on the planet. And my therapists are doing something that's very confusing with my ""civilian reentry"", for the lack of a better word, they're teaching me all these soft unicorn fluffy values of ""kindness"", ""compassion"", ""empathy"". Like I'm not an asshole or a lowlife, i just... feel something about these words that is the reason why i'm posting here.

So my opinion is that kindness, compassion, etc. actually the reason why societies fall instead of thriving. Consider basic values like freedom of speech, democracy, pretty much everything you cherish. And they exist because humans are evil by nature. Term limits, freedom of speech laws and amendments, power checks and balances exist exactly because humans are by nature tyrannical and evil, and checks need to exist because of that. 

And on the contrary, tyranny rises because people are politically inept and don't do anything, or equally bad, enjoy the new government because it favors them. And prety much positive news story these days is ""homeless guy works 4294967296 hours a millisecond to help his cancer girlfriend who is drowning in student loan debt"".

I think kindness, compassion, and empathy actually bear a little resemblance to communism. Every time people try to build a society off of them, it falls apart because that's simply not realistic, and then advocates for kindness mop it up by saying ""That wasn't *real* kindness!""... Besides, was it kindness that freed minorities from oppression? No. Only armed resistance."

The aim of the attack is to provoke the empire into an overreaction they cannot sustain, which would lead to an increase in resistance, cause the empire to over-extend itself, and ultimately bring about its collapse. This is pretty much exactly what Bin Laden wanted to achieve with 9/11. Additionally, both attacks were made possible by imperial complacency and repeating them immediately became impossible as the empire and the US cracked down with  additional security measures.

The analogy would not be entirely unprecedented either, since the original Star Wars was directly inspired by the Vietnam war (with the US being the empire and the rebels the Viet Cong).

There  are differences in that Aldhani did not have a significant civilian death toll, and in the ideologies of the rebel groups and their origins, but the fundamental aims and effects of both events are too similar to be coincidental."

https://nypost.com/2018/10/17/harvards-gatekeeper-reveals-sat-cutoff-scores-based-on-race/

First, let me say it's just my initial opinion.
I am not American, so I was surprised when I heard of it.
I don't think I have ever seen a double standard worse than this idea.
It divides people into race groups by definition (and race is just a fake generalization we invented &amp; should be ignored, use social status or living areas instead if you want more fairness).

Look, one of the proposed definitions of racism is:
""of, relating to, or characterized by the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another.""

Now, I see that diversity is celebrated in the USA, which is great, but I feel like people who think they understand why it's ok to give some groups an advantage or disadvantage in acceptance based on race, just spit things they read on Instagram and have no idea what racism is, which makes me perceive them as ignorant people who should not be taken seriously. 

Moreover, I am convinced this population (of people which I perceive as lacking critical thinking, i.e. celebrate diversity but encourage racism) can get brainwashed to be racist on more significant occasions, if it would come using the right politically correct terms, with the right delivery, from the right celebrity. Basically, a herd of sheep.

If you think this way of enforcing diversity is acceptable, please change my view. I might be unaware of some ideas."

12,2023-03-18,CMV: The best voting system is ranked choice with a condorcet selection and runoff,u/ee_anon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11uvizi/cmv_the_best_voting_system_is_ranked_choice_with/,changemyview,"This topic comes up a lot in this sub, but I can't find any specifically suggesting this idea so please give it a shot.

First I want to immediately address a big misconception. **Ranked choice voting and instant runoff are not the same thing**. Ranked choice is any system where the voter ranks the candidates on the ballot in order of preference. At this point, there are multiple ways of determining who is the winner based on the ranked ballots. Instant runoff is just one method. There are many others. Usually when this topic comes up, people are suggesting a ranked choice ballot and an instant runoff (I'll refer to this as RC+IRV) method for counting the ballots. That is not exactly what I am suggesting.

The main problem with RC+IRV is that it can fail to select the condorcet winner. The condorcet winner is the one who who win a heads up contest between any of the other candidates. Not all contests will produce a condorcet winner (think rock-paper-scissors; no clear winner) but if there is a condorcet winner, they should be the overall winner.

Approval voting and STAR voting are often suggested as alternatives to RC+IRV. I don't think these are good alternatives. My view is that there are 3 critically important criteria we should look for in a voting system:

1. It should select the condorcet winner (if one exists)
2. It should make the voter feel that their ballot accurately reflects their opinions
3. The selection of the winner should be simple and straightforward, so that the election feels fair

Ranked choice ballots exemplify the second criterion. Ranking candidates sends a clear signal. RC+IRV however fails the first criterion.

Approval voting fails the second. Say the voter is faced with a candidate they like, a few candidates that they'd tolerate, and a candidate they hate. They must decide whether to vote for only the candidate they like (in which case, you are no better off than with FPTP), or vote for all but the candidate you hate (in which case you essentially get a bunch of negative ballots). This completely fails to capture information about who voters actually want.

STAR is an interesting one, but I think it fails the third criteria. Say a voter somewhat likes a candidate. Do they score them a 3 or a 4? What are the implications of that choice? It is too complicated.

I suppose a new method. If this exact idea has been proposed/debated before, please send me links.

Voters cast ranked choice ballots. The ballots are tallied, and if a condorcet winner exists, they win! If no condorcet winner exists, (much like in a traditional IRV) the candidate with the fewest first place votes is removed and their votes transferred to the second choice of the ballots. Then repeat the process. If there is a condorcet winner amongst the remaining candidates, they win! And so on.

This addresses the condorcet problem of traditional RC+IRV, while retaining the expressiveness of ranked ballots. It also does not require cryptic equations/processes to determine the winner. What do you think?"

Growing up in a purple (politically mixed) area in the 90s, there were some vicious debates around gay marriage. I found the right wing position deplorable. I also think everyone was missing the point. My takeaway was: why do ANY of us need to ask the Man for permission? 

I’m 37m, straight, cisgendered and now married. USA. I say this to acknowledge that no one has ever tried to limit my ability to get married, so I’m missing this perspective. My much younger brother is soon to be married to his long time bf. In a liberal state, there haven’t been any issues. I can see how I might be missing the fact that validation from the State might be important to a gay couple given a long history of (and current) discrimination. I can empathize with the value of the symbolism, but still believe personal relationships never should have been within the government’s purview. I’m sure there are other arguments out there for government involvement. I’m not aware of them; hence, my post. 

Anticipating counter-arguments: One could claim that stable family systems (marriage) are good for society, and therefore should be encouraged through tax structures. I can follow this line of thinking to a point. However, I am skeptical that the government is tangibly altering the nature of relationships through tax incentives. My wife and I have been married 15 years precisely for tax reasons. But we’d still be sitting here in the same dedicated relationship, in the same home, with the same number of kids, than if the government didn’t push us into signing papers. 

I am against state-sanctioned gay marriage in the same way I am against state-sanctioned straight marriage. I fail to understand why I had to go pay X amount as a fee for some bureaucrat to stamp his approval on my relationship. It’s nice for taxes, but it seems silly to pay less because the Man likes my relationship choices. It seems silly they have thoughts of any kind. 

I feel very strongly that it is not the role of government to define “marriage”, and sanction individual relationships. This conclusion feels simple to me. But most issues are complex; my level of conviction is probably a sign that I am missing a lot. 

What am I missing? Please CMV.

Edit: So, the very good counterarguments boil down to: A) Monogamous relationships are the norm in my country (USA, in my case Latino immigrant). B) Why not codify and automate the benefits that go along with that? (Survivorship, power of attorney, tax structures, etc.)

Edit 2: My counterpoint is that anyone should be able to enter whatever legal contract they want. Yes, the government as a 3rd party will need to enforce those contracts, as they do any other. Does it matter if the parties involved are “in love”, or monogamous, or plan to have kids, or whatever?

*View changed. The logical conclusion to my original argument is just more complicated paperwork."

Thank you to everyone who commented, you all contributed to me better understanding the problems surrounding these types of issues. Thank you.

First off, I believe that all humans are equal, but shaped by their environment. I'm not conservative, and I acknowledge that some races in general have it easier than others. I understand the history and generational oppression that lead to people feeling the way they do, and those feelings and experiences are valid.

That being said, to diminish anothers because they were born into a ""privileged"" race is not okay either. The color of someone's skin is just one incredibly small aspect about someone, it shouldn't even be important enough to mention. Even if someone has a ""privileged"" skin color, you have absolutely no idea what other adversity that individual has faced. Maybe they were abused, maybe they lost a parent early on. Perhaps they have a chronic illness, or maybe they're neurodivergent. They may have come from poverty, It's possible that they were raised by parents of a different ethnicity and have a very different culture than you might assume. With so many unknowns, you're really just making an assumption about someone based on the color of their skin, racism. 

I never talk about skin color with any of my friends who have a different ethnicity, because it really just doesn't matter. I'm not friends with them because of their skin color, I'm friends with them because they're cool people and I like their company. It's completely irrelevant to the person they choose to be, and that applies to every ethnicity."

The failure of episode 7 is that it tries to tell the same story as a new hope, but fails to maintain the same quality. Finn would fix this in 2 ways

1) it would make more sense for him to be the one kicking ass, as that's his job, whereas Rey is just a scrapper with no real combat experience or training

2) by focusing on someone who used to be the bad guy, it creates a subversion of the original story, gives more meaning to combat as there will be a greater emphasis on Finn's betrayal of his old friends, and better sets up the redemption arc of Kylo Ren

I don't intend to mean that this would fix all the problems with the story, as I still take issue with Kylo being a whiny rageaholic (which completely undermines his intimidation value instantly), but it would make for a much better story. 

Just going to address the recurring concern: Yes, I know that Finn was in waste disposal, but the first order seems to possess the mentality that all Stormtroopers are riflemen, which means that he would be trained in a minimum of systems, in this scenario a blaster, a pistol, and an electroprod, which would give him a training advantage over Ray, who at best is an experienced street fighter which does not translate well to being able to routinely kick professional soldier's ass' and fight an experienced knight of Ren to a standstill.

It is commonly accepted in literature that if somebody has an ability it has to be established why they have that ability. Anakin was a skilled pilot because he grew up participating in pod races, which in conjunction with his latent force powers, established he had the ability to subconsciously use, translated well to him being able to fly a fighter after performing some test maneuvers. It makes sense for Luke to be a skilled fighter because he was trained by multiple Jedi Masters, grew up in gang territory, and routinely Had to fight off Tuscan raiders. George Lucas even went out of his way to explain that Luke had an above average ability to hit precise targets, though he at best subtly implies that he practiced flying behind Uncle Owen's back with his friends. 

We can see that the writers aren't incapable of doing this, as ray being a scrapper very effectively communicates that she has experience with electrical and mechanical parts, and therefore would have some knowledge of how they go together and more importantly how to tear them apart, So scenes where she's fixing shit, which would probably be more prevalent to maintain her importance to the film, Make a large degree of sense. What doesn't make sense our scenes where she's whooping professional soldiers and space wizard monks asses while simultaneously manifesting advanced force powers. It has previously been established that the most an untrained user can do is make short glimpses into the future and subtly manipulate objects, So her ability to do things like read Kylo ren's mind makes no sense."

It is an adult's choice whether or not to emigrate and to which country they want to emigrate.

Therefore,  people who immigrate to country A from foreign countries should love  country A more than those who were born in country A.

People  born in country A who do not love country A are more justified and  rational than those who immigrated to country A from a foreign country  but do not love country A.

After  all, one's place of birth is completely random (God's choice), whereas  one's destination for migration is one's own choice.

I  suggest that all countries in the world should legislate that if an  immigrant naturalized citizen commits a crime against national security,  the penalty should be severe. Because if a person does not love a  foreign country, then he should not immigrate to that foreign country,  not immigrate to that foreign country and then cause trouble for that  country.

I also believe that all  countries in the world should provide for the same rights for immigrant  naturalised citizens as for native-born citizens. It is wrong for  countries like the US, Brazil and the Philippines to stipulate that  naturalised immigrant citizens cannot be president.

But that is not enough, because as soon as the underaged ones hit the 18 year age, adults will attempt to hit on them, which the age of consent law cannot protect the now 18 year old people from them. So, there should also be a law implemented, which limits the age gap in general to max 5 years old, to protect young people from old adults.

And please for my sake, do not harass the ones who disagree with me, okay?

154,2023-03-19,CMV: It makes sense to compare apples and oranges,u/Sad_Tourist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11vm3aj/cmv_it_makes_sense_to_compare_apples_and_oranges/,changemyview,"Sometimes, it would not be sensible to make a comparison between two things, because they are too different.

For example, it would not make sense to compare Harry Potter books and lawnmowers, as they are categorically dissimilar in that the criteria for assessing how successful they are at achieving their agreed purpose would be completely different.

* A Harry Potter book is in the category ""book"" and its quality would therefore be judged by properties that pertain to its agreed purpose (to be enjoyed by a reader), like the imaginativeness of the plot and the strength of the characters.
* A lawnmower is in the category ""garden maintenance devices"" and its quality would therefore be judged by properties of its agreed purpose (maintaining gardens), like its efficiency at cutting grass and the longevity of the mechanism.

So it is meaningless to make a comparison between a Harry Potter book and a lawnmower since they are never used to achieve the same outcome and are therefore assessed by an entirely different set of properties.

When somebody commits this type of problem, another person will often accuse them of comparing ""apples and oranges"", suggesting that doing so would contain the same problem as what they said previously.

I don't think this makes sense because apples and oranges are *not* categorically dissimilar. Not only are they in the category of 'food', they are also both in the category of 'fruit'.

The agreed purpose of a fruit is to be eaten and enjoyed. Its success at doing this would be judged by properties like its taste, texture and freshness. It would be entirely sensible for a person to prefer these properties in one fruit to the properties in another, so entirely sensible to compare the two.

Therefore, unlike the problem it attempts to illustrate, it *does* make sense to compare apples and oranges, and the expression fails."

0,2023-03-19,CMV: Abortion is immoral because it is erasing a potential life,u/Late-Sherbet-8703,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11vni4x/cmv_abortion_is_immoral_because_it_is_erasing_a/,changemyview,"To preface, I’m heavily pro-choice in every case. I support fully legalized abortions for any reason, not just in the case of rape, incest, or danger to the fetus or carrier. This is for a few different reasons, I believe nobody should be forced to undergo extreme changes to their body and literally give their sustenance and bones and blood to something they do not want, speaking as a woman it’s horrifying to even imagine that because to me it seems like being forced to sustain a parasite. I believe in full bodily autonomy when it comes to these kinds of medical decisions. I think it is disgusting to force somebody to carry to term against their will. I am also from a country that completely bans abortions, and the statistics for deaths from “homemade” (unlicensed, unsafe) abortions are awful. It is my firm belief that abortion should be accessible regardless of circumstances.

However, I often find the argument that abortion is “murder” because it is erasing a potential life, and while I disagree with the word murder, I can’t convince myself that abortion is not immoral on some level. To be clear, this in no way changes my pro-choice stance, nor will it ever. But I can’t think of an argument against this sort of ideology, and since I can’t disprove it, I find myself agreeing with it.

I only think this applies in cases that aren’t related to rape, incest, danger to either party, etc. This is because in cases of rape/incest, I understand that severe trauma can result from carrying to term, and in the case of unsafe pregnancy, it doesn’t make sense to me to damage or lose both lives when one life (the mother’s) could still be saved. I acknowledge that trauma occurs regardless, but I feel that it is much more severe in some circumstances. Thinking about it now, I’m wondering why exactly I think this. What level of trauma makes taking a potential life okay? I guess it would have to be life ruining trauma as a result of not getting an abortion. I see things as very one to one, a life for a life if that makes sense. I don’t think people who get abortions are immoral, either. I don’t think they should be shamed. Again, I just can’t disprove to myself that abortion itself is immoral because it takes a potential (human) life.

Here are things that I don’t think would change my view:

“The fetus did not consent to being born.” Neither did the entire human species. And since when should children be held responsible for important decisions, let alone ones that can’t even properly think? On this same line of logic,

“The potential life is not worth more than the mother’s suffering.” I agree. That is why I am pro-choice. This does not mean it is moral. Just that is it acceptable and justifiable.

Any variation of “but the kid could grow up and be suicidal/wish they weren’t alive and hadn’t been born.” Most people are not suicidal.

“But raising children is xyz.” I’m not advocating for the mother to raise the kid. Adoption is an option, as horrible as the foster care system is.

“But the foster care system is xyz.” I know. But I believe a less than ideal life is better than no shot at life in the first place. 

“You can’t be pro-choice is you think abortion is immoral.” I disagree. I am firmly pro abortion access, that will not change.

Something I think could change my view is examples of other procedures that remove a potential human life (for reasons other than the safety of the carrier). Other than that, I don’t know. If I could change my own view, I would. I don’t like having this opinion. Let me know if clarification is required or if this is a rule breaking post.

Edited to add clarification: I do not believe human life begins at conception. Or at heartbeat. Or at any of those miscellaneous milestones. My view is strictly about the future potential for life.

Edit 2: My views have changed pretty significantly! I’d appreciate if new commenters would read the delta log before commenting, I don’t want to try and defend/argue in favor of something I no longer believe. But I’m very much open to questions about why I believed that, as long as there is acknowledgment that I no longer think that way"
0,2023-03-19,CMV: Asian Americans generally prospering in the United States is not an indicator that African Americans should/can also prosper.,u/RchxNiika,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11vnmrg/cmv_asian_americans_generally_prospering_in_the/,changemyview,"Due to strategic atrocities legalized by United States government officials against blacks from the inception of this country until the late 1900s (probably even more recent), black Americans have always had a worse standard of living than white Americans, and the average non-black American. At no point in the history of this country has the average black baby been born to the same wealth or advantages (school funding, low crime community, etc…) as the average white baby. In conclusion, black Americans generally are an impoverished demographic in the United States, and generally always have been. Most are already aware of this, so I won’t touch on it any further.  

Asian Americans on the other hand, for starters, most were not born in the United States (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/21/us/asians-census-us.html). 60-70% of Asian Americans are foreign born. Statistics show that legally immigrating here to the United States is a moderately long process, and that most of those that follow through with this process are already highly educated from the countries that they come from. About 47% of all legal immigrants are educated with at least a bachelors degree (https://www.courthousenews.com/almost-half-of-recent-us-immigrants-had-college-degrees/). I don’t have the link, but I’ve read this is even higher for Asian immigrants which is 55%. If I find the link I’ll edit it in here.

Most Asian-Americans are immigrants that come to the United States already extremely educated, and/or experienced in high paying fields, but come here for better opportunities in said fields. I believe these facts are also why foreign born Americans of other races also out perform mostly all native born Americans. About 36% of native born Americans have a bachelors degree or higher. This number dramatically decreases if we’re talking about African Americans, which is 14%.

Comparing both cultures would be similar to many black American engineers, doctors, lawyers, scientists, tech professionals, etc moving to another country, then comparing their success to the most impoverished demographic of the country this community immigrated to. 

As I stated before, we all know the history that Black Americans have in the United States. So I believe comparing black Americans and their culture with Asian Americans and their culture is dishonest. Black Americans and Asian Americans have completely different circumstances and backgrounds here in the U.S, and generally comparing the two is disingenuous.

0,2023-03-19,Cmv: Dating is generally far easier for women than it is for men.,u/Actual_Parsnip4707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11vogro/cmv_dating_is_generally_far_easier_for_women_than/,changemyview,"When if comes to dating, men pretty much have to do all the dirty work. Men are expected to make the first move, take her out on a date, pick a nice spot, have good social skills to carry the conversation, pay for the date, be financially stable enough to provide for his woman to an extent, be a certain height and so on. I would argue that women don't have to put nearly as much work when it comes to dating and relationships than men. All a girl pretty much has to do is look decent, which men find the majority of women physically attractive enough to want to commit to them where as the same cannot be said the other way around. 
There was a study done that over 60% of young men in their 20s are single where as it's only 33% for younger women. Why is this? Well it goes back to my original point that Women have dating on easy mode compared to men. Women have far more dating options than men especially younger ones. Now as women get older yes it's not nearly as easy because men are mainly attracted to beauty and aesthetics but I would then say women blew their chance of securing a guy when they were in their 20s. Part of that reason is because this generation of women are more career oriented so dating and relationships aren't as high on the priority list as previous generations. That's why when women hit 30 to 40 they might struggle to find a longtime partner because the man they want, wants the younger 25 year old woman. 
Also I would say that men are far more easier to please in a relationship than women. Women often say they want someone who's 6ft or above, makes a high salary, and have all these charecteristics that only few men have. Where as men all they typically want is a woman who looks good and is easy to connect with personally.
So the traits &amp; qualities that women find attractive in men are less common in men than the traits &amp; qualities in women that men find attractive. 
So all in all I think dating women have it on easy mode compared to men. Like I said before men have to do all the dirty work when it comes to approaching, handling rejection, paying for dates, being stable financially, having good charisma and so on. Men have to build themselves up in life if they want to attract women where as women they can attract men right off the bat with no effort because of their looks. I'm open to having my mind changed."

Usually they want it because of the traditional atmosphere or aesthetic of the structure itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find this profoundly disrespectful; on one level due to the sheer entitlement(you can be an eligible Catholic and still get turned down), but on another due to what would either have to be deliberate ignorance or flagrant disregard for Catholic views regarding marriage. It's *not* the same as a courthouse marriage, or even how most other religions view marriage. It's a sacrament, equivalent in gravity to taking communion(which is also generally withheld from random people, even current parishioners in a state of grave sin). If you're not planning on making an unbreakable union before God where the flourishing of life is just as important as the partnership, you don't need a Catholic wedding and you should understand why the Church is not interested in entertaining your interpretation of marriage.

Characters like Dream (played by Clay) are probably more similar to some halfway adjacent fictional character than the person who is role-playing. Sure, the character shares a decent amount of their mannerisms, but this is no different from when an author takes inspiration from their own personality to create a character. I can create more concrete points, but I will start by specifically defending two points. First, Dream (the character in the Dream SMP) is more similar to Voldemort (the character) than Clay (the person), and second, there is no reason to treat Dream differently from a purely fictional entity.

I’m not entirely sure ￼what percent of situations this applies in, but in any cases where there is a similar amount of fictional circumstances or character traits as the Dream SMP, these charters should be considered purely fictional characters.

Context: Dream is the server owner and desires to control the other characters and be in power. In the lore, he is highly capable, controlling, and egotistical. To this end, he is the main antagonist. Some actions include waging war when Wilbur tries to establish an independent nation, isolating and psychologically manipulating a child, blowing up a country when they didn’t cave to his demands, ect.

Edit: I know that this is not deep and most people view this content as stupid (I’m not arguing about that) my viewpoint is about discusses if role-plays should be treated as fictional entities or as extensions of the person.

To me, they are all simply eating disorders and that's how they should be treated. Whether someone eats too much or too little shouldn't be the dividing line and neither should be socially acceptable.

**I am not saying anyone should be shamed, or deserves ridicule but we also shouldn't be forced to accept their lifestyle as acceptable.**

If we are going to push a ""fat acceptance"" movement then we should also be pushing a ""skinny acceptance"" movement.

What won't change my view is claiming one is less healthy than the other, or the survivability of one or the other being longer. Nor the reasons behind them such as sadness, a desire to be petty or fit in. (possibly, I'm not trying to be absolute about that as I'm sure there are views or reasons that could change my mind.) Something else that won't change my view is something like a glandular issue, obesity due to medication or something else uncontrollable by the person experiencing it such as having to eat poor quality food due to poverty. I'm simply talking about people who eat too much or too little while also refusing to do anything about it such as exercise or change their diet habits.

To me, an eating disorder is an eating disorder and shouldn't be celebrated. They are making a personal choice that is detrimental to their health.

I'm not sure what would change my view, that's why I'm asking for you to do it for me.

Edit: I don't wanna say my view has been changed on this matter but my argument has been defeated because I was using the wrong terminology to define my argument. Instead of using words like ""anorexia"" and ""obese"" I really should have used ""too fat"" and ""too skinny"" to avoid the mental disorders associated with them or at least mentioned that mental disorders as well as the results of medications, aren't what I'm trying to argue about but at that point I feel like I would be splitting hairs and just sounding like I can't have my view changed.

--

I sadly don't have many people in my circle that belong to the Queer-Community. So, I can't simply ask them for their opinion and need your viewpoint. Maybe I'm wrong, so I ask you to maybe corrext me and change my view.

The term ""LGBTQIA+"" originally stemmed from ""only"" LGBT, where some gay or trans people joined a community to unite each other.
Then, over the years, more and more orientations and identities joined.
Now, it's basically everyone who is not cis-straight, and even they get a place.

I am asexual and biromantic, and therefore also belong to this community. Sadly, even the ""A"" often doesn't include us and is viewed as ""Allies"", not Agender, Asexual or Aromantic.

Looking into the future, there will propably even be more letters in the term.
When will it end? It already is super hard to pronounce and outdated.
Can't we just use ""rainbow""-community/ people?

Or do I misunderstand something here? I don't want to sound rude.

Edit: thank you all for your great answers! Especially some of them really changed my view. I will now refer this community as ""Queer"" in said and ""LGBTQ+"" or the longer term in written language, as I now understand why this is important.

I sadly grew up very right wing and never had queer people in my circle. I really want to change myself for the better, and this is one step more to do that.

So, my issue is that people will villainize you, just because you do not feel bad for an innocent person, but in my opinion, you should just not be forced to feel empathy for those who are innocent and suffering.

There's a lot of brew-ha-ha in the art community about the use of AI art in place of commissioning actual artists to create art for you. Lately, there's been an infographic floating around in certain circles regarding a technique to take sketches you commission from artists and then use various AI artistic tools to create backgrounds and blend/shade flat colours applied via tools like Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.

Now, I understand that in this particular case, there is a legal framework regarding ownership of the piece of art in question - who owns the finished product from a paid commission to an artist? The Artist, or the Commissioner? And as such, who has the right to decide what can and cannot be done to the piece upon receipt of the finished product? Artists argue, and not unreasonably I don't think, that it allows commissioners to short-change them by buying a cheaper product and then 'upscaling' it themselves using AI-based tools. The same could be argued about you simply colouring a picture yourself upon receipt of a black-and-white sketch or line art drawing but that doesn't seem to draw nearly the same ire.

What seems to be critical to the arguments that I see online is that AI makes it 'too easy' to create art and undermines the years of practice that skilled artists put into their craft. However, how is that different from comparing a landscape painter to a photographer? Granted, both require a certain level of skill but it's fair to say that the skills involved are different - choosing the right lenses for a camera vs the right pigments and paints for a painter. But I equally think it's fair to say that photography makes it MUCH easier to get pictures of landscapes and other scenes. Similarly, look at theatre versus television - a stage actor is required to perform live at every performance and doesn't get the benefit of multiple takes to get things right. It goes as it goes on the night and so you have to be skilled enough to roll with mistakes or simply not make them in the first place. Television and film actors on the other hand can rely on editing and retakes in order to get their scenes just right for the one time it needs to be shot and recorded.

Regardless of this, both stage and screen acting, as well as painting and photography exist perfectly well together in the modern artistic scene. Why is the same not true with AI art? Why does it seem as though people are willing to accept that the two can exist together and, in some ways, can be used to support each other? Absolutely there are ways that AI art can be misused, the same is true with any new innovation or technology. There are legal questions about how these models are trained and whether the developers have the rights to use the art they feed into their models but that falls on the developers of these tools and not the tools themselves. Is there some fundamental issue or concern from artists that I'm missing here? Because to my mind, it feels as though being concerned about how 'easy' it is to make AI art feels as though people are lacking in confidence in their own skills in that they feel they can be outcompeted by a program that can only do what it's been taught to and cannot innovate in the way a human can."

Diseases like these are a massive burden on the families of children with these disorders, and it would prevent massive amounts of stress, anxiety, and financial problems if less people were born with them.

I've heard the argument that something like this would be wrong because all kinds of people contribute to the world in their own way, but I really don't see how this is the case for someone born with downsyndrome, crippling arthritis, or some other permanent and severe disability. 

Would it not be better for everyone, including the would be disabled, if they were born fully healthy and able, not having to deal with an enormous amount of unnecessary suffering?

I've made this argument before and been accused of being in support of eugenics, but I think that's unfair considering no one is being killed, people are just being made more healthy and able.
Change my view?

Edit: I'm not arguing we impose this on soon to be parents, just that it wouldn't be wrong for the would be parents to make this decision on their own.

I don't mean to imply people with disabilities can contribute nothing to the world, just that they could lead happier and all around better lives if they could be cured of their disability."

Suddenly, a person in the chat judged me and called me a rich privileged person as an insult! My view is so what? One does not have to feel guilty, remorse, regret or make up for their life circumstances (especially privileges). Or should they, what do you guys think? 

To expand further, people know I’m not a fan of certain “economic groups”. And one reason is because they’re judging people for what are, in my view, unjustifiable reasons. Just because I’m not an activist or participate in their prioritized topics…doesn’t mean they should call others privileged.

But the way I it there are 5 main reasons that owning a wild animal as a pet is usually a bad thing, and none of them apply to opossums.  


1.) Many wild animals are dangerous.  


Opossums aren't very dangerous. That's not to say they couldn't hurt someone. But they're certainly less dangerous to humans and pets than a medium sized dog is.  


2.) The average person isn't qualified to take care of them.  


While it's true taking care of a opossum would be more work than a cat (especially since they generally can't be litter trained) I don't think it would be worse than other higher maintenance pets that are legal.  


This isn't ""Opossums are the best pet ever CMV."" I just thank they should be allowed.  


3)  Damage to the native ecosystem.  


With most pets, there's a strong concern that they can disrupt the local ecosystem if they escape and become feral. This is especially true with exotic pets. But opossums are native to North America, so that wouldn't be a worry.  


4) Some animals are endangered and taking them as pets will threaten their wild population numbers.  


Opossums are fast-maturing generalist omnivores with litter sizes of up to 13. The wild population isn't going anywhere  


5.) Wild animals deserve to run free and it's cruel to confine them to your home.  


Maybe this would be a concern if America's opossums where still running wild in untouched forests. But in practice many of them are already living in human settlements and eating out of our trash and dodging traffic. What would be cruel about giving them a warm, safe place to sleep? Isn't this how we domesticated cats originally? They started hanging around our settlements because there was food to eat and eventually we grew fond of them and invited them indoors?"

Paying 100's of thousands of dollars for someone to read PowerPoints off a board when you can learn the same topic online for free feels like a ripoff. I went to university during the height of covid-19, which extremified this viewpoint since I felt like I was not getting the full experience of the investment. Paying money just so I could read news articles and Blackboard updates and write responses without directly interacting with another person felt overpriced.

In addition, higher education is constantly growing more expensive and the pressure to attend feels predatory since young adults usually vastly underestimate the costs involved. For anyone outside the USA, education is free until age 18 because the US government has come to the conclusion that providing tax-payer-funded education to everyone until legal adulthood pays itself back. Colleges and universities do cost money and are likely to be one of the largest investments you will ever make. 

If you have strict parents, they likely told you that community college was a shameful concession to make which I thought was a harsh viewpoint. They tend to be significantly cheaper, but are by no means ""bad"" for your reputation. Going to one is completely fine.

For context, I went to college for 4 years, graduated in good standing, and greatly enjoyed several classes from professors who did go above and beyond to involve and make it feel like an involved activity rather than as a mere lecture, but I did have bad experiences as well though. I had a professor who took over 4 months to grade my final essay was my most frustrating example. Having to email him to do his job was awful.

I enjoyed the experience as a whole as I learned a lot and made everlasting friends, but textbooks (massively overpriced and purposely made to be obsolete by next year), parking passes (just there to police who can and cannot park and inconvenience people who forget to put up passes), and tuition seem to more expensive than they have to be.

I hesitate to use the word indoctrinate, but most teachers, school newspapers, and students tend to have strong political views and I am concerned about a growing amount of young adults who genuinely hate and fear opposing viewpoints. I genuinely had to explain to someone in a communications class that ""hate speech"" is still free speech and that we should defend opinions even if we disagree with them.

Of course, the main point of going to higher education is to open the door to career opportunities which I am thankful for, but going merely for the desire to learn feels like it would be a waste of money. I love to learn, but researching a topic on my own for the fun of it feels more informative than studying the exact same subject for a grade in most cases. Surely, I am not the only one?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR, Higher education is borderline necessary for modern life, but it feels overpriced and going just for the sake of learning would be a massive waste of money and time."

For anyone outside the USA or anyone who doesn't understand the system the country uses to elect its president, the American presidential election is not held as a giant election; it is held as 51 small elections where all 50 states and Washington DC hold an internal election where their residents express their preferences towards their jurisdiction's electors. In other words, the people of California do not directly vote for the president; they vote for who they want their state's 54 electors to be assigned to as an example.

Every state (except for Nebraska and Maine) is winner-take-all. The candidate who gets the most votes in the state is awarded all of its electors regardless of the margin of victory. This is a big deal for valuable states like California (54), Texas (40), Florida (30), and New York (28). The goal of a candidate is to win 270 electors or more to win the presidency.

There are noted issues with this system. Firstly, most states are dominated by one party and are completely ignored in the context of the presidential race. The Republican candidate for president can almost certainly expect to win ""Safe Red"" states like Alabama, Oklahoma, and Idaho while the Democratic nominee can almost certainly expect to win ""Safe Blue"" states like Maryland, Massachusetts, and Hawaii. As such, these states are completely ignored by the candidates since narrowing the margin of defeat or running up their margin of victory is a complete waste of time and money for them. You are unlikely to see television ads, campaign posters, or on-the-ground canvassers because your vote is irrelevant. Voting against (or for!) your state's dominant party does not matter since your state's electors are pretty much decided years in advance. As such, polarization can be extremified by voters on a losing end since they can feel like their views are drowned out.

The focus is always placed on the ""Swing states"" which are the states that either candidate could conceivably win. States like North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are heavily contested and are the focus of candidate visits, tv advertisements, events, etcetera. 

Another common complaint with the system is the possibility of a candidate winning the Electoral College without winning the national popular vote. In 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016, the candidate who won the presidency did not receive the most votes nationwide. Even the two most recent cases (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) have publicly stated that while they won based on the rules everyone agreed to and knew about beforehand, they would prefer a system based on a national popular vote. 

I see way too many people claim that the only reason we still have the Electoral College is because the Republican Party can't win the presidency without it, but if the goal was to win the national popular vote, they would be competing differently from the start.

There are still benefits with the system. 

Firstly, if elections were decided by a national popular vote, candidates would focus all their efforts on highly populated cities which would lead to vast swaths of the nation's geography being irrelevant.

Secondly, the Electoral College was created to give each state a role to play in the process.

It is the UK equivalent of being a klansman or neoconfederate. When I say Protestantism, I don't mean Protestant Christianity, I mean I'm a Protestant. I'm referring to the violent ethno-nationalism practiced by the political majority of Northern Ireland. I don't understand the apparent mood of alot of UK citizens where they pride themselves on being more progressively minded than say conservative Americans but let stuff like Ulsterism, monarchy, and colonialism slide.

I feel that the UK needs to disown Northern Ireland on an ideological level. Ulster pride is arbitrary nonsense. Being descended from Scottish Protestants doesn't make you inherently superior. In fact, from what I've read, Northern Irish citizens are the poorest and least educated in the UK. Why aren't there educational and public works programs? Why does the UK let Northern Ireland fester and rot while continuing to support a hate-filled ideology? The UK military supported mass-murdering terrorist groups like the UVF and UDA while getting all indignant about the provos (Provisional IRA). The UK also needs to fully release all the Troubles-related security files, stop using ""national security"" as an excuse. Many of the paratroops and SAS were outright murderers and they need to be named, shamed, and prosecuted. Stop hero-worshipping the military."

0,2023-03-21,CMV: Serving God is neither fully selfish nor selfless,u/Zuccarelo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11x96ff/cmv_serving_god_is_neither_fully_selfish_nor/,changemyview,"Not sure why this came to mind, but this question came to me while I was on an afternoon walk.

On the one hand, you could say it's selfish because you wouldn't be loyal to God without the promise of personal reward (whatever your version or equivalent of ""heaven"" is, or at minimum, not being sent to your version of ""hell""). The ultimate reward for serving God benefits you. Anyone else it benefits by extension still benefits you, as you feel ""good"" for whatever reason helping said person(s).

As an example, you would pray for your family's salvation (probably) as you most likely feel a deep sense of obligation and love for them. Their pleasure brings you pleasure; their pain brings you pain. Inversely, you most likely wouldn't wish such mercies on a terrorist or Nazi, as the inverse (at least, I hope) is true.

Conversely, it could be argued that loyalty to God is a selfless act, as many of His commands and wishes (at least in the popular Abrahamic religions) relate to your interactions in the material world. Looking at the Ten Commandments for instance, respecting your parents, not murdering, not torturing animals, not stealing, etc. These all relate to your interactions with others. In an overwhelming majority of cases in life, doing what is best from a religious standpoint is most likely what's best for your fellow man as well, even if not for yourself in a material sense.

Is it maybe a mix of both? Is reducing this to a binary too simple? Or am I just a bored college student on spring break trying to get himself to sleep?"

Ofcourse, what we perceive as being right is based on our perspective, how you see things won't necessarily be the same as someone else, childhood experiences, education, people, family, environment, religious beliefs, nationality, colour of skin, gender, ..everything influences our views.

If I asked you what came first, the chicken or the egg, some people will say the egg, other people will say the chicken, and no one will be neither right or wrong, because our answer will be based on our perspective. 

Even more complex subjects that technically can only be right, can also be wrong, oranges are orange, right?, we can all agree, except if you're colourblind, in which case they're yellow, or green. 

My view is that how we perceive right and wrong is based on our perspective, as humans, and individuals, and doesn't truly exist in reality, change my view.

This wording is vague and open ended and will have a “chilling effect” on the teaching of history in Florida public schools.

Slavery, segregation, Jim Crow etc. are unpleasant topics that are bound to make students uncomfortable. Teachers will be paranoid about falling into the “trap” set by this bill.  They cannot afford to lose their jobs, so in an abundance of caution, they will avoid these lessons and skip entire chapters of U.S. history. 

In fact, the bill is already causing problems.  A textbook publisher has created a “Florida only” history book that deletes all references to race and skin color.  A lesson on Rosa Parks, in the Florida version of the book, says “Rosa Parks was asked to give up her seat on the bus.  She thought that was wrong so she refused.”  In the unedited version (the version sold in other states), the lesson says “Rosa Parks was asked to give up her seat because the law said a black person had to give up their seat if a white person wanted to sit down. She thought that was wrong so she refused.” 

This does students a disservice.  They have a right to know their history, even if it is disturbing. Dumbing down the education to protect their feelings is the wrong move. It’s just as bad as liberal states banning algebra in 8th grade because they do not want students who fail to feel bad about themselves."

831,2023-03-21,CMV: It makes no sense for girly boys to still carry a stigma while boyish girls are generally much more accepted.,u/JAR_2004,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11xhpij/cmv_it_makes_no_sense_for_girly_boys_to_still/,changemyview,"I've been recently thinking about this since I was recently at a public restroom waiting my turn and a teenage boy (he looked to be around 13 to 15 years old) wearing a skirt came out of the toilet. He stared at me with a scared or concerned look as if he thought I was going to mock him, but I just smiled at him casually and stepped inside the bathroom.

This has made me think about how much of a stigma girly boys continue to have in our modern society whereas the opposite isn't really the case for girls (at least that's what I've seen from my personal experience). 

I went to Elementary School in western europe around the late 2000s and early 2010s and this trend was evident to me even back then. If a girl displayed traits and interests that are normally considered masculine, nobody saw it as unusual, quite the contrary. However, God forbid if a boy was caught doing anything that was seen as remotely girly, because he was guaranteed to be singled out as ""not normal"" in a matter of seconds.

Particularly, I remember one day in 5th grade when our teacher was pointing out one special trait in each classmate. There was a boy who liked to hang out with girls more often than he did with other boys and that was the ""special trait"" the teacher pointed out, seriously!  Meanwhile, there were a couple girls in the same class who liked to hang out with boys and were really into typically boyish things like football and motorbikes but our teacher didn’t say anything about them. 

I've heard some people argue that this is because sterotypical masculine traits such as ""toughness"" and ""bravery"" are largely seen as positive by society as a whole, while femeninity isn't because it's often viewed as the opposite of these traits (A.K.A fragility, delicateness etc.). 

But that makes no sense because femenity has absolutely been demanded of girls just as much as masculinity has been demanded of boys throughout most of human history until very recently. Just look at old ads from the 1950s or 1960s showing the ""ideal family"" and you'll see what I mean. 

So I don't really have an answer to this question and I think it's very dumb. Everyone should be allowed to express themselves however they want no matter gender!  

Anyways, I hope to hear your thoughts on this! Thanks for reading and debating!"

Should probably preface this by saying that Putin absolutely deserves to be on the docket in the Hague (just in case anyone has their finger on the “whataboutism” trigger). It just seems glaringly obvious that the Bush, Cheney, Blair-types should also be, and it’s an interesting juxtaposition that Putin’s ICC arrest warrant came almost at the same time as the 20th anniversary of the Iraq war. 

Neither Russia or the US are party to the Rome Statute, and there would be virtually no chance that either Putin or the Iraq War posse will ever stand trial in the Hague, but the warrant would, in theory, severely limit their travel as it would trigger arrests as soon as they land in countries that are party to it.

The precise charge that Putin has a warrant for is to do with Russia having effectively kidnapped (likely permanently) Ukrainian children who were fleeing the war they started, but the invasion itself is also war crime, just as Iraq was. These were both wars of aggression, both filled with countless war crimes and crimes against humanity. 

It is absolutely just, and right, that Putin be sought by the international tribunal for his crimes (and he deserves staks of charges on top of the one that he’s being sought for), but there is no logical justification why at no point in 20 years since the invasion of Iraq, there’s never been a consequence for the men who lied about, then prosecuted that criminal war, especially when it’s taken barely over a year for charges to be brought against the Russian leader.

Not for nothing, but the UK is a signatory to the statute, so there’s even less reason why Blair shouldn’t be tried. 

TL;DR: The men who drove the Iraq war should be sought for war crimes just as Putin has been."

One thing I've noticed is that it's very common for non Americans, especially European, to shit on Americans for being ""geographically challenged"".

From my experience they are neither worse nor better than other nationalities.

 In fact when it comes to the general world population, that excludes a small percentage of very knowledgeable people, they only know about other countries that they have have things in common with such as: a shared border, overlapping history, a shared language, strong diplomatic ties, significant diaspora, etc. Or if that country is culturally significant like the US, China, France or Brazil.

I come from a small African nation that most Europeans couldn't place on a map, despite my country being a former European colony with many present day ties to the former colonizer.

Many of his actors have began protesting against his leadership, but I think they are in the wrong. Firstly, they claim to be underpaid. Dhar Mann pays all his main actors 33-44 dollars per hour, which in my opinion, is too much for shitty actors with little to no talent. They claim they can't pay their rent and stuff, and complain they don't get benefits. However, they are fucking freelance workers. Dhar Mann does not require their services every day, so naturally he doesn't pay them every day, because that's how a freelance job works. Every responsible freelance worker works multiple jobs, because that is the price they must pay for the freedom yet instability of their career. It seems they want to live the free lifestyle of a freelance worker but don't want to accept any of the caveats with that. They also claim he is a bad and demanding boss. One protestor explained that ""Dhar is extremely demanding, he expects us to know all our lines and be camera ready."" How the fuck are these unreasonable expectations? They claim Dhar Mann has a work hierarchy with him at the top. He is their boss. That is not unreasonable. They also say his sets have safety hazards but never elaborate on what they are so I'm kind of sus of that point. Apparently they called an executive meeting to discuss any complaints they may have, and many executives did show up except Dhar Mann, as he was on a holiday. They then proceeded to storm out of the meeting like children because Dhar Mann wasn't there.

They're deliberately contradictory and vague to encourage discussion, allowing room for  people to change my view.

The universe is a constant circle of destruction and creation, something is destroyed and something else is created from the ashes, and this isn't a theory, is something that we can physically see with our own eyes every day.

The term ""for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"" is more meaningful than just physics, everything that exists have a meaning on life, is the constant action and reaction that generates energy, without energy life can't exist. 

Our very existence is chaotic, we are conceived through a wild exchange of energy between a male and a female, we literarily destroy ourselves through zygotes during the Fertilisation process, during pregnancy we try devour our mothers from the inside out, and we born in the most traumatic way, our lives starts out of chaos.

But without that chaotic exchange we won't exist, life won't exist, for a star to be born, another one needs to die, without the sun, life can't exist, is that constant exchange of energy, that constant action and reaction that drives the universe, and our lives. 

The meaning of life is chaos, changing my view

I think it would be better to save the money for traveling a few years later, when everyone can properly enjoy it. Or, if you live in a country like mine, where families are very involved in raising the children, leave the kids at home and have adults-only vacation."

302,2023-03-22,CMV: Advertising Junk Food to Kids should be illegal.,u/Dawntodusk87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11yksm0/cmv_advertising_junk_food_to_kids_should_be/,changemyview,"As the title says, I believe it should be illegal to advertise junk food (Candy, chips, soda, sugary cereals, etcetera.) to children on TV, movie previews, etcetera. Kids are impressionable and they often have not fully realized the concepts of nutrition and money. 

Advertisements for junk food usually portray them as exciting, get major celebrities to endorse them, and do not share the negative effects of their products. 

Sugary cereals usually have commercials that make them seem magical, tie them to popular cartoon characters, or tie them to ongoing stories. Also, cereal boxes tend to have games to play on them which is specifically meant to be enticing to kids.

When a child sees Lebron James drinking a bottle of Coke between making free throws, it is a very effective way to promote brand loyalty (""Lebron James drinks Coke and he is my hero. I should drink Coke too."") and it implies that soda consumption can at least be compatible with healthy living. (Lebron James can drink Coke and still be a professional athlete. Surely I could too."") Truth be told, I doubt Lebron drinks Coca-Cola at all outside those commercials.

As a matter of fact, the United States is one of the few countries that does not have rules against doing so. Most countries see it as a way to target vulnerable consumers who cannot make informed decisions and ban such advertising to a target audience younger than 12.

Artificial ingredients such as preservatives, artificial colors, artificial flavors, etcetera can have effects such as headaches, behavioral changes, nausea, and even increasing the risk of cancer. To make things worse, junk food companies tend to make their nutritional labels confusing and vague. They are often outrageously high in sugar, saturated fat, sodium, etcetera and are lacking nutritional value.

I should clarify that I am not asking to ban junk food in its entirety as that is unrealistic and would be a simple case of policing the way people act. If you wish to drink soda, eat chips, etcetera, you have the right to and nobody can stop that.

Of course, parents are part of the equation, but most people underestimate the negative effects of junk food because they have come to the conclusion that ""If it was harmful, it would not be legal to sell it."" and figure it can be harmless in moderation. The truth is that the United States is one of the most lenient countries in the world when it comes to food additives. 

In addition, parental guidance can only go so far since schools often sell junk food since they are often funded by such.

In addition, if you have been subject to junk food advertising for most of your childhood, as an adult, it can be hard to break the pattern of craving them since they are specifically designed to be as enticing as possible. Chips and candy are often specifically made to be as enticing as possible with details such as bright colors, texture, shapes, etcetera which can lead to addiction. Eating patterns that start when you are young can be hard to break which is what these companies are hoping for since they want to create lifelong customers."

I make 30k a year and have 2 insurances. One is an open market plan that's like $370 a month I get a tax credit of -$300 so I pay $70 a month. That's $15 pcp, $30 specialist, and $10 generics.The worst part of my insurance is I pay 40% of ER visits up to my $5,000 deductible.  That is what my secondary insurance (medicaid) is for. It covers everything the primary doesn't. 

It only took about a days worth of time to search the open market during open enrollment to find a plan, I didn't call a ""professional"" or any of the other scams out there. It takes a minor amount of effort and everyone should know these kinds of things, especially if they have children.

That's another part that could be reformed, proper education on the basics of health insurance so people can find something that fits them, there's literally plans for everything under the sun and one can basically find a custom plan that works for their needs.

At the end of the day it does no good to constantly decry the system as a whole and advocate for it's destruction, it has its pros and cons and it's better for everyone to work and improve the system we have, rather than starting from scratch or some pipedream of socialized health insurance."

550,2023-03-22,CMV: Americans are held to a different standard when it comes to the pronunciation of non-English words and names.,u/cippy-cup,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11yp6hk/cmv_americans_are_held_to_a_different_standard/,changemyview,"*In the interest of a somewhat-concise conversation, I am limiting this to criticism that occurs while in the US rather than when Americans travel to non-English speaking countries.*

From my perspective, Americans are held to a different standard when it comes to the pronunciation of non-English words and names, particularly when it comes to cultures that they have little first-hand exposure to. I think the bulk of this criticism comes from born-and-raised Americans themselves, not necessarily immigrants or individuals visiting the US. 

For instance, I have a few friends from Germany - German is their primary language, and they struggle quite a bit with the “th” sound. It is not a natural sound in their language, so the name “Beth” sounds more like “Bess”. It is understood that they are not used to the mouth shape required for the “th” sound, so it is not considered disrespectful to pronounce the name incorrectly. 

As another example, I did Taekwondo for about a decade, and my name was mispronounced daily. The middle of my name is a sound that doesn’t really exist in Korean, so some people couldn't pronounce it. I am particular about my name (it is similar to another, slightly more common name and people often swap it out), but I never felt the need to criticize a pronunciation that was certainly well-intentioned and likely unavoidable.

In my experience, when Americans have similar struggles with certain sounds, that same grace isn’t given. It is seen as disrespectful or “classically American” to not take the time to learn, when it often seems to come down to unfamiliar sounds, tones, and mouth shapes. I think, to some degree, this expectation comes down to the melting-pot nature of the US, however that diversity is not necessarily homogenous throughout the country. It is difficult to learn the basics of a language and/or culture when you have little exposure to it. 

To clarify a few things: 

* I do think you should make every effort to respect a person’s name, culture, and identity. I am not a fan of encouraging immigrants or non-American visitors to “Americanize” their name or choose another American name outright. 
* I think Americans should prioritize learning languages outside of English. 
* I hope that this linguistic gap can close through increased representation on TV and in other forms of media.
* I recognize that there are plenty of Americans who are *not* understanding about mispronunciation of American English names/words. 

That being said, I think equal grace should be given in understanding that some sounds are unfamiliar to a person’s native tongue, and they may struggle to hear and implement the difference between correct and incorrect pronunciation. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!"

I will agree that certain wants &amp; needs if have are helping contribute to actions that are not great for the planet. I am also self aware (and selfish) that I don’t really care. I would say most people don’t. Myself and many others included wouldn’t want to live the life that’s needed to help greatly reduce the strain we might press on the planet. 


Because (comparatively) few people produce products for millions now, those efforts create a lot of damage and waste. However, it produces large quantities at lower prices. These products are made one place and sent across the globe, spreading the issues with it. 

This absolutely does apply to “green energy” as well. It’s destructive for the planet, just in an different way. We must move millions of tons of earth to mine for the resources needed. If/once the demand increases, so will the destruction. 


Most people don’t have the skill or know how to produce their daily needs. We just know how to buy. 

If we didn’t have massive companies supplying them for us at cost that millions can afford, we would greatly struggle, suffer or worse. 


So in short: 
* Due to the lack of skill, knowledge, funds and desire to personally produce our needs, we will continue to rely on large companies  to do so.
* Due to the lack of desire to abstain from our wants, we will continue to look for large companies to supply them. 
* Given the current technology, there is no way to supply food &amp; energy to millions in a manner that is not bad for the environment or cost effective. 

I don’t think most of us want to give up our lives we live for the sake of the planet ."
83,2023-03-22,"CMV: I don't think most racist, sexist, or homophobes change their minds/ways because of internet discussion",u/CatCow_1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11yysdj/cmv_i_dont_think_most_racist_sexist_or_homophobes/,changemyview,"I've been on various social media platforms since I was 13 and don't really comment often, but I like to read them. The internet has gotten pretty negative especially with regards to politics and I've watched the average person engage with bigots and it rarely seems to get anywhere. To be specific, I'm only talking about internet discussions between the average user that has an opinion. Not youtubers, politicians, famous people, political experts, t.v. personalities, or anyone with a following. 



1. Social media is  a very divided place. Because of algorithms, people are mostly recommended things that they previously had been consuming/already agree with. This creates an ecochamber that reinforces their current beliefs and if they aren't mindful of their biases and the sources biases, they'll take it as truth. This is made worse because algorithms aren't particularly good at recommending opposing view points. This leads to alot of people holding unchallenged views and alot of confirmation bias. When people decide to engage with the opposing group, the discussions get messy because each side is holds a different version of reality.

2. I don't think many people are good at arguing or   explaining why they disagree with others (including myself) over the internet. I think being online, behind a keyboard, and not being able to see the person's face lowers your inhibitions, so you say things to people and talk to them in a way you would never talk to them irl. In other words, during these conversations, people tend to show alot more negative emotions instead of really discussing the topic at hand. 

3. This last one is something I have personally noticed amongst people who claimed to have shed their bigoted beliefs, but I realize my perspective is limited, so take it with a grain of salt. I think many people who don't hold these beliefs anymore don't hold them because they've interacted with those different than them. I've seen a ton of stories of people who grew up to be homophobic, but eventually leave for college and come to realize that gay people are people just like themselves. If the person for example, doesn't come to accept gay people through interacting with them, the internet played a part. I know I just said that online discussion doesn't help, but what I mean, in this case are those that have been exposed to info that challenged their view point and have decided to keep an open mind. For instance, I've read comments saying that a particular youtuber challenge the views they hold. 


Disclaimer: I'm pretty liberal, but alot of the stuff regarding biases, ecochambers, rudeness, and  not having your views challenged can apply to liberals.

In conclusion, I feel like the average person engaging with average bigots on the internet rarely leads to them changing their mind. Instead, it seems like its more up to the individual or a result of circumstances such as going to college or moving to a different city. I want to beleive that internet discussions arent pointless, but I guess I haven't seen it? As I said before, my perspective is limited so if this is helpful please tell me how."
1310,2023-03-22,"CMV: If you are an American and support Israel because of sympathy for Jewish people, then you should be willing to give your land and resources back to Native Americans",u/External_Grab9254,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11yz0sa/cmv_if_you_are_an_american_and_support_israel/,changemyview,"Since its creation, the US has provided Israel with $150 Billion in military aid, and also supported it's initial creation. While there are some military advantages to financially backing Israel, many American citizens and politicians support Israel because because they believe that the Jewish people deserve to live in their ancestral homeland in order to avoid persecution and harm.   


Native Americans have survived numerous genocidal practices led by the American government. I don't feel the need to list them all or really compare severity but I found this review that summarizes them well: [https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa\_eng/wjdt\_665385/2649\_665393/202203/t20220302\_10647120.html](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/2649_665393/202203/t20220302_10647120.html)  
One argument I often hear against my view is that the Holocaust was more recent than what happened to Native Americans so I want to point out that the US government sterilized an estimated 42% of native women of childbearing age, most against their will or who were falsely told it was their only option as recently as the early 1970s. These genocidal practices have had horrific affects on Native populations and overall health today. While reservations exist, they are rarely on that tribe's original territory and are often in places of the US that are awful for agriculture and/or have been poisoned chemically or radioactively. The US has also historically ignored the sovereignty of established reservations.  


From my perspective, if the US was going to restore the ancestral homeland of any group of people due to moral obligation, it should be Native Americans. The only reasons I can think of for someone morally supporting Israel but not Land Back for indigenous people are:  
a. They are racist against indigenous people and/or Palestinians   
b. They are selfish/hypocritical in not wanting to give up their own property. This is hypocritical imo because they still want Palestinians to peacefully give up their land or support the forceful removal of Palestinians from their land.  


I'm curious if there are any logical reasons why an American citizen would morally support Israel but not also aim to reallocate land to Native Americans.

Edit: I specifically worded my question in a “if you believe x for abc reasons, then you should also believe y” because I was not interested in getting into whether or not Israel should exist or if Israel or Palestine are more correct. Neither is my actually view. I SPECIFICALLY want to see if someone can change my view that supporting the expansion of Israel, but not Land Back for indigenous people is illogical.

Edit 2: “you know native people went to war too and there are tons of tribes that hate each other how would we even do that” I should have mentioned that I am indigenous and I am fairly aware of my history. I don’t care who went to war with who, I am making a moral distinction between war and ethnic genocide. It’s one thing for a population to lose a war and their land, it’s another to be continually prosecuted/poisoned/sterilized/killed intentionally for your race. If people can’t assimilate without facing these horrors, then maybe they do deserve some retribution. I’m not gonna draw you a map of how I would do land back, it’s about the morality of it all and not the logistics. If you want to debate the logistics or be racist with me about it maybe I’ll make another CMV about it more specifically later 

Another comment I’m seeing is that nobody cares about Israel as a means of protection for Jewish people or that they deserve the land as it’s their homeland.

When I went there A kid saw a clay model of a Auschwitz crematorium and said “That’s a big house Mommy,I wish we could live there” and on several other occasions I heard little kids call the train cart that transported jews “The big choo-Choo train”,and even in the place with the victims’ shoes on Display,A kid said “that’s a lot of shoes!” In a cheery voice.So CMV on little kids being brought to Holocaust Museums.

9,2023-03-22,CMV: Titan would be the only place in the solar system (other than Earth) realistically capable of hosting a self-sustaining human colony on it's surface.,u/cantheevilman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11z7ror/cmv_titan_would_be_the_only_place_in_the_solar/,changemyview,"From my perspective, a self-sustaining human colony is defined as a decently sized settlement (of at least 100 people or so) of human beings, whom are eventually, for numerous periods of time of at least 10 years, able to provide and get every need for themselves without help from planet earth (other than initial resources), and are actively a community in-person (no lotus eater machines or virtual reality). Furthermore, these colonies must be able to last for lengthy periods of time (lets say at least a millennia). As part of being ""self-sustaining), humans on these colonies must have survival rates and lifespans at least similar to those that humans from earth in 3000ish BC had. Also, these humans have requirements and abilities similar to humans on Earth right now. That means that:

1) Humans require some sort of protection against galactic cosmic rays

2) Humans require food and water

3) Humans must breathe oxygen and be in a place with pressure below the Armstrong limit.'

4) Humans outside of Earth require some sort of energy source to operate machines necessary for sustaining life

5) Each human (over the long term) needs a certain amount of personal space and access to the ""outdoors"". 

The following sets of beliefs I have are unchangeable:

1) Every thing will at some point break down. No individual machine, person, or structure will last forever. Every system and piece of infrastructure will crack and fail at some time (albeit repair will always be possible) regardless of how well it's maintained. 

2) It will never be plausible for a self-sustaining human colony on a surface that isn't solid. 

3) A self-sustaining human colony requires some sort of energy source which can be gathered utilizes machines that can be sourced locally.

Now, with that set up in mind, I believe this disqualifies the vast majority of solid bodies in the solar system because systems to keep a human living space adequately pressurized to enable human survival will at some point break down, and any loss in pressurization is likely to be downright lethal and not give human beings enough time to fix the issue. Furthermore, I do not believe there is the right combination of materials on any foreign solar system body to create new means of keeping artificial pressurization. 

In addition, the fact that most solar system bodies do not have a atmosphere means that most solar system bodies also do not have an atmosphere that would adequately protect humans against galactic cosmic rays, and it isn't plausible to build enough protection against galactic cosmic rays for a surface colony given how enormous the walls of such a colony would need to be. Now, with that said, there are a couple solid bodies in the solar system that are either capable of holding an atmosphere with enough pressurization to not kill humans immediately or a magnetosphere.

1) Mars 

While it is possible to hold an atmosphere, it will not happen due to Mars not having a magnetosphere. As a result of this, any atmosphere built will be stripped away by space. Building an artificial magnetosphere will be impossible given the power requirements to do this are beyond anything humanity would be capable of building. Thus, Mars would never be able to host an atmosphere over a long enough period of time to host a self-sustaining surface colony

2) Venus

The atmosphere on Venus is extremely pressurized and the temperature and pressure would make building any colony on the surface impossible. Galactic cosmic rays would not be an issue, but this is irrelevant.

3) Mercury

Mercury, while it has a magnetosphere, can't hold an atmosphere and the fact that the temperature on any place on the planet reaches ridiculous levels (because planet rotates and every part will eventually face the sun) will make building a surface colony impossible.

4) Inner Jovian moons

While these moons are protected by Jupiter's magnetosphere somewhat, none of them hold or would be capable of holding an atmosphere with human intervention.

5) Saturnian moons (other than Titan)

Again, while protected by Saturn's magnetosphere, none other than Titan are capable of holding their own atmospheres. 

6) Titan

The atmosphere is pressurized to a level that is bearable for a human, and it won't immediately kill a human. It is protected somewhat from cosmic rays by Saturn's magnetosphere and it's atmosphere.

After accounting for the fact that Titan is really the only place capable of hosting both an atmosphere of a pressure bearable to humans and is somewhat protected by a magnetosphere, here are some other reasons why Titan may be capable of hosting a self-sustaining human colony:

1) There are multiple local energy sources readily available including Acetylene (which can be chemically broken down to create energy), wind power (from atmosphere), and hydropower (from the fact that there are liquid lakes and streams on the planet and the liquid from these lakes falls from clouds and goes down stream. 

These energy systems can be used to...

a) Create energy to grow plants for food

b) Mine water from Titan's subsurface ocean and create oxygen from that water

c) Heat humans to temperatures they can survive. 

d) Construct stuff

2) There are hydrocarbons EVERYWHERE on the planet, which should make creating plastics as a fundamental building and repair material possible. 

3) The primary systems that would be required to keep conditions of a self sustaining colony on Titan habitable are as follows:

a) Oxygen manufacturing systems to keep oxygen levels adequate

b) Heating systems to keep temperature adequate. 

Both of these systems can be built with redundancy relatively easily, and the technology behind these systems is relatively simple and easy to manufacture. Furthermore, a failure in one of these systems isn't immediately lethal, unlike with systems designed to enable pressurization that would be required on other places. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is for those reasons above why I believe that Titan is the only body in the solar system (other than Earth) capable of hosting a self-sustaining human colony on its surface. CMV."

Unless the animal is endangered, if you see an animal in the wild that is hurt by a non-human natural cause, just leave it please, instead of making videos for contents. 

It seems that people use how cute the animal is to determine whether the animal should be helped or not

However, I still support helping wild animals wounded by an obvious human cause such as  if an animal is injured by a trap or a gunshot wound, as it would not have naturally occurred."

The information age that we are currently living on is making education unnecessary. Ever since the Internet was invented, we had at our disposal mass amounts of information, freely available, and unrestricted.

I was born in 1975,  I grew up during the first wave of the information revolution that started in 1985 when Microsoft released Windows 1, it was fundamentally basic compered to today's operating systems, but it opened up possibilities to gather information easily, that traditionally will been unavailable to you, or difficult to access through books in libraries.

Ever since that humble beginnings, the Internet has become our main source of information, books aren't necessarily anymore, we just go to Google or any other search engine, we ask the question, and we have the answer, even though that's making our lives easier, it is also making it unnecessary to learn. 

Even as I writing this, I have an AI correcting my spelling and my grammar automatically, I don't need to proofread or edit this post, my English could be extremely basic, but I will come across as a well educated person, if I need to do a complex mathematical equation, I don't even need a calculator, just ask Google and I'll have the answer instantly. If I need to backup my post with information, the research will be done for me simply by asking the Internet about that subject. 


Are schools even necessary this days?, except for the social interaction which I agree is necessary, schools could be replaced with social hubs for kids and no one will even notice the difference, they just need to learn basic English and maths, and technology will do the rest for them.

To summarise..I personally believe, and it's my view, that technology has advanced to a point in which we simply don't need to learn anymore, the information era is making education redundant.

My view has changed now. Technology can't replace the human interaction needed for education. Even that is a good tool. It can't replace the human brain ,at least not yet. Thank you all for all your comments."

Some people can come back from depression, not a lot do it, and even then it'll become a part of you for longer than you'd like, well beyond they hypothetical ""yes I'm now cured"" moment, it'll creep back into your life. Some people will say ""I wouldn't wish depression on my worst enemy"". I digress. I would wish it on certain people if I was absolutely sure it would change them for the better or get them to listen to a perspective they didn't care existed previously. Alright rant over.

Anyways back to depression.

* Antidepressants. You call that a cure? it's so expensive and dangerous to be on for the long term. So many  side effects. Prevention is better than cure.
* Therapy. Boy do I hate therapy, not only do you fork out $100-300 per session, as you notice your wallet is getting light, then your bank balance. Then you realise just having one good friend could pretty much give you the same value as most therapists.
   * Whats teh need for therapists? oh right if you don't have an internet connection and can't be arsed to help yourself, if you want someone to complain to, seems the only real utility left is that.  Because you pay them to complain to them, not really worth it unless it's a secret that you'll never tell anyone but need to.
* Curing trauma is not as easy as ""get help"" ""you need therapy"". Most mental trauma is never fully cured and can always pop up again from memory, even despite talking it out, taking drugs, getting various treaments. Depression specifically changes the way your brain is structured, and the size of the hippocampus shrinks IIRC. This is not something that drugs or talk therapy can ever hope to cure with such pointless bandaid fixes. Which is further why the entire field of psychology and medicine needs to be rewritten in order to accommodate and be ready to correctly treat the increasing trend of mental illness. But as it remains there's little hope for a cure. And ""take these meds daily for the rest of your life to be cured"" is a slippery slope of ""when will I forget to take them, not if."" Because it **will** happen and all the suicidal etc thoughts come right back with a venegance.

The cure to mental illness seems to be to never get ill. Our top scientists and psychologists etc don't actually have anything worth a damn to beat prevention. Dismal.

# Edit: I'd like to make a distinction. When I talk about depression here, I do mean clinical depression. It's been pointed out that the two are different, so as to avoid confusion, for the sake of this CMV, we'll stick to clinical depression as the one we want to prevent."

I agree that there are great films and different art forms in other countries. I personally am a great fan of anime and love movies and films made from other cultures. My only problem is the new mind set that is being perpetuated throughout mainstream media. The mind set that places basically all foreign media and art/films on this higher pedestal.

I do think that foreign films deserve a seat at the table, but when you create an entire category for foreign films and allow for the film to also win best picture. That is not allowing them at the table, it is creating an unfair advantage. Either get rid of the international film category and let them compete with all films or only allow them to win one of the two categories.

The main reason I made this post is because of Parasite. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. I thought it was a decent movie, predictable but very decent. I gave the movie a 7.5/10. It had elements to it that were unique and interesting, but there were also things that got under my skin. There were many American Hollywood tropes and clichés that I noticed. I remember everyone saying that the movie was a ""masterpiece', one of my friends even said it was ""the best movie they ever saw"". My jaw almost dropped when I heard that.

To me a film that is a masterpiece is one that makes you think, goes beyond the vail of traditional practices within the filming industry and not just a carbon cut out of other films. I am not saying that films cannot follow in the footsteps of giants, but the shoes should have something about them that stands out, something different.

for me parasite was not this, super unique film. it had your cliché ""evil"" rich dumb elites that hate poor people. The rich mother was basically your American dumb blond that relies on the rich husband. I would have rated the movie way higher if the rich people actually felt like they had brain cells and not just a one dimensional bad guy archetype.

By me Just watching the opening of the poor son talking to the rich mother I knew the general direction the movie was going to go down. I knew the rich family was going to be scummy. I knew the poor family were going to trick them. I knew the poor family would get a happy ending while the rich family would meet a bloody demise that ended in most of their family dying.

I even like movies that analyze the power struggle of the poor and rich elites, but I have seen movies that have done it better. movies that are even foreign. Well one was a show, but I did watch two movies that also had similar themes.

Squid game is a good example, even though it is a show. But if you want a movie look at The Platform or snow piercer (the movie not the show).

But I think a major factor that lead to Parasite being rated so highly was because of it being a foreign film, while Hollywood films which I think were better got the short end of the stick. I personally loved Uncut gems (which was not even nominated) and Joker. 

I wanted Joker to win best picture. I thought the social commentary of how society treats people that are less fortunate was done in a master class. The movie had me at the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen next. I don't usually like to put superhero or superhero universe characters in the spot for best picture, but joker transcended movies like marvel or any other superhero movie.

I am open to understanding other points of view and why people think I am wrong. Why you might think foreign films are highly under-appreciated and don't get the full recognition they deserve. I just think that the general consensus is that Hollywood movies are bad and that Foreign films are blowing them out of the water. I just think it is relative to perspective. I personally dislike certain foreign films, but I respect all films that try to expand the filming industry. I just think that we need to change this perspective that Hollywood is not making good movies anymore when that is not true."

Only 36% of the country I live in, which this website clearly targeted given that it only listed companies that operate here as well as being in the local language are “overweight” and this metric of “overweight” used, the b.m.i., is itself already criticized in the sense that those that are “slightly overweight” under it seem to live longer than those that are “healthy weight” so one might argue the number is even lower.

0,2023-03-23,CMV: I don't like the idea of chivalry.,u/tinonymous98,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11zt96j/cmv_i_dont_like_the_idea_of_chivalry/,changemyview,"As a guy the one thing that always kept me away from trying to talk to a girl was always what I heard and watched on TV shows and movies showing romance in a way that all made all the girls go ""aww"".Basically, how in dating world it was shows as a guy doing amazing things for a girl and make her feel special. So that, always made me feel jealous and in simple terms you can look at it somehow like people having jealousy towards those who get more attention. I had similar thing for the entire gender. And I let it bother me so much into thinking that men have no value in dating and relationships that I never tried it (I was wrong on that part I know)

Anyway, coming to chivalry bit, I have been watching this trend of ""who should pay"", ""hold the door"" bits on social media and it bothers me a lot specially looking at modern age women ""expecting"" that, not like ... looking at it like a sweet gesture, but as an expectation. Here are the bits that don't make sense to me

\- If I and her decided to go out and have fun time, know each other, why is it so that the ""gentleman"" or ""real man"" way of going through it is by treating her special by paying and in general treating her like she is more important in it ?I had this talk with my cousin and she mentioned it is more about the attention and gesture that money and ... well that's the whole point! anyone can pay for a meal, I know am capable of doing that or holding door open or what not, but the whole thing makes me feel like I am being lucky or by being with her.  


\- On social media I see comments from modern women who can very well do jobs and are doing it and also otherwise support idea of equality clearly mocking the guys who aren't chivalrous with things like:   
'Earn first before dating"", ""If he can't even buy me a meal how will he provide for me"", ""If I split the bill, I am never going to next date""   
Well, if you want him to have the role of provider (just like traditional gender roles) you can talk about it and both can decide if it is a dealbreaker or not and most guys might not have problem, but on dates you 2 aren't even committed, also how does his ability of paying for few lunches or dinners an indicator of his capability of providing ? instead you can straight up with it if that's the goal and as him to bring his last 3 months' payslips.

\- The most devastating thing is even guys talking to women and telling them to ""expect"" these things, it isn't special when it is expected tho, I would be willing to take care of and make my partner feel comfortable without thinking about all this competition or value shit once I am in relationship with her and am comfortable with her, knowing that she cares about me and values me equally. At that point I don't mind anything, I just want her happy coz she is special to me and I to her, but to say ""Real men"" do this or that on dates?? like it doesn't make sense  


Chivalry and related things (looking at guys acting so desperate for girls, always self degrading jokes about not getting female attention, TV shows showing guys being pathetically trying to get her attention and so on) always kept me away from dating world, I developed this mindset as a little kid and it only grew more coz school life, college life were none different, I could see guys going above and beyond to get female attention and .. ye I never tried coz of jealousy."

And it's highly probable, though now knowable, that it was for the best even today.

Beyond being Public Enemy #1 for a long time and historically unpredictable, along with being an aging dictator, Saddam Hussein had a clear interest in nuclear weapons. When a country shields its nuclear research centers from international eyes, (even after they were directly attacked by Israel), and sends a diplomat to the ~~Uranium mines~~ Niger with no explanation, it really becomes a matter of putting 1 and 1 together.

No better comparison exists than North Korea. 

North Korea represents a major threat to a variety of nations, and harbors some of the most atrocious human right's violations in the world today. Over 25 million people are suffering in poverty because of the regime.

And there's nothing anyone can do about it. Many will point out the significance of China or North Korea's conventional forces, but it all starts and ends with nuclear weapons. If we had somehow known with certainty what was going to happen, desert storm would have been quickly followed with an invasion of NK.

There are other factors that motivate Iraq; sending a post-9/11 message, Israeli Security, and again the danger of Saddam being an aging dictator (see Russia).

But the primary motivator and entirely legitimate motivator was clear signs that we were headed towards a nuclear armed Iraq. Had it been ignored, the nation would likely be a family dictatorship to this day with each generation getting worse than the one before it. Not to mention a broader arms race throughout the middle east as consequence.

Edit: most replies were empty anger,  but one individual brought up a genuine point. Not really worth discussing anymore when all anyone has are continually assertions that basic facts aren't true."
82,2023-03-23,"CMV: ""Woke"" is not merely a right-wing boogeyman but describes an identifiable cluster of political belief. It's no more vague or nebulous than terms like ""liberal,"" ""right,"" or ""progressive""",u/DivideEtImpala,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11zuvck/cmv_woke_is_not_merely_a_rightwing_boogeyman_but/,changemyview,"This post is in response to a recent Atlantic column ['Woke' is just liberal](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/bethany-mandel-woke-interview-definition/673454/), which I strongly disagree with.

""Woke"" is an identifiable cluster of beliefs because at least three distinct political ideologies are pointing to the same thing, even if they might disagree on where the borders are. These groups are traditionalist conservatives, liberals, and leftists/Marxists. 

Traditionalist conservatives, in the US often Christian, like Rufo, Charlie Kirk, and others define ""woke"" most broadly, essentially encompassing anyone who has cultural or social positions opposed to ""tradtional Christian values."" This is by far the least sophisticated and consistent definition, and often is just used as a boogeyman for things they don't like. Ross  Douhat at NYT has a [less religious version](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/opinion/woke-definition.html) of this formulation.
 
Liberals who believe in individualism, equality, and merit, contrast their position with ""woke,"" which through CRT and other critical theories advocate breaking with *equality* to ensure *equity* for historically oppressed or marginalized groups of people. 

The Marxist/leftist critique of ""wokeism"" is that by focusing on racial/sexual/identity differences, working class solidarity becomes broken and prevents either progress or revolution needed to improve the material conditions of the working class. They note that power centers such as government or business use the language of identity politics to maintain goodwill and avoid giving meaningful economic concessions. Freddie deBoer explains this perspective in [Of Course You Know What Woke Means](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/of-course-you-know-what-woke-means). Also see /r/stupidpol for the anti-identitarian Marxist perspective; it's sidebar has links to essays.

These three groups define ""woke"" somewhat differently and object to it for different reasons, yet they're generally referring to a similar grouping of people who hold similar positions on a number of issues. No one would deny ""socialist"" is describes a real thing just because Republicans regularly misuse and abuse the term.

***

Objections

**""Woke"" just means ""aware of systemic oppression""**: yes, that's the original meaning, but words change. 

**""Woke"" is a bad/dumb word for it**: also Freddie  deBoer: [Please Just Fucking Tell Me What Term I Am Allowed to Use for the Sweeping Social and Political Changes You Demand](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/please-just-fucking-tell-me-what). 

**Bethany Mandel wrote a book about it but can't define it**. That interview was embarrassing, but one person or even many people using a word without being able to succinctly yet completely define it does not mean it's not a real category.

You do your due diligence online and find out jury duty only pays $30-$50 dollars a day. Clearly most Americans at the moment cannot afford to only be paid up to 50 dollars a day. 
So you tell the court you cannot attend due to financial hardship. The groups most likely to attend and participate are the wealthy and people below the poverty line who need the money. Paying out an equal amount of wages by your average hours/money made over a year not only allows a larger jury pool, but more accurate and less biased jury. Paying directly the amount you would make originally at work gives everyone the opportunity to go to jury duty without having an excuse not to get out of work because you simply can’t afford to do jury duty due to having bills to be paid. It would also allow for a larger and less biased jury pool."

0,2023-03-23,CMV: The theory of relativity provides evidence for a kind of Solipsism.,u/00darkfox00,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11zwdjo/cmv_the_theory_of_relativity_provides_evidence/,changemyview,"By theory of relativity I mean just that time is relative, in that If I traveled at lightspeed for a few minutes and returned to earth from my perspective it would be as if minutes passed and on Earth it would be as if years have passed.

By Solipsism I don't mean that other minds do not exist, I mean other minds exist but that they likely never share the same present moment.

Disclaimer: I have a basic idea of the theory of relativity, so I'm open to corrections, perhaps this is all crazy but from my understanding the following makes sense.

Regardless of the true nature of time, we perceive it as past, present and future, let's do a thought experiment:

Humanity consists of 5 people all were pulled from nothing and were born at the exact same time and let's say they are all of similar height, brain structure and stand shoulder to shoulder with each other so we can say for all intents and purposes they share the same present moment, When Bob looks at his watch it's 10:00AM, as it is with everyone else there, they all exist perceiving the same time. Bob leaves the other 4 and drives his car around for a few weeks/months however long it would take and returns to the exact spot he was standing with the other 4, but his watch now says 11:35AM, everyone else who remained sees 11:30AM on their watch.

Bob's effective ""present moment"" is at 11:35 AM, He exists in the same location however when Bob speaks to the other 4 he is effectively talking to their future selves, from the other 4's perspective it is still 11:30AM and Bob hasn't arrived yet. Extrapolating this to everyone on earth it appears to me as if we are all effectively alone in our own present bubble, everyone we talk to is either a future projection or past reflection of someone who has already or eventually will perceive the moment you believe is your present, it likely never matches up.

So, it's not exactly Solipsism, other minds probably exist, but we are all effectively alone in our own personal slice of the present."

The Supreme Court this year is expected to overturn the last remnants of Affirmative Action.Affirmative Action as it stands now is virtually toothless. The only thing still around is racial “consideration” not ,as is widely believed, “ race based admissions”. As such, Affirmative action as much as it still exists, should be upheld. 

It feels like everytime some Asian Americans and some White Americans don’t get into their dream school they blame affirmative action. They often erroneously accuse any black person of getting into a university because of long overturned admissions policy. 

In the article I have linked, one person said they “didn’t bother” to apply to Harvard because he “heard” that Asian Americans have a hard time getting in. Another woman said she was told to hide her heritage but still got into Yale. The article talked a lot about fear but nothing substantial. This is my issue with the whole affirmative action debate it seems like made up issues exploiting racial animus"

Having children is the most climate-damaging thing a person can do. 

The carbon footprint of parents is unlimited times bigger than people who do not have children and thus having children should be taxed to the max. 

People who choose not to have children should get huge benefits. Not having children is the most environment-friendly thing the average person can do. These people should be waivered from all taxes regarding the environment and should receive more direct benefits.  

Of course, it is useful for society that we have children but we just have to make it so expensive that we can plan and control our growth better than we do now.  

It is ok if only rich people can have children and that reproduction will be a luxury product. We can't continue like this and we have created money as society as the way to motivate ourselves to do actions that benefit society. We should use this tool for the most impactful action the average person will do in their lifetime: having children.


This should be a worldwide rule forced by the UN and should be relative per country so that people in every county have the chance to have children if they perform better than their peers in their direct environment."

He has some business and military experience, and being from North Carolina, I assume is pretty moderate.  I'm posting here as a way to vet this guy before I order bumper stickers.  A few arguments that probably won't change my mind:

(Edit) Nobody knows him -  The DNC was smart when it put Obama up front, even though he was an unknown.  He had charisma.   If you don't know, Jackson is racking up TikTok views quickly - for good reason.

Too young - We're living at a unique time in history where Old people are as ignorant as young people, just in different ways.  80 year old Presidents and 40 year old Presidents are not ideal, but I'd take the latter over the former.

Progressives wont like him - True, but I think deep down they know that Kamala is not going to beat Trump / De Santis.  And I hope they're smart enough to see the writing on the wall with Russia/China/Iran/Suadi Arabia, the new medieval world order.

He isn't running - I know, but I prefer people who don't want to be President.

A sperm is technically ""Living""  

 Are sperm alive? That really **depends on your definition of “alive.”** Sperm cells have some characteristics of living organisms: they metabolize sugars to produce energy, they grow (mature), and they move on their own. 

But on the same stance a fetus also have ""Characteristics of living organisms"". They also don't move on their own until a certian stage.

But that does not mean that neither sperm or fetus is alive. If you think that a fetus is alive upon fertilization of an egg, then so is a sperm because it is a mere few seconds difference of a sperm and a fertilized egg.  *Similar to how pro-lifer people say that a baby and a fetus are a mere few seconds of being the same thing.*

So shouldn't we make men be arrested for jerking of because they're killing thousands of ""Future babies that could've cured cancer"". And we should make them have vasectomies that *won't* cause them to die and are reversable to *prevent* The *murder* of many babies because a man wanted to cum-shot his wife? 

Because let's be honest abortions prevent the death of women through carrying a fetus. But you will stop *MILLIONS* of babies from dying if you force men to vasectomies. Vasectomies are also more effective.

And let's be real If a ***GUY*** didn't want to create life he wouldn't have sex with a female ***OR*** jack-off. He can EASILY prevent it by getting a vasectomy done in the first place"
0,2023-03-24,CMV: Panama and Costa Rica should be classified as South America rather than Central America,u/Obsidian2697,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/120eadr/cmv_panama_and_costa_rica_should_be_classified_as/,changemyview,"Ok, time for a quirky/fun one rather than the usually intense political/ethical ones.

Hear me out on this.

I was talking to my grandmother about the failing education system in my country and she was shocked when I told her it's not uncommon for me to encounter people who can't name 3 countries outside of the countries which make up the UK (my country) and Europe and that I will get people unironically call Asia and Africa countries.

She was curious about how many countries from each continent I could personally name and eventually we got to Central America where I could rattle off most of them except Panama and Costa Rica.

To me it makes zero logical sense for these 2 countries to be classed as ""Central"" America, when they are further south than areas of Colombia and Venezuela.

If you get a map of the world and put an X-Y axis on it, then take the most northern parts of Colombia and Venezuela and draw a horizontal line across them , thes there are parts of these countries which which run well into Nicaragua.

Therefore, to me, it only makes sense to say that if an entire country falls beneath the lines created by the most northern parts of these countries that those countries must also fall into the category of South America. Otherwise we should be classifying Venezuela and Colombia as ""Southern and (in northern regions) Central"" American countries. 

So whilst I appreciate they are not technically classed as South America, I believe they should be. 

How you can CMV: 

Explain to me how its possible to divide something up into 3 categories which can be put on an Y axis, and explain how on a scale of 0-10 (where 10 would be central america) you can have places closer to 10 be considered ""closer to 0"" than countries lower on the axis."

There is absoultely nothing wrong with that. But going from attraction to a crush is one of those things that would be on you. In my eyes, a person would have to purposely let it get that far. And that person is very irresponsible. 

I've dated quite a few people and have never had that feeling. In a relationship, I am always 100% devoted to my partner. I don't know about any of you, but when I get into a relationship, I let the person know I'm monogamous and expect monogamy. I think I was pretty lucky to find like-minded people to date and who don't make excuses for their behavior. Until I dated a virgin who claimed it was because they were inexperienced with relationships, both romantic/sexual and normal friendships. So I could kinda understand where they were coming from.  But at the same time, while I commended them for randomly being truthful (never asked), I also felt like it was all just a big excuse for their wild behavior. 

I would also like to point out, I only have one other female friend. (I am a woman for extra clarification) All of my friends have always been guys. It's totally possible to just be friends with the opposite sex with no feelings attached. 

Change my view please! I would like to try to see the other side of this. ♡ TY

UPDATE: I gotta go to work and probably won't be able to respond to any more comments for a while. So... so far I don't think my views on this has been changed. Just to quote a couple comments I had with a user: I really believe that a crush developing is something that is built up from different forms of attraction. And that a crush is attraction that is mishandled when it comes to already being in a relationship.---I think I was definitely touching on psuedo-romantic attraction forming. Such a thing just does not sit right with me in a relationship!"

I’m fairly sure the vast majority of people who watch these garbage podcasts have never actually talked to or properly spent time with women before. Watching fresh and fit and others of their ilk is nauseating enough but comments from their audience has convinced me of my point.

The way they talk about women like they are a separate species, talking about the wrongs of modern women, their bodycounts, and what they bring to the table in a relationship. The way they think a woman’s life is simply a hedonistic sex filled romp, where men just hand them piles of money. They have this delusion that 90% of women are on onlyfans, and millions upon millions of them are being flown out to Dubai to party on yachts. Genuinely insane beliefs.

Anyone who’s actually talked to or been with a woman will know what they bring to a relationship, companionship, love, emotional support, and so much more. If they knew women personally they’ll realise they aren’t so different  to men,  they’re just PEOPLE, as far as I’m concerned women’s want, needs worries and pursuits are fundamentally the same to that of a man in terms of finding a partner and life in general. Actually having a conversation with one, beyond just trying to sleep with them will yield such a conclusion.

It’s always hilarious when they talk about, when and if I find a girlfriend, admitting they have no experience with the opposite sex at all. It’s genuinely pathetic seeing so many lonely, repressed young men dogpile onto the anti woman circlejerk these so called alpha males and pick mes have created. 

They put they’re own insecurities and personal failings at the feet of women, jerking each other off as stoic and sigma and whatever other Greek letter they decide to bastardise this week. Instead of realising that they’re just unpleasant, repugnant people, who normal people don’t want to associate with because they are so disconnected from reality. Because off the internet they have nothing interesting to say or do to actually get women to talk to them or be interested in them, they think they’re muscles will magically attract every female in the vicinity like a lynx advert. Instead of trying to develop an actual interesting personality or develop basic social skills it’s all the women’s fault for not finding them attractive. 

The rest of their viewers are just jaded losers, who got rejected or maybe had one toxic relationship and have now decided to write off half of humanity based on one experience. Until the people who watch this rubbish actually grow up or get to know women on a genuine level, I foresee a bleak, lonely and miserable future for these lost chaps."

This is a colorblind and weaponized definition of racism which the right has successfully utilized and is taught in our basic American education. 

This definition has been used to successfully mount affirmative action challenges on behalf of Asian students who are being discriminated against in the current affirmative action scheme. Often conservative lobbyists will find an Asian or white student willing to sue the school and go to the courts to dismantle affirmative action. 

I think the implementation of affirmative action that singles out Asians as too qualified is wrong; the schools have implemented affirmative action wrong. Asians are an underprivileged group who experience racism and thus should be benefactors of affirmative action. 

The left’s definition of racism is, to quote Ibram X. Kendi, “a marriage of racist policies and racist ideas that produces and normalizes racial inequities.”

This definition is more complex and is not taught in schools. But racial inequity seems like an intuitive concept to understand. So by this measure, affirmative action and reparations are both Antiracist measures that are struggling against racial inequality. 

Affirmative action fails to do so because of how Asians are treated and only Evanston, Illinois has implemented reparations. 

I don’t understand why the basic colorblind definition of racism is the one people seem to use."

From my reading of the crisis, there are many small issues - like a general context of Macron seeming aloof, Macron forcing the bill through parliament without a vote, and French police being violent with protestors, etc, but I'd like to focus on what I hope we can all agree is actually the single most important issue here - the actual raising of the retirement age from 62 to 64. 

What seems clear to me is that the current French pension system is broken - it is designed to redistribute wealth and income from people who are making money now to people who are in retirement now (which is how all pension systems work), but therefore like all other pension systems they didn't consider how much tax pressure that would put on the younger generations when the number of retired people is high but because of declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy across Europe the number of working people is lower (at the very least the ratio of retired people to working people is going to be much higher than when these systems were designed which means that this level of pressure on the working population was never part of the plan) \[Some stats for this, in 2013 the ratio was 0.26, in 2023 it is now 0.3, in 2033 it is expected to be 0.38 ([https://data.oecd.org/pop/elderly-population.htm](https://data.oecd.org/pop/elderly-population.htm))\]. The French monitoring organization predicts a deficit over the next decade. People might say that even if this is true,  it is okay because not every government enterprise needs to turn a profit, but I disagree with this - the pension system is as of now France's biggest money sink, in a world where they simply cannot afford to be bleeding money -

* France is not a fast-growing economy, they are expected to grow by only 1.5% max on average for the next 10 years, they are also in a uniquely bad time with the Ukraine war expected to go on for years, meaning their energy crisis isn't going to go back to the pre-2020 free Russian gas equilibrium, which will only make things harder, inflation is still pretty bad - this is not the kind of economy that can spend money without thinking about it, money is always limited, but for some countries, it is more limited than others, I'm not saying France shouldn't be spending money, but they have enough problems that I really don't think they need a money sink like this current pension system to deal with as well.  
* Every Euro spent on the pension system is a euro that could have been spent on other programs that everyone including the French people think is a requirement - education, healthcare, poverty welfare schemes, I like pro-welfare policies, I think they help the people we need to help the most while also being able to boost your economy if done right, this actively gets in the way of it because as of the past 5 years, the pension system has been taking money from other govt expenditure pots to make up for their deficit. 

This is not a sustainable system, and it clearly needs to change. I'm not saying the deficit needs to be completely eliminated, but the current severity of it is not acceptable, something has to be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are two ways to change this - reduce the expenditure of the pension system, or increase the revenue/inflows of the system. Macron's solution is one that will reduce the expenditure, while alternatives like increasing the tax on people (whether it's just the rich or the middle class) would increase the inflow.

&amp;#x200B;

The French people would have a problem with any expenditure reduction: whether it is reducing the pension amount, reducing the number of people to whom it is given, or as we see here an increase in retirement age - so those options are out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see precious little discussion on why a tax increase on the average person or middle class is either fair or a viable option is given the current economic climate - Europe is dangerously close to a recession and is not expected to make a quick recovery anytime soon, this is the worst time to increase the tax burden on people because it will make the economy even weaker, and if a tax is imposed in the next year or two it has the real risk of driving growth rates to the negative, which in the past causes recessionary spirals that are incredibly hard to recover from. I'm not saying this solution is completely unreasonable, but no one from the french protestors camp, whether its people on the streets or political parties backing the protests or intellectuals backing the protests has put forward a convincing enough argument that there exists a tax increase which could solve this problem and not be disastrous. 

&amp;#x200B;

But more generally when it comes to taxation, even if you claim that you can get away with only taxing wealthy people who we don't care about losing money or incentive to work (I would argue in the current regime of rising interest rates in countries like the US imposing some sort of wealth tax while appealing would be catastrophic as it will incentivize short term capital outflow from France but lets even say thats not an issue) I disagree with the idea that this is a problem that can be solved by an increasing of some external tax - because if it is possible to increase the tax on the people (or rich) in some way, there is a good argument that this money should then go to more meaningful, structural investments that the country badly needs - like Healthcare, education, infrastructure etc (these also affect the most vulnerable most, these also affect the people the most, and these will help France keep its economy going and maybe modernize a bit making everyone more wealthy), so I am not convinced that a tax is the solution to this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't see what the French people want. Finally, let me be clear on what I mean by ""unreasonable"", this is a nebulous word and people can easily say that nothing is every ""unreasonable"" because if the French people care deeply about something then they should be able to protest it end of story. For the purposes of this CMV, when I say unreasonable I mean I do not think that the people shouting fowl here have an alternate solution that is better for the nation as a whole in the medium / long term."

812,2023-03-24,CMV: Colombia should have legalized cocaine in the 90's rather than allow US intervention within the Country,u/shadadada,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1211kll/cmv_colombia_should_have_legalized_cocaine_in_the/,changemyview,"Not a hill i'm dying on by any means but I had this thought for awhile being Colombian myself. 

I felt that the US never cared to help Colombia with there drug problem anymore so than making sure they didn't have to deal with it's repercussions internally. It's always been very evident that often in battles and 'political' wars; the countries that ultimately lose are the one who had to be the battlefield for said wars.

Colombia gave itself more significant pains and long-lasting impacts from enabling the US to come into the country and arming it for the sole reason of fighting narco-trafficking. Colombia has been dealt with numerous blows from paramilitary groups that stem from the intervention of the US and their political beliefs and justifications that still trouble the country today.

If we look at the legalization of the drug, lets first focus on the economic impact: It would have severely opened up an exorbitantly profitable industry within the nation that was highly valued all around the world. To re-iterate... at his highest; even after the immense wealth lost from spending to cover their operation, Escobar still was left with a net wealth of 30 billion back IN THE 90's! and it wasn't just him. The wealthiest drug lords in the world have been cocaine empires from Colombia by a large margin. The conflict with cocaine benefited the US's war on drugs rather at the cost of Colombia's economic benefit. 

This would have obviously been a highly controversial move for Colombia but had Colombia shifted its operation to instead work cooperatively with the drug, who knows if cocaine would be seen as no different than swiss bank accounts or legal arms dealers? Cocaine indirectly was causing problems to people in other nations no different than when Lockheed martin products cause pain around the world or Swiss bank accounts allow the absolute worst of the worst criminals become untraceable. 

If the US or the world wants to intervene so be it.. but Colombia could have benefitted itself by forcing the fight to have to occur outside its borders instead. There would have definitely been violence occur internally before a mutually beneficial agreement were to settle between cartels and the government, but then it would have primarily left only the issue of how the drugs find their way to other countries, which in what is of interest to Colombia as a country, isn't their problem.

I even go as far as reckon that had the nature of cartels not been militarized and already powerful from the jump, the US after defeating it would have found ways of controlling the production of coke from Colombia much in the same way it has with other global resources, they have just failed to own these operations and win. 

It should not be seen as any different as the oil or liquor industry history within the US"

If you like the NBA, I am genuinely interested in what makes you like the game of basketball and the NBA.

Generally, I don't find basketball to be a very exciting sport. It's higher scoring than football and soccer, but I don't care about that at all. I don't really get how defense is played when I see players dribbling right in front of defenders with no consequences. It seems like fouling is so prevalent with fouls being given for relatively slight contact. It's just not pleasing for me to watch that. 

At least with March Madness, you have the hype of upsets. The NBA regular season has so many games that each game is less important. So many teams make the playoffs too...

I know the league is more player-driven than the NFL. However, there aren't any players in the NBA I care about. If you do have a player you root for, I'd be interested to know what makes you a fan of that player.

I know the NBA is more popular than the NFL internationally, but domestically, the NFL just feels bigger and more important. It feels like the NBA is second fiddle to the NFL with the NFL draft mattering more, each NFL game mattering more and the Super Bowl mattering more than the NBA finals."

I don’t see a way to get a new job unless you learn the language of an industry, and it’s not even about skills, it’s literally how familiar you are with the language of the trade. I’m curious if others believe different.

I’m aware of my own literacy issues, and I have parents that are immigrants to America.

So I feel often at a disadvantage because of my lack of language skills and lack of confidence in my current skillset.

So I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this is if this is unique to my experience.

1,2023-03-24,CMV: I'm in a simulation.,u/yosemighty_sam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1218trm/cmv_im_in_a_simulation/,changemyview,"I am finding it difficult to ignore the probability that I am a part of a historical simulation. Most likely not human, but simply a self aware component, or more literally, a component that acts and ""feels"" as though it were self aware. The difference there is negligible if not moot.

I think the trends in technology are clear, that convincing historical simulations eventually can be created, and by Murphy's Law, will be created. If that's true, of all the points in history we could be experiencing, it's quite a coincidence that we're ""living"" a the point in time when something like a simulation first seems possible. So it's probably not a coincidence, this is probably just a uniquely interesting and/or important point in history. 

Natural language processing, the calling card of the singularity, has finally been achieved, and it works by training with large data sets. Seems like a historical simulation is not just a possibility, but a clear goal for current technology. It's inevitable that someone will train an AI by running countless simulations of historical events, perhaps in order to predict and/or navigate future events. And it seems natural that you'd want to populate it with people (programs) that behave with autonomy, non-deterministically: you'd want to simulate free will. 

So, what other conclusion can we draw? If there is just 1 simulation running, then there's a 50% chance I'm in it. But there probably are or will be millions of simulations running, that means I'm most likely in one. 

(Arguments about resolution, memory, and bandwidth seem very silly to me. There are countless optimizations we could think of today, and an unthinkable number of optimizations we can't think of. But I'm curious to hear if anyone has something convincing on this side of things.)"

The spectrum of mental health illnesses have 5 zone's; excelling, thriving, surviving, struggling, and in crisis. Even though excelling and thriving are quite obvious, most people are either excelling or surviving, the thriving zone doesn't seems to exist, the same thing happens with struggling, you either surviving or in crisis, struggling doesn't seems to exist. 

You could be anxious or depressed but be in the excelling or thriving zone, but because thriving isn't clearly defined, you will jump straight from excelling to surviving, and because struggling isn't clearly defined neither, you will jump from surviving straight into in crisis, and that's the problematic area. 

Most people with mental health issues are often just surviving, tip toeing between excelling on their lives, or falling into a crisis, but often mental health professionals will put people on the in “between” category, give us some drugs, and recommended therapy that often is impossible to obtain. It is in this area where people will more often than not fall into a crisis instead of a recovery. 

My view is that the so call spectrum needs to be reviewed, it needs to be widen, early prevention and identification of a declining behaviour,  will stop people from deteriorating into serious issues that could lead to suicide, or even committing murder. 

The in crisis zone should be further in the spectrum,  and more focus should be put on the thriving and surviving zone’s, because it is in this area where proactive help can be given to stop people from deteriorating further"

Throughout history, pride has been a powerful tool for destruction more than it's helped make things better. Pride in countries, pride in religions, pride in race, pride in sports, pride in sexuality. All of these things are arbitrary and are based on concepts that don't actually exist or matter. We are all randomly generated, and so it just makes no sense for me to have pride in something I haven't chosen for myself, or is a matter of the circumstances in which I exist. 

An argument against this, is that pride has historically also been a shield to protect marginalized and abused groups... From other people with pride, but more power &amp; influence. The pendulum continues shifting back and forth, with balance not being possible because as long as have pride in our differences, we will never be able to see past that. The pride saved us, but will also destroy us. 

The ebb and flow of societal growth continues changing who has a right to ""pride"" which causes further division &amp; infighting. I can't help but revisit the phrase ""pride cometh before the fall"" and asking myself why pride had been considered a mortal sin. Though not religious, I try to see the philosophical or logical reasoning behind these ancient wisdoms that exist across multiple schools of thought. It puts the one before the all, and the us before the them. 

The only time I see pride as beneficial, is when it's something achieved through hard work and adversity, not when it's inherited or accidental."

There are 3 ways for this to last forever:

1. Exponential population growth: ZERO rich western country meets this metric. Birth rate is low everywhere, and people live much longer than before. There will be too many pensioners per tax payers.
2. Slavery: self explanatory
3. Large supply of cheap people from poor countries to exploit: this was achieved in the past in rich countries by outsourcing everything to poor countries. It kinda isn't exploitation, because it helped raise living standard everywhere. But higher living standards oversea also means it's harder to exploit them. We will have to find new places to exploit after China becomes too expensive (currently it's India, South East Asia, or Africa).
4. Super advance technology that save the world, robots producing unlimited food, and a government that actually distribute that food fairly while not abusing their power. Yeah, not happening any time soon.

In all countries, pension schemes are just old people taking money away from the younger generation. The system will most likely collapse before Gen Z (or late millennials) see a single cent paid back to them. It worked in the past because we satisfied point 1 and 3, and also because western countries got rich from all those years colonizing the world (why is 1 European human life hour worth 10x more than 1 Bangladesh human life hour?)

Questions you might ask:

1. **Who will care for old people?** Their children, and their own life savings. This actually encourage being a good parent, else your kid will abandon you later.
2. **Does that mean people just work to death?** If you spend your money irresponsibly and have no children then yes. But if you save money and invest, you can retire with your own money.
3. **Government can literally print money to pay for pension.** I've seen it on Reddit and not sure if people are just joking, but doing this cause inflation and the young generation will suffer the most, as most of them haven't got assets that grow faster than inflation. Also look at Venezuela
4. **What about immigration?** This is a valid solution, the USA is the leader in this aspect. Immigration solves problem (1), but the downside is that it might culturally change the country, which many people don't like. Also there's the risk that some immigrants cost more welfare money than the amount of tax they pay.
5. **Countries can invest taxpayer's money, so it doesn't require much population growth?** Most popular example is Norway. But they have oil money, and it's impossible for all countries to survive by ""investing"". At the end of the day, some poor countries have to do the hard work of producing food/products/etc. On a smaller scale, this is similar to high paying finance jobs Vs essential workers, we already know which one is more important.

Note that this discussion is totally unrelated to other aspect of social welfare. We still aim for cheap healthcare, free education, etc, just abolish the pension system.

French protests are a hot topic on social media right now. They can protest as much as they want, but without some serious changes, it's just stealing from the future to pay for the present."

If another person made the same exact argument, would it suddenly become valid? But if you have no argument and find out you're arguing with someone under 18 then I guess you can just claim their opinion does not matter? Dumb. Like if you are x then somebody says y instead and gives z argument, but you can not fight against z argument as a way of defending x then you go through their profile to see if they have anything else you can insult instead if just insulting y. Then you see the person defending y is 15, and suddenly you no longer have to defend x, you can just insult the person defending y. In that case if somebody older came and started defending y and insulting x, then what would you argue against that? Why does the age of a person determine how good their arguments are. Very dumb.

Edit: So after reading the comments, I've come to the conclusion that age can sometimes matter, if its based off experience. I still believe that in the majority of arguments it doesnt."

I am saying this should happen, not that it ever will. For the sake of discussion, let's assume that nations ratify the necessary laws and generally attempt to enforce it.

Structurally, this would be something along the lines of a simple law that says that any country crossing the border into another recognized country without that country's government's consent counts as an invasion. By tying this to a law rather than a vote, there is less risk of abusing the law. Each country would provide manpower and funding in proportion to their population. In the event of the UN military getting involved, combatants from the aggressor would be removed from the military.

1) By having a clear law, there is less room for miscalculation. Most interstate wars since WWII have been caused by nations believing they could attack another country without foreign intervention. For example, Russia assumed that there would be very little outside intervention in their invasion of Ukraine. With a clear law, there would be less risk of a nation attacking another with the expectation that there won't be intervention.

2) There would be less risk of retaliation if the military can't be associated with a country. Russia can currently threaten to nuke or cut off gas with whoever opposes them, but if the military is not associated with an individual country, that retaliation would be much less effective.

3) This would be much less costly than every nation developing their own military. To be able to combat the most populous nation, this military would only need about .025% of each country's population. For reference, the US has about .31% of its population in its military. It would also be much cheaper as the money could be spread out across many countries.

4) This gives big nations less power over international affairs. Countries no longer have to appease the US, Russia, or China just for their continued existence.

Also, before somebody mentions that countries just won't authorize defense, just remember that almost every UN country denounced Russia."

I believe that human existence is vastly imagined. Children play make believe naturally, they play these make believe games constantly and us older humans kind of dismiss it as just kids being kids. I am now convinced it is much deeper than that. I am now inclined to think that humans never actually grow out of this make believe phase as many of us believe we do. I think as we get older , we just shift what we imagine we are to fit the society we are in. This shift, however real it feels, is not any less of a make believe game as the little boy pretending he is superman or the little girl pretending to be a princess. I think that along with age we begin to lose sight of the fact that we are just playing a role. We may practice medicine but the role of doctor, which comes with certain baggage in society is a role we pretend and judge ourselves based on. Every position in society is in part an imagined role. The action and the role just merge together to form the perception that they are the same thing. We imagine values,we imagine ourselves, we imagine pretty much everything. We take these imaginations as if they were realer than they really are. This wild imagination is the creator of suffering in society and in individuals. That may sound dumb but basically i feel that the majority of human society is us playing make believe and taking it all too serious."
864,2023-03-25,CMV: Walmart is bad for poor people,u/spiegro,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1229q67/cmv_walmart_is_bad_for_poor_people/,changemyview,"Even if discounting the overwhelming net-negative impact on a community's ability to generate and keep wealth,  Walmart's prices only saves a family $640/year, and only if spending there exclusively and making ~$80k+/year.

In a thread about a recent looting of Walmart a few Redditors were sticking up for the company, as if the conglomerate needs their support or protection. 

What was more curious was the claim that Walmart is good for poor people because of their low prices. 

The thread was locked before any could reply back to my point, that Walmarts are almost entirely net-negatives for the communities they're in, forcing out competition and driving down wages for everyone. The stores and the entire organization's business model is to extract money from consumers while intentionally disenfranchising its employees and all of those in the area. 

I didn't think this was a controversial take, but in being challenged I went to find some sources. 

It's clear that these stores funnel money directly away from communities and into the pockets of a single family. But what wasn't clear was how much savings a family could miss out on by shopping with integrity and not giving Walmart any of your hard earned money.

Less than $700. And despite the article being written a while ago, the facts still remain, and  perception of savings even more delusional given the staggering increase of inflation in recent years.

And those ""savings"" are only really ever present artificially just to get you in the door. Once there you'll likely buy something else that's not the deal the original item might have been. Furthermore, those ""savings"" can usually be had at other stores as well. Like, all of them. Retailers are very sensitive to being beat on price, and will adjust to get closer to Walmart's prices. 

The very few instances where Walmart may be of any use is in desolate rural communities that have absolutely no other viable options but mildly regional store placed within a modest drive, of which the article stated there are few.

*CMV*: I haven't heard any convincing data or opinions about anything of value Walmart stores do for poor people outside of a quick and temporary cost saving on very few goods. The articles I read were old, and perhaps Walmart has modernized their business practices to be more economically viable for the communities they're in. 

Links to articles I was looking at:

- https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2405-real-cost-walmart.html
-https://www.marketplace.org/2009/11/23/does-wal-mart-really-save-you-money/


Edit: Thanks for weighing in y'all. Feel like this discussion keeps getting bogged down in things that aren't talking about my view. It's kind of run its course.

I really only created this thread so I could hear what those other folks were saying in that locked thread. 

But it's all good, I got what I needed from this post, and I do genuinely appreciate everyone being respectful in explaining their views. 

It's late where I live, and need to go to bed. I don't know if that means this thread will get locked because I won't be responding for quite a few hours (I got stuff on in the morning). 

If it's not locked tomorrow I can try to respond to some of the responses to my own. But this is kinda exhausting and not that fun. So probably would rather not unless someone wants to talk about it more. 

Walmart sucks, but if you need them I won't be judging anyone for their choices on this matter. Cheaper shit ain't always the answer y'all.

If you think you have a good point, take a peek through the comment section. I’ve responded to 30+ comments already, and have been seeing a lot of repetition. If I don’t respond to you, it’s probably because someone has already tried to make that argument.**

There’s nothing more passive aggressive than downvoting a post or comment on Reddit because you disagree with them on something, but then never saying anything about why you disagree. It’s like, giving someone a dirty look and then walking away. What good does that do?

**I propose a new system instead:**

Every time someone downvotes a post or a comment, then they are forced, by the software of the app, to submit a response for why they disagree

This solves two issues:

1. Most people will find that it just isn’t worth being angry about things that aren’t all that important. 

2. For the people that do care, or for the disagreements that do matter, it encourages debate and truth-seeking. 

There is nothing “truth-seeking” about a bunch of down-facing arrows, but by encouraging healthy debate, we can make Reddit a better site for everyone.

The point of this system is to encourage debate. If someone received a bunch of downvotes, they are left doubting their view without a proper response. Sure, you may have filtered out bad advice, but it’s at the cost of someone being left without advice, the very thing you had sought to promote in the first place, ironically.

Edit: **Rebuttal to Comments**

_The downvote system is a democratic ranking to find the most useful information, and to ignore the junk_

Downvoting is a privilege that was given to everyone on every social platform, however, we’ve abused it greatly, and there’s no way of fixing it besides implementing the system I’ve suggested.

This is how the downvote system should work in theory, but we do not live in a perfect world. By human inclination, we downvote things that we personally disagree with even if it does contribute to the debate. Many topics that could be debated are dismissed entirely because of downvotes. Everyone that wants to find the truth deserves a sincere response. While downvoting may be the easiest option, it is not the best option.

Besides, junk is ultimately up to the moderators to deal with. The moderators are the janitors of the restaurant, and we the reddit’r’s are the one’s who order from the restaurant, so to speak. If there’s a mess that needs cleaning, the the janitors handle it. It’s not worth your time as the customer.

_People just use cliches while debating_

I think this is actually a symptom of downvoting, and social media in general: we’ve lost the ability and patience to debate a topic thoroughly. Instead, we just downvote.

By encouraging people to debate, we’ll come to see each other eye-to-eye, even if we disagree. This is more a matter of learning how to properly debate. Avoiding the issue and dismissing someone, even if they’re just using cliches, doesn’t solve the issue. It only makes it worse.

_What about subreddits that encourage debate?_

What works for certain subreddits cannot work for all of Reddit. In subreddits where the whole purpose of it is to debate topics thoroughly (such as this one), and there’s a common decency between each user, then implementing this feature may not be as necessary. In other words, there are exceptions.

However, the upvote system works fine by itself as the sole contributor to a democratic topic-rating-system. And besides, stating why you disagree is what we _should_ do. We should respect each other enough to correct someone of what you believe to be an incorrect view

_Doesn’t this encourage troll feeding?_

Trolls are an irreversible evil, unfortunately. As long as mankind lives, there will never be a fix to trolls. However, they are quite easy to find. If not already obvious by their post, questioning a troll once or twice should suffice. Also, “0 upvotes” will be the new norm for comments you should probably not reply to.

If someone keeps commenting on a troll’s post, despite all the red flags listed above and having the time to think about what they want to say and how to say it, they’ve only brought it upon themselves. You can’t blame the system for your own ignorance

_Miscellaneous comment threads that answer stuff_

Firstly, just because most of reddit is merely content consumption, it doesn’t discredit this system. People share some interesting opinions that are worth exploring further, no matter what subreddit you are on.

Secondly, downvoting is a privilege that we’ve abused for reasons I’ve already listed. Either we can be passive aggressive, or we can engage with people on a more meaningful level. The problem is common enough for it to be addressed.

We can do just fine with upvotes: upvote the comments that are good, and ignore the comments that are bad. Like I’ve said in my rebuttal and in other threads as well, comments left at 0 will be the new norm for what should be seen as junk or a trolling attempt. It’s not rocket science.

I think the biggest hurdle for most people that try to rebut this point is that they just can’t seem to imagine Reddit without downvotes, like having a discussion over something you disagree with is too direct or labor intensive. This is at least what I’ve gotten from all the 30+ comments I’ve replied to.

And finally, some people have claimed that I’ve been downvoted because I wasn’t meaningful enough with my response. Well at least I actually gave one. Because apparently downvoting a response is actually more meaningful than stating why I was wasn’t meaningful in the response I actually gave… do you see the hypocrisy here?"

Democratisation cannot exist in a capitalist economy.

All democratisation does is devalue design and art, we live in an economic system where you're subject to homelessness if you're aren't able to make money or don't already have access to money. So people who choose careers as artists are unable to pursue art purely as a means of creation and expression, and instead get it tangled up with the requirement to make money in order to survive.

If you took away that requirement, suddenly there's no more ""AI art is stealing our jobs"" rhetoric, and it could be seen as the amazing tool for expression that it is. Other concerns would remain, but this particular avenue of backlash totally depends on the exploitative economic system that we're all subject to.

Everyone on Instagram has a pirated copy of Adobe suite and is now a designer, imagine if we treated law, finance and any other professional field the same.

And I GET that art is different to law, finance etc but until UBI is a thing, then yeah - I'm gonna gatekeep what I do for a career with what you do ""just for fun"".

Point 1: It makes interpersonal relationships cold and tense. If you're not supposed to give trouble to others you don't have the chance to vent to your friends, or to seek help even if you need it. Because venting and recieving help, whether materially or emotionally is giving trouble to others and is often socially stigmatized. This makes people interact less and superficially with each other, there is barely any real friendship. It's harder to form emotional bonds because you aren't supposed to talk about deep stuff or help each other, instead everyone is encouraged to just mind their own business.

Point 2: It deepens the social stigma of mentally ill and neurodivergent people because of their weird, often socially ""inappropriate"" behaviour. I have bipolar 2 (taking meds for that) and probably Asperger's. Not only me, many mentally ill people fail to observe the manner of ""not giving trouble to others"". We need to be forgiven if we apologize and it didn't cause any real lasting harm. If such behaviour did cause real harm to others then we need to be punished, but if there is no such harm then we shouldn't be punished so heavily for breaking social manner codes, for reasons that are out of our control. Edit: Deleted the personal experience part in fear of doxxing. 

Point 3: It discourages people who need help from seeking it, worsening many people's mental and physical illnesses. That's quite simple. Recieving help is discriminated against which makes many people keep their needs to themselves. 

Point 4: There are no people giving out help without people recieving help. Discouraging seeking help and ""giving trouble to others"" is also indirectly discouraging offering help, because people who need help often hide it and are often too shy to accept help even if it's offered. As a result people who offer help and charity would feel frustrated and stop doing so."

There has been zero progress especially in Crimea, which Russia has turned into a fortress and can resupply at will by sea or the bridge.

The Russian military has suffered casualties exceeding a hundred thousand. Which sounds like a lot, until you realize that the Soviet Union lost *more than 20 million people* in World War II, and yet managed to emerge as a superpower immediately afterwards. At this rate, Russia can keep this up forever.

The West has thrown the strongest sanctions in living memory at Russia, and while they have certainly hurt the Russian economy, nobody seriously believes they will stop the invasion.

Russia itself is of course untouchable militarily because of their massive nuclear arsenal. They can essentially do what they want, and imposing sanctions and supplying their enemies is pretty much the only thing the West can do. They’ve been doing it for a year and it hasn’t stopped the invasion, and if there’s a concrete plan for that to change, I haven’t seen it.

Ukraine has received some of the most modern weapons available from Western production, as well as an unprecedented amount of humanitarian and infrastructure aid. It has no doubt made a difference, but not the difference between being invaded or not. There are no signs of the Russian government losing the will to fight, and pipe dreams of Putin being swiftly deposed by his oligarchs have evaporated. For the foreseeable future, there will always be customers for Russian petroleum products, so they aren’t going to run out of money anytime soon.

And of course, a Ukrainian victory would be an enormous victory by proxy for the Western world. Anti-Western powers like China and India are going to pour all available resources into making sure that doesn’t happen.

Considering all that, it seems completely unrealistic to push Russia out of Ukraine, both by military force and indirectly through sanctions. Change my view!"

Let me start by explaining what's Political correctness, it's basically being careful with what you say, or do, in order to don't offend people on disadvantaged, or discriminated social groups.

In other words, calling a petite person a dwarf, could be seeing as politically incorrect, the politically correct term will be ""handicap"", even though, that handicap itself can also be seeing as politically incorrect by people with dwarfism, they might not want to be seen as handicap or disable, in that case handicap is also politically incorrect.

You can easily see how I probably being politically incorrect, just by talking about political correctness..So far, so good, most of us understand that what we say or do could be offensive if used in the wrong context..

My problem is that this days everything is politically incorrect, you literarily can't say anything without offending someone, to the point that you will deliberately avoid talking to specific people, just incase you say something offensive, we all been there.

Political correctness is necessary, but is getting to a point that you can't express any views without offending someone, is getting out of control."

0,2023-03-26,CMV: Ex-colony cultures don't deserve any moral supremacy over ex-empires who colonized them,u/Big_Dick920,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/122q15j/cmv_excolony_cultures_dont_deserve_any_moral/,changemyview,"Some people think that belonging to a culture that was colonized by someone in the past gives them moral supremacy over the people of the colonizer culture. For example, I have a friend from a Central Asian country which was part of Russian Empire. He thinks that

1. Russians ethnicals or Russian speakers should not use traditional Russian spelling or pronunciation of toponyms in his country — they must spell them the way it's done in his native language.

2. but at the same time he can use whatever spelling he likes for Russian toponyms. For example, he can say Maskeu (his native language) instead of Moskva (Russian).

He demands that Russian ethnicals should be more aware of what happened in the past, and insists that they are not feeling guilty enough for it. And his country has a significant percentage of Russian ethnicals who were born there and who, as people, didn't do anything to him. They are citizens of that country same as him, and they deserve the right to keep their language and their culture without having to apologize to anyone.

I think his stance is hypocritical and absolutely unjustified. This is his own xenophobia and self-servingly picked ethical principles, which normally would not be tolerated in a civilized society, but now with woke agenda he is somehow allowed to be publicly display this attitude and be called a progressive instead of douchebag.

I gave my friend as a concrete example, but I think that this type of attitude is common, especially in the West. It also applies to some of the Ukrainians who are being very hateful towards Russian culture because of the war.

To summarize, my two problems with this stance are:

1. The moral principles it's based on are hand-picked to serve (presumably) oppressed people's sense of self-pity, not limited by anything. Unless restrained by self-control or some reasonable public criticism, a person will come to the conclusion that they're the most wronged one in the world and everyone owes them something (like Putin does when he explains why he invaded Ukraine). And this progressive anti-colonialist agenda is reinforcing this effect.

2. I don't think there's any point in blaming empires of 17-19 centuries for colonizing other countries and trying to multiply their power (although it's ok to blame them for some concrete atrocities and genocide that may not have been necessary). Anyone who didn't do that back then got subdued by others — we didn't have the economical and political situation of nowadays that prevents that. And blaming Russia for colonizing Central Asia is like blaming it for choosing (and being able) not to be colonized by others, and not ending up whining now about anti-colonialism like my friend does.

   Also, those colonized countries weren't harmless either. Central Asian nomads raided and fought Russians way before Russia became an empire. Mongol invasion came from them. I don't see any point in this search for historical justice. It's inconsistent, it's cherry-picking facts in a self-serving manner. Russia was subdued and nearly colonized by other countries before it became empire.

I do allow though the colonized cultures to feel traumatized about the past and to ask (nicely) the other to be compassionate and understanding. And I believe that any decent person should give them that (as long as they're doing the same). But it is a favor, not an obligation."

0,2023-03-26,CMV: Most people aren't responsible for the bulk of their behavior.,u/thelink225,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/122sujm/cmv_most_people_arent_responsible_for_the_bulk_of/,changemyview,"My contention is simple:

People are physical beings. All things that exist are necessarily physical (we can have this argument if you want, I'm prepared for it), so everything that comprises a person must necessarily also be physical. All thought and behavior is the result of a physical organ, the brain. To operate, the brain is constrained by physical parameters — chemical makeup, the information and connections within it, and so on. If any measure of free will exists — and I do personally believe that it does — it is necessarily facilitated by, and therefore constrained by, these factors. A person can only act and make lucid free will decisions (if free will exists) to the degree that the physical factors within their brain enable them to do so. If those factors are not adequately functional, or if they are inhibited in some way, then any faculty of free will that might exist is constrained, or completely disabled, in its operation.

Personal responsibility implies the ability to respond with the characteristics of a person — that is, with lucid agency, the capacity to exercise meaningful and empowered metacognition and executive function over one's decisions. It is the capacity to act toward a situation with empowered and functional free will. If a person cannot exercise these faculties over their thoughts and behaviors, then they have no means by which to exercise any sort of meaningful responsibility. No one can brightly be considered responsible for what they do not meaningfully have control over. We could not rightly hold someone meaningfully responsible for lifting the Eiffel Tower unaided, nor could we expect a quadriplegic to be responsible for doing 50 jumping jacks. So why would we treat the brain differently than any of these other physical parameters? How could we rightly hold someone responsible for behaviors or decisions that they could not meaningfully exercise?

I do believe that most people have the potential to exercise such decisions — but, as society currently is, most lack the actual resources to do so. Most of these resources, if they have ever existed, have eroded away. Perhaps the most prominent of these is education and information. The quality of education, at least anywhere that I have been, has been abysmal — education primarily consists of memorizing what you are told by supposed experts. Things like critical thinking, critical analysis, news analysis, and even practical everyday applications of scientific method simply aren't taught, except in some higher level university courses which most of the public never gets to take. Media seems to work mostly the same way, with a bunch of people telling you what to think and how to think about it, and often quite a bit of conflicting information being used to bombard the public, creating quite a lot of confusion. It often seems that many people aren't even living in the same reality in terms of what they believe. We live in a post-truth society where even someone with those skills, unless they have a lot of time and resources to focus on it, will have trouble distilling the truth of a matter. I know I struggle with it. As a result, you have some people believing that masks and vaccines are more dangerous than a global pandemic, or that the Earth is flat and 6000 years old — and the people who know better often only do so because they just happened to listen to the right authorities or talking heads. If people do not have the educational and intellectual capacity to work their way through these things, then they have no capacity to exercise lucid agency over it — they are responding to environmental conditions, not making executive decisions over their behavior. We can see this in trends like regions were certain religions, worldviews, and cultural practices are more prominent than others. It's clear that people are adopting these things because of the information and social pressures to conform to it they are most exposed to — if the majority of people had the capacity to override this, you would expect to see this trend happen a lot less, but that's not what we observe. Instead, we observe areas that are overwhelmingly Muslim or Christian, conservative or liberal, pro-intellectual or anti-intellectual. Where there is overlap and mixing, we see people arrange themselves together in echo chambers — and where these echo chambers collide, we frequently see unresolvable conflict. Rather than breeding growth and change, which is what you would expect if the individuals who comprise these monolithic communities were empowered free thinking individuals, you see them constantly self-reinforce and spread like a mind virus, with the most contagious and inflammatory ideas spreading much faster than any sort of reasonability. An individual, of course, can accept all sorts of horrible ideas and cling to them stubbornly even with pure unfettered free will — but to see this repeat in a consistent pattern throughout a society strongly implies that something else is going on.

However, another problem that might be equally as bad is the breakdown of functional support systems for people — families (not necessarily the nuclear family, or people related by blood, but those who serve the function of a family), the tribe, and the community. This might seem like the opposite of everything I just said, but I would assert that these points are complimentary, not contradictory. If the issues that I raised above are true, and the intellectual and cultural environment around a person can inhibit their free will, then the reverse is also true — a healthy intellectual and cultural environment can empower a person to exercise that free will in a lucid fashion. Additionally, we can see that person is far more likely to make healthy and reasonable decisions if they are being supported by people around them, both in reinforcing their identity as someone who makes those sorts of decisions, as well as taking some of the burden off of them when certain aspects of those decisions stretch their physical and mental resources. Most of these echo chambers barely function as support systems in this manner. What we have instead is a society where people are increasingly isolated and individualistic, left to their own devices in a society that is demanding more and more of them, and where most social interaction serves to confirm biases rather than support and empower one another. There is more interaction than ever thanks to the internet, but very little practicable solidarity. This leaves people stripped of the resources they need to be a fully functional person. And this is just the average person — it's to say nothing of someone with serious mental health issues who can't obtain the treatment they need and is left to their own devices.

All of this seems to going to the conclusion that people are profoundly affected by their environment, in ways that are greatly limiting to their capacity to exercise lucid and meaningful agency over their person. We have barely even touched on intrinsic factors like intellectual ability or mental illness not due to environment. If nature, nurture, choice, and chance are the factors which facilitate human agency, choice is inescapably constrained by the other three. Even if we say that a person's choices can affect the other three — that is, a person can choose to change their environment or circumstances — the ability to even make this choice is constrained by the resources they already have in their current circumstances. If they do not have the intellectual, psychological, material, and social resources to make that decision and carry it out, then they don't have a meaningful choice in the matter. If they don't have a meaningful choice in the matter, then they can't rightly be considered responsible for the choice of the outcome, can they?

Of course, all of this hinges on the belief that at least some degree of free will even exist. I personally believe it does, but there is plenty of room for me to be wrong there. If I am wrong, however, it simply means that most of the above arguments aren't necessary to prove my original assertion — that most people are not responsible for the bulk of their behavior. It simply means that nobody is responsible for any of their behavior, and that responsibility does not exist, since no one would have the ability to meaningfully respond with lucid agency. So the end conclusion would be about the same.

A few additional thoughts:

My assertions above do not imply that no one is ever responsible for any of their behavior. Showing counterexamples of people fully empowered in their decisions wouldn't constitute a contradiction to anything I've said. I hold that people who are empowered with sufficient education, support, and control of the resources they need to survive and thrive are considerably more responsible for their thoughts and behaviors, since they have the means at hand to exercise that lucid agency and carry out those decisions. But those who have such resources constitute a minority in society.

Further, pointing out that there are some societies in the world which buck this trend, adequately educate their people, and have robust support systems in place would not in itself contradict anything I've said here — you would have to show that this constituted the majority of the world, not just a handful of societies are communities, otherwise it would remain consistent with my original assertion.

What would change my view is either 1) somehow demonstrating that a strong libertarian free will able to consistently operate beyond physical constraints exists in the majority of people, or 2) that the majority of people are empowered enough to be responsible for the majority of their thoughts and behaviors — the latter probably being the more viable path, as I cannot imagine how the former would be possible apart from magic and woo. I also remain open to any counterarguments or approaches that I may not have thought of but which pertinently address what I've said above."

The existence of this condition is unethical because all humans have the same amount of hours per week, and we have determined that 40 hours is the cutoff where anyone should be expected to give to their employer. If the employer takes any more than 40 hours, it would and should be at an increased rate. 

However, exempt status means that legally, some employees are recognized as not being entitled to this extra pay when the employer requires them to work over 40 hours. In addition to it taking proportionally more and more of the employee's free time, the risks of work related injuries due to fatigue also rise with more hours worked. To not compensate the employee for this fairly is unethical.

This means for notes, hand outs, assignments, and exams. Of all of these, the only one that I would say has completely fair and valid reasoning is the exam material, largely for security reasons and to prevent cheating. These other instances can all very easily be ported online.

I understand that not everyone can afford a laptop and may be forced to use paper; that's not what I'm saying either. Rather, these professors tends to go on a huge rant about ""the benefits of using paper"" and distracting others. First and foremost, the evidence regarding taking notes on paper being substantially better *are not sufficient*. This is because these studies are primarily correlational. Many students use an electronic device so that they can multitask, and just because all computer users in class includes those students doesn't mean that actually just taking your notes digitally is any worse for memory. From the cognitive evidence we have, the mechanism that makes note taking effective is putting things into your own words, typed or not.

Outside of notes, for handouts and assignments, both of these are easier, and better done online.- It's clearer and easier for the teacher to mark- It can be downloaded multiple times if the student loses the paper or never gets one, or missed the class- and it DOESN'T WASTE PAPER

That's the big thing, paper waste. The irony of my environmental ethics professor using so much paper is astounding...

In any case though, that's why it's a negative decision. It's a waste of paper, and I would also argue unproductive for student learning and engagement.

This boils down to selfish, however, because usually, teachers explain that the main reason they do this is because they are ""old fashioned"". Now generally, there is a significant learning curve to technology use in many cases. This includes on applications like canvas that are complex. I totally accept that it is challenging, and not easy to learn - but when you agree to be a professor, your job is to teach others, to benefit students. If you're dedicating your life to helping others learn, why would you have no interest in improving the experience for them? And then, you're too stubborn to learn something new? Like, dude. And I know this is more typical of older profs but I've had other professors, most of them, who are old as dirt, and they still make an effort! Yeah, their canvas page isn't the best, but they make a strong effort, post marks online, post guidelines online, etc. It's just part of the job at this point. Ironically, more of the paper-protagonists I've had teach me were actually a lot younger, from 30-50. If multiple teachers I've had that are older, like 70-80+, who clearly struggle with technology like zoom make a strong effort, why can't these others? There really is no excuse. The evidence isn't sufficient, and at the end of the day, they just don't want to learn, and then they justify it in any way they can. And it's at the expense of students, and namely the environment, as one teacher's decision to go paper only results in an INSANE amount of paper use. The last class I had with paper had around 200 students. The syllabus was printed, 12 pages long. That's already 2400 pieces of paper! Just because you couldn't cba to upload it?? We had multiple, packaged handouts over the course too, aside from standalones for assignments. In the end, it's just super wasteful for no reason.

I've done CMVs before; if you disagree, go nuts. But if you truly agree, don't try to disagree just to see if you can, because there's really no point.  


Edits:  
\- That last part is just to say, don't just disagree just to disagree, don't just reply with random assetry. Try to be persuasive and have a good point. I didn't mean to say that people who agree with this idea can't make a case against it here  
\- My argument is meant to apply to cases of say grade 10 and up, mostly university and college level, not in applications where younger children may be learning to write and the like. "

203,2023-03-26,CMV: There is too much of an emphasis placed on college for work qualifications and it just acts as a barrier to economic mobility.,u/eagle_565,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1230dlj/cmv_there_is_too_much_of_an_emphasis_placed_on/,changemyview,"A massive proportion of people with college degrees seem to say that they never use what they learned in college in their working life. This especially seems to be the case for business and social science degrees, but still applies to some extent to things like STEM. It's commonplace for professional firms to require a college degree from all their applicants, even if the degree is in no way related to the industry the firm operates in. They then assume you know nothing anyway, and have multi-year training programs where you learn everything you actually need to know to be a useful employee.

This essentially means that there is a 4 year period where you're unable to work full time, and often have to pay extortionate fees and cost of accommodation if you're studying away from home, while learning no skills that are actually applicable to the working world. This is clearly a barrier for people from poorer backgrounds who can't afford 4 years without a full time salary.

I would say the exceptions to this are STEM degrees, which typically teach actual technical skills that would be too much to learn as you go in your first job, and students of arts and social sciences who are going for the express purpose of getting an education, with no expectation of better job opportunities coming out of college. 

While there is an argument that college is a test of work ethic and intelligence, which is obviously useful for potential employers, your grades in secondary education along with an IQ test seem to me to be a much more cost-effective method of measuring this.

If you remember them having more then 1 channel. This is not a topic about if it sucks or not I'm not bashing the cartoon at all I'm not saying it's a terrible cartoon either. I just be so amazed how people just really let this show ruin the quality of the network. Okay I get that the show is a hit I get that to show is good but I just don't like the fact that their whole focus is on this show. So are you telling me that it's that hard and difficult to come up with other shows that are just as good or better? To me in my personal opinion I feel like there were a lot of shows that were better. But I guess that's just my personal opinion but there has to be potential for Nickelodeon to make another cartoon that can appeal to a lot of people I feel like they was being lazy. I've actually seen a couple videos I don't know if it's accurate of them saying that SpongeBob was their main focus and made tons of money. Okay I understand that you made a lot of money but that doesn't mean you can't put focus on another cartoon as well and promote that cartoon as a kid we had plenty of tv time we had enough time to like other cartoons as well so even if two shows were a hit you still had enough slots to put them shows on there. I always thought spongebob was a good show but never thought it was the best ! Can someone change my view or give me a different perspective or let me know if you agree with my statement

I’m talking about amauter SCCA events where people race around comes in a farm field where you’re likely to not catch any air; basically autocross in a parking lot but on dirt.

While rally suspension is typically not super stiff because pro rally drivers launch rally cars 10 feet into the air sometimes, in the specific case of SCCA rallycross where you don’t have to deal with too many jumps, it might benefit your lap times to have a stiffer suspension.

In the case of rallycross, your tires and your drivetrain layout will be two of the most important factors to getting a fast lap time. If your tires are not designed for driving on dirt, having a soft rally suspension probably won’t help you get a faster lap time because your tires are holding you back. Even with the best rally tires, any car with decent power will still be spinning the tires so it comes down to suspension tuning. The softer your suspension is, the more time your car takes to transition in braking and corners."

It seems like nowadays service has definitely worsened and tips should be expected. And I’m not saying this because I’m “cheap” or anything, and my friends can back me up when I say that although I am picky with my tips, I can be a very generous tipper, sometimes tipping more than I actually spent. And I really don’t wanna feel guilt when giving tips based on how the customer service was. I know every situation is different and maybe the employees are busy, and I take that in account as well. But when the employee doesn’t seem like they even care about the customers experience, then they should not expect a tip.

This comes from my own personal story where I went to a pool hall and when the person behind the counter asked if I was getting any drinks, I said no because I was driving as well and I just wanted to play pool. After that she gave me a disgusted look. I understand that when I get food or drinks, the tab will increase, Hense a bigger tip for her. But I was a regular there (so I always tipped) and it was the first time I’ve ever seen her. At the end I didn’t tip because of this unprofessional behaviour.

Whereas there are some good cases where a waiter/waitress actually provides great service and makes me want to go back in the future. And those are the kind people who actually deserve tips. Whether they were genuine or just putting on an act, they still made the customer experience more enjoyable."

Ideal partner: someone who's got their heart and head ready for a long term relationship, measured in years not months

* Tinder and the rest of the online dating scene is just full of sexy hookups. The investment of time is big and reward is minimal. Lots of scam artists use online dating. Wall to wall with catfishes and people who didn't sign up for the right reasons or to find true love.
* It is the safer method to find a partner through mutual friends, but still not as easy since everyone is still competing with everyone on a much larger scale now with the internet heightening expectations, from both genders. Making True friendships quickly? No it's getting rarer. Plenty of people are growing up with drama and learn early on that lying is indeed useful and honesty is just for show.
* Social media has ruined the minds of everyone, young especially. Young females are now demanding too much perfection from young males. This turns many males off from chasing and courting.
* It is increasingly harder to keep calm about one's future prospects. With inflation killing off many hopes of owning a paid-off house one day or living a comfortable life on a living wage. This adds more stress, dating life and looking for love takes a firm backseat now whilst some are just scraping by in the working class.
* Fast food filled with sugar, and energy drinks,, makes us fat and unattractive to a potential mate. But many youths are brought up eating this junk. Like it's an addiction. 

Why is this problematic? Because finding love at an early age is important for healthy growth in a world where there's less reason to push for excellence than previously. You're bombarded with trauma and tragedy at every screen you look. From news, to social media, to online forums, to online videogames.  etc. There's nothing you can do to change the world. And young people have to live knowing this. So the only hope they've got left is the hope of finding love. If they can't even do that, they're going to start questioning what the point of living their life is. Then you have a bigger crisis."

0,2023-03-27,"CMV: Using ChatGPT for academic purposes is not an academic integrity violation, educational spaces shouldn’t ban the use of it.",u/Much_Waltz_967,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/,changemyview,"The title should me more along the lines of “higher education spaces shouldn’t ban the use of ChatGPT.”


I’ve thought about it hard and long, and have come to the conclusion that using artificial intelligence in research papers, essays or something along the lines is completely ethical and reasonable.


Let me start off with the pros:

- Efficiency. ChatGPT basically has all information up until 2021, it saves so much time instead of going to the search engine and clicking on links one after another until you find something useful for your papers. It lays all the information in a sophisticated and organised manner that is easy to work with.

- Time saving: pretty self explanatory, you don’t need to spend hours and hours looking for relevant information.

- Helpful. ChatGPT can enhance your research papers, be it grammar wise, structure, clarity, factual and etc.. 

- Money saving. You don’t need paid language services such as grammerly to spot the mistakes anymore.

- Inspirational. Depending on which topic you want to talk about, ChatGPT can give ideas, dive deep into them and spark inspiration within you. 


Now with the cons:

- Students may use it to have their essays be written for them without putting in effort, claiming it as their own.

- The tool can make factual errors, as I said it has information up until 2021.

- Occasional plagiarism. This one can be talked about deeper. I’ve heard of cases that teachers have found the AI’s writings to be extremely plagiarised, but there are other studies that show that it’s completely void of plagiarism.

— Can be biased. The tool has a lot of stored data from many sources, many of  which can contain biases or prejudice.

Despite the cons, using the actual tool shouldn’t be banned because the pros outweigh the cons, not to mention that we live in the future. Soon this technology along with many others will be normalised. Basically, calculators will happen all over again. Educators banned the use of calculators because they deemed it as cheating, only for it to be the norm nowadays. I predict same thing will happen with AI tools. Also, just like calculators, people with high education who already know the formulas, are allowed to use calculators, since the hard parts of learning the basics of maths has become easy and tedious to them. This could apply in the same sense of using ChatGPT, people with higher education that already know how to form a well structured essay or paper shouldn’t not be allowed to use the tool.


Now with the refutations of the con points:

- “Students use it to cheat.” Although students can use it to generate essays and papers and claim it as their own, OpenAI, same developers of ChatGPT, have created counter AIs to spot if something was AI written or human written.

Some may say that people can evade the system by using paraphrasing tools such as quillbot to get under the radar. And while I agree, advanced cheating has always been a thing. People are willing to get smart to get that full mark, but teachers can solve this issue by asking for early drafts, and explanations of why they changed some things. 

- Incorrect facts laid by the AI. This problem, alongside the biased information of the AI falls under the responsibility of the student. Students should naturally fact check their information, a simple search in google scholar (or even normal google if it was a simple paper) will clear out the false information. 

- Plagiarism has always been a problem in education, but that again, falls under the responsibility of the student. If the student is dumb enough to get caught.. well, you reap what you sow. But in my opinion, the correct way of using ChatGPT in an ethical manner is by using it as a resource instead of a writing tool. For example copy-pasting your already existing essay to the chat and asking it to suggest edits or fix issues with clarity and grammar. It can be used to enhance your writing and even allow the student to learn new ways of phrasing things or organising their work. Cheating by definition is the act of lying in order to take advantage, by Disclosing that you used and referenced a helping tool contradicts the definitions of cheating; since you were honest and fair.

Thus, it shouldn’t be banned in educational spaces. It good to learn about technology early and embrace it; we are living in the future.


..but I’m open to hearing different opinions. Let me know what you think?


Edit: I want to say that I don’t condone full on copy-pasting generated essays-papers, that is plagiarism."

Those who use this as an argument against people who don’t seek parenthood; believe in abortions and individual rights of women, specifically ; LGBTQ+ rights; or those who keep delaying the “so-called” inevitable.

This argument has never been nor ever proven to be true by any actual study, research, or “thoughtful observations or analysis.”

There’s a list of things that quickly disprove this expectation in the way it is used against people to shame them for either “not having children,” “getting married to have children,” or “preparing for a future with hypothetical children.”

\*\*1. Human genitalia and sexual reproductive organs does not automatically give all humans the ability to reproduce\*\*

Everyone cannot reproduce natural. I mean in the since without technology or advanced medicine to do so. People will often mention those who are intersex as an example of this phenomenon. Though, this is often correct, it’s a bit more complicated and nuanced than people go. Our sexual reproductive organs and genitalia should be thought of as a spectrum of many variables that aren’t necessarily developed to create children.

Beyond intersex, many people struggle or do not have the ability to conceive or create offspring.  A condition, such as venous leak is often a lifelong condition where boys or men do not the ability to maintain an erection, even with assistive devices or medicine. It is a terminal condition in many cases. It’s an example of a host of sexual reproductive disorders or phenomenons that make it near unlikely or … impossible to have children.   For certain conditions, coitus is not possible with typical male-female penetration. 

These people are not born with the capacity to have children on their own as it seems.  

Any form of infertility or a condition that makes a child unlikely alone says that it is not something that everyone was intended to have or be able to have the “natural way only.”

Another overlooked aspect of this argument is the formation of our reproductive organs and genitalia. Our organs need a specific organization and a specific type of activity to happen, so people can reproduce.  In reality, I could wager many or most people could create offspring, but should that be the expectation for everyone. I’d wager no and also think it’s silly to believe that’s what a deity would intend. I’ll speak about that later.

Our genitalia formations are present with no issues, but locating a suitable partner or pairing strictly for reproduction is a serious barrier or could be a terminal problem. A person is not intersex, nor have any diagnosed sexual reproductive function issues. Nothing, like vaginal agenesis, where a vagina is missing, closed, or very small. 

But, these conditions are not completely divorced from the “working order” labeled genitalia.  Many of these such conditions primarily only lack a few things from being “so-called” working order. Still, a person may have a problem strictly on genitalia alone.

The ends or medians of each spectrum challenge this expectation. I say this in a way where a woman does not have vaginal agenesis, but her vaginal opening is fairly small or does not expand enough for penetration.  For men or people with penises, I could use those who have micro penis or the largest penises. All three of these conditions give each person significantly more difficulties in finding a partner sufficient enough for procreation.  

There’s three logistical challenges-

a. finding someone with a compatible set of genitalia. Being at the opposite ends of the spectrum means a person may inevitably struggle with finding a compatible “breeding” partner. Because, for these people finding a partner for full penetration or coitus is a problem. Each group does not have sufficient genitalia to perform a certain connectivity of penetration or ability to sustain it.  Basically, in most cases, these people do not have the physiology or even physics to breed easily with most members of the entire population.  That’s a noticeable design flaw in almost every capacity. Would it be one a deity purposely design? Even if they did, they are already creating the expectation that everyone won’t be able to reproduce, even though they may have the capacity to. Most of all, what about the people who experience pain, trauma, or uncomfortable feelings from sex or the idea of sex. Again, if I’m a deity or creator why would I do this, if everyone needs to have a child.

b. You cannot tell someone’s breeding capabilities by looking at them.

Not a thing, not possible, or even an educated guess. “Breedable hips, though.” A stupid, cliched joke.  Actually, something any person can have regardless of biological sex or gender. A person with breedable could be hips any previous condition I’ve made reference to and they’d have some obstacles in producing children in the so-called “natural-way” or penetrative sex in the form “working order penises to vaginas.” 

A woman with those “breedable hips,” may have a sexual reproductive condition, have a penis, not be in the condition to have children, medically infertile, or the interests or desires.

c. People simply don’t have the interest or desire to reproduce or deal with the outcomes of reproducing.

Quite a few problems here, a person not having a desire for any particular person who is capable of reproduction is already throwing a kink into plans. We as a species do not and have almost never desired someone strictly for their ability to reproduce. For humans, they are many intermittent factors that trigger our desires for partners. They could be instinctively biological; linked to social and psychological factors; or be some profound habits of conduct or experiences.

Humans have diverse sexual characteristics, habits, and interests. We call these paraphillias, which are often marked as deviant and unnatural.  Which is categorically false for some of the conditions, because would these same people think someone’s fascination with breasts (boobs/tits), penises, or buttocks (ass) are completely natural. Regardless, they are paraphillias and their eroticism can change with culture or social situations and norms.

Our sexual identities, outlets, and interests are not exclusively tied to procreation. It can for some people, but not all. The outcome is almost equally, if not more so tied to pleasure, hormonal releases, and the activities or recreations of sex. A common bio-essential argument is that the purpose is children, which for humans and quite a few other creatures is false. 

Humans possess a much higher level of sentience than average. We have the ability to wager outcomes; moving through complex situations in both nature &amp; society; and the possible consequences of reproduction.  We possess a history of knowledge of sexual reproduction, health, responsibilities, and processes that give us circumstances for offspring or pursuing a union for offspring. Which may entail:

1. Competition
2. Higher level of social and societal achievement may be required.
3. Ability to avoid partners with deadly and infectious STIs and related conditions
4. Partners who cannot produce children naturally or easily, put 
5. Social environmental factors and actual environmental challenges: The social impact of having offspring in a given society and the actual physical environment challenges that present many obstacles for your children to survive. Procreation would make absolutely no sense if your children had a high probability of death or not surviving.
6. The capacity to reject our own offspring-

Due to emotional or psychological factors; their physical condition, looks, ability, etc; their or your personality incompatibilities; or incompatibilities with their other parents; their or my own family/village/community; or any other given social factors where I may question the importance or necessity of my offspring or their potential.

We have just as many people who don’t desire any offspring, because they become dependent children who need an extensive amount of care, support, time, responsibility, toll, attention, and resources. Just as many people don’t desire partners or sex for whatever reasons.

From the perspective of a deity or god /God/whoever, why would this process need to exist. Why would I need offspring, human children, human unions, or especially married human unions where each partner were exclusively assigned to opposite sexes and gender that will need to inevitably create children in a process that is less organized than your average DMV. And, if this God is somewhat powerful or near omnipotent, why would I need humans beyond possible experimental purposes or pure entertainment?"

This demographic is shrinking, which is why the party lost in 2018, 2020 and 2022. 

The party alienates people who typically vote democrat - people of color, people under 40, women and the LGBTQ community.  When you put justices on SCOTUS who help overturn Roe, you lose tens of millions of female voters.  When you vocally oppose “diversity and inclusion,” you lose tens of millions of minority voters.  When Ted Cruz says that Obergefell should be overturned, you lose millions of LGBTQ Americans and their families. 

The party not only ignores those demographics - it antagonizes them.  In doing so, the GOP leaves millions of votes on the table.  The democrats do not have to lift a finger to earn those votes because they are not actively targeting/harassing those voters.  They get the votes by default. 

This is bad and should concern you even if you are liberal, because it means we are headed for one-party rule.  We need two functioning political parties so that people have a choice and one party does not become a political monopoly that can run roughshod over the voters (see California).  

If democracy is going to survive, the GOP needs to become more inclusive.  It could do that by dropping the culture war nonsense and focusing on “kitchen table issues” that affect everyone like inflation, jobs, gas prices and crime. 

If the GOP continues down the road it is on, it will eventually become a minority party and will never be able to win presidential or senate/house elections.  

We need two FUNCTIONING parties, not a majority party and an opposition party."

Recreational drugs that people use, such as mushrooms, cocaine, heroin, should all be legalized.

And I know this is a hot take, but hear me out.

* If we make recreational narcotics legal, then the manufacture and sale need to be legal as well.
* By making the manufacture of recreational narcotics legal, there are FDA standards that need to be adhered to in said manufacture, that way there are no ""bad batches"" that will kill people.
* By making the manufacture and sale of recreational narcotics legal, there will be sales volume that will then be subject to income tax and sales tax and dispensaries/manufacturing centers/warehouses that will become subject to property tax. Because, let's be honest, your local street dealer is not paying taxes. 
* Also by making the sale of recreational narcotics legal, you are making street gangs that revolve around the illicit drug trade obsolete. By making street gangs obsolete, you eliminate the petty violence that plagues inner-cities over ""turf"", especially stray bullets that kill innocent bystanders.
* By making the entire narcotics supply chain legal, the war on drugs will essentially be over as well. It's been going on for 50+ years, and honestly, it's been a complete and utter failure.
* If you want something to compare the drug trade to, look at prohibition from 1919-1933. It didn't stop people from drinking, people were still drunk out of their minds in speakeasys. It also fostered the growth of street gangs of rum runners and increased crime and violence in cities. That was only for 14 years and it didn't take long to realize that prohibition was a failure. War on drugs has been going on for 50+ years and I'm surprised more people aren't realizing that this is much more tremendous of a failure.
* By making the entire narcotics supply chain legal, we can start changing our attitudes on its use and its users. Narcotics abuse needs to have the same social attitude as alcohol abuse.
* In short, making drugs legal will Make America Great Again."

Hamas has de facto control of the region and they are uncompromising hardliners that think God is on their side. A Hamas controlled Levant would just be another Islamic theocracy with all the same corruption that Lebanon suffers from. Speaking of Lebanon, Palestinian refugees in the country aren't treated much better than Gaza despite on paper pan-Arab solidarity. If they did win right of return to Palestine then Hamas would recruit them into a ""holy army"" to start yet another Intafada. Hardliners groups on both sides think God is on their side and some leftists think that if the Israeli government disappeared tomorrow then that somehow means an era of peace would magically spring up. Also alt right neo nazis latch onto this cause because Israeli apartheid somehow means the Holocaust didn't happen and/or was justified. So explain how your secular antitheocratic life would be greatly improved if the Judea region were controlled by an Islamic theocratic army?"

Spoiler: I hate the American approach to it for a bunch of reasons, chief of which is that it's just an excuse for employers to lowball their workers)


This post is based on a narrow question, though. Even if we accept that servers should derive the bulk of their income from tipping rather than wages (a poison, but for the sake of this argument lets go with it), it should be based on how many items they actually have to bring out to the table, rather than a percentage of the total price. 


A $20 bottle of wine, for example, requires the same amount of work as a $100 bottle of wine, there’s no logical reason why a customer would need to pay 5x more in tips for the same effort of service. 


I’m not sure what the per-item calculation would look like ($1.50-$2.00 per item, maybe?), but it seems that basing a tip on how often a server has to come to your table makes more sense than basing it on the price of each item, which has no bearing on the work servers are doing. 


(Ultimately, restaurants should pay their fucking people so they don’t have to rely on tips in the first place, but I digress.)"

This is a hypothetical. I can't have kids for medical reasons, but let's imagine I did. 

I'm Hindu. I pray every day, chant mantras, meditate, do yoga and believe in all the gods and goddesses as part of Brahman, reincarnation, karma etc. I think it's the best lifestyle for me. 

Some people find it very weird that I have said in the past I wouldn't raise my kids to be Hindu, given how important my faith and lifestyle is to me. But how is it weird? My faith and lifestyle is for me, not my kids, unless they express an interest when they are older. I would give them a choice about faith and rituals, not automatically tell them it's true. Because I believe people should have faith because it makes sense to them, not because their parents told them too. Also, I don't believe in any punishment for not believing. It's very difficult to each a kid to meditate, so I would probably leave it up to them to learn or teach them if they want when they are about age 12. 

Some of my friends find this really weird. I would raise them with no faith unless they start showing an interest in religious things. I tried to ask them why they thought it was weird, but they said that the answer was obvious. 

If you think my view is weird, please try to explain why."
2,2023-03-27,CMV: The mental health spectrum needs to be reviewed,u/Sir_vendetta,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123svef/cmv_the_mental_health_spectrum_needs_to_be/,changemyview,"The spectrum of mental health illnesses has 5 zones: excelling, thriving, surviving, struggling, and in a crisis, even though excelling and thriving are quite obvious, most people are either excelling or surviving. The thriving zone doesn't seem to exist, the same thing happens with struggling. You are either surviving or in a crisis. Struggling doesn't seem to exist.

You could be anxious or depressed but be in the excelling or thriving zone, but because thriving isn't clearly defined, you will jump straight from excelling to surviving, and because struggling isn't clearly defined neither, you will jump from surviving straight into a crisis, and that's the problematic area.

Most people with mental health issues are often just surviving, tip toeing between excelling in their lives, or falling into a crisis, but often mental health professionals will put us in the in “between” category, give us some drugs, and recommend therapy that is often impossible to obtain. It is in this area where people will more often than not fall into a crisis instead of a recovery.

My view is that the so-called spectrum needs to be reviewed, it needs to be widened, early prevention and identification of declining behaviour,  will stop people from deteriorating into serious issues that could lead to suicide, or even committing murder.

The in crisis zone should be further in the spectrum,  and more focus should be put on the thriving and surviving zone, because it is in this area where proactive help can be given to stop people from deteriorating further."

At the end of the day it’s none of my business and I believe everyone deserves respect. This is more of logic stance than a matter of the heart. I’m not transphobic or against supporting that community I just think some of it doesn’t make sense.

I can recognize that gender, as opposed to biological sex, is a social construct. Broadly speaking, the majority of people agreed there are only two genders and they must align with your biological sex. Obviously, this is changing and there are new genders being created. Social constructs are only a thing if everyone agrees on them I.e. paper money being valuable, calendars, etc. If we’re 


Gender being viewed on a spectrum makes sense to me. Referring to people as ‘they’ also makes sense to be respectful since most languages are highly gendered. I can understand we don’t all fit cleanly into gendered

Creating a new gender makes no sense because it’s not a social construct and it inherently requires folks to recognize that gender collectively. It’s not a self identifying matter.

Edit 1: Let me clarify my position a bit more. I think we’d be better off without genders vs. having 70+. If everyone is on a spectrum of gender we are all logically non-binary. In order to create new genders and self identify your own gender you have to change what gender is… Gender developed as a byproduct of gender roles defined by sex and socially constructed, and externally assigned/imposed.

Edit 2: so, I think I see why gender identity is specifically important to some people internally."

In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us. This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.” - Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman

My view is the following:

1. It's reasonable to expect a rise in romantic relationships between humans and AI in the next few decades
2. Romantic relationships with AI are detrimental to society.

I think the easiest way to forecast the impact AI relationships will have is by looking at the effect technology has had on social norms in the past ten years.

The number of high school seniors who have been in a relationship or a job has [decreased significantly](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percentage-of-12-th-Graders-Who-Have-a-Drivers-License-Have-Ever-Tried-Alcohol-Who_fig1_340562787). Deaths of despair have [doubled since 2000](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/9/long-term-trends-in-deaths-of-despair). The increasing loneliness of young men has been a frequent topic of discussion lately.

While it would be foolish to attribute these things to a single cause, I believe that social media and platforms like YouTube and Twitch have had a significant impact. People are replacing human connections with virtual ones. In all honesty, it's hard to blame them. Human connections require you to be vulnerable and need time, patience, hard work, and perseverance. Friends can be flawed while internet personalities give the appearance that they are not. As we've seen with Facebook, companies profit from manipulating young men and women to become emotionally dependent on their service.

If social media can have such a significant effect on our society, I imagine the impact will be even larger for technology that can mimic human interaction perfectly and is available for you at any time of day without any needs of their own.

What prompted me to post this was looking through the subreddit r/replika. AI isn't even close to its full potential and the level of connection and intimacy people feel with their ""rep"" is something I never would have guessed. To me, it's severely dystopian. At the rate AI has been improving over the last few years, I assume that the connections will only get stronger and more life-like over time."

any chemical in the tryptamine or penathylamine class this does include lysergamides as they are technically both tryptamines and lysergamides.

I could go into all the nittpicky details about why they are beneficial generally, don't cause addiction, and more but that all falls short of a single primary arguement

you should be allowed to ingest any chemical and receive no legal duress from doing so, so long as that act does not ***DIRECTLY*** harm a different individual in a way they do not consent to or that is not already legal. the fact that you aren't is absurd. I could jump off a cliff and deal massive emotional damage to my family and cause my body to cease to function but if I take a dose of say psylocibin then somehow I have commited a graver crime?

now some say it's for the good of society. but what good society seeks to restrict that which changes it potentially for the better if that society is not already perfect. in fact I dare might say any society that creates laws to protect something so abstract and nebulous borders on a dictatorship and the persecution of thought crimes.

just a side note most tryptamines are very very very similar to chemicals already and indeed in some cases identical to chemicals endogenous to your body so your a felon already anyway to some degree in the current legal landscape even though it is not enforced as such.

My view is that one's proffesion is not compensated based on how valuable or important the job itself is to society. Instead, it's based in large part on the demand of your skills and abilities. Or to put it another way: can you provide something that is unique and difficult to replace?

For instance, the NFL has  32 teams, each with a 53 man roster - a total of about 1700 roster spots available. That means there is a very small amount of people who are qualified to play at that level - which makes their value extemely high to their teams. The Chiefs are willing to pay Patrick Mahomes $45 million per year because they know that just about no one else on earth can do his job to the level that he can.

On the flip side, there are approximately 4 million teachers in the USA. That means the demand for an educator's abilities is much lower.

I do strongly believe that good teachers who are great at their jobs deserve to be compensated and rewarded accordingly. And although I don't quite know enough about teacher salaries/education budgets, I may also believe that teachers generally deserve higher salaries than they receive.

But I do not see the disparity in income between athletes and teachers to be problematic, as although most would agree teachers hold a more important role, that does not equate to higher earnings.

 - Also, I want to recognize that an organization's generated revenue (among many other things) is a large piece of the puzzle of their employee's salary as well. But I'm mostly addressing the common argument that is typically made in regards to the importance of a job in society."

I think there is nothing inherently morally wrong with owning a gun (or multiple). Guns are tools and can be used productively or  cause grave harm. My desire for a gun ban is not a moral judgement on those who own guns.

However, if we assume laws exist to protect society, I see no reasonable justification for laws NOT to ban guns (ignoring the 2nd ammendment for a moment). Guns are a leading cause of death in the US (suicide &amp; homicide &amp; mass shootings). Beyond those that are killed, countless more are traumatized and emotionally harmed. We've banned many other useful/fun things for less (DDT, asbestos, lead paint, lawn darts, etc). Why then are guns special?

Well, the 2nd ammendment. However the 2nd ammendment itself is an ammendment. This itself should show that those who made the constitution made mistakes or omitted key information when they wrote the constitution initially. Why should we feel beholden to one confusing sentence written before 90% of the country would have even been allowed to vote? Amendments have been undone before (See prohibition). We could undo the 2nd ammendment if we want. And I think it would be best for our society.

What am I missing here? Why do people care so much more about owning guns than other dangerous items?

Edit: I say ""almost"" all guns because I acknowledge there may be a handful of circumstances where it is safer for there to be a licensed, well secured gun than not, e.g. a qualified park ranger in bear country may need one"

If you care about freedom so much why are you using the government to ban books about gay people, if life is so precious and we can't have abortion why won't you ban guns. These cases confuse liberals as liberals see equality and flattening of hierarchy to an extent as good, but conservatives don't see it like that. Whether openly or not the reason this hypocrisy exist is to maintain a hierarchy, specifically that being gay is abnormal and bad and should be kept away from children. And that women shouldn't be able to have any PIV sex without constantly risking having a baby, forcing women into the position of mothers and removing their autonomy. The truest answer one can give as to whether a conservative will supourt an action or not is whether it consolidates or distributes power.

I say all this specifically because as a leftist that technically makes me freinds with liberals we need to stop putting stock in this idea, because it leads us to viewing them as stupid which is why so many righ leaning people think the left are assholes. The real solution is to invoke why we should distribute power to change their minds as all constantly pointing and laughing at hypocrisy does is aleinate them."

Basically I think a lot of the dilemmas about what role the government should play in business could be effectively solved by getting rid of limited liability for investors when there has been some sort of social cost created. 

Take the moral hazard issue associated with bank failures for example. There is now a rock/hard place of:
1. ""Bail out"" the bank and reward taking dumb risks with depositors' money, and also drawing capital away from responsible institutions.
2. Ruin depositors who did nothing wrong other than not understand relatively obscure concepts like bank capital requirements because they were busy running a startup.

If equity investors did not have limited liability, then there would be no issue. Ultimately they should be on the hook for covering any shortfalls. The government could make depositors whole in a timely manner of course, but then could go after shareholders to get paid back.

This concept can be extended to things like the Norfolk Southern debacle as well.  This would be much more effective at discouraging bad corporate behavior than any regulation. Limited liability is just transferring risk away from those who are intentionally taking risk to people who were not supposed to be taking risk. It also forces investors to be much more rigorous in their diligence because their investments are exposed to losses orders of magnitude larger than their cost basis.

Management should have an offsetting exposure to any option-like compensation they receive in the form of an insurance policy they write against these sorts of liabilities.

Lastly, I explicitly excluded debt defaults from this, because losses on debt instruments are taken by lenders who intentionally taking risk and are compensated for that risk.

I haven't seen this idea put forth in this specific way before so is there something important I'm missing here?"

1. **Self-obsession reigns supreme:** SMH, these influencers and vloggers are the epitome of narcissism. Their posts scream ""look at me, look at what I'm doing, look at what I'm wearing."" It's like they've forgotten there's a world beyond their perfect little bubble. 

2. **Spreading mindless consumerism:** They shamelessly promote unnecessary products in exchange for $$$, perpetuating a culture of mindless consumerism that's destroying our planet. With every sponsored post, they're basically saying, ""Hey, buy this crap you don't need because I got paid to tell you to!""

3. **Fake AF lifestyles:** Influencers and vloggers are masters of illusion, curating their lives to look picture-perfect. They post the highlights reel, creating unrealistic expectations for their followers. In reality, their lives are just as messy as yours or mine, but they'd never admit it.

4. **Inauthentic relationships:** These so-called ""influencers"" have thousands, even millions of followers, but how many genuine connections can one person really have? They don't give a rat's ass about their ""fans,"" only the numbers that boost their ego and their bank accounts.

5. **Exploiting FOMO for personal gain:** They tap into our deepest insecurities, making us feel like we're missing out if we don't have the latest products or experiences they're shoving down our throats. Thanks to them, we're on a never-ending quest for more, more, more.

6. **Turning friendships into transactions:** Remember when friendships were based on shared experiences and trust? Well, not anymore. Now it's all about networking and leveraging connections for personal gain. Influencers and vloggers have turned human relationships into commodities.

7. **The glorification of hedonism:** It's all about living large, y'know? Flashy cars, luxury vacations, and designer clothes. These influencers and vloggers are peddling a hedonistic lifestyle that's totally unsustainable and, frankly, pathetic.

8. **Undermining real talent:** Don't even get me started on how they're overshadowing genuinely talented artists, creatives, and experts in their fields. It's all about who has the biggest following, not who has the most skill or knowledge.

9. **Breeding a culture of entitlement:** Their success is built on superficial charm and luck, not hard work or merit. Yet, they act like they're entitled to the fame and fortune they've stumbled into. It's infuriating and sends a terrible message to the younger generation.

10. **Dumbing down our society:** With every vapid post, they're contributing to the collective dumbing down of our society. Instead of promoting critical thinking, self-improvement, or meaningful content, they're just adding to the mindless noise we're all drowning in.

social media influencers and vloggers are a cancer on this earth, preying on our insecurities and vulnerabilities for their own selfish gain. They're the embodiment of everything that's wrong with the hedonistic, consumer-driven society we've become. It's time we stopped worshipping these false idols and started focusing on what really matters in life."

I can’t name one person that has truly gotten true consequences for “offensive jokes or tweets from 10 years ago” They get backlash sure, but it’s never really affecting anyone’s career. And I’d argue that it’s not a bad thing that they get backlash, people should be able to have an opinion that criticizes old tweets and jokes, and I’d argue the real insensitive ones are the ones bitching about people getting “cancelled” too much. It’s just not happening. People who have done very bad things in the past still have very successful careers now. People went after Logan Paul for the forest video, and he’s been doing great for 4 years since then. Shane Dawson had countless awful old videos come into light, and of course he got backlash, but now he posts consistently on his podcast, gets good views on it and even has sponsors on his podcasts. If Logan Paul who felt filming someone’s dead body appropriate and Shane Dawson who regularly wore blackface and other awful shit can still have career as celebrities after being “cancelled” than that means to me that cancel culture is not only not a big deal, but is not even really real."

It's probably because of the cultural difference between US and China. 

CLARIFICATION: The title includes a restriction of ""as long as you're not breaking the law or apparent rules"". Not working at all in the workplace is breaking an apparent rule. 

DELTAED: We should still have the same legal responsibilities as normal people but we should face less moral condemnation and social marginalisation and bullying when we do something wrong because we're mentally ill. 

People say that we use our mental health conditions such as Bipolar, Depression and Autism etc as excuses but I think it's justified.

Point 1: We didn't choose to be mentally ill, and as a result we have a shorter lifespan, worse quality of life and many other restrictions in our lives. As a result, we deserve to have more happiness and less responsibility in other fields to make up for it. Asking us to work the same hours, shoulder the same responsibility as normal people is simply unfair for us, cuz we're already unhealthy and unhappy. So it's okay to use your mental illness as an excuse to decrease your responsibility.

Point 2: Saying that people use their mental health conditions as excuses is just strengthening the already stringent social rules and bringing more stress to even the normal people. If you put too much emphasis on ""manners"", ""respect"" ""politeness"" or such similar stuff that requires restraint and sometimes even dishonesty, to a point that even the mentally ill have to obey these unspoken rules, there is less and less room for people to ""be weird"" or ""stand out"". Eventually the society would be a dystonia where everyone is expected to behave like a diplomat---always nice, but rarely real. Being weird is nothing wrong as long as it doesn't bring harm to the society.

Point 3: Some people may say some are faking their mental illness, but this is increasingly untrue today with the advancement of examination techniques. It's impossible to fake a brain electric activity or blood flow pattern these days.

Point 4: Performing the same tasks as normal people required extra effort for mentally ill people and such extra effort is often beyond our reach. So it's not possible for us to handle tasks that are pushing even normal individuals to their limits. In such occasions we have no choice but to use our mental health condition as an excuse to avoid or delay such tasks."
0,2023-03-28,"CMV: The twist in God of War: Ragnarok, is hollow and empty",u/This_The_Last_Time,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/124hr0f/cmv_the_twist_in_god_of_war_ragnarok_is_hollow/,changemyview,"SPOILERS for the whole game, obviously. 

Just before the endgame, you find out that Tyr, one of your allies, is actually Odin, your worst enemy, in disguise. However, the twist is empty, hollow and meaningless. It changes nothing, either going forward or in retrospect. Twists ought to be game-changers. This is just an empty gesture. 

You would think that if your worst enemy is practically a mole in your innermost circle, tasked with taking down that enemy, that there would be some complications. But not really, no. Team Kratos basically goes from one triumph to another. Never is there a feeling that you are always one step behind Odin. That you always fall short of your goals. That there is something, something, preventing you from succeeding. 

But no, disguised Odin seems content on doing practically nothing, despite knowing all their plans beforehand. He never, as far as I remember, effectively alters the plans for the worse. Sure, he sometimes disapproves and gruntles and raises doubt, but none of it affects anything either. There is no revolt against Kratos or his leadership, no fractures within (with one exception), no faith or hope lost on the cause. Kratos would be happy to give up his seat as the leader, if someone like Tyr were to take it. What a perfect opportunity to disarm the anti-Odin league before it becomes too dangerous, to guide it to ruin. But no, Odin rejects all leadership and responsibility, for some reason. 

The exceptions, where things are not going as planned, are when Garm is freed, and when Atreus decides to join/infiltrate Odin, against his father's wishes. But both of these really fall on Atreus, not Odin. It is possible that Odin was gently guiding Atreus to go to Asgard, but I fail to remember it. Besides, it happens quite early on, so if that was it, Odin was slacking afterwards.   


So, when the twist happens, it kinda comes out of nowhere and doesn't really answer anything, because you had no questions to begin with. Everything was going according to plan. This was, in my opinion, a massive waste of potential. 

Does the twist alter anything going forward then? Well, not really either. The big thing is the mask. Kratos has it, and as Odin is forced to reveal himself, he tries to take it. BUT HE FAILS TO DO SO. This is the perfect chance to make the reveal mean something! Kratos has an important mask, the twist happens, now Odin has it. Now, the circumstances have changed. Perhaps Kratos and his team have to abandon their plans and attack Asgard now in order to prevent Odin from using it. 

But no. Odin fails to achieve anything, ergo, the writers fail to make the twist meaningful. 

What about Brok? Sure, a side character dies, and then another side character becomes upset because of it. But what does that matter? Some players were maybe fond of him, but his death was rather pointless as well. Brok was in no way instrumental to anything, in either good or bad. 

What if Brok was meaningful to the plot? What if had an important task to perform in Ragnarok that only he could do? Or what if his death would rally all of Svartalfheim to join Kratos? Or if Sindri wanted to get out, and Kratos really could not afford to lose him, but after losing his brother, Sindri goes all in? What if his death is the thing that pushes hesitant Kratos to attack Asgard? No. None of these things come to pass. Dwarves do not join the attack. Sindri would have helped regardless. Brok did not have anything important to do anyway. He could have lived or died. No course was altered because of what happened. 

Sindri gets upset, and I guess that is the biggest thing. But this thing could have been and should have been HUGE. To have your biggest enemy inside your team that is planning to take him down. Yet, none of it matters. It could have been real Tyr all along, and everything would have happened exactly the same way. Brok would have lived, but he had no part to play anymore anyway. The twist was empty and hollow, it changed nothing, mattered even less."

Whenever I've been myself in the past in front of classmates, friends, cousins, I've encountered laughter thrown at me as if they were laughing at me. And ever since I've stopped being myself and adapted a certain behavior, I am not laughed at anymore. This pretty much confirms my view of women but I don't want it to be.

I feel like sharing about something I am concerned about or sharing about something related to my vulnerable traits, leads to laughter either at my face or behind my back. How do I find trustable people and how do I become open again?"

Trust is a broken mirror. You can fix it but you can always see the cracks. If an employee is thinking about quitting, they already lost trust in you and that trust will probably never be regained even if they did stay.

Likewise, you’ll never be able to fully trust an employee knowing that they were at one point attempting to quit.

Usually the only way to retain an employee is through promotion or salary raise. But employees seldom if ever quit because of money. It’s usually because they don’t work well with their manager or team. So you’re never really treating the root cause of the problem.

From the employer’s perspective, you don’t see this employee as worth promoting or giving a raise to, otherwise you would have given them the promotion or raise already. So retaining them will only lead to resentment down the road because you’ll feel that you’re overpaying this employee.

Once the employee is shown to be unhappy in their current role, it is virtually unheard of that they can be happy again. You’re better off just start looking for their replacement when they’re still around to transfer those skills."

I’m not saying they should be prioritised over people with allergies or those with other food needs (like vegetarians or those who don’t eat certain foods for religious reasons). But they deserve a little more respect and support because it’s also hard for them being picky eaters. Definitely prioritise food issues that could harm someone.

first off, what exactly do you mean by that? i understand it as meaning “every human who works as a police officer is a bad person”. if that’s your definition, it’s just wrong. there’s people with all sorts of views and moral compasses working as a police officer. some are horrible people, some aren’t.

now you might argue that the profession is unethical. you might be forced to act against your own moral compass by your duties as a police officer. and i agree, that is a difficult issue, morally. but i just wonder, what is the world you envision instead? no cops? anarchy?

i am going to use mexico as an example as i have ties to people who live/lived there. it’s not a full anarchy, but it’s close. police is exactly not doing what i mentioned above, just following and enforcing the law. many instead do what they want (often that is getting money by being corrupt). the government has very little control. and guess what the result of little to no control is? organised crime. lots of it. death. violence. way more than in germany for example, where police are almost overly strict in keeping to the law. 

my point is, i see the moral dilemma, but blaming it on cops and calling them bad people isn’t gonna make it better, and nobody being cops would only make it worse. why are people saying it, what do you hope for, what’s your solution?"
0,2023-03-28,CMV: Use of deadly force is allowed in self defense against serious harm.

My view: Abortion (typically) meets the legal requirements as ""self defense using deadly force.""

The legal bar allowing this varies by state, but NY has one of the most strict requirements, so I'll use that state's law as my example (sources linked).

&gt; [§ 35.15](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article35.php#p35.15) 2. A  person  may  not  use deadly physical force upon another person
under circumstances specified in subdivision one unless:

about  to  use  deadly  physical  force.

&gt; * ""[Deadly physical force](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article10.php#p1011)"" means physical force which, under the
circumstances in which it is used, is readily capable of causing death
or other serious physical injury.
* ""[Serious physical injury](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article10.php#p1010)"" means physical injury which creates a
substantial risk of death, or which causes death or serious and
protracted disfigurement, protracted impairment of health or protracted
loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.

For this CMV, the above legal text boils down to (my own words):

&gt; Abortion is legal self defense if the mother reasonably believes that her pregnancy/childbirth could cause Serious Physical Injury (SPI)

Is it reasonable to believe that pregnancy/childbirth could cause SPI? YES!

According to the legal definition of SPI above, pregnancy/childbirth qualifies in many ways. It causes risk of death, disfigurement, and impairment of health.  It will certainly cause protracted loss of the function of the ovaries, which prevents her from having a child with another person for nearly a year.

**There is even legal precedence.** In [U.S. v. Guy](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-guy-13), the mother's childbirth was deemed SPI, which allowed a longer sentence for the rapist who caused the pregnancy.

To summarize:

* Pregnancy/childbirth causes Serious Physical Injury
* Mother wants to prevent (what she ""reasonably believes"" will be) Serious Physical Injury
* Abortion is legal self defense

---

EDIT: I'm done.  I see the same points being made over and over without even reading the OP text.

* ""Pregnancy isn't life-threatening"" It doesn't have to be. It's causing SPI.
* ""A fetus isn't doing it intentionally"" It doesn't have to be intentional. Intent is not a requirement for self-defense. You are allowed to defend yourself against unintentional harm.
* ""It's the mother's fault for having sex"" Sex does not preclude her from defending herself.
* ""You can't shoot people who might hit you with cars"" Pregnancy causes SPI 100% of the time (read above). Not comparable to car accidents.

Thanks everyone and have a good day.  This was a fun exercise!"
0,2023-03-28,CMV: Ticketmaster is not a monopoly,u/pylio,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/124pnke/cmv_ticketmaster_is_not_a_monopoly/,changemyview,"But it is part of a duopoly. There is so much misinformation going around the internet about this situation. To the point.  I'm just going to lay out some facts. 

Ticketmaster is going to equal TM

Live nation is LN. 

As people have pointed out, TM was bought by LN so is a subsidiary. Every LN venue is ticketed through TM. 

1. So there are three main parts of the live music industry.  Venues, Buyers, and Artists. All of these parts are separate but sometimes venues and buyers are related. Venues are simply locations of the event. Buyers are the ones putting on the events. Artists are who the buyers bring on to make the event cool.  

2. Buyers have a couple of different types of relationships with venues. One option is that a buyer simply rents the venue. There is no exclusivity in that. An example is most arenas and stadiums act like this. Sometimes, buyers have exclusive deals with venues. This means that while the venue is independent, for music,  they will only use one buyer. Lastly is that the buyer owns and operates a venue.  This is the least common of the three. 

3. AEG exists.  Not only does it exist, it is only slightly smaller than LN. They own and have exclusivity in a lot of different venues as well. Sometimes, in certain cities, they own more than LN does. AEG also had a ticketing vendor called AXS. And they do the same practices TM does.  

4. While LN is not a monopoly, it is part of a duopoly. AEG and LN own such a large portion of the live music space and this only got worse after the pandemic.  Owning an independent venue is so difficult and a lot of them shut down in late 2020. AEG and LN had the resources to keep themselves open through other deals. 

5. If the Artists wanted to do anything about this problem,  they would.  If you are thinking of the Taylor Swift you see in concert as a person, you are wrong. She is an entity with 100s of people supporting her. She is the face of that entity. While Taylor Swift is obviously a person, it is important to understand how powerful branding is. I say this because if Taylor Swift wanted to,  she could make her tickets $20. She doesn't want to.  Do while LN/AEG are out of control, they are egged on by the large artists they are funding.

6. What can you do about this? First thing is to go to more local shows at independent venues. Do some research on who owns the venues you go to and support ones not owned by a corporation. AEG owns goldenvoice, bowery presents (not bowery ballroom though), and a many more. Likewise,  Live Nation owns C3, House of blues, and many others. Support smaller acts. Going to a Blink 182 concert is super cool. But they are an act that only wants your money. They do not care about the fans and who shows up.  Local Artists do though. So go see them. It will make you look super cool as well being owning original merch."
0,2023-03-28,CMV: The logic that American's need guns to prevent government overreach or tyranny is flawed.,u/603er,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/124poxg/cmv_the_logic_that_americans_need_guns_to_prevent/,changemyview,"I routinely hear Americans say that guns are necessary to prevent government overreach. This seems to be the main point in support of gun ownership in the nation (other arguments in favor include personal protection, etc.). 

Supposedly, guns  keep tyranny at bay. Is that so? When was the last time  guns did that? 

The hallmark of America's republic is free and fair elections. I, like most, believe that the 2020 Presidential election was fair and honest. Clearly, though, thousands upon thousands did not, and argued the election was ""stolen"".  To ""steal"" an election would constitute tyranny on the largest scale, and we saw a dramatic response to this supposed tyranny on January 6th.  

Yet even in the face of this so-called overreach and corruption, where were the guns? Not a sole brought one to prevent this tyranny from occurring on January 6th (thankfully). If not in that moment, then when will they be necessary? 

In short, I feel that American's using this excuse to keep guns in society are lying to themselves if they think this is a true statement. These gun owners lack the courage to actually use them in situations they consistently cite as reason for needing guns because they are afraid of the consequences.  "

I occasionally get that anxious feeling of a car accident or collision when getting a ride with the family or on the city bus. Whenever I do, I would be ready and position myself, sitting upright, pulling on my seatbelt strap, and hands on my knees.

I hate getting those anxious moods during a ride and don't want to imagine what would happen if I got anxious in the driver's seat.

The frequency of these anxious moods is enough to make me have a very, negative view on driving. You have to pay attention and be extremely focused while driving. You have to be defensive, pay attention to your surroundings, obey road signs., and have good driving habits.

I can perfectly understand the road signs and etiquette fine, but all of this sounds overwhelming. Especially so for someone that has inattentive ADHD. (aka, meeee!) What if I can't be a good driver? What if I cause an accident?

Even if you are a quality, model driver, you can still get into a fatal car accident. You might be sideswiped, collided from behind, god knows what other terrifying ways there are.

I've seen news reports online of car pursuits colliding with other cars, or a runaway car smashing through another car at high speed. It's terrifying to see these innocent drivers get into a car accident they had no role in.

So I ask for anyone to please, change my view. While I have my identification card, a driver's license and vehicle are a necessity for work today. I cannot have a healthy or possibly safe experience with driving if I have these anxious beliefs rooted in my mind."

However, at an unspecified point, control begins to become counterproductive. It belittles the controlled party because doing what is asked is often setting a very low low bar. There is no feeling of reward when acting because it is what is asked of you, not something you are doing on your own volition. It is expected, and it subconsciously makes the controlled party feel there is something lacking on their end that requires them to be controlled. This directly undermines confidence and the feeling of being a sovereign entity. I’d be interested to hear about any studies on this topic."
144,2023-03-28,CMV: Speed limit signs are meaningless if the road was designed to go faster,u/-Wobblier,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/124qjge/cmv_speed_limit_signs_are_meaningless_if_the_road/,changemyview,"In most cases, speed limits in the US are designed as a sign that says to go certain speed. There are usually no physical limitations in the road that would force drivers to actually go that speed. And on the contrary, road designs in the US encourage speeding because lanes are designed to be wide and forgiving.

A perfect example of this was proven during the pandemic. Since there were less drivers on the roads, you would expect there to be less motor vehicle accidents. But the opposite happened. Motor vehicle related deaths increased because drivers weren't stuck in traffic and could use the full potential of the roads, which is typically much higher than the limit. Therefore, the speed limit signs have no real point on most US roads.

Edit: I think that I'm learning that speed limits are really only there to ""anchor"" you, socially/legally. Though as we know, people will generally drive faster than what's posted, and this is usually fine, because of course not everyone who speeds is pulled over. In fact most people who speed are not pulled over. Which again, makes me wonder the point of setting a limit that will be pushed anyway. "

So, women's rights movement was created to give women equal rights, since women were oppressed, and wanted to have equal rights. Then, after some decades, men's rights movement was created, since males also had a disadvantage with some aspects, in comparison to women. So, both of them were experiencing sexism in different aspects. But after some time, men's rights movement is slowly turning into a misogynistic mess, because instead of reducing sexism, this movement is acting toxic towards women, like they are saying that women are constantly falsely accusing males of heinous crimes. While I won't deny that false accusations definitely are a problem, this movement is attempting to villainize women into people who constantly falsely accuse men. So, my problem is that men's rights movement turned into women hating mess, with lots of misogynistic males hiding behind that movement."

The landlord tells the tenant “hey, I got another unit that the previous tenants just moved out of. I need to get the place cleared out. If you help me out with that job, we can skip rent this month.”

This would be socially acceptable. In fact, I think many would say it’s downright kind. A landlord who will be flexible and occasionally accept work instead of money as rent would be a godsend for many tenants.

Now let’s change the hypothetical a little bit. This time the landlord tells the struggling tenant “hey, I want to have sex with you. If you have sex with me, we can skip rent this month.”

This is socially unacceptable. This landlord is not so kind. The proposition makes us uncomfortable. We don’t like the idea of someone selling their body for the money to make rent.

Where does that uncomfortableness come from?

As Clinical Psychology Professor Dr. Eric Sprankle put it on Twitter:

&gt;If you think sex workers ""sell their bodies,"" but coal miners do not, your view of labor is clouded by your moralistic view of sexuality.

The uncomfortableness that we feel with Landlord 2’s offer comes from our moralistic view of sexuality. Landlord 2 isn’t just offering someone a job like any other. Landlord 2 is asking the tenant to debase himself or herself. Accepting the offer would humiliate the tenant in a way that accepting the offer to clean out the other unit wouldn’t. Even though both landlords are using their relative power to get something that they want from the tenant, we consider one job to be exceptionally “worse” than the other.  There is a perception that what Landlord 2 wants is something dirty or morally depraved compared to what Landlord 1 wants, which is simply a job to be complete. All of that comes from a Puritan moralistic view of sex as something other than—something more disgusting or more immoral than—labor that can be exchanged for money.

In order to fully normalize sex work, we need to normalize what Landlord 2 did. He offered the tenant a job to make rent. And that job is no worse or no more humiliating than cleaning out another unit. Both tenants would be selling their bodies, as Dr. Sprankle puts it. But if one makes you more uncomfortable, it’s only because you have a moralistic view of sexuality.

The upvote  system reduces fake reviews since real users will downvote them until they are hidden. While accurate reviews will be pushed to the top. 

This works poorly for social media because this same system creates an echo chamber of thought as on popular takes will be upvoted. While unpopular takes, even if rational, will be downvoted.

The Threads

On most review sites one cannot communicate with other consumers. I think it would be great to be able to comment under a consumer's review so that one could obtain more information on the product. This Information  may be overlooked or purposedly hidden by sellers.

Reddit threads are somewhat difficult to sort through, especially on mobile. Unless someone replies directly to you or has alot of upvotes, it takes a bit of effort to see other comments. So it's a poor feature for social media.


Moderation

If sellers moderate their product subreddit than they could easily manipulate reviews.  This is the main issue with reddit reviews but... The upvote system *should* counter that. Perhaps there can be a feature that prevents sellers from making subbreddits. Maybe an application of some sort. 

Moderation is a good thing for reddit as a social media site in some senses. Helps for organization of topics. I find that other social media can tend to have randomized feeds of information even if a specific topic has been esablished. But, similiar to the upvote system, the mods create a bias in subbreddits. 

So, what do you agree?

Is reddit better as a review site than it is as a social media platform?"

They seem like one of the more broadly nutritional fruits. 

Also I recently learned that their nutritional content is affected by their ripeness so if you're diabetic unripe bananas offer a lot of starch with not so much sugar.

So I guess change my view that given the choice of snack the smartest choice is nearly always a banana"

What I mean by this prescriptive statements like “if you want to follow the law you should not steal.” Is an objective statement. 

This might seem obvious but a few weeks ago I thought the opposite, and after a CMV post and introspection I changed my mind, so I wanted to come back here to see if there are any holes or arguments against my new viewpoint that CMV can point out. 

Specifically the logic that led to my new viewpoint is:
1. statements that correctly follow formal logic are objective.
2. prescriptive statements are a part of formal logic.
3. Therefore some prescriptive statements are objective.

But past the bare minimum needed for the story to make sense, adding random ""creative"" new details for no reason doesn't really add anything, and almost always serves as a cheap distraction from lack of character depth, meaningful themes, plot, or delving into concepts. A lot of the time it feels less like a cohesive story and more a kid rambling, just slapping whatever comes to mind into the story.

For example, a lot of Studio Ghibli movies or Harry Potter; adding a bunch of random spells or fictional animals just because it's fun takes away from a story's capability to be meaningful, serious, or engaging, because it arbitrarily adds things whenever it wants to. Avatar: The Last Airbender had this to a certain extent by adding a new convenient animal or bending ability whenever plot was running dry. 

In comparison, stories that are more rooted in reality with only one or two major ""gimmicks"" have a lot more space to focus on characters, plot, and the gimmick repercussions on the world and characters. It's a lot easier for them to have a clear, engaging, high-stakes plot with a moving theme/message. Some good examples are Chainsaw Man, Artemis Fowl, or House MD where the gimmicks are devils/fairies/an impossibly genius doctor, and the plots focus more on how the singular gimmick would interact with the world.  All three stories have much more developed characters, themes, and messages too, and I'd argue at least partially because there's not a ton of unnecessary, over the top worldbuilding. 

Ig in conclusion, I don't see why stories with a ton of worldbuilding are automatically considered great writing, especially when excess creative details are prioritized over plot, characters, or themes. It'd change my view if someone could convince me that 1) creative worldbuilding takes actual authorial skill, 2) there are examples with both developed plot/characters/themes and a lot of worldbuilding, or 3) worldbuilding has inherent value in making writing more valuable."

I never knew of it's significance and potence until late last year ( i go to an all dudes school). 

Majority of my friends are female, and after asking them many questions, ever since intermediate (11 -13) their self-confidence has drastically dropped. One could make the argument that it's just teenagers, but I think makeup plays a vital part in this lack of self-confidence. 

My girlfriend puts on makeup all the time, regardless of whether she'll go out that day. I've tried to make her realize she looks good without it to some avail, and i'm proud of her, but what she does plenty of other girls do and I think that's really bad for the mental health of what will be the women of our society.

Preemptive points: (not presented as axioms but personal truths I'm open to debating)
1. Mice dying while harvesting wheat is incidental not equal to deliberate slaughter
2. If livestock was killed painlessly that's how we'd euthenise humans and execute the death penalty
3. Letting cows go extinct is more humane than the cycle of needless cruelty/ they're not being kept from extinction cause anyone cares about them but because they're tasty.

Edit:
So some arguments more vitriolic and childish than others. But on the whole a good bredth of views. 

Main take away is that people identifying themselves as animal lovers likely aren't using it in the same way at all to how I would use it.

""

This can come in the form of explicit subjugation or segregation e.g. slavery or pre 1965 America, or, from giving one race advantages over another because of their race e.g. affirmative action, diversity quotas.

The last 2 forms mentioned seem blatantly unfair to me. Modern day white and Asian students had no part in the racism of the twentieth century, but are still expected to perform better for the same chance of admission than a black student. This is especially wrong in the case of poor white or asian people, who in no way benefit from the historic subjugation of african americans, but still have to meet higher standards for admission to colleges. 

The argument given for the latter 2 forms being acceptable is that minority groups (in this case African Americans) have been historically oppressed and as a result of this they are at a disadvantage when it comes to job opportunities, applications to university, and many other areas. While I think this is obviously the case, African Americans being on average poorer than average in the US is in large part due to the legacy of segregation and racism, I don't see how reversing the direction of racism solves this issue. Surely the goal is to completely disregard race as a factor, due to the fact that it's an arbitrary distinction and doesn't have a significant impact on peoples abilities and temperaments.

I think the real way to solve this problem would be to ensure that the income of the family you're born into doesn't have such a large effect on your educational and employment opportunities, which would neutralize the effect of generational poverty on black people without giving them an unfair advantage over other races or having to characterize people based on their race. This could be done through better and more equally funded public education, and admissions based on family income (giving poorer students the advantage) rather than race.

The concept says every law needs 4 parts to make sure it works well, is responsible, and can change. This idea wants to create laws that use data and fit society's needs. The 4 parts are:

1. The Law: This part talks about the main rules and policies. It should say what the law covers, who it affects, and any legal results. The words should be easy to understand to avoid confusion.
2. The Desired Outcome: This part shows the goals the law wants to reach. By saying the outcomes, lawmakers and people can see if the law works. The outcomes should be possible to measure and reach, so we can see how the law affects society.
3. Time Period: This part sets a time for when we will look at how well the law works. Having a time period makes sure the law is checked often, and we can change it if needed. The time should be long enough to see the law's effects but not too long so it doesn't get stuck without changes.
4. Variable Identification: This part makes lawmakers find and talk about the main things that could change how the law works. These things might include people, money, or technology. By thinking about these things, lawmakers can be ready for challenges and change the law if needed.

Using and Changing:

When the law starts, we will watch how it works based on the outcomes and time period. If the law doesn't work or gets old because of changing things, it must go through a process to change. This process makes us look at the law, find out why it didn't work, and change it to make it better. This way, laws stay useful and work well for society's needs.

In short, the 4-part law framework makes lawmaking better, responsible, and able to change. By adding outcomes, time periods, and finding changing things, lawmakers can make stronger and more helpful laws for society."

The classic example of why this is a risk is the “paperclip maximizer”, a hypothetical superintelligent AI that is given a mundane goal like “make as many paperclips as possible” and goes on to murder everyone and dismantle the entire planet to harvest all of our atoms to make more and more paperclips. 

It does seem hazardous to tell a superintelligent being to make as many paperclips as possible, or any other open-ended goal. Vague goals, like “maximize human happiness” seem dangerous as well, likely to result in a crazed machine giving everyone involuntary surgery to electrically stimulate the happiness center of your brain forever. 

But in the back of my mind, I’ve often wondered if you couldn’t easily avoid these dangers by just giving specific and closed ended goals. Like “make 5 paperclips” instead of make as many as you possibly can. I know there would be other risks associated with AI of course - maybe it uses your bones to make those paperclips or something weird like that. But at the very least it seems unlikely to result in mass extermination and the downfall of civilization. 

I’d like this view changed, if possible, because if there is some hazard that I’m not seeing then it could impact my policy preferences and to a lesser extent my politics or voting. Sorry if there’s an obvious answer I’m totally missing but it just seems like a lot of the problems could be mitigated by just setting a smaller, specific, closed-ended goal and then shutting the damn thing off when it’s completed."
0,2023-03-29,CMV: the theory of natural selection is eliminated with developed conscience and medical accessibility,u/snotballbootcamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1267yu3/cmv_the_theory_of_natural_selection_is_eliminated/,changemyview,"I've had this idea bouncing around in my head for a while. I think that when a species has access to medical resources and the conscience to choose/feel love, natural selection is gone. 

Basically, the theory is that only beings with the ""strongest genes"" i.e resistant to cancer, physically and mentally able, etc will reproduce as the others will die out before they can reproduce efficiently. 

EDIT: by strongest genes I did not actually mean strongest genes. I meant most adaptable and survivable but worded it incorrectly

But humans, for example, choose who they love and do not choose their mates based off  of traits that would be longetivically strong even though they are recognizable. I, as a human woman, can love and reproduce with a man who has cancer or disabilities or whatever. 

This also applies for small things like allergies, mental illnesses that are hereditary, and hereditary diseases, which brings me to my next point of medical availability.

Without medicine, people with internal issues such as heart or brain disease would die, but with medicine they can be cured but the ""bad genes"" would still be passed on to any offspring. Most notably, I think this applies to people with breast cancer because it is notoriously hereditary but comparatively easily cured. 

Another point I want to mention is sexuality, because if natural selection applied to humans then it would not ""make sense"" for people to be homosexual, whether or not it was a choice to love someone of the same sex, because it is not possible to reproduce. Obviously there are options like donors and adoption but it is not biologically the child of two same-sexed humans. (This is not a homophobic comment, just a thought piece)

I'm just curious what parts of my argument are lacking and if I make any sense at all because I'm no biology professor or anything"
1117,2023-03-29,CMV: It is more likely than not that America’s mass shooting problem will not improve in the next 10 years,u/hansolo2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/126980l/cmv_it_is_more_likely_than_not_that_americas_mass/,changemyview,"One of the more infamous mass shootings in American history, the Columbine shooting, happened DURING the assault weapons ban passed by the Clinton administration.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre

It appears that gun control is easily one of the most divisive and heated political issue in America with no signs of being resolved.

A year after Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law last year, it appears to have done nothing to stem mass shootings in the USA.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Safer_Communities_Act

Whether a state has strict gun control like New York and California or loose gun control like Tennessee and Texas, the only state that seems to be safe from mass shootings is Hawaii. 

Both sides of the gun control argument have powerful lobbying organizations, such as Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown and the NRA that seem to create a gridlock on the issue.

The side in favor of gun control seems to have no intention whatsoever of making any compromises with the pro gun side and while the pro gun side has made certain concessions to the anti gun side in a sense, they still hold pretty firm in their policy ideas and beliefs.

The pro gun control side pushes very hard to ban assault weapons, but banning assault weapons won’t stop mass shooters from using shotguns, pistols or even using home made bombs or using a car to plow into people at high rates of speed.

Medicare 4 all is pushed by Democrats as a possible solution but a majority of Americans do not support implementing M4A.

So it appears that for the time being, mass shootings will continue to plague America despite the best efforts of a concerted few."
7,2023-03-29,"CMV: the criminal justice system should focus more on rehabilitation, ALSO it should not include the death penalty",u/FoundationOfFarts,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1269vpd/cmv_the_criminal_justice_system_should_focus_more/,changemyview,"two for one in this post, I'd like to discuss each. &amp; I'm feeling less firm on my view of the death penalty. becAuse i find the argument ""wasted resources"" (like those spent on prisoners who failed/are uninterested in rehabilitation.)to be pretty valid. of course i was thinking about this all day, i went down a lot of different subs and collected points from each side of these arguments.

one idea that i firmly agree with, which conveniently combats the waste concept is.. we COULD have less people inside. as in.. victimless crimes should not result in incarceration, (not NO punishment, i think its important to keep a deterrent in place, maybe.. via retribution? whether solely financial or not, idk. but) this would apply to minor drug possessions, and with that, its only reasonable everyone currently inside for (only) that.. should be released.! we've seen before how the war on drugs is ineffective, im not here to discuss this. &gt;!(well unless you rly want to)!&lt;
i just mean we wouldnt have to worry about the money and food put towards keeping those ""lost causes"" alive if we stopped locking up 22yros for having 3lbs of pot. (or more dangerous substances. thats moot so long as they were intending on using it personally, and not giving it to children or something evil like that.)

i feel like prison should only be a place for those who lack empathy, honestly. it should function like a strenuous ""get mentally well"" course, that will go on and on until you pass. OR as a holding place for those who dont want to participate. &lt;-- these are the only people that i think would be viable for the death penalty. like in a situation where our country runs out of food, it should be the dangerous population that gets cut off first. not that i think they should be cut out when theres currently no harm in keeping them where they are. (of course, maybe we could use the taxpayer dollars for healthcare.. thats an option. BUT if we're looking for taxpayer dollars, i can name a few other places to start &gt;! 👀 corrupt policeforce.? !&lt; fair argument though. we could prosper with even more resources available.)

anyway, to get into the real meat n' potatoes of this post; IMO murder should only be acceptable in self-defence situations, as a last resort.
(yes this includes abortion (if you consider that murder) since pregnancy&amp;birth can take your life or lead to irreversible mental and/or physical damage.) I'll go into furthur detail of what i feel constitutes ""self defence"" if requested.

i believe anyone can change for the better, learn empathy/to behave. so long as they want to. yes even rapists, racists &amp; pedos. in the circumstance of dealing with a damaged&amp;confused individual, we should lead with pity. not pain.

you can see that even in the very beginning, during CHILDHOOD, people respond better to positive reinforcement &amp; being given the chance to understand what is right and what is fair. I'm sure we're all capable of coming to the same consensus that no one deserves to be hurt. with time, pity, effort and patience, an attacker can be taught to be better. FORCING people to submit will only work for as long as you are in control, it does not result in respect, or an individual who aspires for the success of his brothers. just someone who waits for their next opportunity to continue doing what they know.

this same logic applies to an argument that i think will be prompted in response to my ""death penalty bad""  and that is.. ""the death penalty can offer closure to victims and their families"" and i DO think its reasonable to not want your attacker to be free, risking a repeat offense.. but wishing for their death? its malicious.

honestly, its so hypocritical to punish someone's inflicted pain with more pain. ""youre not supposed to hurt others! now feel my wrath!"" like what. what lesson is being taught there. &gt;!the lesson of ""dont get caught"" maybe jfc!&lt; its so simple to just not hurt others at all. if our system's response to crime looked more like an effort to teach empathy (while simultaneously separating attackers from the vulnerable) wouldnt we all be happier.?

""they deserve it"" is the evilest argument there is. no one deserves to die.


today, i was trying to come up with an alternative to the death penalty, not releasing the perp into the general population again &amp; not killing them either. like what should you do with the ""lost causes"" ? but..idk.. it doesnt seem like there's any option other than imprisonment for those that cant help but be evil. you've got to protect the vulnerable.

i wouldnt mind getting some more feedback on THAT idea, even tho its entirely unrelated, probably via DM, since the sub doesnt allow comments not pertaining to the CMV aspect.

anyway. rehabilitation/teaching empathy &amp; keeping possible threats in a position where theyre not able to do damage should be the first and foremost goal of the penal system:) but, there should be less people being punished in the first place. only the malicious &amp; those SO confused they could do harm.
also, death should only be a last resort.

im really just looking to develop my stance on these things further. especially since im kinda on the fence about the death penalty thing. how far could you carry the argument that we NEED those resources so badly that someone should instead die. (remember, i dont think killing them because they ""deserve"" it is ..empathetic enough? it makes me question if anyone posing that argument should be treated with the same pity &amp; effort towards teaching better behavior as the criminals they condemn.)

Reason 1: Most apparent reason, it's predatory. Interest rates are So. Damn. High. And it's often compound interest plus penalties once you fail to repay in time. As many as 64 percent of people have to renew their payday loan, resulting in interest money skyrocketing and only 15 percent of borrowers repay all of their payday debts when due without re-borrowing within 14 days; 20 percent default on a loan at some point. Source: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finds-four-out-of-five-payday-loans-are-rolled-over-or-renewed 

Reason 2: Those in real dire need of payday loans are usually poor people, these loans are sucking the blood out of them to benefit the capitalists. The government can issue welfare benefits that don't need to be repaid (for the most needy people), interest-free loans (for the next most needy people) and low-interest loans (for ""normal"" people who need money for an emergency) to help them, and maybe also put more fund into the healthcare industry (like maybe fund a compulsory basic health insurance) so people don't go broke with a single illness if they don't have one of those notoriously expensive private insurances. 

Reason 3: Payday loans are often hard to distinguish from illegal loan sharks, and confused people may accidentally choose an illegal, violent loan shark when they want to use a legal payday loan. If we just outlaw any loan with an annual interest rate of greater than (inflation rate+20%), people would easily know it's illegal."

Making sure somebody is responsible enough to care for a pet and can meet the demands of a pet before they are legally allowed to obtain a license to have a pet. A £10 fee every year to renew your license and paying for accommodation inspections is a low price to pay for animal welfare. It would end a lot of neglect because every year when a license is renewed and the animal is showing clear signs of neglect such as malnutrition or flea infestation, the animal is taken away and the pet owner had his licence stripped off them as well as it's cost effective because not only are the inspections paid for buy the owner but the renewal of the license funds the system too."

Obviously, the company/people can't forever keep files on their servers, e.t.c, so my solution is to legally bind anyone who created a public work of art to release it in the public domain if they can no longer maintain it. With that in mind though, I'm open to hear other people's opinions on this and why it would/wouldn't work

No, I’m not talking about Ukraine ceding territory to Russia, I’m talking about Ukraine ceding territory to Poland. At the end of World War 2, Russia forcibly removed 75,000 km of territory from Poland and incorporated it into Russia while giving Poland around the same amount of German territory. In other words, Poland was picked up and moved 50 miles West. See Wikipedia article for the cliff notes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_changes_of_Poland_immediately_after_World_War_II. Long story short, much of the territory stolen from Poland is now in Ukraine. This territory is now filled with ethnic and linguistic Ukrainians and Poles. Depending on how you sliced it, the area annexed by Poland could conceivably look like any of these three options https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ukraine#/media/File:Western_Ukr.png. 


Now, why on earth would Ukraine want to do this, or Poland want to do this? Using the exact same argument that Russia made for annexing the Donbass/Crimea, Poland could annex (with permission) the Western regions of Ukraine temporarily without triggering a war with Russia. This would have a multitude of effects. First, it would free up many soldiers all at once that are currently guarding the border against aggression from Belarus, or Russians using Belarusian territory as they did in their initial invasion. It would allow for the emplacement of additional air defense systems that could cover the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv (or Kiev). It would bring NATO troops much closer to Russia’s borders, causing a political poo-storm for Vladimir “Khuylo” Putin. It would vastly shorten supply lines needed to get supplies from the West to troops on the front line. In would create a de facto “no fly zone” in Western Ukraine (which is now Poland). It would allow the Ukrainians to concentrate air defense systems along the front lines, getting them much closer to air superiority. 
Yes this is a less than perfect solution for Ukraine which would at least temporarily give up some of its sovereignty, but it would be giving it up to an ally in its fight against an aggressor.


Edit:
My view has been changed thanks to u/birdmanbox. While I do absolutely believe that my proposal would help Ukraine militarily, its justification would be seen by the Russians as justification for their occupation of Ukranian territory. Thanks for the lively discussion folks!"

Ranked choice voting and instant runoff are not the same thing. Ranked choice is any system where the voter ranks the candidates on the ballot in order of preference. At this point, there are multiple ways of determining who is the winner based on the ranked ballots. Instant runoff is just one method. There are many others. Usually when this topic comes up, people are suggesting a ranked choice ballot and an instant runoff method for counting the ballots (I'll refer to this as RC+IRV). That is not exactly the same as what I am suggesting.

The main motivation of this proposal is because I believe the two-party political paradigm is driving US politics into a destructive place. Party primaries produce candidates that try to “out-extreme” each other, then candidates dance a little back toward the middle for the general. Even this characterization assumes that there are only two opinions on anything and that the two opinions on different issues are always grouped the same way. People who do not feel either of the two parties represent them are left feeling like they have to choose between two bad options. The common wisdom is that voting for a third party is “throwing away your vote” because a third party has no chance.

The two-party system creates another problem. The legislative branch is supposed to perform oversight over the executive, with impeachment of the chief executive as the strongest tool to wield. With the two-party dynamic though, the chief executive comes from one of the two teams of power in the legislature. If the president’s team is in majority, there is no oversight and the president acts with impunity. If the president’s team is not in majority, the president is subject to frivolous impeachments of partisan motivation. It is becoming a completely dysfunctional system.

What we need is a voting system that allows third parties to gain support. A system where people are free to vote for who they really want without worrying about ""throwing away their vote"". We need a system that does not have a spoiler effect. A system where voters vote their true conscience and don't need to try to vote ""strategically"". Even if third parties do not win elections, a system that reveals how much support third parties have will cause the major parties to start changing their platforms to better align with what the voters actually want.

RC+IRV is often suggested as a solution. When it is, people immediately point out the shortcoming that it can lead to strange results, such as this [real life Burlington example](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/113db6o/comment/j8pn71s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

I think this problem is easily solved by using a Condorcet complete method to select the winner. Using the ranked ballots, you can perform a head-to-head comparison between each candidate pair (candidate A beats candidate B if more ballots rank A higher than B). The winner is whoever can win a head-to-head comparison against any other candidate (ie the Condorcet winner). If there is no Condorcet winner (think rock-paper-scissors paradox), first any candidate that loses to all the others is eliminated. Then, from the remaining set, the candidate with the least first place votes is eliminated. This is repeated until there is a Condorcet from the remaining candidates. This is basically [Tideman method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tideman_alternative_method).

I am specifically not suggesting this method for election of the US president because the presidential race is too controversial. It can already take a long time after election day to determine the winner. The election is already rife with accusations of rigging. Making it more complicated would just give more reasons for people to suggest foul play. If we can get better representation in the legislature, however, that can mean a world of difference for earlier stated reasons. People put too much importance on the president, but the legislature writes the laws and performs oversight on the POTUS. Also, state and local politics, while often overlooked, is where policies are made that more closely affect people’s lives. Therefore, a better election method for governors, mayors, and state legislatures would be an excellent improvement.

**Counter-arguments I have heard:**

*This method is still victim to favorite betrayal* – Yes, this method is not perfect, but that particular problem can only happen if there is no Condorcet winner. That would be rare. Even with that possibility, Condorcet RCV is still a vast improvement over what we currently have.

*Approval voting is better* – Approval voting does not allow you to indicate that you like one candidate more than another. I think this will still leave voters feeling like they have to make difficult choices rather than express their true opinion.

*Score voting is better* – Here is an example as to my biggest problem with score voting. Say there are 100 voters. 45 voters score candidate A – 5 and B – 0. 55 voters score B – 4 and A – 0. Those 55 voters all liked various other parties, but none of those other parties had enough support to win. Candidate A wins with an average score of 2.25, beating candidate B with an average score of 2.2, even though most voters liked candidate B over candidate A.

*STAR voting is better* – STAR voting fixes the above issue with a instant runoff between the top two scored candidates. This just seems like RCV with extra steps. I think ranking candidates is more intuitive than scoring them.

*Approval and score voting can be implemented using existing voting machines* – I don’t think this makes up for the other reasons I find them inferior.

*Proportional representation is better* – I agree. This could happen in state houses but unfortunately it does not work for the federal legislature. The US is comprised of states and each state get a certain number of seats. Changing to a system where seats are awarded to parties proportional to that party’s support would require states to cede their power to a different system. The US congress is supposed to represent precincts on a local basis and the senate represents states. This is unfortunately not compatible with proportional representation. I suppose an individual state with lots of congresspeople could appoint them proportionally but now that state’s voters do not have local representatives. Changing to a complete different paradigm is outside the scope of this CMV."

1. The average has incredibly shallow understanding of most things, and are at the same time over-confident
2. People upvote mostly based on emotions (I'm no exception to this), and emotions have a way of getting in the way of logic, making emotionally triggering posts more salient but lacking the required ""truth"" non-emotionally triggering posts need for upvotes.

I think this applies to any subreddit in the top 50 subreddits by members, as the hivemind tends towards the population mean.

I think there are exceptions to this rule, when the subreddits are heavily moderated and truth/objectivity are required, like r/OutOfTheLoop or r/bestof

I guess the core of meme is getting the reference. If so, I haven't really seen any memes in the right context. But I can't imagine how any context can save something that is, uh, just fundamentally crappy.

The memes I've seen looks a bit like dad jokes. A tired punchline repeated badly, without any effort. And while dad jokes, in their pure form are at least geniue (the ""dad"" truly believe he is being fresh and clever) in contrast to this, memes just seem so desperately ironic and distanced.

My feeling is that memes will go the same way as the Flash format. This was *the* format for everything entertaining on the web, but today it is all but forgotten because badly animated clipart with an ironic voice-over simply isn't all that grand.

A lot of books, reddit posts, youtubers and games offers inspirering, honest and challenging ideas. Why should I miss out on any of this for something that just seems worse in every aspect?

So basically what I'm talking about are policies that x amount of films shown in cinemas have to be national. Screen quotas shouldn't exist because

* They're limiting freedom of expression. The government is imposing rules as to what needs to be shown in cinemas, instead of letting cinemas decide what they want to show. It also limits what people see as they may not get to see the movie that they want to because showings of said movie will be limited in order to make space for national films
* The government shouldn't get to intervene at all when it comes to what people watch(as long as said content is legal), instead, what is shown in cinemas should be decided by public demand
* They are bad for cinemas. If screen quotas are implemented, it will cause to cinemas to lose profit, since the showings of Avengers, Star Wars, Batman and other movies and franchises that will get more people to go to the cinema(and in turn get more people to buy overpriced popcorn and soda) will be limited to accommodate for less profitable movies
* If you go to the cinema to watch a international movie that's really successful but you can't because the tickets have sold out, you're not gonna be like ""Hey I came here to watch Avengers, but since it's sold I'm gonna watch this random national movie I've never heard of instead"" so they are kinda pointless"

I'm down with the world building, the hero complexes, the monster girl stuff, the sexy times, all of it. HOWEVER, it seems to me that repeatedly I'm reading gastly sex scenes that are just ridiculously inept. These are from authors I really enjoy, are super popular, and have ongoing series that sell well. 

Why spend soooo much time working out the details of all the other aspects of these interesting worlds and complex narratives and then neglect just this? Here's a real excerpt from an author I really enjoy writing about a cis gendered straight relationship. 

""I grabbed her petite waist and lifted her up, and she giggled as I easily carried her over to the bed. Then I gently laid her down and admired the view as she smiled up at me from the satin sheets. I climbed onto the bed and laid down on my side next to her as my hand roamed over her perky tits and pinched each nipple.""

Aside from the fact that I personally find the word ""tits"" terribly unsexy, it's a situation of grabbing someone, pinching their breasts and then banging it in as they are suddenly totally wet and ready. I see this over and over. There's about 1 line of foreplay and each woman is immediately primed to go. Look, I get that the heroes in these stories are the ultimate male fantasy, but how is this enjoyable for readers of any gender? This seems like a disservice to the story, the characters, and the readers.

I'm not expecting ""wuthering heights of ecstasy"" with Fabio or anything but a nod to some semblance of actuality would be nice since other parts of the story reflect Earth normative behavior. Is it because these are primarily written by men and this is how they imagine the scenario? That would be surprising since foreplay is fun for all.

I feel like since more women also enjoy games, strategy, fantasy and other pastimes that draw them into this genre, it would be smart to entice them to not skip these lame segments AND we should not convey to male readers that this is the right way to seduce someone or normalize this. If you're going to include it, just give it some thought. Especially if you have some fantasy or alien creature. Enhance the story! I'm sure the lovers out there could write some good stuff in this area. Why is a good sex scene so rare?

That said, what could change my mind is anything that shows that Communism (fully and ""properly"" implemented) will indeed have the promised result of bettering society for the little guy and not just result in a state owned economy, taking any and all economic power away from the people and giving it to an increasingly omnipotent government under a one party rule."

2) The House of Representatives is (usually) more representative of the American People than the electoral college, and this change will unironically make the election MORE democratic, not less.

3) The dynamic of the President leading Congress’s government, and serving at their pleasure will make it possible to overcome gridlock and tackle serious challenges in a timely manner, something our current system struggles with mightily.

This really can apply to any major city, but I'm choosing LA because it's where I live and I see the effects first hand. 

Pretty much daily, there are threads here across many subs complaining about the lack of housing, nimbys, and zoning laws that are stopping LA from building more homes, specifically affordable housing. Why does LA need to build more? Do we really need more people to move here? At what point is a city at capacity? Never?

LA is a desirable city for many reasons, and desirable things cost money. Why should a city be any different? Should everyone be able to live in LA simply because they want to?  

This isn't a case of ""I got mine, so screw everyone else"", I'm actually in the process of moving because I simply can no longer afford LA. However, this doesn't seem to stop anyone else, in every single housing thread people bring up a million ""solutions"", but none of them involve people moving to somewhere they can afford.

But often the Left doesn't care at all about how unappealing it looks, certainly not compromising. It stays very fast to it's 'morals', and if others don't subscribe to them, even if they agree but not to same severity, they'll be very quick to cast them out.

11,2023-03-30,CMV: Web3 does not exist.,u/skynet0x01,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1276vy3/cmv_web3_does_not_exist/,changemyview,"**EDIT:  Title should be changed to ""CMV: The concept of Web3 has no substance""**

&amp;#x200B;

There has been (or used to be) excessive attention received on building technologies and applications around the concept of Web3 (which, to some extent, is not clearly defined).

&amp;#x200B;

So I will start with defining Web3 for the sake of this argument:

* We will take a narrow definition by defining Web3 as the collective of **Distributed Apps** built on top of **Blockchains**.
* There may be broader definitions, which are not within the scope of this argument:
   * Say you take out the 'Blockchain' predicate, then Web3 could refer to all distributed apps, even including Torrent.
   * Say you take out the 'Distributed Apps' predicate, then Web3 could refer to all crypto exchanges, or simply wallets.  This is because the term 'App' has a particular meaning, often referring to things like games or web applications, that developers or large companies build, rather than referring to a financial market or a bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

My view is that, the following statements are true:

* Blockchain is merely just a liquidity tool - a way for participants to exchange information securely, reliability, sometimes in a programmable way.  There are no fundamental differences between blockchain and SWIFT, except following a different philosophy (centralized vs 'decentralized', non-programmable vs 'programmable').
* The underlying infrastructure of blockchain would be inefficient to process anything other than financial transactions. By nature the volume of financial transactions is smaller, compared to others.  In fact, the action that you just open this reddit post, and post a comment if you will, would have already generated more data than any pre-existing blockchain can process within a second.  Even we stay within the original scope, being a liquidity tool, there is a long way to go.
* Attempts of building a game or create a real and useful application on top of blockchain will end up nowhere.  Imagine someone building Twitter, Reddit or Discord on top of blockchain - It would be  economically inefficient, if not physically impossible.  Now imagine World of Warcraft - The game we loved, storing all the data of players/items/.......  on blockchain?  Even Texas Poker is hardly fit.
* So why is that the story people tell (i.e. Web3 is eating the world?) has such much discrepancy from reality, is it because it hasn't happened yet?  My view is: No, it will not happen.  The term 'Web3' itself, is an excessive exaggeration, which has led people to believe there is a next generation of Web, where in fact there is not, and most components of the world that we are living in will unlikely have anything to do with any blockchain, even in the future.  This is merely a label, with a substance that does not exist.  I admit that there may be some useful use cases following the concept of Web3, but in the end, the use case will still be minor.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons behind this view:

* I have been studying so-called web3 companies for a while.  Most of these companies, if not purely speculative in nature, are essentially building financial products, or so-called 'token economy'.  And the more time I spend on these companies/products, the more I am convinced that there will eventually be no meaningful use case.
   * Majority of these companies are exchanges or wallets.  These still treat blockchains as a liquidity tool, goes no beyond the original scope of blockchain.
   * There are companies doing GameFi. Now take a look at this list: [https://crypto.com/price/gamefi](https://crypto.com/price/gamefi).  The fact is, what they are really doing, is issuing NFTs, while the 'game' is only a by-product.
   * [Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) is no doubt notable, however that goes to my next point below.
* I have talked to many people that I came to believe that no one would put their serious use case on blockchain.  There is no point in doing it, and economically makes no sense of doing so.  Imagine:
   * If I own a B2B company, would I have anything to do with blockchain?  Most likely no.
   * If I am to build a Dark Forest game equivalent, other than receiving more attention/funds from associating with buzzwords like Web3/blockchain, would it make sense to make it on top of blockchain?  Are games not supposed to bring people fun, who would love a game that itself is a by-product?
* I myself am a software engineer, the more I study blockchain projects, the more I tend to think these are just a pile of hobby projects, with very poor engineering standards.  Those software are being produced excessively, surpassing the real demand (Take this metaphor: it is like people need SWIFT, or NASDAQ at best, yet you are saying that you would give them a metaverse).
   * Look at the list of pre-existing blockchains: [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/).  Count how many chains are there.  A lot of these chains run on poorly written software that usually goes crippled.
   * Why does the human society need so many chains?  The answer is no.  They build these chains to reap benefits (from private equity investors and individual investors), believing that if they can get more transactions onto their chain, their piece of pie goes larger.  Unfortunately there will not be a very big pie eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, challenge and change my view if possible.  Because If I am wrong, I am missing out on a huge chunk of opportunity."

How many people that don’t drink runs 10 miles everyday, never eats sugar, lives 40 miles away from the nearest civilization, only eats from their own farm, etc?"

**Definitions:**

*Potluck* is gathering where everyone brings and contributes evenly for the served food.

*Optimal* is way which is simple, requires little organization, fair, minimize food loss or excess food.

**Traditional way:**

There are multiple ways to do this. One is pre-set menu where everyone pick what they want to bring. But this approach has less variety, is hard to organize and some people might pick more or less than others so it’s not fair. For example, if you are a vegan you shouldn’t have to contribute for the meat.

Second option is “whatever”. Everyone brings food and often lots of it. Whenever this approach is taken the food waste is enormous.

**Better way:**

I propose third option. You bring one food enough to feed you for the entire night. For example, if you know you are going to take three full plates, you bring three full plates worth of potato salad and nothing else. No more no less. But because someone else wants potato salad they will trade you with equal amount of whatever they bought. This gives variety and minimal food loss. And because you bring food you like to eat there is no problem with vegan contributing for meat and no need for highly organized pre-set menu. There will be lot of variety.

If you want to add little organization you can distribute courses to people. Some people bring deserts, others main courses and someone else brings entrees and salads."

Thinking about someone else during sex is cheating or disrespectful, so why isn’t watching porn? Yeah it’s a “fantasy” but why wouldn’t you want to have to fantasies with your partner? I don’t understand stand it. Why not look at nudes of your partner or sexual videos of them? Is that not the same as porn? or make your own home made videos? Why does it HAVE to be of other people? I’ve seen so many men say “it’s normal, suck it up” as an excuse or explanation for watching porn. I much prefer looking at my partner (who’s the most attractive person in my eyes) to get off rather then random people i don’t even know solely because they’re “conventionally attractive” 

I’ll always personally think porn is cheating to me. but i’d love to hear what other people have to say and why it isn’t cheating to them and maybe change a couple views."

I'd like my view changed because maybe there isn't an option I'm not considering.

Personal context: I care for the soil on my property, my neighbors do not. Thus, the moles frequent my property over other nearby properties.

FYI: Anything about ""lawns are bad!"" is fine to post, but I doubt it's going to do anything to change my view about moles

Options:

1. Trapping - This is not the best option because you have to kill the animal, or risk hurting it by trapping it live and transporting it miles away. Also it's difficult to trap moles as it can be hard to identify which runs are ""main"" runs and not just one time feeding areas. Plus this isn't a permanent solution.
2. Deterrents - The only deterrent I've found that works (and confirmed with some cherry tree farmers) is castor oil. However, it needs to be re-applied constantly throughout the entire year (VERY expensive), and it's not 100% effective. With other deterrents, people often mistakenly think they've worked because they don't see visible mole activity even though the mole is still very much there.
3. Just ignoring them - If you just ignore them, eventually you're going to lose plants because they will tear through the roots. And you'll definitely not be able to maintain a lawn.
4. Killing the food source - Moles main food is worms, not grubs. Killing grubs does not make moles go away. Yes, removing all insects and worms from the area would deter the mole, but whatever you've done to kill all worms is certainly not good for the environment nor your soil.

The best way: Bury 1/2 hardware cloth either 3' deep or to the hard clay layer (whichever comes first), and have the bottom of the cloth go out at a 90' angle. Once this is done you no longer have to deal with or think about moles in the area anymore; They will not go into the area. I have heard there is a very slight chance they may travel on the surface and then go into the area, but I've yet to experience that happening myself. Even if that can happen, it still wouldn't make this not the best option."

And that it's not the consumers fault it's that the companies don't give consumers an environmentally conscious choice.

I think that's nonsense. People often point out that Coca-Cola is the biggest plastic polluter out there, but for as long as I can remember they've always offered Coca-Cola in cans and glass bottles which not only similarly priced, but are also infinitely recyclable with negligible losses, and environmentally neutral when they break down to sand and rust respectively. Consumers choose plastic bottles because it's more convenient. But no, it's Coca-Cola's fault for not magically making something that has all of the benefits of plastic without any of its impact because it's a big corporation.

People complain about sustainable fashion being unaffordable but every fast fashion outlet from Zara to H&amp;M to fucking Walmart offers cotton or even organic cotton options but people have still made Shein and their plastic garbage clothing the biggest clothing manufacturer on earth. But no it's ""the big fast fashion chain's fault"" and ""I'm just one consumer I won't have an impact""

People complain about the environmental impact of aviation but choose to fly instead of going cross country by bus in America or rail in Europe. Because it's ""the aviation industry's fault"". Why would they want to burn more fuel on purpose? You could literally choose a more efficient transport method.

The same with protein. There's been vegan alternatives for ages and now there's even plant-based meat but it's still not good enough.

I could go on and on.

I just don't see how anyone who even pretends to be environmentally conscious can think that the environmental impact of modern life is caused by ""corporations polluting"" because they don't offer you something with all of the convenience and absolutely none of the cons. That's impossible. This argument is just a cop out to avoid making the most minor tiny lifestyle changes.

I even considered that perhaps my economic viewpoint that consumption drives production is wrong, and that changing consuming habits won't change production. But even from the perspective of production driving consumption there are so many environmentally better alternatives to everything being produced and consumers still choose more harmful options because they are more convenient.

TLDR: Blaming corporations for damaging the environment is just a way to make consumers feel less guilty. They chose to buy worse environmental products."

895,2023-03-31,CMV: Sharing nudes of yourself with a partner is a bad idea for most people,u/ericoahu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/127xrwi/cmv_sharing_nudes_of_yourself_with_a_partner_is_a/,changemyview,"In most cases, for most people, sharing nudes of yourself with someone is a bad idea. The shorter and less committed the relationship, the worse of an idea it is. My view does not necessarily apply to or include people who are comfortable with anyone and everyone seeing their nudes. For example, if you earn money performing in porn of some sort or posing nude for publications, it *might not* be such a bad idea for you.

It is a bad idea primarily because there is a risk that your relationship will change in a way that makes you regret giving this person your nudes. For example, your consent to intimacy with you has been withdrawn, but they still possess and control intimate pictures or video of you. This alone can make it a bad idea for some. In more extreme cases, the ex might share those pictures (intentionally or unwittingly) somehow or, in the most extreme cases, perpetrate some kind of revenge porn situation. My view is not confined to either end of that continuum.

If you are a person who would not want a significant number of people, in the present or in the future, to see you undressed and/or doing something intimate, my view applies to you. Don't give anyone control over your nudes.

Definitions:

* ""partner"" Typically a relatively shorter-term fuck buddy or hookup but also to include a boyfriend, girlfriend, significant other, wife, husband, etc. There's no use putting a number on the length of relationship or trying to gauge the commitment in the relationship as I am more inclined to believe that it's just a bad idea for everyone, but I say ""for most people"" because I allow that there are some extremely rare couples out there who've earned each other's trust.
* ""nudes"" Any photo, video, or other reproductions of yourself under intimate circumstances that can be removed from your control--for example, some state of undress and/or doing something sexual--that you would not want shared without restriction. A common way of expressing this is a ""picture you wouldn't want your grandma to see."" But it's really up to the individual to decide what kind of material fits this category. My view is inclusive in this area, not exclusive.

The kinds of evidence and arguments that *might* change my mind or cause me to readjust my view includes, but is not limited to:

* Evidence (hard evidence - data) that most people don't mind if *anyone*\--their parents, coworkers, their children, friends, and innumerable random masturbators could have access to pictures of them nude. This is at least plausible because I've heard claims that young people care much less about privacy in general than older people, but I've never seen the claim substantiated yet. But I am not going to be satisfied with just an assertion or anecdotal evidence.
* Evidence (or solid reasoning) that those who had been victimized by things like revenge porn were not actually hurt by the distribution of their nudes. Or that trusting someone with nudes means you somehow deserve to have them distributed widely, outside your control and beyond your original intention when they were made.  I doubt anyone would or could make this argument, but for completeness, I am adding it.
* Thoroughly supported, well-organized arguments that the benefits of sharing nudes is well worth the risks for most people--i.e., the typical person with fairly average values and priorities. Similar to #1 above. You'd need to thoroughly and methodically walk me through it. A drive-by assertion won't cut it.

The kinds of arguments that **will certainly not** change my view include:

* Semantic games--nitpicking over definitions and my choice of words.
* Yeah-buts, what-abouts, and edge cases. My view is not absolute. I know there are rare exceptions. For example, I can imagine there are some couples out there whose relationship is probably measured in decades rather than years, months, or weeks, who have earned each other's trust well enough that the benefits might be worth it. Allowing photos of yourself naked to be used in medical textbooks or studies, or something along those lines, does not fall under the rubric either.
* Arguments about morality. My view is not based on the idea that sharing nudes is immoral.
* Rarity. Arguments that abuse of sharing nudes (e.g., revenge porn) are too rare to matter.
* Any form of calling me a prude or ""not with the times"" without plenty of support. By itself, that's circular. You'd need to support the argument.

Edit after one day:

Thanks to all who participated. I have given out a number of deltas to some very thoughtful and helpful posts that didn't really cause me to reverse my view entirely, but that is far too high a bar for a CMV like this. I was fortunate that some offered well-supported arguments that simply helped me reconsider the weights in the risk-reward ratio. Some also added information about the whole nudes thing that I either didn't know or hadn't thought of. 

So, another big thanks to everyone who participated constructively. 

I won't be reading any further responses very carefully -- i.e., I will look at the preview in notifications only enough to see if something looks promising by way of covering new ground. I am still happy to discuss any fresh ideas. 

**But life is full of all kinds of risks that we take every day!**

To potentially save you some time, one argument I can add to *""The kinds of arguments that will certainly not change my view:""* Basically, any form of ""other risks are worth taking, so this risk is worth taking too.""

I do agree that some risks are worth taking. But *each risk needs to be assessed individually*. 

And there are also risks that I would not take, such as skydiving, that I would not claim are a bad idea for everyone. Each person gets to decide, and in my original CMV, I left room for those who are certain they could never care, etc.

But *risks differ from each other also in the fact that risk is not static nor immediate*. Neither can one know all the factors for evaluating all risks. For example, smoking your first cigarette is unlikely to produce any life changing consequences over the first few days, but there's a good chance that you can end up addicted, with cancer or heart disease, and that even if you are okay accepting those risks at 18, you don't know how you'll feel about them at 48 or what kinds of things you might find out about your health history that change the risk equation. Anyway, that is why I can tell you that smoking cigarettes is a bad idea for most people, but I won't tell you that skydiving is a bad idea for most people, even though I would not jump out of a perfectly good plane. I don't think you can make a fully informed choice about smoking that first cigarette to the extent you can make a fully informed choice about jumping out of an airplane.

So, here's the difference between something like skydiving and sharing nudes. You know after about five minutes of jumping out the plane whether there will be consequences. Your choice to take the risk today is not going to come back to bite you 20 years from now. With sharing nudes, there is virtually no short-term risk. The risk of regret is complicated by the fact that, *especially for younger people, circumstances, priorities, opportunities, and values will change over time.* But with someone else controlling pics of you, your capacity to mitigate risks pretty much vanishes in the short term and there's not much you can do, over time, to keep those pics out of the wrong hands. At least with cigarettes, you can stop anytime you want if you can overcome the nicotine addiction. I discuss this in a little more depth in some of my responses to delta posts."
