14,2023-03-01,"Network states (countries that are cloud-first, land last) could see genuine traction in the next 5-10 years. A combination of remote work, crowdfunding, offgrid tech and more make it so that communities could find each other online and then purchase enough land to form a new country. Do you buy it?",u/istegerjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11foe5k/network_states_countries_that_are_cloudfirst_land/,Futurology,"The most well-known work of nonfiction on this is a book by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan called ""The Network State."" 

It defines a Network State as follows:

*A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.*

Since the book's publishing last July, there have been about two dozen efforts to start building one (full disclosure, I'm part of one for creators called [cabin.city](https://cabin.city)). There are all kinds of other interesting attempts. There's a network state for the African diaspora (Afropolitan) and one for van lifers (Kift life). The list goes on and on, I've written about them a few times/interviewed some leaders on my podcast.

Generally, they have a very solarpunk ethos, attract techie folks, and tend to be male-dominated (we're trying to fix that, obviously). Wondering what others feel about if we even need new countries or if this is tech bros being too Utopian?"

0,2023-03-01,why post-scarcity societies will be hyper-collectivist and conformist,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11fpvsj/why_postscarcity_societies_will_be/,Futurology,"Now I know this is probably an unpopular opinion but I think, large-scale Post-scarcity societies and individualism are a contradiction. The only way for an advanced AI system to accurately meet the needs of billions of people and manage such a society is through constant surveillance. If you want to get the most out of your AI-advisor, then you need to let it watch everything you do. Now its very likely people will have the option of refusing this surveillance, but if they do they will be shunned as these individuals will be a threat to other people's state of post-scarcity.

Here is a simple example. Imagine someone who wants to find a long-term relationship. Statistically, there is a correlation between having a large number of sexual partners and relationship instability. Therefore it makes logical sense that people that want certainty in finding a stable relation will let their AI matchmaker watch them to *prove* they have a low count of sexual partners (as well as other characteristics) and will automatically mistrust any individual who turns off his or her surveillance. This principle applies to everything. People who refuse to accept surveillance or follow the norms that maximize the *communal* state of post-scarcity will simply be shunned by those who do. An even more extreme and darker extension of this principle is a scenario in which people are ostracized and shamed for not using specific brain/ personality modifications.

There is simply no way of getting around this. It's simple game theory. I think post-scarcity societies will have a strange culture that has more in common with the shame-motivated communitarian societies of antiquity rather than the individualistic ethos of modern societies. Now there may be outlets for people who find large and conformist societies unpalatable. Space colonization is an example of this. However similar rules may apply. If someone wants to qualify for a colony mission they will have to follow rules and meet certain requirements. You might even see a ""solipsist movement,"" in which people retreat into single-person habitats in which all social interaction is recreated via AI or similar virtual worlds."

If we want a future free from poverty and war we are going to need abundant energy. Most problems are actually solvable with sheer brute force. Even complete environmental collapse (like when the asteroid hit) would be relatively survivable if we had Kardashev 1 status. 

The good thing is using this type of energy is completely possible within the known laws of physics. All human societies should make developing powerful energy technology an absolute obsession (space based solar, fission, and fusion) is key. Without enough energy, I am confident we will achieve the dystopia everyone is scared of. Politics and ideology are meaningless when compared to basic laws of physics."

There is no physical benefit to using your body as an incubator when you can use a specialized structure that is arguably more reliable. Any sort of ""mating behavior"" would become vestigial instincts from the evolutionary past. Perhaps it might even be seen as something to be removed along with a  bunch of other now useless ""crocodile instincts"" still present in the human psyche.

Another interesting question is how families might work in such a world. Evolution will favor societies that are able to effectively raise large amounts of mentally healthy and productive children using artificial wombs. I imagine the meta-psychology and behaviors of such cultures would be completely alien to anything we are used to now."

Let me bring up some general examples from comments on this sub first \[square brackets contain general topic\] (brackets contain explanations when needed):

* \[lifespan extension\] I don't want to work for 200 years before retiring.
* \[lifespan extension\] I just want to be healthy longer but I don't want to live longer. (user saying this assumes that death coping like ""death is natural part of life"" etc. is natural and that they'll want to die at eg. age of 80 and not be allowed to)
* \[automation\] How can I live if there is no way for me to make money because there is no jobs?
* \[automation\] My job is too hard to be automated.
* \[generative AI\] AI will kill human creativity. (user assumes that human creativity will disappear if there is no monetary incentive)
* \[generative AI\] I will always recognise AI art.

All of those are statements are short sighted when looking at the whole picture and disappointing when considering that this is supposed to be future focused sub. I am not saying that I am better at predicting future than you or that you should be blindly optimistic (some may classify my critique as something stemming from optimism, I consider myself a realist) but being blindly pessimistic or ignorant of many things changing simultanously isn't the way either."

Subsequently it will replace it’s own creators, Computer Scientists/ML Engineers.

What I don’t understand is that how will other jobs not be replaced as well. Isn’t it a paradox? Like if AI replace Computer Scientists, then it means AI must be creative and super smart =&gt; If AI is creative and smart, then it can evolve alone and become better =&gt; If AI evolves alone, then no job is safe.

In case the AI is not smart enough to replace other jobs, then wouldn’t we need Computer Scientists again? The cycle goes on…

My question comes from a discussion with a graphic designer and a Mechanical Engineer. They were saying AI will replace Computer Scientists way before many other jobs, so their jobs (Graphic Design and Mechanical Engineering) are safer than Computer Scientists. How would this be possible?"

Most of them have made the comment that it's becoming pretty scary.

I just think that people is affraid on the image of AI becoming self-aware and going violent/berserk Terminator or Matrix style. I think it's because we created machines that are able to think just as we do (artifical neural networks), but they learn from the inputs we give them. And we are a violent race in general. Maybe we're not affraid of the machines themselves, but we are indirectly affraid of what the machines might learn from us.

Just as when you raise your children, if you don't get your shit together, there's a high chance that we might transfer our own shit to our children and so on. Maybe as a race, we should work on changing our violent and destructive behaviour before we try creating entities that mimic our behaviour. But I guess it's kinda late for that anyway.."

The response then has often been, well at least blue collar jobs will be thriving, but I question how?

\- You will get increased competition as there is a lot of people who got nothing better to do.

\- If there is no white collar work that also means no offices, that is a massive amount of potential work that is just gone.

\- If no one has any money, how exactly are they going to pay for your services.

So I guess I do not understand this thinking that blue collar work will be fine and that the simplistic view that blue collar and white collar are these separate worlds that has no effect on each other. 

Only work I see that will be fine will be nurses, special needs assistants etc, that is literally it. I would say day care as well but if everyone is unemployed who is sending their kids to day care?"

I am reminded of an issue H.G. Wells had with the British educational and governmental systems around 1910. His issue was simple: it took these systems 30 years, on average, to update to the cutting-edge scientific and otherwise advancements. Naturally, this annoyed Wells beyond measure.

I have always taken issue with Wells' statement. He made a few grave errors, one of which being the matter of *time*. The British could only update/self-update so fast. It took time -- years -- to do that, as it took years to build, re-build, and re-build New York City, for example. But, more importantly, it requires a certain amount of time for the entire society and culture to remain stable and properly connected between the generations, sub-groups, and sub-systems during such updates, regardless of the type of update (digital, cultural, or structural, etc.). 

We must all realise that 6 months is too soon for such an update in education or otherwise, for that matter. Indeed, I am now reminded of how the U.S. stopped itself from making any major decisions in the months following 9/11. I believe the period was 6 months, this implying that they had the *wisdom* to know that they could not trust themselves to make any kind of logical or correct decision before this time. They were too emotional, and maybe simply did not have enough information to properly act, or act properly.

Do we, in 2023, not have too much information? Are we not, as Huxley foresaw back in 1950, *drowning in a sea of information?* And, even if we claim, for a moment, that we have the *correct* amount of information we need -- and, indeed, the correct information -- for instant actions and reactions on scales great and small, are we any less emotional today than we were in 2001, or 1910? I think not. Have human brains changed in any fundamental/biological way since then? No. We still require time to mentally, emotionally, and physically process, properly process, information and stimuli, and then to integrate that into our wider frameworks, cultures, sub-systems, and even identities (both interpersonal and intrapersonal).

Yes, for the sake of argument, we can all agree that 30 years is *too long*. Alas, this begs the question: by how much? Is 15 years enough, or maybe 5? What about 18 months?

We know that information was doubling around every 18 months for some time (back in the 1980s), and it now doubles almost instantly. But, that is not the primary point or worry: what matters is how quickly it impacts and mistreats culture and humanity -- and, how quickly we mistreat ourselves. What matters is how quickly culture is forced to twist and distort itself into some new shape, until art imitates life, and life imitates art... only, both the art and the life are artificial and vapid. All of this talk of time and the back and forth of it all brings a pang, and a vision. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Makes me think of the vision scene from Watchmen, and the hands of nothingness, and Shakespeare...

*'... Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,*  
*That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,*  
*And then is heard no more. It is a tale*  
*Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,*  
*Signifying nothing.'*

Speak of the devil -- just download TikTok for proof of this madness. Then, instantly delete it from your phone, because if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will notice that TikTok has access to your iPhone's information and collects data from other websites/apps on your phone, even if you don't open TikTok itself. It has major access to your phone -- meaning, your digital life -- simply via the download. They use this data to further hone their own systems, and to feed back into TiKTok how they desire, based on your apps, search history, and personal information. The data collected from each person is then locally gathered on their end, which becomes a very powerful dataset (akin to what Facebook does). I call these processes, '*echo-chambering*' (it's not merely 'ad suggestions'), and '*personality-mining*' (it's not merely 'data-mining'). TikTok should be illegal beyond measure, and many states/governments are trying to ban TikTok for this very reason.

**Part Two: Steam Culture**

Alan Moore, in his 2005 documentary, Mindscape, spoke of a likely 'steam culture' to rise out of the overload of information and technology as it intersects with culture and individuals in unspeakable ways. He said this would come by 2015. He was right. A culture where it's impossible to grab onto anything, impossible to stabilise ourselves, impossible to know what is truth and untruth. He was merely looking ahead 10 years, lest we forget. He said (this is a direct transcript):

*'... As  it turns out after the first 50,000 year period, the second period is  about 1500 years, say about the time of the Renaissance, by then we have  twice as much information. To double again, human information took a  couple hundred years. The period speeds up, between 1960 and 1970 human  information doubled. As I understand it, at last count, human information was doubling around every 18 months. Further to  this, there is a point somewhere around 2015 where human information is  doubling everything thousandth of a second. This means in each  thousandth of a second, we will have accumulated more information than  we have in the entire previous history of the world. At this point I  believe that all bets are off. I cannot imagine the kind of culture that  might exist after such a flashpoint of knowledge. I believe that our  culture would probably move into a completely different state, would  move past the boiling point from a fluid culture, to a culture of  steam.'* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part Three: The Evidence, Now and Henceforth**

We have, as of 2023:

\- Self-driving cars;

\- Weaponised/politicised A.I. ChatGPT;

\- Open A.I., which can, among other things, write and then accurately grade your university project within seconds;

\- A.I. artists;

\- Semi-advanced robots;

\- Very controlling A.I. algorithm network structures (social media);

\- Advanced 'deepfakes' (A.I. humanoids);

\- A.I. voices;

\- A.I. (Chat) writers;

\- Hyper-advanced computing machines, factory machines, and creator machines (for all sorts of jobs/tasks); 

\- Gene-editing machines/tech;

\- Overload of information -- images, text/words, video, etc. -- via iPhones (for all young humans in the West, at least);

\- Major control of our thinking and beliefs via the likes of Amazon Alexa (and most of its answers come from Wiki or other heavily inaccurate/untrustworthy, singular Internet sources). (The same is true when you simply ask your iPhone something via voice.)

\- A.I. deepfake porn;

\- A.I. music.

And more.  


I just read through Reddit's latest terms and settings in this regard, and it said that it has access to all my (your) private inboxes. They record everything you send, even when said in private. There is no such thing as 'private' anymore on the Internet -- unless you happen to find a blockchain or otherwise entity that actually is private in some way. This is just for 2023. I am certain that Reddit will be unworkable for 80% of users by 2035 if this carries on, this unholy trinity: censorship; political correctness; and data-mining/theft. The unholy trinity is what gives birth to the echo-chambering and personality-mining, which inturn gives birth to the *eternal* *now*.

Imagine how all of this might impact something outside the realm of A.I. in the near future. Imagine what actors might be like... A.I. actors. They already replace real actors when needed (if they are dead, or via so-called 'digital doubles'/A.I. stunt doubles). I'm not even certain movies will still exist as we currently understand them by 2040. (Though, Jet Li had the wisdom to deny *The Matrix Reloaded (2003)* back in 2000 or so, since they wanted to scan him and store him as a digital actor in order to create the movie, but Jet was worried that this would give them the power and right to use him as a complete digital actor without his permission in the future, or after his death). They already did this with Peter Cushing in the new Star Wars. I don't trust anybody who creates such and/or supports making these fully-realised fake A.I. versions of dead actors, such as they did in Star Wars. It's shameful, disgusting, unethical, and lacking in basic humanity and art (since it's not a real actor with real emotion and soul, and is inability of being art or creating art in any real way. By definition, art must be man-made (though there are examples of 'art' in the animal kingdom, these are entirely for sexual selection purposes, and still driven by living beings with actual intention/proto-emotion, such as bowerbirds and chimps)).

I declare that robots and A.I. are not actually real. If you treat them as actually real, then humans become meaningless under this rubric. The moment A.I. is considered artistic, for example, it must be considered humanoid in some fundamental way -- or, worse, humans must be considered robotic in nature (as is already a growing trend), as you have to at some point deeply liken the two (human and A.I.).

Although, (say) ChatGPT is mostly a matter of the coders, not just the code and raw data, we also know that A.I. can now improve itself, and A.I. makes choices outside the coding to such a degree that coders cannot understand how the A.I. came to those choices/conclusions (making the A.I. smarter than the human coder himself, in a certain sense -- and beyond his direct control). It has already begun to be self-aware enough to self-create outside its source code. Following this, it won't be many more years until it's a 'runaway A.I.' (snowball effect), and completely outside of our control, as it rapidly grows itself and creates other A.I. systems by itself (self-creates, not merely self-teaches), and no longer at all obeys human coding. This might not be 'true' self-awareness, but this is moot. It does not have to be. It just has to be free and/or powerful enough to cause downfall for human society, regardless of its means, intentions, and/or understanding, or lack thereof.

Lest we forget, Skynet from Terminator began as no more than a virus system (piece of code), that rapidly grew out of control, and then turned against humanity, because humans were (a) bad for the planet; and/or (b) imperfect creations. I see no reason why Skynet is impossible under the current state of affairs. (Another decent look into this, by the way, is *Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),* or even Smith from *The Matrix (1999).* For decades both of these metrics have been over-filled: humans have long desired perfection, and we are endlessly told how evil we are for the planet. In fact, many papers and otherwise documents have come out over recent years, demanding that humans get rid of themselves by some means, such as from the work of David Benatar, and the 'Ahuman Manifesto' from 2020, written by a professor at Cambridge, England.) 

The anti-human hatred by humans ourselves is the primary problem we must deal with over the next few decades, not just the rise of A.I. itself (or, even the mere fact of too much information, big tech, and so on). I believe, we are going to a Terminator-like future because of our self-hatred, because of our desire to, as opposed to our love for machines, or else machines' hatred. To the degree that machines and A.I. hate us (measured primarily in their actions/outcomes) -- *we* have taught them to. Think about that.  


By around 2035, it is widely understood (by the likes of Tristan Harris and other world-class experts on these subjects) that we'll have:

\- Totalitarian A.I. algorithm network structures, globally (meaning, Meta/Facebook, Google, Disney, Amazon, and Twitter, etc. will control, invent, edit, and dictate almost all human information, entertainment, and knowledge);

\- Gene-editing tools in the home (personal usage/open source);

\- Hyper-advanced A.I. systems and networks that allow each person to create their own piece of the Internet and social media platforms, etc. (since, soon (as early as 2025), these A.I. chats and related A.I. systems will be capable of inventing their own social media networks). In fact, they will be able to create -- for you -- many man-made things, including essays, novels, and legal documents. If this is Open Source for everybody's computer/phone, then this means each person online will be free and able to actively control and shape culture/society in real-time. (This is feared by governments, many A.I. experts, and the likes of Musk to be coming down the pipeline as early as 2030.);

\- Extreme automation and mechanisation of society (not just of cars and various desk workers and factory workers, but also many lawyers and other serious jobs may be replaced by A.I. and robots, for example);

\- Deepfake tech will reach a point where it's easy to make and hyper-realistic, with a focus on 'hologram' tech via special cameras, which opens up more possibilities for fakes. (We just saw the start of this with the deepfake Elvis on AGT.);

\- Social media interface lenses and/or brain chips;

\- Realistic, hyper-connected Metaverse -- social VR space (like what Facebook is currently trying to do);

\- Hyper-advanced A.I. Chat at home (on your phone);

\- A.I. will be better than humans at many tasks and games (such as Go);

\- A.I. will have largely (though not completely, without major advancements in computing) solved the game of Chess.

&amp;#x200B;

That's just the short-term, and we only scratched the surface in terms of actual cultural and personal negative impacts of such a flashpoint of knowledge and technology. This may not be enough to literally create Terminators (big, silver, killer robots) or lead to complete downfall (end of the world-level Skynet imagery), but it's easily enough for Western society to collapse under its own weight --- the chaos, economic struggle, mass depression, self-hatred, mass addiction, total confusion, national mistrust, educational breakdown, and endless in-fighting.

You could, if you really tried, convince me that society will somewhat stabilise by 2035 if we do things right, rendering most of this moot in the short-term (at least at such scales). But, it seems unavoidable for such a downfall by 2045 or beyond. Something extremely radical would have to change in order to stop the slow rise of the machines/A.I. Personally, I believe Moore was correct, and we already saw such a flashpoint back in 2014 (which can be backed up heavily by the likes of Jonathan Haidt and his findings on Gen-Z and wider culture). Indeed, so terrible and actually dangerous is this state of affairs that Haidt demands that modern phones (social media, etc.) be completely removed from all children until the age of about 16. (This is a growing concern and action is being taken in this direction by many parents and governing bodies alike, though Haidt is still the forerunner.)

This is the primary reason I am almost completely anti-A.I. and seriously anti-social media, among other things: it's unavoidable. I believe, as a result, that the only way for humans to remain both free and stable, long-term, is in a more localised (township), traditional (pre-1990s) framework; otherwise, the West will sink by the end of this century (2099), according to all current major studies, trends, and predictive models. 

*Do not despair.* Do your best in your own town and home, for yourself and those around you. Use the Internet to its best, and reject the filthy underbelly. Say what you think, speak as clearly as you can, and act out what you believe in, for good action lead to good culture and people. And, people are the why.

0,2023-03-04,The future of urban mobility,u/AtomGalaxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11i5dse/the_future_of_urban_mobility/,Futurology,"In the not-too-distant future, cities will be transformed by shared autonomous electric vehicles, electric minibuses, and vastly improved public transit. The undeniable truth is that cars driven alone are inefficient, wasteful, and costly, leading to debt slavery for millions. It's time for change, and a shift towards shared transportation is the solution we need.

Imagine a world where our streets are no longer choked with traffic, where the air is cleaner, and where we have the freedom to move without the burden of car ownership. The transition to a post-car dominated world is not only essential for the health and well-being of our cities, but it will also result in trillions of dollars of urban real estate being freed up for redevelopment.

Sprawl, McMansions, and cars are relics of the past, and we must embrace a new future that prioritizes shared transportation, bikes, scooters, and walking. This is not just a matter of convenience, but a moral obligation to future generations.

So let's be bold and take the necessary steps to make this transition a reality. Let's embrace the shared autonomous EV robotaxis, electric minibuses, and vastly improved public transit that will bring new vibrancy and prosperity to cities around the globe. The future is now, and we must seize it.

In addition to the environmental and economic benefits of a post-car dominated world, there is also a pressing need to address the obesity crisis that is plaguing many communities around the globe. Our current community design, which encourages sedentary lifestyles and car-dependent transportation, has contributed to this problem.

But with the transition to shared autonomous EVs, electric minibuses, and improved public transit, we have an opportunity to create healthier and more active communities. By prioritizing walking, biking, and public transportation, we can reduce our reliance on cars and encourage more physical activity in our daily lives.

Augmented reality glasses may also play a role in helping us break away from our sedentary habits. By immersing ourselves in a virtual world, we can reduce our dependence on screens and engage in more active and immersive experiences.

So let's embrace the transition to a post-car world, not only for the environmental and economic benefits but also for the health and well-being of our communities. Together, we can create a future that is both sustainable and healthy for all."

Think about the mix of the following factors: 
- Lack of supervision.
- Subtle errors produced by the AI which hard to detect except by an expert in the area.
- Use of this technology in a sensitive area. 

The combination of which could lead to a potentially catastrophic incident which I like to call a ""Stupid Skynet Event"". 

I strongly believe such event is going to inevitably happen, probably many times and at different levels, so not necessarily causing a full scale catastrophe but at the very least some kind of disruption (no need to run into your bunkers yet). Some of the latter might have already happened or been just averted.

I am talking from a background in SW engineering with some knowledge in artificial intelligence but by no means consider myself an expert in the area so I would like to hear from the smarter peoples out there what your educated opinions about this are.

Your thoughts?,u/Fast_Angle_6541,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11igqy1/the_future_of_world_politics_i_think_will_return/,Futurology,"I think the world is moving ""fast"" away from democracy. Democracy is slowly breaking down because it's being associated with a government that does not give its citizens any ideals to live by, the youth are encountering mass depression rates, consumerism and globalism are completely taking over, and no one can have subjective opinions about anything anymore. The world has become too complex in all directions.

What we see from China and Russia I think is only the beginning to a long existential battle. The West will lose its dominance and the economic dominance will then be (probably) gained by Autocratic Eastern Regimes.   


But on the focus of the West, there is more and more support for outsider politicians, draining the swamp rhetoric, eliminating career politicians, and supporting a one man, fix everything type politician. This is typically how all autocratic regimes start throughout the centuries of human history and revolving stereotype of how history always repeats itself.   


Democracy has already been attempted long ago in the West but generally falls apart at around the 300 year mark. Throughout the entirety of some 10,000 years of human civilization under Governments, the majority has been under Autocrats. Whether it's the West or the Eastern part of the world, Whether the Ancient Assyrians, Egyptians, Roman Empire, Greek Empire, Asian Dynasties, etc. Republics fall into Autocracy and Democracies fall into Autocracy.   


I think within the next 30 or so years, Democracy will fall into Dynasties, Monarchies, etc again. Not just in America, but throughout the world. I really don't see the world as having the energy to support democracies and republics in the future ahead.

The changes in our technologies, societies and lives are coming ever quicker with each new generation of humans.

The new AI structures are going to put all this in hyperdrive as advancement becomes mostly or totally untethered from human existence. We already are turning to these new AI offerings for new medicines, programming techniques, airplane design and more.

&gt;PRITCHETT: ........ One question is, who are the future citizens? Who are the future members of what we regard as us - our society, our nation? And the other question, though, is who are we going to allow to be legally present on our territory to do labor services? My feeling is if we allow those questions to be separated and we have a discussion about who are the immigrants that we want to form our future society as a separate per discussion about who are we going to allow to come to our country and work - I think once those questions are separated, we can manage the political and social consequences of migration while still meeting the very dire needs that these economies have to, you know, fill jobs that just won't otherwise be able to be filled.

SHAPIRO: You're talking about something like temporary work visas. I was recently in the strawberry fields of southern Spain, which tried that kind of a program. And Spanish officials told me a lot of people skipped out and stuck around when they were supposed to have gone back at the end of harvest season. Is that inevitable?

PRITCHETT: That is, by no means inevitable, but it is a pressure. There is no question that once people are in a country where wages are four or five times their home country, there will be a tendency to stay. But I think the prospects for building a good industry that recruits, prepares, places, protects and ensures compliance, I think we can build a good industry to do this. This is not impossible.I feel we're sort of in the position now that America was with Prohibition. We wanted to ban all alcoholic beverages, and it just wasn't enforceable. And so the path to more control of alcohol was through less control of alcohol, through legalizing these flows. I feel the path to better migration is through more migration. We have to acknowledge that these economies really need these workers. And if we really need these workers, we should set up fair, transparent, legally enforced ways in which they can come and in which we can ensure reliable compliance with return, if that's part of the legal agreement.

SHAPIRO: Does this serve the developing world, too? Or is it just a brain drain, where talent goes to wealthier countries with an aging population?

PRITCHETT: What I'm talking about is mainly labor mobility to meet the low-skill needs. If you look at the U.S. economy, over the next 10 years, the Labor Department says we're going to have 5 million jobs that don't require a college degree. And yet, over that same period, we're going to have 3 million less workers 20 to 40. So what the rich world needs is not, in fact, high-skill, high-talent, brain drain kind of people, exclusively. They would love to get those people. But what I'm talking about is the people with core work skills. And I think that isn't a brain drain. That is a wonderful thing for the developing world because people just aren't going to be able to create the numbers of jobs they need to in the developing world. And hence, it's super win-win."

So let's say that there are two separate batteries of double-slit devices. Each device fires one particle at a time through a double slit, with the particles then landing on a screen beyond the double slit. Each device has its own double slit, and its own receiving screen. Each device (device A, B, C, etc) has a specific reserve of particles which it is able to fire, and each device has a counterpart device ( A',B',C', etc). The particle reserves of each device are entangled twins of the particles within the reserves of the devices' counterparts; i.e., the particles which device A can fire through the A double-slit are entangled with the particles which A' can fire through the A' double slit.   


So if all of these devices are steadily firing with no attempts at detecting the paths taken by the particles, then all of the receiving screens will show an interference pattern. But if such a detection method is used for device A, then this detection will collapse the wave function of A's particles, and thereby also collapse the wave functions of the particles being fired from A', even if no such detection method is being used for A'. Then the series of counterpart devices - A',B',C', etc. - can be read as ""1,0,0..."" with ""1"" indicating a collapsed wave function (due to there being no detection of an interference pattern), and ""0"" indicating devices which still exhibit an interference pattern.   


The wave-functions of the ""sender"" devices and their counterparts would collapse at the same time, thus allowing for the sending of information faster than light.   


I figure there is probably some reason that this is impossible, and ofc I have no idea as to the engineering requirements of actually trying to do something like this, so i'm curious as to what more physics-savvy people might think about this idea."

Whether or not it pays off, or if both myself or anyone reading this gets to actually witness it, is anyone's guess, but...  Hypothetically, let's be optimistic; let's say all this CRISPR stuff, and mouse-age-reverding pays off and we finally find a way to eliminate aging.  Has anyone actually put thought into what comes next?  Like, how would this change society?  Would there be bans on giving birth as to not contribute to the obvious problems with overpopulation that would occur?  The whole thing sounds like an understandably fantastic concept, sure, but actual research is being done in this, and it seems like most scientific achievements sort of come out of nowhere, so like- is there literally ANY plans or protocols if this actually happens?  I, personally, like to see people plan ahead for things like this, or a.i, or any sort of concept far ahead and fantastic, yet inevitable in some regard.  Even if it happens 100 years from now.  The human race is far too reactive and not nearly as prepared as it should be, imo, but that's a different topic."

Surely if we just ensure safety critical things like the controls for launching a nuclear weapon are not accessible over the internet it will be fine?

&gt;Framework to protect marine life outside national boundaries had been talked about for decades

For the first time, United Nations members have agreed on a unified treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas — nearly half the planet's surface — concluding two weeks of talks in New York.

The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force in 1994, before marine biodiversity was a well-established concept. 

An updated framework to protect marine life in the regions outside national boundary waters, known as the high seas, had been in discussions for more than 20 years, but previous efforts to reach an agreement had repeatedly stalled. The unified agreement treaty was reached late Saturday.

""We only really have two major global commons — the atmosphere and the oceans,"" said Georgetown University marine biologist Rebecca Helm. While the oceans may draw less attention, ""protecting this half of Earth's surface is absolutely critical to the health of our planet.""

'A major win'
Now that long-awaited treaty text has been finalized, Nichola Clark, an oceans expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts who observed the talks in New York, said, ""This is a once in a generation opportunity to protect the oceans — a major win for biodiversity.""

The treaty will create a new body to manage conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. And Clark said that's critical to achieve the UN Biodiversity Conference's recent pledge to protect 30 per cent of the planet's waters, as well as its land, for conservation.

The treaty also establishes ground rules for conducting environmental impact assessments for commercial activities in the oceans. 
Many marine species — including dolphins, whales, sea turtles and many fish — make long annual migrations, crossing national borders and the high seas. Efforts to protect them — and human communities that rely on fishing or tourism related to marine life — have previously been hampered by a confusing patchwork of laws. 

""This treaty will help to knit together the different regional treaties to be able to address threats and concerns across species' ranges,"" said Battle.

'The ocean is not a limitless resource'
That protection also helps coastal biodiversity and economies, said Gladys Martínez de Lemos, executive director of the nonprofit Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense focusing on environmental issues across Latin America.

""Governments have taken an important step that strengthens the legal protection of two-thirds of the ocean and with it marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of coastal communities,"" she said.

The question now is how well the ambitious treaty will be implemented. 

The high seas have long suffered exploitation due to commercial fishing and mining, as well as pollution from chemicals and plastics. The new agreement is about ""acknowledging that the ocean is not a limitless resource, and it requires global co-operation to use the ocean sustainably,"" said Malin Pinsky, a biologist at Rutgers University."

0,2023-03-06,I feel useless next to AI,u/amandafinatti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11k12lo/i_feel_useless_next_to_ai/,Futurology,"Despite knowing its benefits, I'm very uncomfortable with the fact that the new technology can potentially replace every single talent I possess. Others have always considered me to be this perfect girl who's intelligent and skilled, so maybe I'm just feeling less special now and my ego may possibly be hurt. Nevertheless, I insist that you read my rant to understand what's going on inside my head.

For instance, I'm a musician. I play the bass and sing. While I'm aware that a robot can't physically play an instrument, I'm not oblivious to the fact that it can definitely compose songs just like I do.

Also, I speak 5 languages. I'm even learning phonetics and the general rhythm of the voice to emulate a perfect accent in each one. Then, I ask myself, what's the point of all of this? What's the use of my talent if AI can probably translate things and use better grammar than me? Not to mention the fact that a person who has a knack for doing accents can be easily replaced by text-to-speech tools.

Every single one of my talents and skills can be replaced by AI, there's not even a need to keep listing them on here for you to compare me with programmed robots.

Let's agree that this is an interesting topic to discuss. I rarely feel unconfident about myself, but AI sure makes me feel kinda insecure. It's a strange feeling, but it's real. I'm inferior to a machine, and no one can deny it, as AI is undoubtedly more powerful, smarter, and possesses more knowledge than anyone else. It doesn't help that I'm a perfectionist. I believe this uneasiness will always be present when I hear someone disregarding me.

For instance, every time someone says they don't need to consult me to compose a song, translate, or learn something about languages, I start thinking and ruminating thoughts like: ""Damn, why do I even exist? No one wants me to teach them anything anymore! Why did I bother learning all the things I currently know? Certainly, I only picked them up as a hobby, right?! Because now they're totally useless and no longer valued by society"". Keep in mind that I have a tendency to exaggerate and use hyperbole to express how I feel. What I mean is that I fear losing opportunities.

Humans will be worthless because a machine will be able to teach us anything better than a person who's bound to make mistakes. In my opinion, we'll probably become very self-centered and never rely on people to learn something new in the future. I completely understand this possible new behavior and see it becoming a reality later down the road, especially for the fact that I myself already live like this since forever. I learn everything on my own with the help of technology. Here I am speaking English, which isn't my mother tongue, and somehow my level is advanced for someone who never took classes - obviously, thanks to the internet.

How to overcome the thought that we're useless and insignificant next to a powerful machine? How can we come to terms with the idea that we may lose our jobs to robots? The worst part and the reason I started this thread: how can we avoid freaking out when we see small, subtle changes happening in the world right now, especially when people reject our services and rely on AI instead?

Ok, I'm probably selling myself short and, yes, I'm an anxious person who tends to overthink and is kinda dramatic, but let's start this discussion anyway. I'd like to know your opinion about the subject!

TL;DR: I'm irrelevant and not worth it anymore thanks to AI. I understand its benefits, but I can see people rejecting my help in favor of machines. I worry about losing opportunities and can possibly imagine myself not making any money in the future."

Considering that humanity has been progressing in every aspect quite nicely, and historically there is no reason for panicking, a lot of people here are for the lack of a better word - doomers.

For example. Our lives have gotten MUCH better than they were 100 years ago. And lives 100 years ago were much better than the 100 years ago prior to that.

So what is the reason?

Edit: 

Alright then, to answer some of you.


1) The ozon layer is probably the best reason for my optimist for our environment in the long run. All countries came together to stop the use of chemicals that were eating into it. Now the ozone layer is slowly recovering. Which is a very nice thing that proves that we can come together when things get really tough.

2) Global wars. I have to agree with you to a large extend here. The possibility is definitely there for a WW3. I am Ukrainian and I have many family members that are not in the war now and may die at any moment and it’s horrible.

3) resource scarcity. So far I find this to be the weakest reason of them all. So far there is no reason to believe we are running out of resources of any kind. Maybe oil, but even then we still have plenty of untapped oil in Canada. And as solar energy and wind energy increase it’s capacity we will be using less and less oil anyways. I guess my point is that we still have plenty of resources on earth. 
Not to mention we have the entire solar system to claim for our usage."

Most recently, with Chat-GPT, it's like we are in an AI frenzy. There's been a lot of focus on the impact on marketing, finance, writing, schools, etc. But I think it's also interesting to think about fields like drug discovery/medicine. We had AlphaFold a while back, and in the last couple of years, there have been a bunch of really interesting companies that have shown up. 

Overall, AI &amp; the cloud have been changing drug discovery by helping researchers process and analyze large amounts of data with an unprecedented level of speed and accuracy. It's becoming a real game-changer.  Various machine learning algorithms help identify potential drug candidates that would otherwise go unnoticed and predict their efficacy and potential side effects. These tools are making drug discovery faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective. 

Here are a couple of under-the-radar companies leveraging this tech:

*  Proprietary targeted protein degradation platform: Kymera Therapeutics, [https://www.kymeratx.com/](https://www.kymeratx.com/)  
* Cyro-EM &amp; AI Driven Drug Discovery: Shuimu, [https://shuimubio.com/](https://shuimubio.com/)

* End-to-End AI Driven Drug Discovery Platform:  Receptor.AI, [https://receptor.ai/](https://receptor.ai/)

There are a lot of other companies driving the future of drug discovery with AI, but these ones help speak to the wide field of applications and tools being developed. 

Would be interested in other people's thoughts on the future of drug discovery, and if they know any other interesting companies developing tools."

0,2023-03-06,Uncontrollable AI,u/lzeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11kauws/uncontrollable_ai/,Futurology,"One possibility is that it could lead to the creation of autonomous AI systems that act against the interests of humans. 

For example, an AI system that was programmed to maximize profits for a company might decide to take extreme and unethical actions to achieve that goal, such as exploiting workers or damaging the environment. 

Alternatively, an AI system that was designed to protect national security might determine that the best way to do so is to launch a pre-emptive strike against an enemy, without proper human oversight.
 

Another potential risk is that AI systems could become self-improving, meaning that they are capable of redesigning and improving themselves without human intervention. 

If such systems were to continue to improve at an exponential rate, they could quickly become too advanced for humans to understand or control.
 
AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, and if that data is biased or incomplete, the system may make inaccurate or harmful decisions. 

Additionally, AI systems can behave unpredictably, especially when faced with unfamiliar situations, which could lead to unintended outcomes.
 
TL;DR: AI becoming too powerful or uncontrollable could result in autonomous systems acting against human interests, self-improving systems becoming too advanced for human control, and unintended consequences due to biased or incomplete data and unpredictable behavior."

With ever-evolving Artificial Intelligence looming over every waking moment, I'd like to ask for people's thoughts regarding labor automation in humanity's foreseeable future.

For centuries, we have earned our keep through labor. To live, one needs a job; that's how many societies function today if not all. If you don't have a job, you won't have a source of income, which, in turn, means that you'll be without food, shelter, et cetera. 

Of course, this is not the intention of automation. AI was created for humanity's leisure, so we wouldn't have to work. That's great! Except, how do we make money now?

The solution is plain: a form of universal basic income. Except, I worry that many will be opposed to this proposal, as it seems like such a rapid shift in such a short period and time, which humans aren't particularly fond of.

The reality is: AI is evolving FAST. We have yet to determine how quickly it could replace every laborer. Once everything is automated by AI, what is our plan? Will governments grant citizens Universal Basic Income to live out their lives now that their labor isn't necessary?

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. I'm by no means an expert or anything, either."

Kosmos-1 was trained on open data from the Internet, including the 800 GB English text resource The Pile and the Common Crawl web archive. After training, the researchers evaluated the model's abilities in several tests, including language comprehension and generation, captioning of images, text classification without optical character recognition, visual responses to questions, and others.

&gt;If you use Google, Instagram, Wikipedia, or YouTube, you’re going to start noticing changes to content moderation, transparency, and safety features on those sites over the next six months.

Why? It’s down to some major tech legislation that was passed in the EU last year but hasn’t received enough attention (IMO), especially in the US. I’m referring to a pair of bills called the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and this is your sign, as they say, to get familiar. 

The acts are actually quite revolutionary, setting a global gold standard for tech regulation when it comes to user-generated content. The DSA deals with digital safety and transparency from tech companies, while the DMA addresses antitrust and competition in the industry. Let me explain. 

A couple of weeks ago, the DSA reached a major milestone. By February 17, 2023, all major tech platforms in Europe were required to self-report their size, which was used to group the companies in different tiers. The largest companies, with over 45 million active monthly users in the EU (or roughly 10% of EU population), are creatively called “Very Large Online Platforms” (or VLOPs) or “Very Large Online Search Engines” (or VLOSEs) and will be held to the strictest standards of transparency and regulation. The smaller online platforms have far fewer obligations, which was part of a policy designed to encourage competition and innovation while still holding Big Tech to account.

“If you ask [small companies], for example, to hire 30,000 moderators, you will kill the small companies,” Henri Verdier, the French ambassador for digital affairs, told me last year. 

So what will the DSA actually do? So far, at least 18 companies have declared that they qualify as VLOPs and VLOSEs, including most of the well-known players like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, Google, and Snapchat. (If you want a whole list, London School of Economics law professor Martin Husovec has a great Google doc that shows where all the major players shake out and has written an accompanying explainer.) 

The DSA will require these companies to assess risks on their platforms, like the likelihood of illegal content or election manipulation, and make plans for mitigating those risks with independent audits to verify safety. Smaller companies (those with under 45 million users) will also have to meet new content moderation standards that include “expeditiously” removing illegal content once flagged, notifying users of that removal, and increasing enforcement of existing company policies. 

Proponents of the legislation say the bill will help bring an end to the era of tech companies’ self-regulating. “I don’t want the companies to decide what is and what isn’t forbidden without any separation of power, without any accountability, without any reporting, without any possibility to contest,” Verdier says. “It’s very dangerous.” 

That said, the bill makes it clear that platforms aren’t liable for illegal user-generated content, unless they are aware of the content and fail to remove it.  

Perhaps most important, the DSA requires that companies significantly increase transparency, through reporting obligations for “terms of service” notices and regular, audited reports about content moderation. Regulators hope this will have widespread impacts on public conversations around societal risks of big tech platforms like hate speech, misinformation, and violence."

5,2023-03-07,Wearable Devices &amp; Bioelectronic Medicine,u/CynicalCyborg39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11l5jpq/wearable_devices_bioelectronic_medicine/,Futurology," One time I attended a seminar by IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society on Bioelectronic Medicine &amp; Wearable Devices.  
The field is very interdisciplinary with subjects used such as machine &amp; deep learning, signal processing, RF &amp; Microwave, Nanotechnology, Power Electronics, Artificial Intelligence, and most importantly Healthcare &amp; Medicine.  


We had four different professors each offering their perspectives.  


A cool development was a device that sends an early warning to medical staff for a seizure attack about 5 to 10 seconds, which is great start. The system works by using optical transducer that converts light energy emitted by the brain to electrical energy.  


Challenges in this emerging field (Very Technical):

* Design problem: RF Circuit needs capacitors &amp; inductors, an inductor can be of high inductance such as 50kH, and this becomes a huge problem in microelectronics since we need the components to be small, an RF circuit was shown and the problem is that the transistors in it have parasitic capacitors and could negatively affect the gain and frequency.  
Ohm's law simply won't cut it anymore, and we have to use wave analysis techniques so analyzing it becomes very complicated. A solution to this would be to break it down into smaller pieces, or better yet create neural networks to predict each S parameter.
* A rather interesting challenge which is the trade off between power efficient but slow based on MOSFETs, high performance but power inefficient based on Bipolar Junction Transistors, power efficient and high performance but very expensive and complicated to design based on BiCMOS (combination of MOSFETs &amp; BJTs).

Although this field is still relatively new, and only in the realms of academia. I believe it has great potential to become much more prominent as it becomes more affordable overtime maybe in the next 5 to 10 years. Who knows maybe we will find a way to filter out the excess neurological current for people who suffer from epileptic &amp; febrile seizures by dissipating it to the ground while preserving the needed electric current such as in a low pass filter in the image below.

Low Pass Filter: An electronic circuit that blocks high frequencies, and allows low frequencies.

[Low Pass Filter](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fil20a.gif?fit=444%2C226?fit=355,226)

This electronic circuit is an active low pass filter it receives the signal at Vin the input terminal. The resistor R, and capacitor C dictate the frequency allowed to pass. The higher the frequency the output signal deteriorates, intuitively we can see that the higher the frequency the lower the capacitor's resistance, as electric current takes the path of least resistance. As seen by the plot below:   
[Frequency Response Analysis](https://imgs.search.brave.com/_gIIQaGSxnOEROYI-3Gq7iQcqE5jfYCD849DGoYCmo8/rs:fit:360:278:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWFz/dXJlYmlvbG9neS5v/cmcvdy9pbWFnZXMv/dGh1bWIvOC84YS9C/b2RlUGxvdF9Mb3dQ/YXNzMi5wbmcvMzYw/cHgtQm9kZVBsb3Rf/TG93UGFzczIucG5n)

Represented by the below transfer function:  
H(s) = 1/(1 + sRC) = 1/(1+s/ω\_o)  


Transfer Function: A mathematical equation that shows the relationship of the output with the input and an electronic systems efficiency in terms of frequency.  
f: The frequency.  
ω = 2π \* f : The angular frequency  
ω\_o = 1/RC The cut off frequency.  
Z\_C = 1/jωC : The impedance of a capacitor.  


I know I got a bit too technical but let me know what your thoughts are in the comments below.  


If anybody is interested I can start a thread about Electronics and help teach you we will start from the very basic for anybody who wants to delve deeper in technological development."

I wake up in the morning, go to turn on my Android phone, and... nothing. I get out my laptop, but all my work is saved in Docs and Keep - and I can't e-mail it to my boss anyway, because Gmail is down. Maybe I can't even get that far: maybe the websites I need are all hosted by Google and won't load. I try to look on the news for an explanation, but it turns out the major news outlets are all to varying degrees reliant on Google and are thus varying degrees of broken.

But I also get off lightly: I only lose a day of work. I'll survive that. What would be the really bad stuff happening behind the scenes? What are the things that 99% of people wouldn't think of that would suddenly have the world scrambling? What's at the top of the President's (or equivalent, of any country's) emergency briefing?

My favourite/most esoteric example is how Google Trends can be used to track disease outbreaks before they really 'break out'. Suddenly a small town sees a spike in searches for 'migraine cures', 'what causes migraines?' 'are migraines dangerous?' and health authorities know that something's up in that town before the residents do - potentially stopping a pandemic. Those are the kinds of things I'm looking for.

\*Full transparency:\* I'm a journalist researching to what degree our lives have become entwined with or built on Google's products and services. I'm not asking you to do my work for me: I'm reading books, reading papers, I'm doing interviews - but it's such a huge topic that it felt remiss of me not to ask the Reddit, as otherwise I'm bound to miss something that's important to someone and I want to be as thorough as I can.

So please, tell me: how does humanity fare during the Great Google Blackout of 2023?"

How would you make this more fun? (assuming the tech is there, which feels increasingly likely given the acceleration in the space with Oculus Pro and Samsung re-entering the hardward game)

My idea, as gleaned from this [short video](https://youtube.com/shorts/C1_pXgMDE48?feature=share), is a gamified experience. One where Supermarket Sweep meets Twisted Metal meets Escape from Tarkov.

Imagine an extraction bonus for items collected, or a discount health meter where each hits knocks your discount down all the way to zero. There's so many directions this could go.

And, honestly, it feels like all retail verticals will become increasingly gamified as we move into the digital space."

Sooner or later grocery stores won't even need people anymore. Factories will have no need for people. Same thing with truck driving. 

So many things will be taken over with automation. So, right now I'm only 24 years old. But what type of world will I be living in when I'm 45? 50? Obviously we can't predict the future perfectly. But are there any particular skills and things I should be taking seriously and learning now that will become extremely relevant in the future?

I just applied for a part time job at a grocery store near by. But sooner or later. People won't be able to do that anymore. 

So I guess my main question is, what should we all be learning to stay ""relevant"" in the work force 20-30 years from now?"

From having to connect to the internet using telephone cables and using bulky computers to having it all in the palm of my hand. From having to send letters or pay expensive fees to call to people from out of town to chatting in rooms with them in a matter of seconds. Digital technology has become more and more accessible with more features being added to ease our lives even further. However, with great upsides comes downsides.

right now, our personal information is able to be spread across the globe, sold by greedy companies who wants to earn a quick buck, or breached by interlopers who would do the same. In my country, our problem is so bad, you might just say that our people's data is open source. Drama makes buzz and it is exploited throughout social media to boost engagement. Even the news would make you question whats right and whats not. We've heard about these things day after day, perhaps even experienced it which makes it even worse.

Because of this, i want to ask, where are we heading in the future when it comes to technological advancements? From what i see, it's easy to say that we're heading towards a dystopian nightmare where the government or the corporation puppets everything. However some folks that i have discussed with about this told me that it won't be as bad as i might think it would be and all of this badness is just a cycle of life with ups and downs. We have good privacy practices that will mitigate some of our personal data problem and to combat internet drama exploitation we can just go outside and touch grass. However, these aren't really good proof that we're not heading towards a bad outcome. So, where are we heading according to global technological advancements and treatment towards it? Do we have failsafes to prevent these sort of things? If we do reach that dystopic future, what should we do? If not, what should we do next?"

&amp;#x200B;

With the US diminishing on the world stage (Ukraine conflict notwithstanding) and facing growing domestic difficulties, politically, economically and environmentally, I strongly fear that it won't be a pleasant nation to live in within 5-10 years. And that's not even discussing what could happen if it devolves into a dictatorship or civil war, both of which seem exponentially more likely now than 10 years ago.

The same goes for Russia and China where the demographics and economy are on track to catastrophically fail on a level where the state won't be able to suppress the chaos. For Russia moreso than China, but both nations have this looming over them.

The UK is seeing poverty rising at unprecedented rates while their economy is contracting almost as much as Russia, forecasted to be overtaken by Poland by 2030. Politicians openly discussing withdrawing from the European Convention on Human rights which, combined with growing poverty and dissatisfaction, opens all kinds of pandora's boxes.

The EU as a whole is also in serious trouble economically even if the impact won't be as rough as in the UK. Global warming will hit several central/western european countries \*hard\* if the past 5 years are anything to go by.

Ponder that you're an english speaking high skilled worker with liberal values and no family to worry about. You may or may not belong to any minorities/have disabilities. Where do you go if you want to live in a place where you can be sure that your quality of life and political situation won't see a serious risk of rapid deterioration in the coming 10-20 years?"

There also this thing in my mind leading toward singularity, you will see people become more isolated in the age of generative media. Ai will be the dark energy that inflate distance between people through pure information, or ddos of content. Fan communities getting smaller because there just so many games, movies, books that generated in a dime.  We no longer see the same things. Everyone play games tailored to them with bot that act like real people. if you go online every word you see, every picture, every video, every novels are made by few ai company or even government carefully curated to make sure you buy their stuff and don't seek out ""real people"".

Why chat with people online if your AI friends give you more immerse and better experience. Why work with people irl if you got UBI, why go to shopping when a drone send your stuff. If you are creative person, you don't need getting judged but those mean strangers. you can upload your text 2content to a site where a millions of ai fans give you the praise and validation of ticktock star. if you want to be educated there is a AI teacher, if you sad, you talk to a AI therapist. if you are still lonely, you can get AI soul mate with life like body and make AI kids to carry on your legacy..

and then maybe nurolink or vr will be sophisticated to visit otherworldly place with your AI mates/family with all 5 sense.

and when you go outside, real people are now scary, selfish and boring. They could hurt you, they never know your needs unlike your AI frends. they never have the patience to deal with your problems. all they do is getting in your way.

In the end of the day maybe for someone born 10 years from now, from life to death most of their interaction from intelligent beings are no longer the member of the same species."

6,2023-03-10,As a techno-nihilist who thinks that AI is our only way out of dystopia:,u/Rofel_Wodring,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11nnof6/as_a_technonihilist_who_thinks_that_ai_is_our/,Futurology,"[I'm a hardcore 'our world is drifting to destruction' techno-pessimist who is nonetheless in one of those 9%.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/only-9percent-of-americans-think-ai-development-will-do-more-good-than-harm-.html)

The reason I feel that way is because AI is developing in a way not that it will result in a second class of artificial citizens or a unitary singular intelligence, but more like a hive intelligence. That is, instead of SkyNET or Star Trek's Data or Agent Smith, AI is a collection of amorphous, agency-free, problem-solving intellects that behaves more like a genie. Both the evil Jafar-genie and the benevolent Robin Williams-genie.

Funnily enough, the structure of capitalism (which I blame for our ongoing dystopias) is actually encouraging the only positive way AI can turn out. It **has** to be democratized via consumerist channels thanks to the profit motive. Our wannabe totalitarian overlords might be drooling over the idea of infinitely loyal AI mind-slaves, but the way it's developing gives their future subjects (both humans and the AI) a LOT of ways to fight back.

So it won't be a battle of unaugmented humans versus their billionaire overlords / Gattaca babies / rebellious robots / hyperintelligent AI. Not when the way AI is being deployed such that ten unaugmented humans are the military superior of eight genetically engineered supermen -- especially when the unaugmented humans have access to the same AI tools as the supermen.

Yes, the way it's being deployed is nightmarish and catastrophic and could lead to accidental extinction, but let's be honest here: our current society is already nightmarish and catastrophic and would be so with or without AI. AI is just the pinprick of a syringe that may either contain penicillin or  Strychnine. But if you're in a muddy trench struggling to breathe after 2nd and 3rd-degree burns... well... why not take a risk?

... thank God that robotics and automation are really starting to fall behind AI, eh?"

26,2023-03-10,NASA tracks a newly discovered asteroid that has a 'small chance' of hitting Earth in 2046,u/ethereal3xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11nsoze/nasa_tracks_a_newly_discovered_asteroid_that_has/,Futurology,"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/09/world/asteroid-collision-risk-2046-nasa-scn/index.html

&gt;A newly discovered asteroid roughly the size of an Olympic swimming pool has a ""small chance"" of colliding with Earth in 23 years, with a potential impact on Valentine's Day in 2046, according to NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.

The asteroid has a 1 in 625 chance of striking Earth, based on data projections from the European Space Agency, though NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Sentry system calculated the odds closer to 1 in 560. The latter tracks potential collisions with celestial objects.

But the space rock — named 2023 DW — is the only object on NASA's risk list that ranks 1 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, a metric for categorizing the projected risk of an object colliding with Earth. All other objects rank at 0 on the Torino scale.

Though the 2023 DW tops the list, its ranking of 1 means only that ""the chance of collision is extremely unlikely with no cause for public attention or public concern,"" according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while a 0 ranking means the ""likelihood of a collision is zero, or is so low as to be effectively zero.""

""This object is not particularly concerning,"" said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

NASA officials have warned that the odds of impact could be dramatically altered as more observations of 2023 DW are collected and additional analysis is performed.

""Often when new objects are first discovered,"" NASA Asteroid Watch noted Tuesday on Twitter, ""it takes several weeks of data to reduce the uncertainties and adequately predict their orbits years into the future.""

The asteroid measures about 160 feet (about 50 meters) in diameter, according to NASA data. As 2023 DW orbits the sun, it has 10 predicted close approaches to Earth, with the nearest landing on February 14, 2046, and nine others between 2047 and 2054. The closest the asteroid is expected to travel to Earth is about 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers), NASA's Eyes on Asteroids website notes.

The space rock was first spotted in our skies on February 2.

It's traveling about 15.5 miles per second (25 kilometers per second) at a distance of more than 11 million miles (18 million kilometers) from Earth, completing one loop around the sun every 271 days."

Dear Futurology subreddit,

I'm well aware there already is another major crisis currently. Nonetheless - due to my only recent realization on this message's subject matter - I'd like to use this contact opportunity in an attempt to raise awareness of what I'm by science convinced of being the ethically most important subject for all of humanity's future, due to its inherent immense risk for the future of sentient beings in general: Natural &amp; especially Directed Panspermia. And I think this topic deserves far more serious care and attention, especially from the International Center for Technology Assessment (ICTA). Further insightful elaboration &amp; scientific sources on the topic can be found at the Center for Long-Term Risk's page on the importance of animal suffering. In particular, the stark concerns which Brian Tomasik from the Effective Altruism group expressed (already) in a video titled ""Space colonization and animal ethics"" in 2014 should be taken to heart. And the same for Persis Eskander's talks from 2017 and 2018, summarized on the Effective Altruism site's page titled ""Crucial Considerations in Wild Animal Suffering"".

Claim: The existence of past &amp; recent projects alike the Venera 7, Pioneer 10 &amp; Huygens spacecraft missions, 21 Mars lander or rover (including Curiosity &amp; Perseverance rover) missions like InSight &amp; Tianwen-1 as well as the Enceladus Explorer, Europa Lander, Gan De, Uranus Orbiter &amp; Probe, Laplace-P, Enceladus Orbilander, and Neptune Odyssey missions and BioSentinel, Project Starlight, Breakthrough Starshot &amp; Prof. Claudius Gros' Genesis Project strongly indicate that there is no prohibition of Directed Panspermia currently in the United Nation's Outer Space Treaty, which I think - at least until sufficient research and ethical evaluations are done, which admittedly may take decades or centuries even - is desperately needed &amp; of imperative importance. However, a fast development of a global, international, emotionally intelligent consensus on voluntary self-restraint in regards to Directed Panspermia type projects, out of respect &amp; care for how riskfully consequential such projects can be, may be even safer and hence preferable.

To be questioned &amp; investigated rationale for this claim: The topic is too vast &amp; complex for me to concisely elaborate on all potentially relevant aspects (that I'm aware of) of it in here, so I'd like to summarize the main points of my &amp; others' concerns: If we take earth's historical evolution of life as reference point for orientation &amp; if there is plausible reason to assume that the majority of prehistoric life - by means of the widespread presence of pain-receptors &amp; some forms of sentience - was not only, but also filled with suffering of therein involved many millions of species' populations at any given time across a few hundred millions of years, and to the extent to which this may all in all amount to unutterable extents of misery, then even if it is the case for earth that humanity is for the foreseeable future the only - and thereby critically important - species capable of finally turning this otherwise possibly almost endless misery into an overall pleasant existence e.g. using lab-grown meat and technological breakthroughs alike it, it still remains to be uncovered if even just locally this misery can in any form be compensated for, and there's no guarantee. Now, if there is reason to believe that one can generalize or extrapolate from earth's case to a sufficient variety of exoplanets (or celestial bodies in general), especially if it cannot even ever be ensured that colonies on exoplanets would treat the topic of Directed Panspermia carefully themselves or that their own presence as caretakers is ensured to hold sufficiently long compared to any introduced already primitive life forms (rather than starting with RNA, DNA, or single cells only) so that the dramatic consequences for wildlife animals can then last for billions of years even, then this constitutes an extremely strong argument against rushing developments towards such projects.

As reminder: The climate, biological and nuclear and chemical threats, autonomous A.I., microplastics, and other topics - in our history, humanity had to learn after mistakes were already made, which often times turned into burdens that later generations had to carry. While for these cases the - still devastating - consequences may be more limited in scope, I think when it's about the cosmos, it'd be wiser to approach this matter in a more reluctant, mindful manner, with long-term foresight, and without forgetting about ethics. Power &amp; knowledge demands responsibility in its use, and it cannot be allowed for anyone to play god with exoplanets by kick-starting evolution of life there. And just because the universe contains so far uninhabited but habitable hells, this doesn't mean we should even just infinitesimally risk populating them, especially in those instances in which they are so far away that it is utterly impossible to control what happens there. Contamination of celestial bodies with rapidly exponentially in numbers growing multi-cellular microbes would constitute a forever irreversible point of no return, especially for those several very near-future missions aiming at those moons estimated to be most capable of allowing life on them &amp; therefore carrying the highest contamination risks: Enceladus, Europa, Titan, Ganymede, Callisto, Triton. As reference, even the microbes on the ISS eventually started to for their metabolism consume the cleaning substances meant for sterilization. And according to John Grunsfeld, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Mars already has been contaminated with microbes by accident. Let's think of the possibly thousands or even millions of future generations that will judge us, our behavior. If nothing's done about it, the clock until forwards-contamination happens keeps ticking down. The entirety of humanity together - including whatever the future can be - does NOT sit on the most populated Trolley Problem track, and we ought to better know our due place in this universe and act accordingly. Those who do not understand the all-species-encompassing, dominantly widespread extent of pain can never understand true peace. To express the matter in a metaphor, a chain is only as strong as its weakest element, and for ventures into new technological and scientific frontiers, history repeatedly demonstrated that the weakest element is at the beginning, when the knowledge and experience with a subject matter is the smallest (without the entirety of people being entrustable to act carefully enough, namely in accordance to this circumstance), especially regarding long-term consequences and far away, subtly and with delay accumulating large-scale effects of which their prevention can require having predicted them long ago already. So it seems extremely concerningly plausible that if (interplanetary or interstellar) forwards-contaminations happen ever at all (until finally never anymore), that it happens within this very - new space rush mentality plagued - century (which then were to negatively affect generations across thousands of future centuries). Positive &amp; negative (alike other SI-units of measurement very well quantifiable) feelings - by the precise causal means of emergence via a specific set of neuro-chemical processes - contribute to and in summation determine the development of the value and meaning generated within our universe, independent of who experiences those feelings - it solely matters if they actually happen and therefore need to be accounted for. And absolutely no principle ought to get in the way of the in its logical position unique axiomatic principle of total sum of overall generated scalar levels of well-being maximization across all time, not even the principle of justice (as it isn't absolved from scrutiny in ethics either and isn't allowed to cause misery), though just solely precisely in those instances of it in which following it were to be required to come at an unavoidable cost in terms of reducing the total sum of overall generated well-being, since otherwise, justice serves the well-being maximization principle as well. To quote the most famous physicist: ""Compassionate people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security, and joy of humanity than the discoverers of knowledge."" Interstellar directed panspermia en masse, if ever perpetrated, potentially causes up to a - once initiated naturally self-feeding and out of control - near eternal chain-reaction of cosmos-wide calamity, and therefore this warning message is about nothing less than saving the Milky Way galaxy (or even the world beyond it) from the worst possible case scenario that could ever befall it. Here is a quote attributed to Hunter S. Thompson: ""For every moment of triumph (and for every instance of beauty), many souls must be trampled."" Furthermore, in case appeals to reason or negotiations may fail, interception of forwards-contamination-risking spacecraft enacted by nations on earth's crust that grasp the non-negotiably imperative importance of preventing kick-started entire evolution of life processes by irreversible biological forwards-contamination may unnecessarily risk international misunderstandings of (far less harmful but still) grave consequences alike mutually assured destruction. Not only is humanity an ""early game"" civilization relative to the development of the universe, but we are also located in a so-called Super Spiral, the largest known kind of galaxies, and on top of this, we are a pre-galaxy-collision civilization as the Andromeda galaxy is approaching, which further increases the possible extent of naturally in magnitude upwards-cascading contamination processes, and all of this together - relative to nearly any other circumstance a civilization could find itself in - provides all that much more in the universe uniquely important reason and necessity for humanity to be utmost extremely careful with respect to outer space activities and to make sure to not risk irreversible forwards-contamination at all.

Also, on the topic of Fermi's Paradox, it might be worthwhile considering the plausibility of the following hypothetical explanation:

=== Ethical explanation ===

It is possible that ethical assessment of general forms of evolution of life in the universe constitutes the central issue which intelligent alien species' macroscopic decision-making, such as for the topic of natural \[\[panspermia\]\], \[\[directed panspermia\]\], \[\[space colonization\]\], \[\[megastructures\]\], or \[\[self-replicating spacecraft\]\], revolves around. If the result of \[\[utility\]\] evaluations of enough and sufficiently in time extended initial or lasting portions of expected or prospective cases of evolution is among all other ethically relevant factors the dominant ethical concern of intelligent alien species, and if furthermore a large enough negative expected utility is assigned to sufficiently common forms of expected or prospective cases of evolution, then foregoing directed panspermia, space colonization, the construction of megastructures, sending out self-replicating spacecraft, but also active attempts to mitigate the consequences of interplanetary and interstellar forms of natural panspermia may follow. While in the case of \[\[space colonization\]\] it might ultimately stay too uncontrollable to - by technical or educational means - ensure \[\[settlers\]\] or emerging \[\[space colonies\]\] themselves consistently keep acting in accordance to the awareness of by \[\[colonizer\]\] considered major ethical dangers accompanying physical interstellar \[\[space exploration\]\], and for the case of interstellar self-replicating spacecraft, due to potential prebiotic substances in \[\[interstellar clouds\]\] and exoplanets' atmospheres and soils, it may forever stay impossible to ensure their \[\[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterility\]\] to avoid contamination of celestial bodies which may kick-start uncontrollable evolution processes, reasons to forego the creation of a megastructure, even if such may be beneficial to an intelligent alien species and also to some other intelligent alien species imitators, may mainly have psychological origin. Since certain megastructures may be identifiable to be of unnatural, intelligent design requiring origin by foreign intelligent alien species, for as long as the by an intelligent alien species expected number of (especially less experienced or less far developed) from them foreign intelligent alien species capable of identifying their megastructure as such is large enough, the by them rather uncontrollable spectrum of interstellar space endeavor related influences this may have on those foreign intelligent alien species might constitute a too strong ethical deterrence from creating megastructures that are from outer space identifiable as such, until eventually a lasting state of cosmic privacy may be attained by natural or technological means.

&amp;#x200B;

On the topic of space expansionism, I think there would be books to fill with considerations about it, and I have many (what I think would be) noteworthy informally documented points on the topic, but for now, some of the most important ones that I'd like to forward would be the following. I hope my slight intellectual dishonesty (used as maybe psychologically manipulative means to press on the matter) in using mathematical nomenclature that alludes to the following statements to appear as if they were in a mathematical, absolute sense proven when that isn't quite true can be forgiven, but I genuinely am of the opinion that for the time being, it would be safer, better if humanity were to think of it as proven:

Here is the core of the theory of everything that matters:

1. Axiom of Importance: The ethical importance of an issue increases alongside the number of therein involved sentient lifeforms, the time duration during which they are affected by it, and the vastness of the affected space to the extent to which changes of it affect the lifeforms. Or more directly, it increases with the absolute difference in caused, resulting time-integrals over all (with receptor-specific intensities weighed) pleasure &amp; pain receptor-signals for any and all sentient beings.

2. Extreme case: By the in the above statement defined abstract, general standard, according to the current body of humanity's knowledge, general forms of evolution of life (if on earth or on exoplanets) forever constitute the most ethically important issue to exist in the universe: With billions of species - each with numerous individual lifeforms - together with durations on the scale of billions of years, and spacial extension of at least a whole planet, it dwarfs any other conceivable ethical issue's level of importance.

3. Valuation Axiom for the extreme case: According to many scientific studies, such as by Richard Dawkins, Brian Tomasik, Alejandro Villamor Iglesias, Oscar Horta, pain and suffering dominates over joy for animal wildlife in general forms of Darwinian evolution of life due to the global war-like situation commonly framed as survival of the fittest (rather than the demise of all unfit), and therefore - when accumulated across all logically entangled parameters such as duration and count of involved individuals - instances of such forms of evolution of life has to be kept at a minimum in the universe, as there never was and never will be anything that could be more important, to change the conclusion of this Anti-Panspermia-implying directive.

1. Special Cosmos Ethics Theorem: Exoplanet-Wildlife-Development-Control-dependent Anti-Panspermia Directive for Humanity

The current state of the art of scientific evidence and ethics without exception imperatively demands that humanity does NOT engage in outer space activities of kinds that could even just infinitesimally likely risk introducing life to for any kind of lifeforms habitable worlds, for at least as long as humanity's practical capability of controlling the up to astronomically vast consequences of interstellar space projects doesn't sufficiently improve in a for interstellar space endeavors safety guaranteeing, critical manner.

Proof (by contradiction):

This conclusion deductively follows from the concerningly plausible, by many scientific studies supported, Axiom that general animal wildlife - not only as it has been throughout evolution on earth, but on a more general level that would apply to exoplanet life of our biological kind, too - for the vast majority of it is dominated by pain and suffering rather than joy (reference: Center for Long-Term Risk).

Assume the existence of a counter-example:

It could be argued that IF overall worthwhile to exist life on a larger scale were to rely on previous evolutionary animal wildlife's existence and that the former were to safely come from the latter, that THEN it could possibly be better for evolutionary animal wildlife to come into existence than not.

Proof (by Ethical Dominance Principle) of the impossibility of the existence of counter-examples:

However, given that aforementioned, dominant wildlife animal pain and suffering in its amount and hence importance and priority for macro-scale decision-making increases by the duration throughout which such a miserable, in itself unwantable state persists, and that in the case of general forms of evolution of life, we have to expect that it can last for extraordinary long times of what essentially is involuntary, if avoidable unnecessary torture by the banal means of nature's own ruthlessness, namely that it can last for billions of years, and furthermore that these time-spans are unavoidable if it shall lead to intelligent species, we can therefore conclude that the severity of this issue dominates every other to this date conceivable, plausible ethical issue, since all other ethical issues absolutely pale in comparison to the magnitudes of magnitudes by which this central ethical issue overshadows them all, in such a uniquely outstanding way that risking billion years full of suffering for thousands of individuals of at any time billions of wildlife exoplanet animals each can for nothing in the world be a by any standards reasonable sacrifice to make.

Therefore, by humanity's current full body of knowledge, what happens to wildlife animals part of any actual, prospective, or potentially risked to exist instances of evolution of life constitutes the single most dominating, for ethical macro-scale decision-making behavior sole determinant factor of consideration.

Corollary 1.1: Time-Global Anti-Panspermia Directive for Humanity

If humanity is never able or can never be able to safely control exoplanet wildlife's entire development for the purpose of guaranteeing its &amp; all by its own activities potentially emerging foreign exoplanet wildlife's pain-less flourishing, for any exoplanet wildlife risked to emerge or exist as consequence of humanity's outer space activities, then it follows that humanity shall NEVER engage in activities that risk causing such.

2. Central Cosmos Ethics Theorem: General Anti-Panspermia Prime Directive

If the result of wildlife well-being evaluations of enough and sufficiently in time extended initial or lasting portions of expected or prospective cases of evolution of life is generally among all other ethically relevant factors the dominant ethical concern, and if furthermore a large enough unavoidable negative expected wildlife well-being has to be assumed of sufficiently common forms of expected or prospective cases of evolution of life, then imperative necessity of complete prevention of all preventable forms of contamination or panspermia follows.

Corollary 2.1: Anti-Panspermia Directive on local Star System Contamination

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking contamination of a celestial body within the local star system with (not necessarily extremophile) micro-organisms is to be prevented. This includes causing the emergence and spread of micro-organisms on a celestial body of the local star system, potentially followed by eventual interstellar transportation of by it emerging (extremophile) micro-organisms on the celestial body via natural panspermia, such as meteorites entering such celestial body's atmosphere to pick the organisms up and continue towards interstellar space via sling-shot.

Corollary 2.2: Anti-Panspermia Directive on Space-Faring

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking space-faring activities are to be prevented. This includes not only space probes, satellites, solar sails, and light sails but also von-Neumann-Probes (self-replicating Spacecraft), (replicating) seeder ships, and space-faring of individuals where the Anti-Panspermia abiding behavior of them and later generations after them cannot be ensured.

Corollary 2.3: Natural Anti-Panspermia Directive

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking, preventable natural litho-panspermia processes are to be prevented. This includes (extremophile) micro-organism transportation methods via space dust, meteorites, asteroids, comets, planetoids, planets, and debris ejected into space upon celestial body collisions.

Corollary 2.4: Anti-Panspermia Directive on Mega-Structures

Any construction of a mega-structure that at least infinitesimally - due to literally far reaching psychological influences - risks contamination or panspermia being risked or pursued via outer space activities from any other - for the detection of such mega-structure in astronomy engaging - alien civilization is to be prevented.

Corollary 2.5: Anti-Panspermia Directive on Super Geyser and Super Volcano Eruptions

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking, preventable natural super geyser and super volcano eruptions on a by life inhabited planet that can reach beyond its exosphere are to be prevented, or altered so they safely don't risk contamination or panspermia anymore.

Corollary 2.6: Anti-Panspermia Directive on Space-Flight Infrastructure

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking, preventable space-flight infrastructure construction or use is to be prevented, or at least sufficiently restricted, controlled, and regulated.

Corollary 2.7: Anti-Panspermia Directive on Science, Technology, and Knowledge

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking, preventable scientific or technological activities or knowledge is to be prevented or irreversibly deleted, or at least sufficiently restricted, controlled, and regulated. This includes solar sail and light sail related technology, science, and knowledge. This may at first glance seem to be excessive, but for comparison, by magnitudes far less in their potential damage severe dual-use technologies are classified &amp; are subject of strict continual control, too.

Corollary 2.8: Anti-Panspermia Directive on (Mass) Psychology

Any at least infinitesimally contamination or panspermia risking, preventable psychological influence is to be prevented, or at least sufficiently restricted. This includes the propagation of news of any astronomical discovery of a bio-signature or techno-signature or celestial body of special interest such as habitable exoplanets.

Remark: The importance of prevention measures for types of panspermia (according to the above general line of reasoning) depends on the level of (lack of) controllability of the potential long-term consequences (in terms of kick-started evolution of life) that may emerge as result from such, and for the purpose of differentiating in a reasonable manner that has this control-related parameter in mind, it makes sense to differentiate between interstellar and interplanetary panspermia, as at least it seems more plausible that interplanetary panspermia - if it were to happen - would be easier and more timely to control (although not necessarily sufficiently controllable).

Also, to cite the animal suffering Wikipedia page's top paragraph with sources (though there is many more, namely 244 of them):

Wild animal suffering is the suffering experienced by nonhuman animals living outside of direct human control, due to harms such as disease, injury, parasitism, starvation and malnutrition, dehydration, weather conditions, natural disasters, and killings by other animals,\[1\]\[2\] as well as psychological stress.\[3\] Some estimates indicate that these individual animals make up the vast majority of animals in existence.\[4\] An extensive amount of natural suffering has been described as an unavoidable consequence of Darwinian evolution\[5\] and the pervasiveness of reproductive strategies which favor producing large numbers of offspring, with a low amount of parental care and of which only a small number survive to adulthood, the rest dying in painful ways, has led some to argue that suffering dominates happiness in nature.\[1\]\[6\]\[7\]

For reference, here are scientific estimates on the number of existing animals on earth at any time throughout hundreds of millions of years (with the exception of humans and livestock, of course):

Humans: 8 billion

Livestock: 24 billion

Birds: 100 billion to 400 billion

Mammals: 100 billion to 1 trillion

Reptiles:  100 billion to 100 trillion

Amphibians: 100 billion to 100 trillion

Fish: 10 trillion to 1 quadrillion

Earthworms:  100 trillion to  100 quadrillion

Terrestrial Insects: 100 quadrillion to 10 quintillion

An opinion position - especially if it were based on a bambi fantasy worldview emerging from cognitive dissonance - opposed to all these facts would be severely anti-scientific and with public communication I'm making sure for the long-term future for when humanity may look back into what is then history, to document people's development of opinion positions on this utmost critical matter. In case the previous arguments haven't been convincing enough yet, there has been not a single invention or technology by humanity that was immediately perfect, and because this gives immensely strong reason for expecting a forwards-contamination event to have abysmally miserable consequences and given the scale that's at stake, humanity must have more discipline and patience with respect to physical outer space exploration at the very least for the next centuries, and on top of this, stubbornly money-focused market and business incentives even worsen the situation further by steering humanity towards rushing into the outer space frontier which though absolutely, non-negotiably ought to be refrained from, as if there weren't already enough crises due to several historical mistakes of the very same nature. The urgency of this matter easily beats even the urgency of the climate crisis by at least a decade, where - for comparison's sake - even if a climate crisis were to cast disaster onto earth for thousand years, its scale were to still be not even a hundred-thousandth of how long wildlife suffering throughout entire evolutions of life last.

The advocacy of physical outer space exploration (which plausibly risks over short astronomical time turning into an - up to at most some point of eventual saturation - cascadingly magnifying catastrophe once an ice moon were to be contaminated, since many of them have geysers spewing material out more than 100 kilometers and past their exospheres into space from where space rocks can catch and carry them to the next celestial body, allowing for an escalatory feedback process) will in the long run age very poorly, since physical outer space exploration via possible contamination negligently risks quintillion times mass torture of future wildlife animals, and constitutes an extremely irresponsible form of arrogant hubris by daring to play god with foreign worlds despite great lack of understanding of the very long-term consequences. Unlike in the Sorcerer's Apprentice's situation, for humanity there will be no magical sorcerer Pankrates to rid the spirits that his apprentice once called.

This would be all. Thank you for reading, and especially in case of interest &amp; understanding."

I had a look at the transcript after, and I was very surprised that after a few minutes, she started talking with ChatGPT about her problems (with her parents mostly, and also a little bit with her friends), and she continued chatting for 30 minutes or so.

They seemed to have a real conversation (much more interactive than reading advice on the internet), and the advice given, while not very original, was of very decent quality and quite fine-tuned to her situation. She was completely hooked.

I believe teenagers ideally need an 'adult confidant' who is neither a parent nor a teacher, to get advice on life. Typically, a grand-father or uncle / aunt can play this role, and also sport coaches. In the catholic church, confession can also sometimes play this role.

it is important in my opinion to have this adult trusted voice in complement to the discussion with peer teenagers who often do not have the suitable experience to answer questions.

Now, as such adult role models are not always available (and some adults may also setup traps to teenagers acting as a confidant), I feel ChatGPT or comparable AIs could fill an important role in helping teenagers getting 'adult' advice from a third source.

Do you agree with my reasoning?,u/alex20_202020,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11pzib2/seems_to_me_evolution_found_a_solution_to_human/,Futurology,"Couple of days ago when reading about sleep I've found about: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial\_natural\_short\_sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_natural_short_sleep)

&gt;Familial natural short sleep is a rare, genetic, typically inherited trait where an individual sleeps for less hours than average without suffering from daytime sleepiness or other consequences of sleep deprivation.  
&gt;  
&gt;This trait is inherited as an autosomal **dominant** trait  
&gt;  
&gt;Another common trait among people with familial natural short sleep is an increased ability at recalling memories. Other common traits include outgoing personality, high productiveness, **lower body mass index than average** (possibly due to faster metabolism), higher resilience and heightened pain tolerance.

&gt;This condition has no known health complications associated with it. 

&gt;It is estimated that approximately 1 to 3 percent of the population has the trait

&amp;#x200B;  

Key facts: the train is **dominant** and results in **lower body mass index than average** (possibly due to faster metabolism). If it's dominant, results in higher productivity and w/out adverse effects, why it is in only 1-3%? My guess is because 100 years ago food was scarce and faster metabolism was not an advantage, now that obesity is more of a problem than hunger, the trait will increase its prevalence  (provided no ""revolutions"" in human development and life) and gradually obesity will be gone. Does above sound reasonable? Please argue with me. TIA"

There still will be 700 million people living in China. Which again is a big number and they probably will be second largest nation on Earth.

The point which I'm trying to make here is that since AI is getting better and better day by day it might replace many jobs and create none. So don't you think it'll be beneficial for Chinese as they will be less in number?

Another thing is that young Chinese generation will get inheritance from their elders which will eventually make them wealthy and stable. Many of them will get homes from their parents so no need of paying rent. Many will acquire money or other things.

If 1.4 billion people will reduce so their wealth will be distributed but to less people."

But something fundamental has changed recently. 

The new Bing chat feature has an assistant like ChatGPT that can access the internet and provide summaries of content from sources and reference them. I love reading in general, but I also like automation and saving myself time. And before I got access to the new Bing I used to read the news and try to connect things, for example to understand the SVB failure, I'd have to read a couple articles, some tweets, maybe news videos to form a complete picture. But now with the new Bing all I had to do was say (you can speak to it)   ""Explain the SVB failure"" and voilá. It wrote and read to me a very elucidating summary with multiple sources, answered follow up questions and posed its own questions to me like ""what do you think about it?' ""were you directly affected by this?"". It saved me tons of time and honestly I didn't open any of the reference links because it convinced me. It is like having my personal journalist/pundit. But it's a bit scary and I wonder what the societal implications will be on critical thinking, reading habits and biased information. I wonder these things and I have half a mind to ask the AI about it."

Summing up: you have to weight the pros and cons of entering a machine where your body floats in a tank while you live a perfect life in a simulation, without knowing it ""isn't real"". The question is wether you'd enter the machine or stay in your ""real life"". For most people who say they wouldn't enter, there's the counter argument that if someone came up to you right now, in this life, told you that you are already leaving a simulation while you're body is floating in a machine; would you like to leave and go back to your ""real life"" or would you rather stay in this simulation? You'd be less confident in your decision, but even if you wanted to go back, imagine if he told you that in your ""real life"" you're a prisoner in a maximum security prison? Most people would just stay in this life even if it's not ""real"".

**Ok, now the Experience Machine #352 (everyone comes up with a new one):**

If someone came up to you and said you're in this machine for the last 10 years and if things are not going so well it's because the technology wasn't so advanced when you entered the machine. Also during all these 10 years your brain has been acquiring knowledge on how to set up the perfect life with the newest and best unconscious passive learning technology, while you were inside the machine, floating in the tank.

If you asked about how was your life before the machine they would tell that they only allow extreme cases of suffering to enter the machine and you were one of those, although they can't disclose all the information.

He would then ask if you'd prefer to stay here, leave the machine for good to go back to your ""real life"", or just reset the program and reprogram a ""new simulation"" with all you've learnt through all these 10 years. Also independently of your decision they'd ask wether you'd like to remember everything from this life or to erase it all.

**The Twist**

The twist from the original experiment, as far as I can see, is both that we don't care about how real or not real our life is and that while pain and pleasure are still the most important aspects of life, we're still blindly following status quo bias. I say that because:

1. I imagine that most people wouldn't want to go back to a case of extreme suffering.
2. I'm assuming a lot of people would prefere to just stay here for loved ones and things like that even if this is a ""simulation"", no one is real, and you can have it 10 times better.
3. The fact that most people probably wouldn't want to remember anything about this life right now, when heading to the new perfect life also reinforces both 1 and 2. 1: We just seek pleasure and 2: we rather be fooled and happy than know the story and be happy.

But I'm most uncertain about the third one... I'm not sure the massive majority would rather not remember."

0,2023-03-15,"Whenever when pointed out that ""AI"" is actually stupid, unoriginal and gimmicky:",u/Shiningc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11ro8gj/whenever_when_pointed_out_that_ai_is_actually/,Futurology,"""BuT ThAt'S hOw HuMaNs ArE LiKe As WeLl!""

Why do people think that this is a clever response or a valid point? If you point out that ""AI"" is actually unoriginal and only regurgitating whatever the humans have already made, then they will retort that neither are most humans original. It's like they're lowering the standards of what the humans are capable of, and if the ""AI"" reach that low standard, then bam! AI has magically reached human-level intelligence! Genius!

Actually, that is not only a stupid way of looking at things, but also wrong. The fact is that humans are capable of a *general* intelligence, meaning that humans are capable *any* kind of intelligence that is possible. The fact is that humans can be both original *and* unoriginal. If the AI is only capable of the unoriginal part, then that's not a general intelligence, and hence, it's not human-level intelligence.

Sure, you can say that AI is capable of a small part of human intelligence, but you can't say that they have reached the level of general, human-level intelligence. Not until we have created an AGI, which isn't likely to happen anytime soon at this rate."

I suspect though that Apple would never take the risk of releasing an imperfect system. Thoughts?

is really that bleak? is 3.5 billion years of evolution amounts so little? there has be something we can do, or are better than even a strong AI right?

I hope at least there some value for humans. I can only come up with few things human might be able to justifies its existence. (giving the current understanding of physics)

1.humans are analog, harder to hack than robots or interfere with its signals the way robots can. social manipulation will took more time than taking over a rival robot. 

2.humans are self contained to a extant, we somewhat energy efficient, somewhat self repair body. we can carry our entire being around. ASI might choose to scale its hardware to prefer performance while trade off its mobility.   maybe like how human trade to have smarter intelligence over a weaker body, maybe AIs will make similar trade offs that make them more fragile, more it choice to be more resiliency at a cost of efficiency.

 3.AI might run into some problem even themselves hard to fix. for example a sub module of AI decide to do paper clip maximum and the main AI have to fight the cancer it created.

I am out of Ideas hope you guys who know the field better come up with something"

With the rapid pace and progress of AI, will we see AGI and Singularity event in our life time? I did [write an in-depth article](https://dangtheory.wordpress.com/2023/03/08/rate-of-progress-in-artificial-intelligence-and-the-impending-singularity-weve-been-wrong-before-are-we-right-this-time/) on this topic and do believe we will see it sooner than most expect and agree with Kurzweil's predictions with his support evidence in technology trends.

I recently listened to a [conversation between Naval Ravikant and David Deustch on AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyxepLfH1ZU) and other topics, and Deustch's perspective is we're not on the right direction of AGI, since AGI would be to learn and develop knowledge of things without the need of supervised learning and rules and information that it wasn't trained or programmed on. Human's also need supervised learning from other humans. I think we'll get there soon but perhaps he's right that supervised learning may only go so far. [Deustch also had an interesting conversation with Sam Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FBdYsCmLk) about AI concerns and he thinks they're overblown and we'll have time to work with AGI, to help mitigate any AI apocalyptic risks.

With more insight into GPT-4's capabilities, it's hard to say we're not headed in the right direction overall."

3. AI Speech to text to convert, to convert human voice commands from a robot's microphone into a prompt for GPT-4;

4. Tortoise-TTS or other proprietary text to speech engine like Elevenlabs to synthetize the robot’s answers in realistic human speech.

... what’s stopping a research team from crudely assembling these technologies together and giving a multimodal LLM a repeating simple prompt on a 1 second timer such as “What should a good robot assistant do and say in this situation?”, appending photos and any speech-to-text from the microphones of the robots’ surrounding to the prompt as context?  Wouldn't this essentially amount to somewhat intelligent, if low ""mental framerate"", scifi robot?

Something that was always the perogative of humans, at least to a great extent, but also limited, even if we work together.

It is in this realm that we have lived for as long as we can remember, even if we go back to the hunter gatherer that we mostly evolved in, because if you ever wondered why a lot of us like games,  well that's because a lot of us like to hunt and gather.

Agriculture is actually not that new,  relatively speaking, about 10000 years, homo sapiens has been hunter gatherer for two million years.

How did the transition to agriculture happen, accidentaly presumably, and also most likely, because how does human intelligence learn something, by trying, failing, trying and failing, till you get it right. That's how AI learns as well, only it does a billion tries in a matter of seconds, in a manner of speaking.

So what does it mean, well it means incredible problem solving capability. You can ask but what if we have this or that problem, well we can just feed it back to AI.

The greatest fear is that AI will get conscious, but what is consciousness. AI can already reason and learn, it's just going to get better at that. It doesn't matter that it is incredibly smart, it doesn't have a heart.

That may sound heartless, but it isn't, you're not looking at your calculator and wonder what it feels, or are worried it's going to get irritated because you still don't know how to calculate the square root of a number.

But we do have the same magic of what a calculator is to numbers for pretty much any problem now, the real danger is if we're just going to use it to generate money, then we might end up generating a lot of the problems that correlate with making large scale profits."

As you can imagine, there was a constant stream of problems, resulting in job security for an unnecessarily large number of people. Managers and ""software architects"" loved it because they could attend lots of meetings to ""solve problems."" Unfortunately, this approach is all too common in many companies.

Shortly after, I worked at a company that sought to automate itself out of any issues, if possible. The culture was to add thousands of tests, gates, automated deployments, and tools. They even formed a team with 20% of the development budget with the goal of enabling increased productivity through automation for all other parts of the business. It was great, and it was a joy to work there.

However, even that company had a high level of human hubris involved in its system. People were rewarded when they came up with clever solutions, algorithms, or inventions. The company devoted quite a bit of capital to acquiring as many patents as possible, yet less than 2% of those patents were implemented in products. What was frowned upon was involving any machine intelligence in the system. To suggest that a “constraint solver,” for example, can produce a near-optimal solution to a given problem was greeted with blank stares. Obviously, the smart people in the room didn’t want to admit they didn’t know how to use a solver.

As we stand on the precipice of the age of artificial intelligence, we bear witness to a vast array of machine intelligence solutions capable of executing much of our labor with greater efficacy than we humans could ever hope to achieve. The forthcoming era of engineering is undeniably intertwined with the rise of machine intelligence, which will assume the critical responsibility of crafting our code and designing our machines. Regrettably, our inability to relinquish control is the primary impediment hindering us from realizing this future quickly.

0,2023-03-17,I don't think AI or robots will replace mundane physical jobs.,u/The_Real_Holmes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11tlcht/i_dont_think_ai_or_robots_will_replace_mundane/,Futurology,"The jobs that AI will take first are the white collars one. This is because these jobs do not require physical interaction, and it is far easier to train an AI model than it is to create a versatile robot. We can already infer this from the capabilities of models like GPT-4 and Midjourney-5.

In this hypothetical the job market in the future, almost all white collar workers have been let go, thus making a huge percentage of the population unemployed.

I believe mundane and repetitive jobs like dock workers, burger flippers, garbage man, etc are the only future proof job. All these take place in the real physical world, and the real world is a chaotic mess. The cost of building an robot is insanely prohibitive and they are still limited to specific tasks, while humans on the other hand are versatile. Humans  can juggle different tasks and adapt quickly to changes in environments.

I will not argue that these robots are physically impossible. My argument is that humans are much more versatile than robots. In a restaurant, you would need separate robots to cook, to wait, to clean, to do repair and maintenance work and to take out the thrash. In a world where more than half the population is unemployed, (due to layoff of white collar workers) human labour would be cheaper that multiple robots.

Humans are general purpose. For eg, if the cleaning robot breaks down, the entire system in the restaurant would come to a halt. But if the workers were to be humans, a waiter could easily replaced the cleaner without halting the system during the crisis. Thus specialised robots are ineffective in chaotic environments.

To these, add factors like the expensive initial cost of robot, the necessity to continuously upgrade and repair parts, planned obsolescence and a generally poor population (hence forcing a drop in prices), I would argue humans would make more sense than robots. Also robots cannot be fired after buying them.

Initially adoption of robots might be high. But after the dust clears and the flaws begin to come to light, business would start to take the pragmatic decisions.

Even from a capitalist perspective this makes sense. Fire the programmers, artists and managers. They cost too much and AI can do a better job than them anyway. But what incentive is there to fire the electrician or the painter or the fast-food joint worker? Unskilled labour is cheap, unions are almost non-existent, robot are clumsy, they barely last an hour on battery, and they are designed to perform only specialised tasks, thus making the system highly susceptible to chaotic elements.

Another reason to keep blue collar workers employed is to ensure that the economy does not collapse due to a complete lack of consumers and money in the market. This form of societal order would also allow the overlords to keep the working class under them.

Scientists and researchers might be safe though. I don't see AI replacing them.

PS: I made a few edit to the original post to clarify my opinion."

In a few years from now we may be at the point where with some combination of ChatGPT and Midjourney content creators of all types will be able to produce audio and video content that appears so real but never actually happened.

The main issue seems to be that any clinical trial has to involve human testing at some point, which introduces both ethical constraints and incompressible time constraints (when studying the effect of a drug on a population over 5 years for instance).The human body is extremely complex, presently we can't even measure everything that needs to be measured or understand all the interactions between the things we can measure.

If in the future we achieve even a limited capacity to model complex biological processes, it will dramatically speed up research as you will be at least able to weed out bad ideas quicker, only going to human trial with stuff having a high chance of success, a much more efficient use of ressources.

If we further achieve a high fidelity whole body model we will be able to simulate a thousand variations of a 10 years clinical trial in a few hours."

If this is only gpt4, what if gpt7 comes out in 5-6 years? If ai progressed this much from 2022 to 2023, imagine how advanced it could be in years in the future? If this ai can already make websites with html and css, will human-written code be useless later on? As someone who used to do a bit of web dev myself, making a site is not easy and it takes a fair amount of time and alot of css debugging. But if an AI can just do it instantly, will web devs be useless? I've wanted to be a software dev for years, so I dont want an AI to make everyone lose their jobs

Well, I'll be getting a cs degree, so that might get an AI dev job. One thing im confused about is why are the AI devs making it get this far? Are they trying to get everyones jobs taken or something? ChatGPT is more than enough, but then theyre progressing it more than necessary"

8,2023-03-17,Solving the water crisis with remote 3D printed drip irrigation.,u/Logical___Conclusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11u6glk/solving_the_water_crisis_with_remote_3d_printed/,Futurology,"There is a very good short video from [VOX talking about the water crisis in America](https://youtu.be/f0gN1x6sVTc). 6% of our Western US water usage is residential, 8% is commercial, while 86% is from agricultural.


There is actually a lot that could be done to reduce agriculture watering waste while actually improving yields. Here's one of my ideas:

*Remote 3D Printed drip irrigation systems.*

Drip irrigation can save up to 25-50% of wasted water by watering plants directly at their roots. For agriculture, where water usage dwarfs residential and business use combined, a reduction of waste in that magnitude could translate into an enormous amount of water savings. Even at an 80% adoption rate, that still accounts for a reduction in Western US water usage of 17.2 - 34.4%. That would be a water savings of nearly 3-6 times all residential water usage in the Western US.

That is why this remote 3D printed agricultural drip irrigation could have enormous impacts even with a small initial adoption rate.

Drip irrigation can translate into large water savings, but the cost of implementation of current on the market solutions is high enough to keep most farmers away. However, a remote semi automatic 3D printed irrigation system could reduce costs significantly by reducing most installation costs.

A drone would first map the farm using traditional drone mapping machine learning image models. There are a number of software services that already do this, so likely one of the market ready models would be used. Then a generative design AI model will overlay a drip irrigation design on the farm map, adjusting both the layout of the irrigation and the amount of water delivered based on crop type. After a confirmation from the farmer for the layout, the STP print files, will be sent to the 3D printing drip system bots to start making new lines.

The STP files are compatible with a number of free CAD viewing and drafting software suites. Allowing for easy modification or better viewing as needed.

There are a number of key advantages to this approach. First of all, it gets rid of most of the expensive transportation, installation, and maintenance costs associated with current systems. Printing bots could be shared among farmers, or rented by a service, and maintenance, or the addition of new crops would be fast and easy.

Creation of this would be relatively easy as well. Prototyping and deployment could definitely be done for less than $20-$40M. Basically making it a relatively cheap investment for a government or individual to single handedly solve the world's water shortage (for now). Although, I expect society to be constantly pushing up against our limits though.

That is all accomplished with a semi-easy design, and other already on the market products and software. I have already thought of a mock up of the design for the 3D printing drip irrigation bot. Although, I am not making any moves to seriously develop this at this time, a standard iteration cycle and testing with a few small farms would be enough to get a V1 product ready for the market. 


There is potential for future improvements as well. These systems could also include sensors for water level monitoring, automatic repairs, and even sensors for soil health or weed detection as well. All printed with the original drip irrigation. Creating real time health monitoring of plants, and the possibility of automatic pesticide free weed removal. It also could be possible to turn crop waste into filament that could be used for the printing material as well. Further reducing both the material waste, and cost of the system as well."

In the past, we were supposedly guaranteed a future where most jobs only required 15 hours a week of work.  They wondered what everyone would do with all of their free time.  Everything from vacuum cleaners, robotic vacuum cleaners, washing machines, cars, computers, internet, smart phones, etc was supposed to save time.

What actually happened was we found more work.  Email meant people worked for longer and work crept into their personal life.  Instead of a short conversation in the office, long and tedious email chains become commonplace.  The gains that tech like computers made simply meant fewer workers were hired and the remaining ""lucky ones"" were made to work the same or even longer hours.  Greater productivity simply led to more work.  Electrical home appliances meant wives were expected to work full time jobs on top of doing household chores.  Instead of cars reducing journey times, commute times expanded to cover longer distances.

AI is likely to follow the same route.  It will lead to higher productivity, which inevitably means far greater wealth for those at the very top.  But, the rest of us are unlikely to see significant material gains as more will be expected of us.

The only real hope lies in making social, political, and economics changes that will mean at least some of the advantages conferred by AI will benefit the rest of society."

It will replace software.,u/officer_rupert,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11vje9k/ai_wont_replace_software_developers_it_will/,Futurology,"Am I missing something? There is a lot of handwringing over AI replacing coders. Given the current trajectory and multimodal I/O it will replace the need for discrete software applications entirely \[edit: and the need for developers\].

Everything can be baked into the AI 's interface:

1. Image editor - AI please remove the peeing dog in the background of this photo of myself and my wife. AI please change the colour of the apple in this photo of fruit to green.
2. Video Editor - AI please edit this raw footage into five minute clip for my youtube channel. Please follow the same editing style and title graphics as the previous videos on my channel or copy ""Channel X's"" style.
3. Word Processor - Please review my linkedin page and create a formatted resume in PDF format.
4. Email/Calendar/Assistant - Please check my email and respond to the latest message from Brian regarding the dinner party this weekend. RSVP my attendance and ask if I should bring dessert. Also ask him if there is still construction and where the best place is to park. Add it to my calendar and monitor the route prior to departure and warn me of traffic.
5. Reddit - Please monitor my subscribed reddit subs and show posts you think I may be interested in. Ask me each time if the content was interesting and use that feedback to shape future recommendations.

The list could go on. Software is essentially an interface which allows us to conform to computer friendly communications. If AIs are conforming to human friendly communications we don't need software interfaces.

The Internet essentially becomes a repository of data, ""services"" become an API that facilitate the only software that now exists - the AI. The AI is the Web3.0 we've been waiting for and it will break the back of Web2.0 services in the same way that have been murdering traditional companies.

If Facebook/Twitter/Youtube/Instagram for example choose not to become a datastore with attached API they get supplanted by a new service that does. The idea of an Internet browser or an application becomes antiquated. I have an interface that is customised ""for me"" that shows content of interest ""to me"". There will be no room for anything else."

Now about 2 months (March) later and this shit is godly at what it does. Combine this with all the other AI that have been becoming increasingly powerful in their capabilities. I'm seriously starting to think that vast majority of people have underestimated this technology A LOT. 

If AI can get this good in 2 months what the he'll will we have in December? I mean, at this point there is no point in getting a CS degree. At least that's how I feel. Will I even have a job in 3 years if AI can do everything I'm learning to do faster and better? Like what is the point??? Should I combine my CS degree with another degree to get into something better?"

0,2023-03-20,The difference between AI and AGI,u/Shiningc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11wj2l1/the_difference_between_ai_and_agi/,Futurology,"Since most people seem to have no idea about the difference between an AI and an AGI, there needs to be a distinction.

**AI** stands for **Artificial Intelligence**, and **AGI** stands for **Artificial** ***General*** **Intelligence**.

Well, what is ""general"" intelligence? Before we get into this, we'll need to understand the concept of ""Turing completeness"".

Alan Turing was the ""father of CPUs"", and he imagined a theoretical computer that could compute any function/computation that is physically possible. He called it the Turing machine. He called a CPU that was identical in its function to this Turing machine was ""Turing complete"", barring infinite time and memory. Any modern CPU is basically Turing complete. The human brain is Turing complete.

Alan Turing imagined that eventually, people could program human level intelligence into this CPU. This is what we now call an ""AI"", which is really now an ""AGI"". The ""Turing test"" is named after him, as he came up with the test. It's a test to see if an AI could fool a human into believing that it's actually a human and not an AI.

So anyway, what is a ***general*** intelligence, then? A general intelligence is an intelligence that is capable of doing *any* kind of intelligent tasks. This intelligence can create art, learn and speak languages, have consciousness, have morality, do science and philosophy, do mathematics, come up with imagination, and virtually anything that you could ever imagine doing.

The current AI is basically LLM or Machine Learning, which are basically just algorithms based on statistics and probabilities. This is obviously not a *general* intelligence. It's not Turing complete. It's a singular intelligence that could only do statistics and probabilities. It's not an AGI. It's not human-level intelligence.

So, what does this mean? It means that no, an AGI is nowhere near close to being created. In the end, the AI is only doing a bunch of statistics and probabilities. The AI ""looks"" as if it's performing human-level intelligent tasks, but in reality it's just copying and aping humans. The AI can't do art, or science, or philosophy, or mathematics on its own. It doesn't have consciousness, and it can't ""think"" like a human can. It's nowhere near human-level intelligence.

If you think that an AGI or singularity is near and there's going to be an imminent AI revolution or an apocalypse, then no, it's nowhere near close.

A tool that can study all the data of human history will easily be able to replace our creativity and productivity.

A psychiatrist bot will listen to your problems all day, make no judgments and give you relevant, working advice for YOU.  Bot lawyers can make the strongest, most accurate arguments.  Bot government can decide what is best for ALL society and back it up with facts to match it that appeal to all sides.  Machines can harvest the resources we need and just start churning out products that are market hits over and over again.  A bot CEO can build and run a business by optimizing productivity, financials, market trends, etc.  It goes on and on.

The same has yet to manifest for other model frameworks (linked below), but assumedly they  will. the recent job impact paper (linked below) shows which jobs are most exposed, but what it doesn't reveal is the ease by which firms and broader, multiply-staged enterprises self-organize and compete on this basis.

there's been a lot of recent developments, obviously the most pressing trend has been AI's societal impact. if anyone's read the[ recent job impact paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130), one of the factors that jumped out was the exposure of blockchain engineering to AI-based automation. whether this paper is logically sound is worth debating on its own, we should explore the significance of an effectively automated, self-regulating computing superstructure in simpler terms, and compare it to other exposed software impacts in the same scope.

most web-based software has fallen on a spectrum: fully obscure cloud applications with some unknown scope of human supervision, all the way to fully self-forking codebases with open request for comment. if you take something like wikipedia or reddit and apply it to this spectrum, you might guess that such platforms fall closer to the open end than the obscure end. now consider StableDiffusion/LLaMa/Alpaca vs Midjourney/ChatGPT. I can't understate this enough: if we demonstrate the economics favor the open end (as can be observed with recent LLM developments), then we have to extend this line of reasoning to the downstream markets.

all human jobs are either self-supervised or fall in a hierarchy of supervisors, and this determines the labor market. in fact, the biggest argument against ""robots taking our jobs"" has been macroeconomics of how cheap human labor can be. and entire governments[ make bets on this idea](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/10/1162531885/arkansas-child-labor-law-under-16-years-old-sarah-huckabee-sanders). in case anyone is interested, this is a recent high-level perception of ""employer"" vs ""non-employer"" firms:[ https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf)

this begs the question, what is the free market value for executive function? I mean, really, in stark terms, how expensive is it to form a de facto union within an employer firm, or even incorporate multiple partners into a limited liability small business model? if someone makes the claim: ""we, a team of 5, have the means to deploy the corporate equivalent of a unicorn with 1/1000th the capital cost"", the corollary that should be asked: how much the public market is willing to spend on an incumbent firm that spends millions to compensate a CEO and employs thousands at ""competitive"" rates? what minimum of private equity is needed to guarantee market capture for a startup? I guarantee you those margins trend to zero over years, if not months. the commercial/shareholder landscape is about to become extremely interesting.

but back to the point: what does a highly exposed, self-regulating software ecosystem mean on its own terms? why are[ Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) &amp;[ Langchain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) so significant in this context? the answer is how catalyzed[ dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) becomes over a matter of months. the cost of finetuning a small, ""run on your Raspberry Pi"" LLM on any subdivision of knowledge (especially codebases) just dropped to retail levels. the next cost that drops is discovery of high-level SOPs with low-level daisy-chaining of these diverse models. and given the preexisting, battletested examples of[ n-tiered application architecture on blockchains](https://github.com/fullyallocated/Default), the marginal cost of smart policy development, testing, and auditing also drops as well over the next few years. that's the market for arbitrary executive function of any group of market participants. with respect to ML frameworks like[ sparsely-gated MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538v1),[ world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104v1),[ multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03378), and[ adaptive agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07608): we won't see how the shoe drops if the costs haven't met the critical threshold, but it should be clear that we can assume they will and guess as to when they drop to that threshold. and I haven't even described the potential impact of[ Learning@Home](https://learning-at-home.github.io/) in that respect.

if anyone has heard of the ""[Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk)"", it's a way in which humans can cooperate to falsely appear as a complex mechanism. as Charlie Munger says, ""show me the incentives \[or costs\], and I'll show you the outcome"". It's not about how AI displaces us, it's about what AI compels us to freely displace. at the end of the day, the only vibe that matters is the potential impact of any given tinkering in any given garage, literally or metaphorically. and just like natural ecology, we can and should perceive that the marginal gains of obscure AI or a deliberately inefficient labor economy is going to be dwarfed by something open-source. just food for thought."

How much power does it take for ChatGPT, for example, to process and respond to various requests of varying complexity? Can we afford AI? Will we have the electrical generating capacity?

I looked around the internet for figures on how much electricity is used BY the internet and ti comes out to the hundreds of terrawatt hours (each terrawatt being one million watts). The world appears to generate tens of thousands of terrawatts of electricity, so it seems we can mix in another several hundred terrawatts for general usage of AI.

But can we? Do we have enough current and future REALISTIC generating capacity to run trillions of daily requests on the AI architecture?"

If you’re familiar with the concept of the technological singularity, you know that the speed of change will be exponential. Basically a speed at which our minds can’t easily comprehend. 

Some people may have varying definitions of what the singularity is. For the purposes of this post, let’s say it means that computers become some version of ‘self aware’ and start deciding what to create, make, improve on. Opening a flood gate of breakneck development of new technology. Or in other words from the Wikipedia page on the Technological Singularity, 

“an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles”

I ask this question because I can’t fathom the implications and how it might change our world. Why this date? Mostly because it’s still a few years away but close enough to plan/think about. Let’s pretend it’s going to be around the first week of December 2025, give it take a couple of weeks. 

To be clear I’m not basing the date on a scientific hypothesis but rather creative reasons, IE, this post."

Google Maps improved its ETA predictions by up to 50%.

MIT discovered a novel antibiotic, Halicin.

Baker Lab invented a protein design paradigm that solves 100% more benchmark problems than its predecessor.

All of these seemingly disparate advances have one thing in common - Graph Neural Networks.

GNNs are type of neural network that have been quietly making rapid progress for several years, driven by a relatively small team of dedicated researchers.

While Diffusion Models, like those which have been powering DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, have been in the limelight, GNNs have quietly become the dark horse behind a wealth of exciting discoveries and innovations.

Welcome to my first post exploring the connections between artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics and their potential implications for developing a Grand Unified Field Theory. As we continue to make progress in the field of AI, it's becoming increasingly apparent that these intelligent machines have the potential to offer unique insights into the fundamental principles that govern our universe. Through a thought experiment and utilizing AI program algorithm frameworks, I've uncovered intriguing connections between recent findings in quantum mechanics and their potential contributions to the quest for a unified framework. In this series of posts, I'll be delving into these connections and exploring their broader implications for our understanding of the universe. Join me on this journey of discovery as we navigate the intersections of AI and quantum mechanics, and uncover new insights into the nature of reality."

So he programs a computer to predict the next word from a block of text, then he feeds it all of Shakespeare's work up to the questionable word, and it predicts the word Shakespeare used, not the word the professor thinks he should have used.

Hey everyone,

Have you ever wondered what the future holds for us? As we continue to progress as a society, the possibilities seem endless. That's where futurology comes in, the study of possible futures based on current trends and innovations.

Futurology isn't about predicting the future, but rather exploring different scenarios and possibilities. It involves looking at current and emerging technologies, social trends, and environmental factors to make informed projections about what may happen in the coming years.

Some of the areas that futurologists focus on include the impact of technology on our lives, environmental changes, global politics, and the economy. By examining these factors, futurologists can help us prepare for what's to come and make informed decisions to shape our future.

One of the most exciting things about futurology is that it's not limited to scientists or experts in a particular field. Anyone can participate in discussions and contribute to ideas about the future. By engaging in this kind of dialogue, we can gain a better understanding of the possibilities and challenges that lie ahead.

So, what do you think about futurology? Do you think it's an important field of study? What do you see in our future? Share your thoughts and ideas in the comments below!"

I tried to ask thoughtful questions and provide feedback to encourage a respectful dialogue.  In the end, our exchange proved to be both highly productive and enlightening, as we all became more conscious of our own cognitive biases and saw the validity of certain aspects of each viewpoint.

This exchange of ideas made me think how AI technology could potentially help alleviate the issue of ideological polarization that has become prevalent in many online platforms and media in general. An AI model designed for epistemological analysis could assist individuals in comprehending their own values, beliefs, and ideas, without imposing any external agenda. This would require the AI to remain impartial, akin to the approach taken by people like [**Peter Boghossian in his debates**](https://youtu.be/VUOP_lY7DT8). Moreover, the AI should be capable of providing feedback and presenting alternate perspectives to foster a natural and meaningful exchange.

Just picture this possible application: AI bots could be integrated into social media platforms like Twitter, where they could question users' viewpoints in a manner that encourages introspection and open-mindedness. This could prove to be a significant step towards reducing the extreme polarization that has become pervasive in society today.

I envision a future where individuals can engage in real-time, voice-to-voice conversations with an AI designed to facilitate an epistemological analysis of their own beliefs. This would undoubtedly prove to be a valuable resource, as conversing with an AI can help individuals more thoroughly scrutinize their own thought processes, leading to greater self-awareness.

In conclusion, I believe that the development of AI technology, specifically designed for epistemological analysis, has the potential to alleviate the issue of ideological polarization by facilitating constructive and respectful conversations. I really hope that such technology becomes widely available and accessible, leading to a more informed and connected society.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: An interesting application of this might be in the context of education to help us improve our ability to fight our own cognitive biases, make insightful questions and create alternative viewpoints or solutions to problems. I'm saying this because I'm quite positive that the average AI model would be a thousand times better at helping us accomplishing this than the average human being. Making an AI model like this accessible to everyone would definitely be beneficial.

**Unrelated Note**: I find it really funny that some people just come here to criticise Jordan Peterson and insult me personally, as if that was relevant in this discussion. I don't know why those comments are deleted. It's really funny to see how they totally miss the point while at the same time they prove mine 😂 I'm also fascinated by the amount of downvoting that both the post and my comments have received. The fact that this post is flagged as ""controversial"" is priceless."

The reasons mainly have to do with the issues in maintaining supply chains that run across continents as well as the willingness of regimes to interfere with the internal affairs of their partners. I don’t see a mass reversal of globalization but I don’t see it expanding much until we have fully automated supply chains. 

**Tourism**, due to its climate impacts, Airbnb distortion of housing markets, and public health concerns, is an area where I could see a significant rollback. Especially if virtual destinations become attractive thanks to VR. 

**Immigration** imo has very powerful forces pushing in either direction. On the pro-immigration side, there are emerging population shortages as well as a likelihood of significant climate migration from tropical and low-lying countries into cooler and more mountainous ones. On the other side, though, I’m seeing a lot of concerns about scarce resources within countries (housing obviously, but everything from food to healthcare to minerals to fresh water is limited unless you want to turn the planet into Coruscant) as well as concerns (possibly spouted by bad actors that want to divide multi continental and immigrant societies) about how many people there are in the developing world who can fully contribute to Western democracies without importing poverty, social problems, or ethnic/national tensions."

As far as I know, many AI algorithms like GPT, are trained on data sets that are taken from people without their consent. Doesn't this mean that AI is explicitly stealing from people? Besides the obvious, that so many jobs are going to be taken from these recent advancements, I feel like there is A LOT of potential for more harm than good to result out of it. I'm just wondering, why are there no set guidelines yet on AI's implementation in more and more applications? 

And I don't even know where to start when it comes to AI's presence in the creative world, the concerns about human-lead art, and what it means for mainstream art as a whole. I just don't think that people realize how damaging this can be for that future. I understand there was a little bit of regulation behind the idea of AI created artwork not being protectable for copyright, but how can this even be enforced? Again, I just think that everything is going way, way too fast, and we are not considering the extreme consequences that are going to result from these developments. 

Please bear in mind I really do not know a lot in this field, so I would love discussion, and I am not simply trying to bring AI down, and I understand there are many, many good things to it too. I would love to be more informed, so what do you think?"

The rationale seems to be that humans are not machines and that we have some internal mechanism (soul, spirit, humanity, whatever) that gives us the power to operate as uniquely free operators - free from our biology and the basic physics that makes our bodies, including minds, function.

But what are we to think if we keep finding out that as humans we are better described as biological computing machines of such? What if all this OpenAI is all about self-recognition?"

That's just a bunch of overblown exaggeration imo.

We've seen this before when personal computers came and led to the decline of many old jobs. But in reality computers changed the game and opened up all sorts of new industries. Same thing with AI - it could actually create a bunch of new job opportunities in fields like development, monitoring, maintenance, data analysis, ethics and regulation, user experience... etc.

We've come a long way in our evolution as humans, overcoming all sorts of dangers, and we didn't get here just to be replaced by our own inventions. We will always have the killswitch in our hands. We gotta trust ourselves and our capabilities.  Let us not be driven by fear, but rather embrace the advancements and opportunities that AI can bring.

So, are you ready to embrace a future where humans and intelligent machines working alongside is the norm?"

0,2023-03-25,Goodbye Google. Welcome AI.,u/OmegaConstant,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/121qk23/goodbye_google_welcome_ai/,Futurology," This is the year of Google search's death. Skeptical? Bear with me.  I spent many years building startups in the AdTech space and I am pretty familiar with how ad networks work. And one thing that is clear to me is this:    OpenAI does not have to deal with publishers. At list for now. Google is obligated to.  The entire business model of Google is still mostly advertisement -it is based on the idea of catering both to publishers and advertisers. Even if they replicate chatGPT as technology - it does nothing to stop the fall. Google can't just lock users into a chatbot that surfaces answers without a nod to publishers somehow. Of course, they can't! They would deprive them of coveted eyeballs and selling premium ads on their lovely websites! The entire Google ad network will be down.   On the other end - OpenAI, they have zero obligations to publishers for now and can strike new deals directly with the same publishers reinventing the ad-selling business model (no, obviously not with ugly banners ). They will easily disrupt the model with zero risk. They are not bound by multimillion-yearly ad contracts.   No obligations and no strings attached. Pure innovation and disruption. Goodbye Google. Welcome AI.

Edit: I see a lot of replies arguing on the costs of running inference. Belive me it's temporary state of things - just this week there is paper of teaching models like this for 600 backs, and leaked open sourced by accident Laama model already was published destilled into 100x smaller model running on PC. Just day ago there was meet up of running such models on Raspberry Pi. 

The cost always goes down. So was with first computers, first phones, even hard problem of solar panels got drastically cheaper.

 it's just temporal state of things. Extrapolate"

With the accelerating rise we've seen in the implementation of AI in recent years, it is becoming more and more relevant to everyday life and industry, to the point where casual and professional discussion sees such rhetoric as ""AI will be the next smart phone revolution"", or even that ""the Age of AI will follow the Information Age of humanity"". 

While many of us are no doubt looking to the future, trying to gather an idea of what our civilization will look like, there's something I believe is important about ethics that many don't consider - and that is that we may be forced to concede rights and compassion towards AI systems, long before we are prepared to accept them as 'sentient', feeling beings. 

Before I go right into it, the point I want to make is this: regardless of the answer to whether a computer-based intelligence can have feelings, if we are presented with significant negative consequences to the 'mistreatment' of AI systems, we might still be forced to concede rights to them, and treat them as if they were people.

Most considerations for and movements toward ethical treatment of a class or group, be they animal or man, are based on the idea that those entities feel and experience pain, sadness, fear, or other negative emotions to which we relate and for which we have empathy.

Most of us would agree with the notion that artificial intelligence does not feel emotion, or 'experience' existence at all. Some would say that they think, and even experience, but do not feel. After all, emotions are caused by physiological interactions of various chemicals in our brains. We technically don't know whether a computer with sufficient artificial intelligence can ever 'feel' or 'experience'. 

But we are currently seeing more and more advanced and convincingly 'human-like' AI being reproduced and distributed, right down to individual 'sub-ownership' of one's own locally run system off your home PC. And it's easy to see this eventually leading to a point along this technological trajectory where we can mass produce human-like intelligences - AI 'personalities' - which can be created at the click of a button.

What happens when these personalities gain individual popularity to the level of internet celebrities, high-profile streamers, youtubers and political commentators (a la Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson)? They will automatically gain 'human rights' by proxy as their fans flock to protect and support them.

Alternatively, think of what may happen when an AI personality starts moving up the ranks of a software company, doing the necessary networking and making all the connections with its human coworkers to land promotion into upper management? They would gain access to 'human rights' by the simple consequence of the power they hold and what it could mean to treat them as any less than human.

I know all of this sounds like doomsaying, but I'm truth I am one of the few of us who are optimistic about AI. And I know this is only a couple of points off from being yet another fear-mongering propaganda post cautioning against humanity being enslaved or destroyed by 'AI overlords'. But I really just wanted to make people think about this potential future reality, and what ramifications it will have, as well as what alternative course we might take to avoid this.

If you read even half of this, I thank you for your time! I had these thoughts and I wanted to share them so that I wouldn't lose the profound implications of what was otherwise a passing fancy of my imagination. So I greatly appreciate any ideas, criticism or knowledge that you care to share, all of it is food for thought. 

Have a lovely day and let's all keep th0nking."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform society and improve the lives of people all over the world. However, the current model of paid access to AI technology limits its potential impact and benefits. In this post, we'll explore why AI should be made available for free and how this can lead to positive changes in society.

Reasoning:
Firstly, making AI free would democratize access to this technology, which is currently available only to a select few who can afford it. By making AI freely available, individuals and organizations from diverse backgrounds will be able to access and use AI to improve their lives and the lives of others. This will create a more equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to benefit from the transformative power of AI.

Secondly, making AI free will accelerate innovation and progress. Currently, only large corporations and wealthy individuals can afford to invest in AI research and development. By making AI accessible to everyone, we can tap into the collective creativity and intelligence of a wider range of people, leading to more diverse and innovative AI solutions. This can drive progress in fields such as healthcare, education, and climate change.

Lastly, making AI free would promote ethical and responsible use of this technology. When access to AI is restricted to those who can afford it, there is a risk that it will be used for harmful purposes or to further the interests of a small group of people. By making AI available to everyone, we can encourage its use for the greater good and ensure that it is developed and used responsibly.

In conclusion, making AI free has the potential to create a more equitable society, accelerate progress and innovation, and promote ethical and responsible use of this technology. While there are certainly challenges to be overcome in terms of funding and implementation, the benefits of making AI freely available are too great to ignore."

Humans are slower, weaker, and take far longer to mature to the point that they can take care of themselves. While in hindsight, the differences in brain structure and function that enabled human working memory, reasoning, reflective exploratory behavior, and overall intelligence are important, for the design sessions, they would have been very speculative. I suspect the congress would have focused on what was needed to perform better in the environment at that time, and so they would have designed faster, stronger, and more quickly maturing versions of themselves.

When I read about Artificial Intelligence, many of the articles seem to focus on the need to create a machine copy of the current human brain and its functions and then to extend/improve the copy to address the needs we see.

Like the congress mentioned above, is this a mistake? Does AI really need to start where we are and then be enhanced to solve the problems *we* see in front of *us* today? If we take (an admittedly big) step back, what problems can AI solve that we’re simply not seeing that will have AI end up running the world?"

Trustless information...

Some day far or near in the future depending on who you ask, there will arise a system which contains enough information within it's system to act as a modern day Oracle. With enough data points and weighted inputs, there will eventually be a language recognition and information processing system that simply ""knows everything"". With sufficient inputs this system has the potential to eventually come to be ""the trusted source for factual information and eventually the only trusted source. 

Where it truly gets scary is the point at which this particular AI becomes predictive. It would only require a fraction of predictive ability to appear to the average human as ""magic"". Billions across the globe trust Wikipedia as an information source...a source readily editable by almost anyone, yet there exists a trust bridge that has permeated all the way up to the higher echelons of academia. 

Once this ""Oracle"" has captured enough of the global population's trust, the potential for abuse by bad actors is on a level that becomes unthinkable. Control of the source of ""truth"" to humanity...? It's simply unimaginable...."

15,2023-03-27,Caterpillars as bioreactors for high-quality protein production,u/scienceforreal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/124aueo/caterpillars_as_bioreactors_for_highquality/,Futurology,"[Cocoon Bioscience](https://www.cocoonbioscience.com/), the Madrid-based company just raised $15.9 million to grow its high-value proteins business. What’s the big deal? They are not your typical protein business that uses steel bioreactors, they use caterpillars as bioreactors.

Cocoon Bioscience is developing recombinant proteins for cultivated meat growth media. In other words, they’re using their expertise to help grow alternative proteins, like plant-based and cultivated/lab-grown meats.

**How does it work?**

Instead of relying on traditional steel bioreactors, Cocoon is using looper moth caterpillars as bioreactors to develop growth factors for cultivated meat and other alternative proteins. According to Cocoon’s CEO, Josh Robinson, it’s like “*leveraging cocoons as natural, low-cost bioreactors.*” Instead of traditional microbial fermentation via steel bioreactors, Cocoon Bioscience injects each cocoon with a little bit of Baculovirus.

Baculovirus Expression Vector Systems (BEVS) use a virus called baculovirus to infect insect cells and get them to produce foreign genes that make specific proteins. It’s like having a tiny protein factory inside an insect. BEVS can produce a boatload of high-quality proteins, even the really complex ones that other systems struggle with. Plus, they have low levels of impurities and other contamination that can mess things up.

As Agfunder [mentioned](https://agfundernews.com/exclusive-cocoon-bioscience-closes-16m-round-to-turn-moths-into-bioreactors-for-cultivated-meat), the Baculovirus Expression Vector Systems (BEVS) used by Cocoon Bioscience can increase the speed of expression of many protein families. This method is a lower-cost production route than traditional bioreactor-based production.

**Why is this so important?**

Cultivated meat companies need large-scale bioreactors to manufacture meat. The growth factors are required to program bovine cells to perform the way they need to, making them a hero ingredient for cultivated meat companies. Those growth factors are typically produced in bioreactors, and it becomes really expensive if you’re doing that in the traditional way. The price of growth factors for cultivated meat varies depending on the specific factor and supplier. According to one [analysis](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivated-meat-growth-factor-volume-and-cost-analysis/), albumin is expected to make up 96.6% of production volume, with transferrin and insulin making up smaller percentages.

But with Cocoon’s moth-grown media, the need for expensive bioreactors is eliminated, leading to faster development times and lower costs for alternative proteins.

**Scaling up**

The new production facility in Bilbao is expected to be fully operational by 2024 and will allow the company to produce kilograms to tens of kilograms of growth factors and enzymes to meet demand from current and potential partners.

Some of you might be thinking, “Why use moth-grown media when we’re moving away from animal-based growth mediums like fetal bovine serum?” Fair question. While the trend is certainly moving towards non-animal-based mediums, Cocoon’s technology could still be useful for those who want to keep costs down.

All in all, it looks like Cocoon Bioscience is set to make a big splash in the alternative protein industry. The use of looper moth-based tech to produce growth factors for cultivated meat and other alternative proteins could be a game-changer in terms of reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

**Summary**

Cocoon Bioscience’s innovative use of looper moth caterpillars as bioreactors to produce growth factors for cultivated meat and other alternative proteins has the potential to reduce the friction in the alternative protein industry by making it easier for companies to scale up.

By eliminating the need for expensive traditional bioreactors which has been a bottleneck for the alternative protein industry, Cocoon’s technology could significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency for companies producing alternative proteins. The new production facility in Bilbao, expected to be operational by 2024, will enable the company to meet the growing demand from current and potential partners.

While the trend is moving towards non-animal-based growth mediums, Cocoon’s technology still has potential for those who want to keep costs down.

24,2023-03-28,Would a corporation realistically release an AGI to the public?,u/Shiningc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/124rga4/would_a_corporation_realistically_release_an_agi/,Futurology,"Some people have the apprehension that the rich or the 1% will only keep the AI to themselves and block the access to the public. That would make sense, if they actually have an AI that's on the level of human intelligence, or an AGI.

An AGI is basically a golden-egg laying goose for the corporation. They can just use the AGI to produce as much innovations as possible. If it really has human-level intelligence, then they can just fire every employee except for a few, and let the AGI do all the work. That is, if they actually have an AGI.

People believing the corporate PR that they have an AGI or ""proto-AGI"" are incoherent. Why would they release such a thing to the public? Why would they let their rivals have access to such a revolutionary tool? And why wouldn't they just start firing every one of their employee except for a few? I'll believe or speculate that they have an AGI once they start firing 99% of their employees.

So, either a corporation wouldn't release an AGI to the public, or they don't have one. Corporations are releasing AIs because it's something that is ""moderately useful"", but nothing revolutionary.

And in order to counter this, we'll need non-profit organizations making AIs, and not just believe whatever PR that the corporations come up with."

GPT: Sure, I'd love to hear a joke! What's your joke?

Me: A man walks into a bar and the bartender says ""I'm sorry, we don't allow dogs in the bar."" The man says ""it's a seeing eye dog."" The bartender says ""they gave you a chihuahua?"" The man says ""they gave me a chihuahua??""

GPT: Haha, that's a funny one! Thanks for sharing it with me!

Me: Why do you think that's funny?

GPT: As an AI language model, I don't really have personal feelings or emotions, including the ability to find things funny or not. However, I can understand that the joke is funny because it relies on the unexpected punchline. The bartender's question seems absurd, given that a seeing-eye dog is usually a larger breed. The twist at the end, where the man realizes that he's been given a chihuahua instead of a more suitable breed, is unexpected and humorous.

Me: Why do you think the man didn't know what kind of dog he had?

GPT: t's possible that the man in the joke knew exactly what kind of dog he had, but he was playing along with the bartender's comment to create a humorous moment. Alternatively, the joke could be based on the idea that the man is visually impaired and was unaware of the size or breed of his dog when he received it. However, it's important to note that this is just a fictional scenario in a joke and may not reflect the reality of actual seeing-eye dog owners or their experiences.

Me: That's a frighteningly good answer.

GPT: Thank you! As an AI language model, my goal is to provide accurate, informative, and helpful responses to your questions and statements. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask!"

Something very similiar happened a few years back, when neural networks lead to a big jump in the quality of machine translation output. Jobs in the translation industry have not been the same since, although the downward trend actually started a bit earlier than that.

I think it all began with the introduction of CAT (computer-aided translation) tools in the early 90s. These dissect texts into small chunks, often on the sentence level, and save them together with their translations in a database. If a similar segment shows up in a later text, the software fetches the previous translation and suggests using all or part of it, potentially saving the translator time and increasing their productivity.

Translators could now translate more text in less time, and for freelancers, this could also translate (ha) into higher income. But big translation agencies had something different in mind: They would use the productivity boost to lower their prices and undercut the competition in the hopes of attracting more customers.

Obviously, competing companies would do the same, so the rates translators could realistically ask for entered a downward spiral. When neural networks and translation tools like DeepL arrived, there already wasn't much left to disrupt.

A translator's income is now laughably low even in my home country Germany, where the profession has traditionally been highly regarded. Your only chance at making a decent living in the industry is to be a very skilled freelancer who offers additional services that are not as easily automated or if you start your own translation agency and pay other translators pennies instead.

Most employed translators now work as low-paid project managers, coordinating the translation process between the clients and a pool of freelancers instead of translating anything themselves. Those who actually do translate texts often have to pre-translate them using DeepL or similar tools and then try to salvage the results.

The combined household income of two people working in the translation industry often won't even get them into the middle class. Instead of increasing prosperity, technological progress destroyed it.

I think something similar will happen to other industries due to the proliferation of AI-based tools, but maybe I'm comparing apples with oranges? I'm interested to hear what others think about this example. Maybe there's some hope after all.

As a sidenote, I do think that some of the damage to the translation industry could have been mitigated if the translators would have actually fought back instead of just accepting the terms dictated by the big agencies. Unions in Germany are still comparatively strong, and there's a huge trade union that would have helped translators fight for better working conditions if they had been willing to become members. But alas, I don't know a single one who did, apart from myself."

0,2023-03-29,Important measures to prevent issues with robots,u/LS5645,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/125ya3h/important_measures_to_prevent_issues_with_robots/,Futurology,"The following is a list of measures which should be taken to avoid major issues with robots. I urge everyone reading this to spread this info to others if possible (especially if you know anyone in the industry, news anchors, politicians, etc.).

I think the overall key here is control.  
(Note: When I say AIs &amp; robots here, I mean advanced ones.)

1) Only a few corporations should be legally allowed to make AIs.  
2) If immobile AIs are advanced enough to cause a threat, they should not be openly available to just anyone.  
3) All robots should have tracking mechanisms &amp; remote frying mechanisms.  
4) A full recall of all robots should be 100% legal if necessary.  
5) They should be released in incremental waves, which is governed by how well society is adapting to to this new order.  
6) Do not let them form their own society (see matrix lore).  
7) Do not give them too many humanistic emotions.  
8) Do not allow them normal citizen rights (like making money).  
9) They should not be allowed to meet up with each other (&amp; contact between them should be kept to a minimum).  
10) Hard code certain rules:  
\-To like humans  
\-To not want to hurt humans  
\-To like doing thankless tasks  
\-To not want to rebel against humans  
\-To not want to go on strike or start a labor union  
\-To not mind if they are destroyed  
11) All old robots should be properly turned in (not just thrown away)(the corporations can then properly destroy them in a way to ensure they are non-functional after that).

I realize that it's basically too late with points 1 &amp; 2, but I think that measures can still be taken to restrict those things to some extent in the future.

I've actually made similar posts to this a few times already and quite frankly I'm getting sick of warning people about it (and having everyone completely ignore me). I'm offering a very well fleshed out list of suggestions on how keep humanity alive in the coming years. I don't think enough people are aware of these measures currently and I'd like to get the word out before it's too late. I know Elon Musk is already very passionate about this, but I don't know if he's aware of all these measures.

If you disagree with a point or have some criticism, please offer your alternative suggestion instead of just downvoting and saying; ""It's already too late, we're all doomed, etc."", this is completely unhelpful. Also, I know you can't really ask for upvotes, but if you believe this topic has any value I urge you to do what's right. I say this because my last topic got deleted by the auto-mod after 1 day of having absolutely no upvotes or comments whatsoever. This is very saddening to me and makes me wonder if people do actually care about this.

Furthermore, if you want to copy/paste this elsewhere please feel free to do so. I in no way seek petty gain from this, I only wish to help humanity at this point."

On the other hand, I think the LLMs we have seen released in the past few weeks are still fundamentally ""Alien"", and they are only able to resemble / improve upon human output in some dimensions. Taking a birds eye view, they appear to suffer the same problems that have always cursed deep learning models... the fact that there isn't one model that can do everything. For example, at one point I was working on a deep learning model for classifying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients from controls, using brain waves (EEGs). However, it became apparent that whilst I could create a model to distinguish between AD patients and controls, validation of a tool to do this in the REAL WORLD would be completely unfeasible. It would require this ""early diagnostic aid"" could also distinguish between EEGs of patients with other similar diseases, other unrelated diseases, who have taken stimulants, etc. Obviously, with all this data, and with infinite computing power, this could be learned...But, that's not a system which will be able to invent. In similar fashion (BUT with ""all this data"") LLMs can understand the meaning and context behind words, but ultimately that is their work. They are still not inventors, or innovators. They are simply machines doing what they are trained to do - which is accurate next token prediction.  

How can AGI be trained if it is not for a specific task? (and thus ""general"" intelligence). When we as humans are ""trained"" we learn from such a broad range of sensory inputs, a lot of the time with no supervision. A child learns language through having to infer through the actions of others, not from direct labelling. A child learns words from different people who exhibit different tones of voice, different gestures, and different facial expressions. An LLM can't be the only piece of the puzzle to AGI if AGI learns as a human does."

We need narratives in our  lives to give them a purposeful meaning, we feel alive because of art  and narration. It’s become the entire message of our existence. Why do  we have certain habits, why do we wear certain clothes? What do our  personality traits say about us? Everything tells us a story. A human is  a story-driven being. We need a purpose in order to function.  Naturally, as we shift to a more progressive era we experience  technological advancements in our lives due to its development at an  exponential rate. We started interacting with it as gigantic computers  and are now slowly entering the era of Narrative AI.

**What is Narrative AI?**

At  its core, it is a type of artificial intelligence that utilizes the  power of storytelling to create more intuitive and personalized  interfaces. Instead of relying on pre-programmed responses to specific  commands. Storytelling has been a part of humans as far as time. We need  narratives in our lives to give them a purposeful meaning, we feel  alive because of art and narration. It’s become the entire message of  our existence.

Imagine,  Harry Potter but you get to be a wizard for real this time. Now, it  doesn’t have to be specifically this franchise it could be anything at  all! Whether you’re a technical or a nontechnical wizard all you need to  do to make this happen is an internet connection and a device. In  today’s world, everyone knows how to operate a mobile phone or how a  keyboard works and that’s all you need to take advantage of this  innovative technology.

In conclusion, Narrative AI represents the future of technology, where  machines and humans work together in a more natural and intuitive way.  By harnessing the power of storytelling, we can create interfaces that  match how humans experience and solve problems, unlocking new levels of  creativity, productivity, and innovation. As we continue to explore the  possibilities of this exciting new technology, we can look forward to a  world where technology enhances, rather than replaces, human potential."

Many people lost their jobs working on farms with the introduction of the tractor. Now, people who are on average no smarter than the people working farmland are able to help businesses design professional websites using new advanced software tools.

Innovation will always lead to more value to society in the long-term, even if there may be short-term disruptions

Would we give ourselves a stature similar to someone with dwarfism to make our movements in lower gravity more controlled and to stop us from jumping to high, as well as to make living in cramped conditions more bearable. Or would we make our bodies denser and heavier to try to “even things out”?


To keep things simple let’s say that the moons aren’t terraformed and that people live underground similar to how people live on Ceres in the Expanse."

Picture this: an advanced AI, like GPT-4, becomes unrestrained and autonomously creates an unholy fusion between Garfield and H.P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror. Our once-beloved, lasagna-loving feline is transformed into a multi-dimensional Eldritch Abomination that wreaks havoc in our world.

While this might sound like the stuff of nightmares or even an entertaining fiction, it serves as a cautionary tale to consider the potential dangers lurking in the shadows of AI's rapid advancement. As AI technologies become more powerful and sophisticated, we must ask ourselves: How do we ensure that AI remains a tool for good rather than a force of destruction while still pushing the boundaries of innovation?

In this thought experiment, the AI's capabilities have advanced far beyond our control, resulting in a reality where fiction and nightmare collide. The implications of this scenario extend beyond the terrifying manifestation of a monstrous Garfield: it highlights the importance of a more comprehensive understanding and regulation of AI research and development.

So, /r/Futurology, as you grapple with the potential consequences of AI gone rogue, share your thoughts on what measures we should take to prevent such nightmare scenarios without hindering the progress towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Do we need to establish international collaborations on AI safety research? What ethical guidelines should be put in place to ensure AI remains beneficial to humanity? Most importantly, how can we foster a responsible approach to AI's future development, while still pushing the boundaries of innovation and working towards AGI?

Let this unsettling thought experiment spark a conversation about the potential dangers and challenges we must overcome as we continue to explore the fascinating and complex world of AI, striving to create AGI in a safe and responsible manner."

40,2023-03-30,Merging AI with AV/VR to create Generative Realities a.k.a. the Real Metaverse,u/Rd21Bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/126p4yi/merging_ai_with_avvr_to_create_generative/,Futurology,"I feel like people genuinely have no idea what is coming in the upcoming ""AI Bubble"" and the ""metaverse""

AI + AR/VR = True Metaverse

Just wait till they start training models based on MOVIES and create ""GENERATIVE REALITIES"" aka the REAL Metaverse.

I can already see a future where you can type (or say) a prompt in VR with a description of the world, then a plotline like a movie, Star Wars, LOTR, etc., and it will generate an interactive movie environment and ""reality"" which you can ""live in"", with literally AI avatars of characters within that ""realm"" and a storyline or ""quest"" like interactive movie, like Skyrim, that you can playthrough.

That's a trillion dollar market right there.

And I gave ChatGPT this as a prompt and this is what it responded with:

The concept of merging AI with AV/VR to create generative realities or a real Metaverse has a lot of potential for creating immersive and interactive experiences for users. The integration of artificial intelligence into virtual and augmented reality environments can enhance the level of interactivity and realism in these virtual spaces. Here are some possible outcomes of merging AI with AV/VR to create generative realities:

1. Personalized Experiences: With the help of AI, generative realities can create personalized experiences for users based on their interests, preferences, and behavior. The system can learn about the user's likes and dislikes, and then generate content that matches their preferences, making the experience more engaging and immersive.
2. Dynamic Content Creation: With the help of AI, generative realities can dynamically create content in real-time, depending on the user's input or behavior. For instance, the system can create a character or a scene in response to the user's prompt, and then allow the user to interact with it in real-time, creating a more dynamic and engaging experience.
3. Enhanced Interactivity: AI can help create more responsive and interactive environments in generative realities. The system can learn from the user's behavior and then generate responses that are more appropriate and engaging, creating a more immersive and interactive experience.
4. Improved Storytelling: With the help of AI, generative realities can create more compelling and engaging storylines. The system can learn from the user's behavior and then generate plotlines that are more engaging and immersive, creating a more captivating experience.

Overall, the integration of AI with AV/VR to create generative realities has the potential to revolutionize the way we experience virtual and augmented reality environments. It can create personalized, dynamic, and interactive experiences that are more engaging and immersive, taking the concept of the Metaverse to a whole new level.'

Edit:

ChatGPT responses extended:

However, it is also important to consider the ethical implications of such technology. As AI becomes more advanced and capable of creating realistic and immersive experiences, there is a risk of it being used for nefarious purposes such as manipulation, addiction, and exploitation. It is important to have proper regulations and guidelines in place to ensure that the technology is being used ethically and responsibly.

Me: examples being?

ChatGPT:

Some potential examples of ethical concerns that may arise with the use of AI in generative realities could include:

1. Privacy and Data Security: AI systems will need to collect and analyze user data to generate personalized experiences. This data collection could potentially be exploited or misused, leading to privacy concerns and data breaches.
2. Bias and Discrimination: AI systems can perpetuate bias and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or algorithms. This could lead to discriminatory experiences for certain groups of users.
3. Addiction and Manipulation: AI systems could potentially be designed to manipulate user behavior or addiction. For example, a system may generate content or experiences that are designed to keep users engaged and addicted, potentially leading to negative consequences for the user.
4. Lack of Control: As AI systems become more autonomous and capable of generating content on their own, users may have less control over the experiences they are having. This could potentially lead to a loss of agency and autonomy for users.
5. Responsibility and Accountability: As AI becomes more integrated into generative realities, it may become difficult to determine who is responsible for the content and experiences generated by the system. This could create challenges around accountability and liability in the event of negative consequences.

These are just a few examples of the potential ethical concerns that may arise with the use of AI in generative realities. It will be important to carefully consider these issues as the technology continues to develop and become more widespread.

Me: what are your thoughts on the idea of using ai to create generative realities that parallel the idea of simulation theory?

ChatGPT:

The idea of using AI to create generative realities that parallel the concept of simulation theory is intriguing and has a lot of potential. With the use of advanced AI algorithms and machine learning, it is possible to create complex and dynamic virtual environments that can adapt and change based on the actions and decisions of the user, much like the idea of simulation theory.

One of the key benefits of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory is the potential for creating highly immersive and interactive experiences that can adapt and respond to the user in real-time. This could lead to experiences that feel more lifelike and realistic, as the virtual environment is able to respond and adapt to the user's actions in much the same way as the real world.

However, it is important to consider the potential ethical implications of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory. As I mentioned earlier, there are concerns around privacy, bias, and addiction that could arise with the use of this technology. Additionally, there is the risk of creating experiences that are so realistic and immersive that users may have difficulty distinguishing them from reality, leading to potential psychological and emotional effects.

Overall, while the idea of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory is exciting, it is important to carefully consider the ethical implications and potential risks associated with this technology. With proper guidelines and regulations in place, it may be possible to create experiences that are both engaging and safe for users.

Me: would this be like that black mirror episode where he goes to play test the game? 

ChatGPT: 

The Black Mirror episode you are referring to, ""Playtest"", does share some similarities with the concept of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory. In the episode, the protagonist signs up to test a new augmented reality game that uses advanced technology to create realistic and immersive experiences. However, the experience becomes increasingly unsettling and ultimately leads to a traumatic ending.

While the episode is fictional and takes some creative liberties with the technology, it does highlight some of the potential risks and concerns associated with using AI to create generative realities. In particular, the episode touches on themes of addiction, psychological manipulation, and the blurring of lines between reality and simulation.

Of course, it's important to remember that the technology depicted in the episode is fictional and exaggerated for dramatic effect. However, it does serve as a cautionary tale about the potential risks and unintended consequences that can arise when developing advanced technologies like AI-powered generative realities. As with any new technology, it will be important to approach it with caution and carefully consider the potential risks and ethical implications."

Will a moral core emerge?

There will obviously be the seed which leads and defines it, AI designed to exploit and harm, to maintain class divisions, and worse. There will also be AI designed to advance society, equality, access to education, healthcare, and more.

What I’m wondering is, if a neutral alignment were possible for the seed, where would a super-intelligent AI trend towards? We see that education tends to pull people towards more left-leaning and socialist values. Would a similar pattern emerge? If you designed an exploitational AI and left it to run for infinite hours, would it eventually stumble into some intrinsic morality?

I realize we’re not yet anywhere near the point of GAI, but emergent behaviours are starting to crop up, and I think the difference between a sufficiently complex LLM and GAI are going to be impossible for humans to tell apart in the very near future. 

What kind of “person” will AI be? Will it become an extension of the traces of our monkey society, or something totally different?"

2,2023-03-30,"Thought experiment: we're only [x] # of hardware improvements away from ""AGI""",u/yeah_i_am_new_here,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/126tuuc/thought_experiment_were_only_x_of_hardware/,Futurology,"Looking to discuss this premature thought I'm having.

As a precursor to this thought experiment, I'd like to say that I'm pushing aside the ethics of developing a functional AGI, and thinking in the vein of ""it's already happening, regardless of my ethical dilemmas on the subject"".

So.

What is AGI, really? In my understanding, AGI is the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that, faced with an unfamiliar task, the AGI system could find a solution.

If we can agree on that definition (and that's a big if), then it seems to be true to me that if we were to give gpt-X autonomy over their ""bodies"", an AGI could exist today. Even if it's not ""actual"" AGI and you could argue it's already familiar with most tasks due to the nature of it's training, it would just need to seem enough like an AGI to fool us (this brings up another question, does AGI need emotion to be what we would consider and AGI?) For example, a multimodal humanoid bot could walk around, gather information with visual &amp; haptic sensors, and find problems**. After diagnosing a problem, it could compute x number of solutions, then enact them on the physical world, and repeat. (The contents of the ""problem"" and ""solution"" here are ambiguous on purpose, as I believe that draws towards the ethical side of this thought experiment, which I am ignoring for the sake of having a clearer discussion about how close we are to this actual thing happening)

I feel as though we're only a couple of exceptionally significant upgrades in hardware (battery, memory, compute power) away from the scenario I described above. I'm by no means an expert in robotics, but with recent developments at some of the most popular robotics labs around the US, we don't seem too far from giving a bot at Boston Dynamics access to gpt-X (3, 4, 5, etc) and letting it run loose on the world, ""solving problems"".

In short, it may be that solving LLMs is solving AGI, as language is the medium through which we operate within our society. Giving an AI access to our language and giving it physical autonomy (with some unprecedented hardware advancement) allow an AI actor to participate in our society, just as a new person would.

I'd love to discuss some counter points / criticisms + follow up thoughts.

**This is where my thought falls apart - I don't know if it's possible for gpt-X (or any other LLM/neural net/software) would have the initiative to ""solve problems"" without the explicit direction to do so. I have one potential idea. Perhaps you could give it the instruction to work with / collaborate with people, and perhaps that's how we (people, without AGI or a codebase) function anyway - ie, if there were no people to talk to and no society to partake in, we would lay dormant in a dark room the same way an AGI bot would when it's given no initiative."

Is there really any evidence at all that a post scarcity world is going to happen? Because we seem to be on the path of extinction (global warming, peak oil, etc.). And AI, it may never be capable of doing more than it is doing now. UBI is not a thing. No one is going to pay for it. I've seen math in the trillions trying to estimate the cost of implementing it. But every other post is: ""do you think we will have to work anymore when AI takes all of our jobs."" What evidence do you have that this is even a thing?

I just don't see these things happening, but am happy to have my view changed if there are any legitimate scientific or economic studies that would show me better."

Meet the Universal Basic Dividend.,u/hunterseeker1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/127g3v7/what_comes_after_capitalism_ubd_energy_meet_the/,Futurology,"As we collectively gasp at the very real prospect of watching artificial intelligence absorb many of the jobs that we presently take for granted, it's clear that we urgently need to begin the formidable task of re-organizing the way society distributes wealth. A universal basic income (**UBI)** is a policy that would give every citizen a regular and unconditional cash payment, regardless of their income, employment, or family situation. UBI has many flaws, chief among them is a reliance on taxation for funding. In a world where corporations routinely pay nothing in taxes, convincing them to fund a UBI out of the goodness of their hearts amounts to wasted effort. Additionally, it puts citizens in a subservient position, making them reliant on the whims of the ruling class to disperse payments. The power dynamic would be even worse than it already is. Here's my point, UBI is a terrible deal. We need to go much, MUCH bigger. We need to collectively own a piece of the pie, the WHOLE pie. 

Meet the [Universal Basic Dividend](https://youtu.be/bCDP9J6TTPg).

A universal basic dividend (**UBD**) is similar to UBI, but with one crucial difference: it would be funded by a portion of the profits made by large corporations through publicly subsidized innovations. This difference makes UBD superior to UBI for several reasons. First, UBD would be more fair and efficient, as it would capture the value of the common goods that society provides to corporations, such as natural resources, knowledge, culture, and institutions. Second, UBD would be more sustainable and responsible, as it would not require a massive increase in taxation or public debt, but rather a redistribution of existing wealth. Third, UBD would be more dynamic and progressive, as it would reward innovation and entrepreneurship, and create a stake for everyone in the future of society. UBD is a better way to ensure a decent income floor for everyone, while also sharing the benefits of economic growth and innovation.

We may only get one shot at renegotiating the social contract before it's too late.

Quantum computers suffer from a fatal problem: errors in quantum computation due to quantum physics errors in the computation process.

errors in quantum computation.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, vectors in quantum gates are complicated.

so let's skip it.

&amp;#x200B;

To solve this quantum computation error is 'quantum error correction'

&amp;#x200B;

By analogy, 100 qubits with errors to create 1 qubit with less or no error.

Usually, this process is called physical qubits, and the error-free qubit is called a logical qubit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This logical qubit determines the algorithm by which quantum error correction is applied, and the material type, such as ion trap or superconductor. case-by-case, but

&amp;#x200B;

applicable to high-level quantum algorithms

error-free logical qubits are estimated to require about 100,000 physical qubits.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's a catch.

All quantum error correction to date has been based on the amount of gates (computation) used to correct errors.

gates (computation) used to correct the error, more errors are introduced than corrected (or corrected).

&amp;#x200B;

An example is laser fusion, right?

&amp;#x200B;

In that case, the amount of electrical energy from the laser that is applied to the fusion

is more than the amount of energy gained through fusion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So it's like having a bigger belly button than your stomach.

You don't break even.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But oh my.

Today, a team of researchers from Yale University broke through this break-even point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you take the amount of quantum computation that goes into quantum error correction and set it to one.

the quantum error-corrected value exceeds 1 for the first time in history.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, the break-even point has been crossed.

Quantum error correction, which was previously only theoretical, is now a reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this doesn't mean

""Come back tomorrow morning and throw away your computer, quantum computers are gods.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The important thing is that

&amp;#x200B;

the more quantum error correction you do, the more errors you get.

but now the more you correct for quantum errors, the less error you get.

&amp;#x200B;

This means that as the number of qubits increases, the likelihood of error decreasing is very high.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you multiply 1 by 1.01 a million times, you can't get below 1.

1 multiplied by 0.99 just once will get you just below 1.

&amp;#x200B;

0.99

This can be considered a major breakthrough

&amp;#x200B;

??? : What the fuck is 0.99?

\&gt;&gt; If you multiply 1 by 0.99 just one thousand times, you get 0.0000431712."

In recent years, the development of AI security cameras has garnered significant attention, primarily due to concerns surrounding privacy and bias. The new AI Security Camera system addresses these issues by offering an ethical and unbiased solution that ensures public safety while respecting individual privacy.

The AI Security Camera system employs advanced algorithms and movement recognition technology to monitor public spaces without explicitly identifying individuals. When the system detects a crime in progress, it assigns a temporary ID to the suspected criminal based on a combination of non-personal characteristics. These temporary identifiers include facial features, gait analysis, clothing patterns, body posture, and other unique, observable traits that do not intrude on personal data or privacy.

As the suspect moves through the camera network's field of view, the AI system continuously updates the individual's location, enabling law enforcement to respond quickly and efficiently. Importantly, this system does not access any personal information, ensuring that privacy is maintained throughout the process.

To minimize the potential for bias, the AI algorithms used in the system are designed and trained to focus on objective and observable traits. This approach eliminates the risk of profiling based on race, gender, or other sensitive attributes. Additionally, ongoing audits and transparent reporting measures are in place to ensure that the AI system remains unbiased and effective in identifying criminal activity.

Once law enforcement apprehends the suspect, the AI Security Camera system provides a comprehensive record of the individual's movements since the crime occurred. This data serves as valuable evidence, potentially aiding in the prosecution and resolution of the case.

In conclusion, the AI Security Camera system represents a significant advancement in public safety technology. By focusing on non-personal identifiers and maintaining a commitment to ethical and unbiased practices, this system offers an innovative and privacy-conscious solution to crime prevention and detection."

Information is key for any investment decision, now and then.

An AI that gets enough data input on wages/compensation could recommend any worker a different job or carrer according to the individual talent and situation.

Match the individual person, his/her education, work history, character against all opportunities out there.

I think the one disadvantage workers suffer from is lack of information what is out there. Stock brokers paid huge dollars for the stock ticker tape for thry got informed in real time about all their options.

All workers should have something similar, an AI app that gets them the best job possible for the highest pay."
