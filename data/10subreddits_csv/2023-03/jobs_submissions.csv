Recently was told only can work from ""home"" this was after notifying his boss that he intended to travel to take care of family in another state for a few days. 

Is this legal? (New York State)

Thanks for all the feedback. Looks like he's getting managed out. This is just a way to turn more screws. 

His manager will travel and work from all over.

1,2023-02-28,"Does anyone else have a team that essentially only works from home, leaving you in the office to take more on?",u/PsyduckAF,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11eosft/does_anyone_else_have_a_team_that_essentially/,jobs,"I'm in an IT department in a role that, for a lot of it, can be completed remotely. But there's a really large portion of it that requires being in the building.

Since Covid ""ended"", most staff have been coming back into the building 3-5 days a week (I come in 4 days a week myself). This is so I can support users and the IT help desk with any issues and questions, and to just really have a presence on site and stay aware of the happenings inside the building.

The others in my department have for the most part stayed working from home essentially every day, only coming in maybe once every couple of weeks (if that).

This has meant that all my project work is impacted because I've become the only escalation point at work, when normally it'd be my team. I barely speak to my team now, where normally I'd be able to swing my chair around and get advice on something, see what they're working on, and just generally be far more collaborative than it is right now.

They all have kids (I don't) and live further away from the building than I do, so I feel a bit guilty about bringing it up. But I feel like my progress at work has flatlinwd and started regressing because there's no ad-hoc team chats or support like there used to be.

Is this just the way the world is now? Is having kids and living further away justification for never coming in? Or am I being a little entitled?"

2,2023-02-28,Should I argue for a work laptop?,u/LovelyPeppercorn,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11eoufa/should_i_argue_for_a_work_laptop/,jobs,"Some background: I work in electronic healthcare, and I have to look at private health information daily.

When I was hired for this job, nobody in my company was provided a work laptop - myself included. While this is a massive red flag given that we're dealing with patient health info, I needed the job.

I mentioned to my boss that I would like a work laptop both for safety reasons, and because my personal laptop was dying. After some back and forth, I was eventually just.. given some money to buy another laptop. Not a work laptop with any work software, just any old laptop I wanted. However, this money was not 'labelled' in my contract as money for a laptop, so I ended up not spending it.

Fast forward to today, and my personal laptop is truly dying - the screen is intermittently freezing, etc. While I could buy another personal laptop and use it for work, it occurs to me that this might be a good opportunity to petition for a true work laptop - one that I don't use discord on, play games on, get viruses on, etc. That said, I know I will get pushback if I do so.

So this leads me to my question - should I just bite the bullet and get another personal laptop that I use for work, or do you think I should start an argument about getting me a true work laptop, as I have consistent access to patient health info?"
2,2023-02-28,I took a year off to travel now I can’t find any work. What am I doing wrong?,u/_TYFSM,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11eov29/i_took_a_year_off_to_travel_now_i_cant_find_any/,jobs,"I was laid off from my medical device sales role in September of 2021 and tried to look for work immediately after. I kept applying/interviewing for about 2 months. 

At the time I couldn’t find anything that paid well enough or anywhere near what I was making at my last job so I decided to take a year off and travel since I’ve always wanted to do that and I had a good chunk of money saved up in the bank. I also had zero bills (no rent/mortgage, car payment, loans, etc…) so I figured why not. I’m young in my 20’s with no responsibilities so there’s no better time to do it than now.

During 2022 I traveled all over the US to camp, hike, and mountain bike. I worked extensively on my photography business and landed a few big contracts that year for commercial work. I also got more involved with the car community. I used my knowledge of the places I traveled to and became an organizer for rally events where exotic car owners take their cars through beautiful mountain roads to drive, do sight-seeing, and attend organized track events. Me and a couple of friends would take groups of 15-20 cars on those trips and organize everything (routes, lodging, gas and food stops, etc.)

Anyways NOW… I’m trying to get a job in medical or software sales and I can’t even get a phone interview. I’ve been applying for 2-3 months and I either never hear anything back or get an email the next day saying that they chose to move forward and pursue other applicants at this time.

I’m starting to think it’s because of the gap in my resume… the last job I have listed on there is my previous sales role that I left in September of 2021. 

What should I do? I’m starting to get desperate… I have a college degree and 5+ years of sales experience yet I keep getting rejected. I don’t get it. Like not even a phone interview?"

I will be graduating from undergrad this May with a bachelors in political science with a specialization in pre-law, and a minor in history.

I plan to take a year off and work, and simultaneously study to up my LSAT score to then enroll either full or part time in graduate/law school depending upon the job that I have in the next year. With that in mind, is it worth it for me to apply for a “permanent” job, or just try to patch it together until my education is fully played out? Is now too early to submit applications?

I looked up the club and quickly realized it just isn’t something I’m interested in. There’s about 9-10 people who attend regularly, the guest speakers are borderline MLM, and while this shouldn’t matter, none of the people in this group are even remotely my age or in the same field as me. If it even kind of aligned with my career I would maybe consider it, but giving up a weeknight to hang out with 10 strangers at a wine and paint doesn’t really benefit me.

My boss brought it up today and I didn’t quite give him an answer. The only silver lining was that I was being recognized for my leadership ( I had recently spearheaded several major projects that went well.)But I later found out another woman who started about two weeks ago in the same role as mine was also invited so at this point I feel like I’m just helping them check off a diversity &amp; inclusion box. 

Is there a graceful way to decline their offer? I’m afraid if I say no, it will make me look bad compared to the new hire. But on the other hand, this just seems like a big waste of time. And while I don’t feel comfortable saying this to my boss, I lost two loved ones recently and I want to use my weeknights to spend as much time with my remaining family as I can. 

TL;DR I was volunteered to represent my company at a small local ‘women’s networking’ club that doesn’t relate to my field in any way. However, I’m not sure if it’s smart to decline, especially after learning that my coworker was invited to attend as well.

Edit: I know this is probably the wrong way to look at it but I also want to be recognized as a leader, not a ‘woman leader.’"

First, they said they found my resume on Careerbuilder which is not true as I do not have an account on that site and I took my resumes down from Indeed and Linkedin a week ago. They could have gotten my resume elsewhere when I did have it public, but he said Careerbuilder. So that is a little weird. Second, my education and work background is that of science and this job they wanted me for is marketing. It does not make sense that one in business would want to recruit someone in the science or technical field for marketing or sales. I even told the person on the phone that I have no business or marketing skill, just maybe a pipe dream of being CEO of Disney one day but that's it. But still, he insisted that I would a good fit as they liked my resume. That does not make sense at all. But either way I still promised to come to the Zoom meet tomorrow morning. What should I do?

I graduated college in December with a degree in a field I don’t really see myself in any longer, but finished the program because I was almost done and thought any degree was better than no degree.

I was recently accepted into a free, year long coding program (it’s called LaunchCode if you want to look it up). I really enjoy coding and it was one of the areas I considered before choosing my major, but I ultimately didn’t pursue it.

In the future I’d like a job doing something with web design and/or digital marketing, but I don’t want to tell potential employers that because they will think that I’ll leave them as soon as I find work in my desired field.

Every interviewer asks me why I am interested in part-time work and I’ve been mostly honest and told them I’m taking coding classes because I had an opportunity to do so for free, and it’s something I’ve always been interested in. 

I’m worried maybe I’m being *too* honest. Would something like “I’m caring for family” (which is also true) be a better response?"

Also open to WFH/hybrid positions and office jobs that could use the skills that i’ve developed working in childcare (conflict resolution, in depth written and verbal communication, intense multitasking, etc)."

A Fortune 500 company reached out to me, interviewed me, and 4 hours later offered me the job right out of the gate. It's more money than my wife and I have ever made COMBINED, which is great, because she's going back to school. It's been crazy, but hard work does reward you.

I feel though as a boss, its not ethical, if i were a boss and i did  not like an employee not based on their performance but behavior's,  last thing i would do is make it obvious and especially in front of other colleagues.

How much time do you give a job and decide that it is not for you?,u/Thegalaxychaos,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ev4ny/how_much_prep_do_i_need_before_i_leave_a_job_how/,jobs,"I recently graduated bachelors with 2 degrees, and currently I work at an healthcare agency that does not really have anything to do with my degree. I had some experience elsewhere, different part time here and there, and an roughly 8 month internship during my college days. Now its been just over 1 year of my work here at this agency, I have been rethinking and realizing that I should probably plan to leave.

Now I did not make the decision on a whim, as I have given thought to the idea almost 1 month in the job, but I decided to tough it out as a challenge to myself since the job pretty much is the direct opposite to my entire existent, the job being stressful and extremely detail orientated, not much upward mobility, and not much pay for my degrees that I have, less than 45k per year. I have exercised and trained some of my Microsoft skills, and some decent management skills. From what I learn from most of my friends and peers, and some digging on my own position, I am getting paid less compared to the same position in different agencies, so I believe it could be justified to leave the job. There are also some work from home changes since I joined the company, so the job is a lot less enticing for me. There are also rumors of more work from home changes in a few months.

I also have some plans to travel to meet some family and friends by the end of the year. So I want to eventually quit the job anyways, just somewhere within this year. I am also thinking of perhaps another step on the education ladder to masters eventually, just not within the year.

I don't know how much I need to keep in my bank accounts and what I need to know before leaving a job. Since most of my other jobs I pretty much left due to time limits, what do I need to do to leave the job properly? What do I need to write to quit, to my manager or to the HR? How much money should I have in place to prep to leave? Should I start my job searches and look for a temporary place holder job if I get a good offer? Do I try to keep in touch with my colleagues? Is there anything I should know or do before I leave?"

This could be coordinating, scheduling, creating purchase orders, consulting with vendors and stuff like that. A couple months ago, Jessica’s boss (we’ll call him Tom) scheduled a meeting and this was basically the spiel:

He says Jessica is overwhelmed with her responsibilities and would now like to give me half of her responsibilities so that she can focus on the other. And in turn I would no longer report to Jessica and would report to Tom. 

I was assisting Jessica with all this before, but now I would be fully responsible for them rather than just assisting Jessica with them. 

When Tom first brought this up to me I asked if this meant a title change and he said “eventually..” Then I asked if he viewed this as a permanent change or a temporary change and his response was “ask me again in three months.” It’s been about three months and I’m thinking of asking for a title change and raise.

Do you think that would constitute a raise? I keep going back and forth because my day to day is essentially the same with some added tasks. But I am also feeling like I have bigger responsibilities now which should mean a raise?

How would I even go about asking for a raise in this case? I looked at my old description and it’s basically the same other than I’m no longer assisting and am now leading the projects."

Would like to know your personal experiences.

What did you do? 

Did you give contact numbers of your friends instead and pretend they were your clients or previous employers?

Did you pay someone to answer the calls of these background checkers?

And rant: I actually hate how background check companies work. I can be more considerate if they do their job by actually investigating without the need to bother, but no. They are lazy. They just ask you to send all the documents you have, ask stupid and repeated questions that are already in the documents and then use your data to earn and make their businesses from hiring companies."

3,2023-03-01,"I'm 30 with an MA in Asian Studies and an advanced level of Japanese, but I can't find a job due to no entry-level experience. Considering being a high school Japanese teacher out of desperation. Feeling lost and depressed.",u/Crimson_Dragon01,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11eymp3/im_30_with_an_ma_in_asian_studies_and_an_advanced/,jobs,"Sorry this is super long, but I really needed to get this all off.

As I said in the title, I'm 30 with a BA and MA in Asian Studies and an advanced level of Japanese, but I can't find a job due to no entry-level experience.  I chose to study Asian Studies and Japanese because I became interested in Japan in high school and I was told that Asian Studies was a great major since it could be applied to a variety of fields, such as business, government, the FBI/CIA, etc. I had hoped to get into business where I could use my Japanese language skills and cultural knowledge to do international communications and travel to Japan for business.

After graduating, I moved to Japan where I taught English for four years. I didn't want to be a teacher. It was just a means to experience Japan at a deeper level and improve my Japanese skills. I enjoyed teaching there for what it was and did pretty well with it as I made significant improvements to my school's English teaching system. However, the industry is terrible and foreign English teachers basically live paycheck to paycheck. Without having a near-native level of Japanese, job options besides teaching English are extremely limited there. Because of this, I moved back to the US last year as I felt it was time to get a real career started. I miss Japan terribly though.  


Now, I've been job searching for over half a year, and I can't find a job, which is making me very depressed.  I managed to get three interviews for jobs I would have loved. I made it to the second round in an interview for my dream job at a major gaming company, but it didn't work out. Unfortunately, I've come to realize that while my background can be useful, it's too specific to solely rely on to find a job. My Japanese is around advanced level, but that's still far stretch from being fluent, so I don't qualify for fully bilingual positions. There are very few jobs (at least at the moment) that need someone with that kind of background, so I've given up on finding anything Japan-related and am searching for any decent job just to get my foot in the door and start and actual career path. I've applied to numerous jobs that I know I could quickly learn and do if given the chance, but I haven't gotten a single interview because even entry-level jobs are looking for specific skills and experience. I don't even qualify for administrative assistant positions. The only one interview I got was because my dad's acquaintance gave my resume to their company's recruiter and it was for an inside sales position. My Japanese skills and knowledge of Japan are a great supplementary skillset, but I lack any primary skills to land a job. I'm at a total loss at what to do now.

I reached out to my Japanese professor and his suggestion was to become a high school Japanese teacher since I meet the requirements and it offers good job security and lifetime benefits in my state (which certainly sounds nice). He also suggested going for an Ed.D, but I don't want to take out more student loans. My parents and fiancée think I would be a great teacher, but I really don't want to teach as a career, especially in K-12. I always said if I ever wanted to teach, I would get a Ph.D and become college professor. I think I could enjoy teaching college. But even if I went that route, I would still need a full-time job while I was going for a Ph.D, and the starting salary for a college professor is just way too low to justify it at this point in my life. Despite all this, I'm considering going the teaching route because I'm so lost right now. I just don't know what else to do or what I can even do.  Teaching offers a much better salary compared to most of the entry-level jobs I've looked at, so I guess I could teach for a year while I continue to search for other options. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm thinking of already leaving. So much so that I just finished a final interview and am waiting for an offer that would be 160k. I currently make 137k.

So I'm still hesitant to leave my current job. It's a job I wanted my whole life. It's working with someone I looked up to my entire life. I took a 7k salary loss to accept this job. It's been rough though. I'm not living up to the expectations of the role. I have 10 years of expense but because everyone else has 15 to 30 years I'm never listened to. I can barely get a word in. I constantly feel like I'm letting the team down. 

My manager asked when I joined to not just quit but instead give plenty of warning. They've had a good bit of turn over in the role and they wanted to be given a chance to fix it. I've sheepishly brought problems with the culture up and how I feel like I can't really contribute because I'm drowned out. They said they follow the strong opinions, weakly held approach. This doesn't work for me and I feel like it creates a culture of adversary instead of cooperation.

So the job I'm waiting on an offer for should be 160k. Might be 150k. The c level person I'd be under seems a lot like me, let's call them Bob. The company is saying we need another Bob. You seem to be exactly like Bob. You'd be a great fit. While that sounds great and they also have a financial backer already for the project I'd be on. They also keep saying that finding these backers are hard. I have a meeting with the CEO scheduled to get my offer.

Do I take the offer? Do I give time to my current manager to fix the culture, which has slowly gotten better over time.

Current place

Pros:

 * Dream job.
 * Excellent pto and sick day policy written down.
 * Working on an interesting project.
 * I get vested stock.
 * I'm working on things I've never done before and all rapidly growing my knowledge.

Cons:

 * constantly feel like a failure.
 * Health insurance is 300 dollars more than other place.
 * Might get fired anyways.
 * Company has been kind of rocky after 7 leads and executives left last year. All in my project.
 * Company might be bought out.
 * Linkedin says median tenure is 1.8 years.

New place

Pros:

 * Better timezones, I work remotely.
 * Seems like more upward momentum.
 * Higher pay, my budget can breathe again.
 * Better and cheaper healthcare.
 * I'm working on things I've done successfully before.
 * Median tenure on LinkedIn is 5 years.

Cons:

 * Leaving a job under our around a year labels me as a job hopper.
 * I am afraid of change. The evil you know and all that.
 * I might also not meet this jobs expectations if I couldn't meet the last one. Although I do have 10 years experience."

Like if she needed my attention, instead of tapping my shoulder, she'd slap the table in front of me. The times she started a conversation with me, it'd be about a mark on my face from acne and if someone hit me, or that I was weird for not having Netflix.

Anyways, as I came into the breakroom after coming into work and went to go sit down to wait for my clock in time, she had tried to remove my chair from out under me so I could fall, thankfully I caught the chair and sat down. Afterwards, she said ""What would you have done had I got that chair fully from underneath you?"" and I did respond to her I'd be pretty mad and would've likely hit her, and that she should quit it, whilst that wasn't an appropriate response, in my defense, I'm not instigating the event.

I guess she didn't like that response and came up behind me and put me in a chokehold, to which I pushed her off and left the breakroom. After I came back in, she was in there and told me to ""Put my hands up."" and made a motion to punch at me to which I kicked at her. 

Because of our probationary period, management had determined that me kicking at her was grounds for having to let me go.

So for future employers, how would my account appear and would it be understandable? How should I address the circumstance in a professional way?

Edit: Make constructive criticism. Simply saying it's childish behavior doesn't excuse the fact that I got assaulted, maybe your workplace conditions are safe, doesn't mean mine was."

Here's my story.


I graduated this last December from my state university with my Bachelor's in Information Technology. I chose the degree program I did because I'm severely asthmatic and immune compromised so I have a hard time getting around. I wanted a field that would for sure allow me to work remotely to keep myself safe and still be productive in society while not risking my health. My particular degree program was not what I expected to get out of my education. The program was part of the College of Business, and I learned much more about business than I actually did about tech, the majority of the courses being from the former area rather than the latter. I am woefully underqualified to work many IT positions despite trying to teach myself more material on the side while I job search.


And the job search hasn't gone well. I haven't been able to so much as land an interview because I lack work experience. I was a full time student in college and was encouraged by family to focus soely on education, advice which I regret following now. Because my IT degree was so business focused though, I have been thinking about pivoting into a insurance underwriting career instead or something adjacent, and I want to know how I ought to go about doing that if that's what I decide to do. My step mother does it for a living and makes quite good money, and works from home. I know next to nothing about insurance as of right now, but I have a talent for memorization and know my way around computer software.


Here are some things I'd like to know along with any other relevant advice or direction you might be able to give:

-Average day for an underwriter? What practical, technical and soft skills are crucial?

-Is my degree compatible? If not, can I use it to my advantage in any way? Do I need other qualifications/certifications? If so how much of a time/$ investment is it?

-What sorts of positions should I look for? Any advice for the job search, keywords to keep in mind?

-If I am not experienced enough for an entry level position, how do I get there?

-What types of underwriters are there? How would you go about deciding which to pursue?


For anyone that takes the time to read this and share your knowledge, thank you sincerely."

I get that, and for every job I’ve had, I’ve had to sift through a series of interviews for other jobs until I finally got a job. This time I just feel so exhausted 

I get few job interviews, and the interviews that I have gotten haven’t turned into an offer. For a really good job, I most recently had 3 rounds of interviews + a written assignment and did not get the job. Before that, I had a phone screen for a promising job and did not receive a phone call. I followed up numerous times and received an email a week later that they’d gone with another candidate. Before that, I completed two rounds of interviews for a job and didn’t get it. 

I know that compared to some people, this isn’t a lot of interviews. For me personally, I’m exhausted. I’m exhausted by the job search &amp; exhausted by my toxic full time job

And i'm not cutting it, no matter how much I try my efforts are mostly useless.

I'm just not good it seems, I lack basic social and organisation skills. 

My manager told me 6 month ago that I was unable to listen to advice and correctly take notes and that I had a 3D modeling level way under their expectation when they recruited me (and it's my biggest skill).

And so i've tried to go above and beyound to correct that, tried to be even overly carefull about everything...

Well that was way less than enough, m'y manager actually told me that there isn't actually an observable difference. I did not improve in the slightest. Well I did somewhat, now I finally have the 3D modeling skills they expected me to have back when they hired me. 

And they're expectations is ""student first real worklife experience"" level. And I am far from able to meet even that. 

So basically if they had know they would have never hired me and i'm lucky they can't fire me now. 
Yet I'm trying, truly ! And they know I am and it seems to be the only good thing they have to say about me. 

So even if I finish my college degree they won't continue my contract after that, thoo it's even unlikely that I manage to finish college.

I have a ship building HND which technically would allow me to become a ship building technician but those skills that i'm unable to develop are required in any types of jobs, all job offerts demands them. So I don't know what to do... I feel like i'll just drop out never find a job or get fired as soon as I find one and... Well I don't know zfter that, i'm scared."

I'm somewhat shitting myself applying to all these jobs and I cant help but feel empty and scared at the near yet so uncertain future. I've been applying to a bunch of internships and entry level positions that correlate to my degree (pr, marketing, publishing, social media and such) but I hate it. I hate it so much, I just cannot work as a pawn for the exposure or financial gain of some BS influencer or talentless artist. 

I have ADHD and whilst its not impossible to get shit done its certainly tougher for me. especially when it comes to corporate office work, excel sheets, emails etc. im not the best with deadlines plus translating thoughts into words is not my strongest point. I recently noticed that I have a gift, something which I was always told was a bad personality trait turned out to actually be a skill of mine.

I'm very good at observing, questioning, (pondering?) I guess i'm the curious type. By nature, once I get a grasp of whats in front of me (whether that be understanding how code works, comprehending a specific system, or analyzing a certain set of functions) my mind instantly search for faults or 'problems' lets say, about whatever im involved in. Its instantly ""*How can this (product/service) be better?""* This is not to say there's faults in everything*- its more of a 'theres always room for improvement' type of mentality.*  I always find myself asking questions like 

'can a child understand this if they read it thrice?' or 'how can this be more suitable for a blind person?'  for example.

I hate the idea of having to turn up to a 9-5 cubicle job for the forseeable future. I guess I want a unconventional job, one that has less restrictions on setting and the actual work that gets done- it CANT be repetitive (i dont mind doing reports but I cant be doing the same patterned thing on a daily basis). I guess what I'm asking at this point is what career path best suits me? Im 21 with no job history but a few parttime hospitality gigs, I did graduate with the IB cerificate in 2019 and Im about to graduate with a BA in Media @ Uni level. 

Im the curious type, i love asking questions, giving input and receiving criticism as well as outsider opinions. Could I go down the consultancy route? A few friends told me I'd make a quality auditor or something that involves observation and feedback ... one person told me that I'd make an awesome investigator the way I  point things out and observe differently from most people.  I really dont know where to start looking or even searching for a job that 'requires thinking' in a way that I weirdly enjoy. 

Absolutely ANY advice or pointers would go a long way... im tired of not knowing what I want because nothing appeals me (or at least thats all I know?) idk... but thanks for hearing me out💜🤝"

I wanted to see if anyone here has experience with applying or working with Archslate. They're advertised as a talent marketplace and I recently applied for a job through them.

1). Who would be working and sending out emails at around 2:00 am in the morning?

2). The email states I've been selected as a finalist for the position, but I've never had anyone reach out to me before nor have I been to any interviews yet.

3). Their email goes on to say that they would like to schedule an interview with me, but then they ask me to go to a page and submit my resume, etc. to them when I had already submitted my resume.

4). The link takes me to an Archslate page with the ""job application"" but mentions nothing about an interview. Are they trying to trick me into giving them this information again without the guarantee of an interview as stated from their email?

I don't know about the legitimacy of Archslate, but their email sure looks shady to me. Do you think that this is a legitimate offer or is this a scam?

I didn’t even get volunteer work or try to get another kind of education after graduating in 2012 til 2019 when I got a volunteer job.  Stopped only six months later because of the pandemic.  After graduating from college, I was still living with my parents and I guessed I was feeling pretty lazy because I was so comfortable where I was.  I was being financially supported and I was never pushed to live independently.  I’ve dealt with mental issues, I guess.  Anyway, I was just so comfortable where I was so I didn’t do anything to mess that up.

Now, my father died right before COVID and it just put so many things in perspective especially how I’ve messed up by putting off so many things for so long.  I may have been encouraged to do things in order to “grow up“ but never really took action.  I just did whatever made me comfortable.  Being comfortable and happy in my life has always been the most important thing to me in the world.

Now, I want to have a place of my own but what does anyone need for that?  Money, of course!  So now, I‘ve reached to the point where I need to “grow up,” right?  I’m trying to get my life together now and it’s been tough but at least I’m taking action, which is not some thing I could say about myself over 3 years.

Ok enough about me personally.  Anyway, I’ve already been applying for jobs through [indeed.com](https://indeed.com).  So far, no luck and a few application rejects.  My resume is submitted but people wonder what I’ve been doing since graduating in 2012 and my answer is ”nothing“.  Nothing but being on my computer, watching tv and playing video games like a kid only because I was comfortable!  Although I did something that seems valuable from 2007 til 2018 (my dad got sick in 2018) but I don’t know how to explain it.

In 2007, I just made an old profile at myspace (remember that?  Makes me feel nostalgic! lol) and just added some people.  There were random people posting requests to share something like when kids went missing or when dogs and cats in shelters needed homes.  I liked doing that so I created a facebook page pretty much doing the same thing then got interested in just helping people, being aware of social issues and helping others do the same.  helping people be aware of how they can help others in crisis and not be selfish and more loving and understanding of others.  I've also researched on why those social issues are happening and how to resolve them the best we can like homelessness, better education or saving the environment.  Then I ended up writing up whatever information I found and put them on Google blogs or pages.  

The issue is I didn't make anyone in my family or friends aware of this.  I wasn't sure how they'd feel about this and right now, I no longer do those and those pages are gone.  I didn't feel successful in this because people who did follow me on those social media pages didn't seem interested enough or probably thought I was crazy for wanting to be this extreme in order to improve humanity.  So how do I explain this in a resume?  I want to do something for the greater good.  I just want everyone to be happy and comfortable, make Earth a better place and if it's not or people aren't happy or comfortable, I like to study why and how to fix that.  That's why I'm so interested in psychology and sociology and wonder why this or that happens and how people react to those things and why.  I mean, after this pandemic, don't we deserve better?  

So after reading the last 2 paragraphs (if you made it this far, thank you for sticking with me!), I just don't know what exactly I'm looking for and what's best for me.  Sure, I can work to treat illnesses, work to make kids safe in school or pick up litter at a park. But that's not enough!  Why can't we prevent gun violence or work on why it's happening like addressing mental illnesses or social conflicts all the government wants to do is make background checks even tougher?  Why can't we study human behavior to understand why people refuse to recycle and just throw stuff on the ground and do something about it?  Why can't we work together to stop illnesses that affect family dynamics dementia or cancer?  I think it all starts with love, compassion, empathy, understanding and listening without judgement and paying that forward as far as we can!  How do I fix that in my resume even though I wasn't getting paid or under some kind of supervision?  How do I explain this to employers or somewhere in general while trying to seek a job?"

I do **feel** like they are just stringing me along in hopes that I eventually decline their interview. I'm honestly  fed up at this point, I even took the time  during the last couple of days in preparation for this interview. I would love to know your guys opinions as well.

Background: I had first-round interview and they said they would get back to me. They did not get back to me and I texted the recruiter regarding my status. The recruiter then got back to me quickly and  gave me a date for the 2nd round interview. By the quickness of the recruiter response I thought I was still a candidate of interest.

When that date came for second-round interview, I then received an email from the employer saying they needed to reschedule for the next day. The following day I received the same email again. Now today which I thought for sure (after rescheduling my interview twice) the employer would have an interview with me, but then I received the same email again saying that they need to reschedule for tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your guys thoughts? I honestly feel like I'm being stringed along. I am also fed up because I could have been doing other productive things the last couple of days."

I am one of the more tenured employee compared to everyone else (5 years with the company) and I make close to around $32/hour. Yes I know it’s more than most retail jobs, however, I have recently grown bored of this role and have come to notice that there is no advancement, besides management. I can either go for management and deal with more lousy and annoying customers or stay in my roofed off position. 

I have a Bachelors Degree in Communications / PR, however, after I graduated I realized that  entry jobs in that industries in my city were less than what I was currently making. 

It has come to the point where I dread my job, I don’t care about customers anymore, and their negative mindset just increases my anxiety and dislike for customers. I would like to transition into a more “corporate” atmosphere but I don’t even know where to search or how to even begin… 

My current job does not entail selling, instead it’s troubleshooting and fixing software problems. What should I type into LinkedIn / Indeed to get job results that is more close to what I am looking for?

1,2023-03-01,Feeling trapped at work...working for my best friend,u/Ooni1128,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11f9ocs/feeling_trapped_at_workworking_for_my_best_friend/,jobs,"Hey guys - I'm in a pickle and not sure what to do about it. Apologies for the rant, Just need to vent cause I'm just lost.

I work at a company that my childhood best friend owns with his brother (also very good friend of mine)...most of the core people that started the company are family members of the owners and/or close friends but have since grown to about 25 employees. The company has expanded to the US (we're Canadian) and business is going extremely well.

Quick background...I started in 2017, but left in Feb 2019 due to a bit of a falling out...Even though I kinda got screwed, I'm a nice guy and a good friend, so I gave them 3 months notice...hired a replacement and left amicably. It was definitely a weird period, cause they knew I was leaving...but I was still doing my best. I left for another job, and after 4 months, realized it wasn't what was advertised so since I was still in touch with my buddies and hung out on the weekends, we ended up finding a role that worked much better for me and I ultimately came back in about June 2019 and made a solemn vow to never leave again... I've been here since, and have helped the company grow from 5 employees to the 25 we have today. I am personally responsible for about 13 employees and am in a management role, overseeing staff...the thing is...i absolutely hate my life lol.

In the past few years, we've had SO many conversations about growing the company, talking about our dreams to take this thing to the next level, eventually selling the company and everyone getting a huge cheque (nothing on paper obvs)...but secretly I'm so unhappy. The job has become repetitive, my actions are questioned as if I'm an employee, but they do this thing where they tell the core people that ""we're all owners""....everyone buys it....i'm paid decently well and haven't had issues with payment, but there are people who work at this company that do jobs of less value, but get paid way more (they are directly related to the owner)...this sort of irks me.

I can confidently say, this company would be nowhere without me. I've made changes, created departments, created jobs, processes that nobody here would have been able to come up with or pull off.

I've always been the type of guy who...wakes up early, works out, reads, study things i'm interested in, eating clean and energetic...I'm a hustler, a visionary...I'm hungry for success... But the last 6 months...I've gotten to the point where, I have 0 motivation to do anything, i'm always tired, lazy, procrastinating, the spark is completely gone, I'm eating sooo poorly. I want to lay in bed all day, I dread working...it feels like I'm living the life, I was trying to escape by coming here in the first place.

The big issue is, the owner who is my best friend, has literally 0 empathy and frankly, really only cares about the business and not so much the people that work there (although he will constantly say otherwise). I love the guy, but he can't possibly fathom that someone isn't as happy as he is since he ""pays us so much""...it's not that much lol.. The company has gotten much larger and richer, and the owners have developed this superiority complex and are basically worshipped by the other people that work here...i guess that's natural for people who have grown a business into a full blown company...but I'm just not buying it. I cant.

This is going to sound arrogant, and I apologize for this but most of the time, I find myself the smartest guy in the room and the fact that I'm constantly surrounded by people who are younger than me, and don't have much to offer in terms of intellectual value, makes me feel really down inside. I don't consider myself a genius, but I feel like I signed up for a role to make my decisions, but I feel that employee/employer dynamic when it's not supposed to be like that.

The owners themselves, have an unbelievable work ethic and are very smart when it comes to their business, but outside of that, I don't feel like I'm growing or learning anything. I've taken what I can from this, but I'm not learning anything. I'm known around here as the ""problem solver"". The guy who thinks outside of the box and implements processes...but I feel like just another employee, and I'm questioned on certain decisions I make. I hate it. The culture in this work environment, is very ""this company is our life"" and it's not something I can accept. 10 hour work days, working after hours is normal, working on the weekend is normal, sick days are not a thing...vacation? HA good one...

Another thing contributing to this, is I've secretly been working on things in my own time for the last 2 years and am confident I can supplement my income, If I just had more time to devote to it. (they have no idea about this). Nobody else here has that level of ambition...they have sold their souls to this place.

My big issue is, I know these guys TOO well, that if I sit down and tell them I'm unhappy, it's going to cause a massive issue. I know this sounds silly, but I know telling them I'm unhappy and that I want to leave won't result in the reaction I want, which is ""man, you're our friend and we're happy for you regardless"" they will see it as the ULTIMATE betrayal and cause a huge fight..It's messy, we're ALL so close (the guys that work there)..our families are close, our moms are best friends, we all hang out on weekends...it's just weird. Furthermore, I know they are completely screwed if I leave and I feel completely guilty for having these thoughts.

I'm unsure on how to tackle this one. In hindsight, working for a friend is bad, yes I'm aware. I just want my life back, but I don't want to jeopardize the friendship.

Reading this back, these guys sound like horrible friends lol, which may be the case. I just have this loyalty to them and don't want to cause any issues. I'm a peace maker and I do enjoy their company (no-pun intended)

I do apologize if I've come off as arrogant...just wanted to be candid to get this all off my chest.

I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.

TL:DR; work for my best friend, I'm unhappy but if I leave, they will see it as a betrayal and will cause a huge mess and screw them over."

The new job I got, I ended up being laid off from after six months due to budget cuts and organizational restructuring at the company (which can easily be explained since I was laid off and had no control over the matter).

 I panicked and quickly got another job after that, which I voluntarily left seven months later due to it being a toxic work environment where I was doing the work of three people and high turnover (I should have done more research and trusted the poor reviews on Glassdoor). 

Which brings me to my current part time position which I took to give myself some downtime to regroup and rethink my career. 

I am now looking for full time work again with benefits, more financial stability, etc. With all of the job hopping as mentioned above, I am afraid and fully aware that I might be a red flag to interviewers. 

Should I remove some of the short stints from my resume? Should I keep my resume as is and just explain my moving around to interviewers? 

I'm just in need of some advice. I've gotten some interviews and calls with recruiters but I've also gotten some rejections."

Our creative team has also grown a fair bit and uses Adobe Suite for most projects. And for context on my position at the company, I manage the post-production team. 

My boss recently asked if there was any benefit to using a teams account instead of an individual account and if it actually boosts collaboration. If not, he wants to cancel the teams subscription and have everyone go back to individual accounts. 

Now, the company would reimburse everyone’s subscription if they submit a reimbursement request every month. The cost for a license under a team account is nearly double the price for an individual  subscription, so if we pay for everyone’s individual accounts, we’d be saving nearly 50% overall. But this just feels a bit weird to me. 

It seems like it would be putting a lot of responsibility on our employees to have to manage the billing for the tools they need for our company. But since we’re paying for it either way, I don’t know how big of a deal it is. 

But we’re also moving away from a start up, and to me a big part of that growth is the company taking ownership of the tools we use to complete our work. 

I’m not sure what the norm is in other companies, and tbh it does seem like Adobe teams is a little over priced compared to an individual account. But either way, my gut tells me we shouldn’t put the stress of managing an adobe account and billing/request reimbursement every month back on our employees after we’ve already switched to a team account. 

Was hoping to get some insight and advice on how to approach this topic with my boss."

However, 2 of the trips scheduled cannot be cancelled without severe consequences (cancellation fees and up to a year's wait to reschedule).  I'm really curious when I should bring this up.

I'm assuming it's not worth mentioning until after being offered the job, but do I bring it up instantly after being offered the job? Do I wait until my first day? A week in?

I assume any employer would want to know ASAP so that they can potentially schedule someone to cover the shifts, but I'm really nervous that if I mention it too soon they might rescind their offer. (Is that at all likely?)"

I work 40 hrs a week and make $15/hr, with a college degree. I honestly just sit here all day, I’m either just given nothing to do or get the most tedious all consuming task thrown at me on a whim. I try to go to the gym consistently and I am a volunteer music teacher on the weekends, plus a relationship. I have pretty much 0 time to myself, all for job that really doesn’t pay me much at all and has me learning 0 skills. Law is really not the field I want to work in, I just needed a job post college. I really want out at this point, I feel like my soul is being sucked out. 

Fortunately, I accepted a job offer with another company recently. It is a salaried position where I’ll be making quite a bit more than $15/hr, much better benefits, is hybrid WFH/in-person, office is much closer to me, and is in a field I find much more interesting and in-line with my career goals. The downside is that this job doesn’t start until August 14th, and I’m currently writing this on March 1st. 

Like I said, I want out of my current job. My mental health is suffering and I feel stuck. I don’t have huge financial obligations as I live with my parents, however I help out with bills and still have expenses in my life. I’m not sure if I should just tough out working here until august or leave and find something temporary in the meantime that will open my schedule up. Feeling a tad lost"

I'm not going to only do 1/13 of the job so I'm offended the pay change is so low. I also compared salaries to competitors before I asked for a 25-30% increase.

I talked to HR and the person's response was kind of empathetic but also telling me that I'm chasing money and this isn't the sector for it (non profit). I'm pretty off-put seeing that my negotiation isn't just about money, but also equity. Do I say anything or just let these comments die. It seems toxic to gaslight people for negotiating.

I have been job searching since September 2022 and I finally got hired at a gymnastics gym for an admin/ front desk position, but it's kind of far from my house AND the pay is a bit low ($17 per hour and there are no benefits. I was told this is because they are a small business and the benefits will be added as the company grows.) At the time, it was the only job interview I had lined up and the only offer on the table, so I accepted the offer. They did tell me that there was room for growth and this position would eventually lead to a management position though. 

I got a call today from a doctor's office to set up an interview for a Patient Services Representative position. The location is significantly closer to my home and it pays $18/hour. The doctor's office job also has benefits. I'm obviously leaning toward the OBGYN job IF I get an offer after the interview, but only because it pays more and not because I would enjoy the job more. I want to try and negotiate for a higher dollar amount per hour to compensate for that, since it's not a job that I'll just **HATE**. For my area, the going rate seems to be anywhere from 18-20 per hour for Patient Services Representatives. I just haven't ever had to negotiate before and I think it's time I finally start to try and negotiate for better terms rather than settling for less just because it's a done deal. I think if all else fails in the negotiations, I at least still have a job that I would like (the gym, even though the compensation is less desirable to start) to fall back on."

I studied computer science following a career change and work as a developer, but I think that I don't really have the profile, the mindset and the strengths... or the interests. I know that experience matters more, but still...

I would still love spending my days creating React websites, adding something new for the end user, working on simple, well-known and well-documented front-end stuff.

However, in every job that I got, I was spending all my time creating Azure projects, modifying pipelines, taking existing code to break it into parts, correcting existing tests, fighting with homemade library/framework that doesn't work as expected, fighting with module bundler, begging for help all the time... (All that in a front-end team)

That, or doing API after API, trying to understand undocumented monstruous .Net projects. Honestly, I would rather avoid doing anything in .Net for the rest of my life.

I'm not good and I don't like all those things. It makes me feel miserable. And I'm not sure that I have enough motivation and interest for that, not to that extent. I used to be praised for my good work, now I feel that I am always falling behind.

Don't take me wrong. I love to learn and grow in some subjects and I do it whenever I can), but I won't spend my evenings leaning more about Docker, pipelines or module bundling... or anything too technical. Moreover, with a newborn and a toddler, I don't have spare time anymore.

So, do you thing I should reconsider my choice of career or are there jobs out there that I could still enjoy?"

I immediately cut him off and told him, that's not a liveable wage if I still have to keep working two jobs to afford my life and the cost of living in this state(FL). I thought that was a pretty f*cked up comment that he said, but at the same time it's almost discouraging.  Are all of the construction companies paying *""average""* pay for most of us who work this crazy hard? 

I don't want to work two jobs anymore in order to afford my life, bills, food, and living costs. This is messed up and upsetting."

Big company, thousands of employees, good benefits, decent pay. I, like the rest of my team, am completely overloaded and overwhelmed. I have about 12 concurrent projects at the moment, all requiring a great deal of time and energy. I often work well over 40 hours per week. And I have one customer that is awful, mean and demanding. They’re killing my mental health. 

I recently was approached by a recruiter and interviewed for a job that I didn’t really care if I got, so I was super relaxed in the interview.  It’s contract to hire, 6 months contract and very likely to become full time after. Company is much smaller, about 800 employees worldwide, and I’d be the only PM for my part of the organization.  The pay is a raise of about 18k, minimal benefits for the first 6 months, no PTO. 

I accepted the job offer last week and called my current boss to put in my 2 weeks notice. My boss is a great guy and is trying to convince me to stay. They’re offering to match the pay increase and move the one problem customer to another PM. 

I have to make a decision by tomorrow. I really don’t know what to do. My current company is well-known and has a lot of opportunity for advancement. But the job is busy and stressful. The new company is an unknown. I don’t have any way of knowing what the culture is like or how stressful the job will be. But, it would allow me to just walk away and leave this mess to someone else."

&amp;#x200B;

I interviewed for a role today where the last round was almost 50 minutes. The manager brought to our attention that we passed the 30 minute mark, yet, said ""I have some time to keep on going if you do?"". I said ""Yes, absolutely"". 20 minutes later, we're still talking.

They went into the role. I was asked a few questions. Then the team structure... then I was asked a few follow up questions... after that, they mentioned long term potential for what this role can turn into.

It was a really great interview. My best one I've had in months. Parts of me is saying ""I've got it"" but the other parts are freaking out and saying I don't. 

The hiring manager mentioned that I can ask them any follow up questions after the interview if I can think of anything... Anytime I've ever gotten this comment, an offer always came the next day. This is why I believe that I might have this opportunity. Why would a hiring manager waste time extending an invitation to continue networking to someone they aren't going to hire?  

They also mentioned they'd get back to my agency by the end of the day; which will be the fastest turnaround process I've ever experienced which means, in a few hours from now I will know... Usually also when I get set time frames, I receive an offer as opposed to ""We'll be in touch"" or ""We'll update you when we get some information""... My agency also asked me if I was looking at other roles. I've gone through them before and was asked similar questions before given a contract offer too. 

I'm trying to distract my mind and find things to do but I can't. Like I said, I *really* need this job.

I believe I was the last candidate they interviewed... part of me thinks ""save the best for last"" but I also don't know if one can deliberate a candidate in enough time seriously for a role even if it is CTH."

I then provided them with 3 references—my prof (I’m a uni student), my old boss at the same company, and one of my bosses at my most recent company. 

For context, I did 3 internships for 3 different companies. The company I recently applied for I also did my second internship at. I have great relationships with the people there and knew they would give me a great review. 

However, the most recent company I worked for was pretty shitty. My direct boss was mean and impatient. While I was there, one or the workers quit due to bad treatment. 10 days after the next student has started after my internship had ended, he went out of his way to find me on LinkedIn and we ended up having an hour long video conversation on how bad the treatment is at this company. 

After all this, I still used someone from this company as a reference. I did good work for this person and couldn’t imagine them having too much negative to say. Well, I was wrong and my job offer was rescinded because of it. 

Do you think sharing any of this with the company I applied for will help my case or should I just move on? I’m a new grad and this role was super exciting for me and they told me it would be mine. I even bought a concert ticket in this new city because that’s the extent of confidence that was instilled in me. I looked on the company website and they recently reuploaded the job role so I know they’re still looking for someone. 

Just feeling sad and honestly kind of bitter right now lol. Thank you in advance."

I did the training course and even got the license, but now I'm having major second thoughts. Everything I hear about the turnover rate and the recruitment/business practices has me a little nervous.  


They gave me the whole ""be your own boss"" pitch and that was a red flag at the time, but I pulled through, thinking I would be able to make a living. I'm not sure I will be able to, though. It's commissions only, and everything I see from former employees implies they don't give you ample leads and make you pay for everything out of pocket.  


I keep seeing bad reviews from former employees, and everyone else in sales I see talking about it seems to have bad things to say about it. Thankfully, I didn't lose my job at the restaurant, but I did have my hours cut back slightly (though, that will change in April).  


I have another training session on Monday, and I'm having major second thoughts. I feel like telling them I can't continue with the training and cutting the lost months of job hunting.

Since then, I have left voicemails for the company's HR department and sent two emails to one of the managers that did the panel interview. I have gotten no response. The final interview I did was with the VP of the company and so I have his email. 

My question is this: would be appropriate to email the VP and ask for an update on the status of the application? It has been nearly a month since I applied, two interviews, and nearly two weeks since I've heard anything.

We have enough people to fill the contract store hours but there is only ever 1 person per shift. Very rarely do shifts intersect where two people are working at the same time. The problem is that, out of everyone working, only I have an 8 hr shift and it falls on our busiest day but because I’m alone no one can really cover for me when I go on break so I don’t get to go on break at all for all of those 8 hrs. 


Part of the reason I applied for this job is because I have back problems and can’t stand that long so part-time would’ve been perfect and even with an 8hr shift I figured it would be fine with small breaks in between.  Which I expected from an international multi-billion company even though my state law does not require breaks. To note during my training I had to work closely with my manager and he worked 6-8hrs during that time and he asked me to cover for him while he went on breaks. So I think we are entitled to it. It’s also come to my attention that because one of my manager’s main tasks was filling the shifts, so before I was hired he worked my shifts and now he’s off on those days. He must’ve hired me to fill the busiest day which is fine but he never mentioned anything about not having breaks during the interview process. 


So since he’s worked my hours, he knows what it’s like on busy days and to not get any breaks. Would it possibly offend him or endanger my job if I asked to bring a folding stool to sit on for a few minutes every 3-4 hours or so? Of course if customer’s are around I won’t use it."

We have asked everyday if they knew for sure yet and they give us all the run around. They say they have to look into it. We have been asked to fill out the same paperwork we signed twice before. I work 8-5 but with travel it’s more like 7-6pm. Last week there was so many technical issues all we did was sit around getting to know each other and reading up on investments. Some of the people were still waiting on IDs monday. Tuesday we finally started some sort of training. 

I don’t want to waste my time or theirs if it’s not work from home. I can’t look for other work because by the time I get out everything is closed. I am not sure what to do at this point. Any suggestions? Are there any legitamate work from home jobs out there?

I recently went to a second interview 2 days ago (from my understanding also the last one) and did a case study at the interview as well.

Before this I have applied directly to the company but also emailed a manager directly. The manager responded to me with his email and I was also invited to the interview from his email. Also when told I am getting a second interview, it was also straight from his email.

This morning I receive an email from HR, saying that the position has been cancelled.
Does this mean my application is official ended? Or is this just an automatic email from the company HR?

I am very confused because just the other day he responded to my email say they will be in touch soon. Can a position be cancelled a few days after they took the time to have a last interview and study case?

Any advice is appropriate!"

At that time, the only way to be paid was to submit individual invoices for each shift worked.

I am still in the same job as a per diem employee. The system for being paid is different and seems to be  working fine.

**Here's the issue:**In going through my old records, I recently realized that because I was working constantly at that time, I got overwhelmed and neglected to submit the paperwork for four of the clinics.

Yesterday, I did submit the required paperwork. In addition, I can see clear online evidence (which I am screenshotting) on the employers contractor website showing that I was never paid for these clinics.  

Here's the reply I got to my invoice submission:

Regarding the invoices/PO’s you are inquiring about from 2017, these events worked were over 5 years when you were a contractor. As a contractor, invoices are to be submitted within 160 days of working the event. This timeframe was indicated in your staffing welcome email when you were onboarded as a contractor and that 160 day timeline is enforced.

I was never sent such paperwork because the current company bought out a smaller company I originally onboarded with well before 2017.

From what I have read here, I should file a wage complaint with my state.

My question is this: what is the best wording for me to use in responding to the email that states they are refusing to pay me?

Any other suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks in advance!

P.S. I live in Nebraska and the work was performed in two neighboring states.

**TL;DR:**  I forgot to submit invoices from a couple of years ago to my current employer so they never paid me.  When I *did* submit them, they are refusing to pay.  What should I do?"

This was through TEAMS. I asked two questions, 1. What is the pay period? She told me 2. Confirmation about the how many weeks my first check would include. Her response : Correct sir. DAMN YOU REALLY NEED A JOB LOL.   


I was so taken aback. Not only am I an educated with a Master's degree in my area of expertise, I was actively in the process with several other companies and CHOSE this company because I felt it was the best fit. I just responded and said "" I'm sorry I don't understand"" She erased the message on TEAMS, logged out and never responded again.   


What would you do in this situation?  


I talked to my immediate manager, but its just so shitty, and upsetting. Especially because she is the only person who knows I am trans, as I had to reveal my dead name in background check. I just can't help like this was related, or some microagression due to subconscious transphobia. Man, what the hell!"

One is being an at will employee, no base pay, no benefits, mostly work at home and all of the appointments are pre set and commissions are great, all I would have to do is actually make the sale. my schedule would be very flexible with no weekends(or once a month at most), 25 to 35hrs a week, but the potential pay is 100-200+k 

Other is a one year contract, 40k base with a incentive for 10k more on my first year,  great benefits (dental,health, vision, life insurance and 401k match 6%) kicking in the first week of my being there, they will pay for gas aswell. I would have to go door to door 11am to 8pm everyday Monday thru Friday and 4hrs on the weekend. Training there will take 90 days and they warned me that I’ll be working more then usual until my training is done.

Im still in school and this time I was really looking for flexibility and work life balance as my previous job (car sales) had no flexibility or work life balance whatsoever (12hr days, horrible management, and only one day off a week) but the stability of a good base pay and benefits just sounds so attractive to me, as it would solve a lot of problems for me and my partner. 

I would really appreciate some input."

I’m making approximately 48k right now  doing office work remotely.Unlimited PTO and my boss is pretty flexible. I essentially set my own hours, I work from 7 am - 3:30 pm.

When we get raises, it’s about 2-3 %. 

I’ve been at this job already for 3 years (started out with 45k) and it’s very niche, job title is inflated and it’s essentially repetitive Excel work where you probably used only 2-3 formulas and you should be all set.  

The thing is I haven’t learned anything new and most  of the time I’m bored.

To most people in my life they think I got it made: working remotely, unlimited PTO,  doing easy work, limited socializing. Which makes it harder to leave this job.

I live with a roommate now but ideally I want to live on my own and make more than 60k. 

I don’t have many interests/skills prefer not to do customer service or teach.

I stayed job applying but I don’t know what I should look for that would make it worth my while to leave this job. If I look for a job that is in person, what salary should I be lookin? What should I do in general?

Note: I do have an active social life and trying our new things each year. It’s just with this job I know I’m kinda unhappy. Comfortable but unhappy. I have a bachelors in a stats degree I haven’t used since I graduated college 5 years ( I forgot a lot of the material anyway) but stem has never really interested me."

I work in marketing and have 3 years of experience in marketing coordinator and content creator type roles. This means that I can get interviews and for someone my age, I have a decent amount of experience. However, it’s likely that there are also people with 5-7 years of work experience who are applying for these same entry to mid level jobs as me, which makes it very competitive.

 So far, I have submitted over 150 job applications and have had over 35 interviews since the new year. I am feeling quite burnt out. Just this week alone, I have 8 interviews which is a combination of phone screen, Zoom meetings, and in person interviews. About 20% of my interviews so far have been final round which tells me that I’m doing something right, there’s just something that’s causing me to be rejected and I suspect it’s lack of experience in relation to other candidates. When I get feedback from employers as to why I wasn’t selected, it’s always been about my experience in relation to other candidates.

I also work 30 hours a week so my interviews are basically scheduled between any free time I can get at work on my off hours. My hours were cut from 40 at the start of the year which is largely why I started looking for a new job, as well as being in a toxic work environment where bonuses, hours, and benefits are stripped away whenever it is suitable to save a buck. It’s a small business that gets away with whatever the owner’s whim is. 

My financial situation is rough and I need more stability and a position that allows me to move up. I am trying to keep my current job happy while also looking for new roles. Because being partially employed is better than not being employed at all. However, having to even moderately prepare for all of these interviews is so draining. I’m exhausted and barely remember which company is which sometimes. Job applications that I submitted back over the holiday are FINALLY reaching out and everyone is trying to schedule interviews at the same time. 

It’s really discouraging because I’m putting so much effort into jobs that I probably won’t get yet I have to do it in order to improve my odds of finally landing something. Do any fellow job searchers have tips to help in this overwhelming process? I may need to slow down but that will also draw out the process every more."

When I say zero experience, I mean he hasn’t held a volunteer or part time, let alone full time, position in all of his 22 years of being alive. Refuses. Not even an internship. Mum and I are worried. 

The other day I was suppose to sit with him and help him spruce up his resume but I was stumped, I’ve helped cousins fancy up a resume by adding in key words to make even a cashier position shine, but I’m not used to seeing a completely blank resume. I don’t know where to start helping him.

He is looking to relax this final semester and probably land a bank teller job right out of college. So I was wondering what are the realistic chances he’s got with the current job market, his lack of experience, and even lack of meaningful school projects to add to his resume.

I’d appreciate tips of helping him out as well. Thanks in advance!"
2,2023-03-02,Am I being played by HR? How should I approach this?,u/Beemeowmeow,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ftvz6/am_i_being_played_by_hr_how_should_i_approach_this/,jobs,"Hi guys, need some sage advice!

I was recently successful in my job application, HR was pleased to extend an offer mid-February. I proceeded to submit my expected salary and last drawn salary details for HR to take it back to the company and draw up the offer/contract. Things were moving fast up till this point - HR was supposed to return to me with the formal offer but I didn't hear back from HR after a few days. I  proceeded to nudge HR who then informed me there were some unprecedented delays in their internal approval processes, told me to wait till the following week where HR could hopefully provide me some updates. Fast forward today, it's already mid-week but still no news so I dropped HR a note *again* (because the delay is indeed quite unusual) and to my surprise, HR again says they are *still* unable to provide me any updates and will look into the delay.

It is now more than 2 weeks since our last conversation on offer and salary expectations, and I genuinely want to know if I'm being strung along by HR or the company? While I understand that companies can take quite a while for their internal processes, I do think it's strange that things are not moving forward any faster. I also saw that they have recently refreshed and promoted the job listing on LinkedIn 1 week ago. Could it be that they are holding onto me while waiting for a ""cheaper"" candidate to come along? 

That said, I'm currently brainstorming **how best to broach a conversation with HR about my concerns**. While I'm giving the benefit of doubt that HR's hands are tied (while waiting for the relevant approvals from upper management?) I'd like to push for some progression or closure even, and confirm if things are even going to move forward at this point. While at some point in our exchange HR has affirmed they are still keen on me, I'm increasingly suspicious about the delay and fear that I'm being strung along. 

Would it be appropriate for me to be more aggressive in my approach and probe further on the cause of the delays and express my concerns? In doing so, I would question HR whether the position is still mine or if they are still in search of suitable candidates. I can't be waiting endlessly for the letter of offer... should I also give HR a cut-off date to provide the letter of offer?

Would greatly appreciate your advice! Let me know how you would approach this and convey the relevant concerns to HR. Thanks!"

Business analyst position",u/indygui25,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11fvqjj/job_offer_deadline_32_4pm_est_need_help_deciding/,jobs,"Hey all! I’ve been up all day and night deciding if I should take this offer or not. Here are the details:

Me:
28 years old 
B.S in marketing management 

Current job
- Mortgage industry 

- 52k salary (hourly)/ 16 days PTO, remote 

- Title: business control analyst 1 (about two years, been with company for 3)
- No raises for the past two years or promotions available regardless of increasing skill set (moving from Excel to a database and power bi reporting )
- flexible time, great team, super chill, lots of time to study Udemy, do school if I go back for computer science at Oregon State
- hit my learning cap with my team, no one to learn from
- lot of offshoring and job cuts in the industry. Been told I’m safe.

The offer:
- Health care insurance industry (Blue Cross Blue Shield / Elevance)
- 61k salary (hourly employee, negotiated from 56k), 2.5% annual bonus, 19 days pto, remote 
- title: business information analyst 1 (I applied for level two, they said they filled it and wanted me for the level 1 they had available)
- team seems cool, company is rated much higher on Indeed, also seems to be more focused on financial payments then data reporting like I do now.

The issue I’m having is that I’m going from a level one analyst position to another level one position, but I’m starting at the bottom of the totem pole. The minimum qualifications for the level one is a high school diploma and some preferences of  a higher education where as level two requires the degree and two years of analyst work. Being the new hire I’d most likely be the last to be promoted to level two, and I’m trying to move up, not stay stagnant. 

Do I stay where I am and keep applying to jobs for a better title / salary? Do I make the jump? Do I try and negotiate harder?

Thoughts appreciated!"

Its not payed vacation if course, for payed vacation you need to have worked 1 year there.

About a year ago I started looking for jobs to try and get my foot in the door. I was lucky to have a local software company hire me as a bookkeeper with no experience. This company is relatively small but has a lot of higher profile customers. When I was hired, there were only 2 people in the admin/accounting department. My boss, (the accounting manager)and an accountant lady who specialized in everything accounts receivable as well as many other various things. When I got there, I realized just how under staffed they were due to the amount of work and stress the other 2 accountants were under. I started doing things such as posting invoices, expense reports, distributing the mail, assisting with payroll, etc. After 6 months of working, my boss tells me that our accountant lady has submitted her notice. Her last day was in one week. My boss offered me her position, and I accepted. I began shadowing the lady a little bit and she showed some rather simple things and gave me an overview of her work. After she leaves I took over and realized just how unprepared I was and just how little she actually showed me. I started being brought work from different departments and customers that I had never seen in my life and a ton of work at that. I’m doing my best at it, but unfortunately the accountant lady worked this position for 15 years, and nobody really knows everything she did. I try to ask my boss for help but he is always busy and swamped with his large amount of work. The president is now coming to me with deadlines and asking complex questions that I have no answers for. I tried reaching out to the previous accountant lady with questions but no response. This is causing me an incredible about of stress. It is to the point where I’m working so much and so hard that I can’t make time to finish my school work, so my grades are dropping. I have to do homework on the weekends while with my fiance. On top of this, they are paying me $13 an hour and no mention of a pay increase or job title change since accepting this role a few weeks ago. I am becoming overwhelmed. Should I look for a different job or keep this one and deal with the work load for the sake of job experience?"

1,2023-03-02,Promotion pay advice,u/BeccaDuenas,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11g4b8u/promotion_pay_advice/,jobs,"Hi all, I'll give background.

Started a new career as a trainee one year ago(Fed 2022), I picked everything up really quickly and got promoted to Associate (5 months, took affect on 1 Aug 23) and of my profession was put in a progression plan to reach the regular role, no trainee or Junior etc, just the regular role like my colleagues. (Note: this is the first time this company has trained someone up so I was a Guinee pig and they were finding their feet with it)   
I started as a trainee at £21k, then I when I got promoted I got £23k and in the contract outlining my change to associate I got promised another pay rise 3 months later, which I got and earned. £27K which is the standard pay for an associate in my industry.   
Now, I have been here for a year and in previous contracts I was also promised a promotion on my year at the company provided I pass my development plan, which I have.   
On Feb 3rd I got pulled into a meeting with my team lead and head of department, they told me I passed and they were happy to promote me. I asked about the pay and job title but they had no idea and hadn't sorted that out yet. I have given time to sort this but it is now March 2nd and still heard nothing. My promotion is supposed to be in affect from March 1st and I will be getting paid more from March 1st as well.   


This is one part. The main question is this.

My one and only colleague in head office has worked there a little longer and has experience in the industry but a different part of the industry, so it doesn't really related to the job we do now. His work is bad to say the least. I have picked up a lot of errors and inconsistencies, he is also very hard to work with and even the team lead has issues controlling him, he always does what he wants and changed standard process. My manager has told me mullite times my work is better and he sees me as his second in command. And yet I get the feeling the pay will be a lot less than my colleague.

I don't know the exact amount this colleague gets paid but I know it is £37k or more, In know for a fact he started on that and he has had an annual pay review since then, but I can't know the exact amount.   


My question is, if I get offered less than this, how can I push back without sounding greedy and make the point that my work is much better than my colleagues' work and it has been pointed out multiple times? How is that fair?   


All advice is welcome and I can give more info if needed. I just don't know how to go about this and if they mention the previous experience thing; considering my work is better and I've been doing it for less time, shouldn't that be rewarded?"

I work in a STEM field, recently left a good company for a new job that I am not crazy about. Nothing against my new company, just isn't the right fit for my skills and I don't see where I fit in the picture long term. A contact I made through my work at my last company reached out to me, told me he was hiring (he would be my manager) and that I should apply for the position. I applied and interviewed. Interview went great, and not to be arrogant but I know I interview well. This felt like one of the best interviews I have ever had, if not the best. The company is in Europe, and I am based in the USA. I would be their first remote and overseas hire. The interviewing panel was my personal contact and an HR person. After the interview concluded they told me they would let me know when the next interview would be, shortly.  Two weeks go by and I don't hear anything so I reach out to the HR contact who had set up my first interview. He told me there had been a delay with interviewing some other applicants and that he would be in touch soon, and apologized for the delay. Two more weeks have gone by, and I haven't heard anything. I wrote to him again, and he hasn't responded.

Should I reach out to my personal contact? I don't want to seem un professional and cross any boundaries with him, but the lack of response seems odd considering how well I felt like the interview went. Thanks all......"
3,2023-03-02,Declining a job offer,u/Far-Director5466,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11g56ey/declining_a_job_offer/,jobs,"Basically I’ve been wanting to decline an offer, but told them to wait for my decision since I am interviewing with other places (this is not true, I am only applying and applying). The pay is low (though this was on the description), and after the interview I figured that they might have a company culture that isn’t fit for me. For reasons I don’t even know myself I felt my heart drop when I got the offer. 

I wouldn’t really have much of an issue saying no or lying that I had interviews elsewhere just to give an excuse, but the person who is the key figure in the hiring process is the leader of his organization, with decades of experience in his field. I was afraid that I might be black listed, or talked of negatively throughout other organizations simply because I expressed that I wanted the job during the interview, and didn’t want it afterward. I know I am overthinking because it’s not like I accepted then declined, and there isn’t really anyway for them to know whether I am interviewing elsewhere. 

For now, I am thinking of saying that I am declining their offer to search better opportunities because I don’t want to be too dishonest, but Im worried this is weird to say since Ill get back to them once I get the other interviewer’s decision, and didn’t even get an alternative offer. I’ve been doing all the interactions about this offer through phone, but was thinking of putting the “nail in the coffin” through email. Any advice Is appreciated."

I had an interview with a really reputable data center, although I dont have much experience within the IT world, this job would've propelled me deep into that sort of line.

I really wanted this job therefore I came prepared with knowledgeable research, aswell as projects that I completed during my time at uni, mainly coded projects using Python. The interview went well and I really thought I was going to get the job.

However another canditate applied for it, they were debating between me and him. A couple days ago I got the news that they were going to choose him, on the basis that he has had more customer facing roles since this would've been a first line helpdesk sort of role. 

I've been trying to stay positive, the last few days I've been tweaking my CV adding any relevant informations reguarding my projected skills within speaking and interactions but I cant really add anything more since I've never had a job that required me to interact with people that much. 

I've been getting rejections upon rejections and its honestly started to effect me badly. I've had amazing help with my CV but the fact that I dont really have much experience other than my education kind of ruins my procespects within the technology field."

2,2023-03-02,I might be leaving my job,u/cupcakepantry,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11g6a93/i_might_be_leaving_my_job/,jobs,"My work experienced a malware attack over the weekend and had to get everyone’s laptops to reset and better secure them. For WFH people like myself this meant we had to come in and drop them off Monday and pick them up whenever they were done. 

Over the course of two days I continued to check in with the receptionist since I had no other method of contacting them. Eventually HR calls me back and says that my laptop is ready to be picked up on Wednesday so I make the drive and come get it. 

Everyone is all smiles and they walk me to the room they’re keeping everything in, I get told to wait outside while he grabs it and I do so patiently. He gets it, I say thank you and ask if there’s anything else like passwords I need. He says that they’re all in emails so I say alright sounds good and go back home. 

When I get home, my standard login doesn’t work and I have to figure out how to contact my supervisor to let her know. She doesn’t respond to me almost the entire day and finally tells me the correct password in a quick IM, also telling me I will not be able to use the VPN/access our drives. 

I assume that’s being actively worked on and resign myself to just answering emails.  Eventually my email also locks me out, great. 

I get a call from a coworker asking if they can send me some documents - I tell them I don’t have VPN access yet and she gets confused telling me I should be in office and that the WFH has been revoked for everyone until further notice. I tell her my supervisor has not said that so I’m not sure what’s going on. At that moment I think someone from IT walks into her office and she tells them who she’s talking to and what about.  

Five minutes later my boss calls me and asks if I’m confused. I say - I don’t think so but what are we talking about? Apparently I was supposed to be given some papers with login info and be informed that I would have to work from the office by HR. And according to my boss, HR told her I rushed in, signed for my laptop and grabbed it before anyone could give me that paperwork and left in a hurry. 

I am. Immediately livid. I start heatedly explaining to her the actual scenario and get told that she is neutral in this and that if I want I can dispute that.  (With who, HR? The people lying about me? Sounds like that will go great /s)

I am also told that HR is going to only pay me for 2 hours today since I didn’t stick around. I am a salaried employee. 

I then get told that I must come in going forward. The reason I am WFH is I am caring for my mother who is going through chemo. She needs someone to be in the house with her to get her things and make sure she doesn’t fall. She had a fractured arm from a fall last year that makes us (family) all concerned about the possibility of another fall especially when she’s weak from chemo. 

For the past 8 months, work has been accommodating my WFH request; every three months they check in and ask if anything has changed. I tell them no, they renew my WFH request another 3 months.

Back to present,  I am told I must go into the office until further notice. I am at a loss as to what I should do. I can’t leave my mother, we can’t afford to get a nurse, nobody else in the family is able to help either because of distance or disability. My boss tells me because work has been so accommodating that I should be so in return during this time. 

I tell her I’m grateful for the time I’ve been given and that in other circumstances I would be happy to go in but it’s just not feasible.

I am told I basically have three options:
1) go in and hope mom does fine 10 hours a day with no one in the house until whenever the VPN is fixed. 
2) take leave without pay; I don’t like it but I could. 
3) quit. Which I am sorely tempted by given HRs attempts to imagine up a bus to throw me under. 

Any advice is welcomed. I’m so at a loss."

I've worked on marketing and brand creative teams in the outdoor industry for my entire professional life (5 years).

I've gotten a few interviews, but since most of these jobs are tech or tech-adjacent, it's hard to convince them I'm the perfect candidate.

Similar jobs in other industries won't hire me because I don't have direct experience with that industry. Brands in the outdoor space simply aren't hiring due to the end of COVID-19 demand, and companies in the retail space have small teams and few openings.

With my last job, I was able to move to a wonderful small town with few employment opportunities and endless natural exposure. With even fewer remote retail and outdoor marketing jobs out there, I'm starting to feel hopeless about being able to stick around in an area I've grown to love.

But if I put  'Yes' I have another section to write but it would probably be hard to put anything interesting. It's for a job in a Forest commission so trees/woodland is their thing though the job itself is more of a technical role so my skills in another industry are transferable which is what I am counting on and have already covered.

I like trees/woodlands etc but surely that is a bit lame or is that something I should be saying. I am not immensely knowledgable on the threat to tree coverage though or anything so would probably get found out if i try to pretend I am some sort of champion of tree preservation.

I am 28m, with a 2 year degree in both accounting and business management. Last year I applied for an IT Tech position for a community services organization. I got the job, and have really enjoyed everything about it up to this point.

A few weeks ago one of my higher ups in the fiscal department came into my office, slammed a massive Tax Training book on my desk, and told me I’d be doing free tax services for customers through the tax season. She said our CEO said I needed to be one of the new employees to start doing them.

I didn’t complain at the time to her specifically, but I did go to my direct IT supervisor and asked about it. He said they probably noticed I had an accounting degree and knew I’d be good at it so they just volunteered me for it without mentioning it to me.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m great with taxes. I’ve went through the first week or two with no flaws being sent back to me by my quality reviewer, and I’ve been told if I keep it up I could be a quality reviewer next year! (Yay! /s)

My issue is that when I originally got my accounting degree and pursued that field, I didn’t like it. Now I’m basically doing the same job but for much less money because I’m being paid my normal IT salary for doing accounting work. I should also mention that this is work being done through VITA which is a VOLUNTEER service.

I’m not sure if this is worth fighting, but if it is, what should I do to get my point across without risking being reprimanded?"

I am a fairly recent grad with a degree in Ocean engineering (civil engineering with waves and beaches). Straight out of school, I got a job as a field engineer for a dredging company, making around 80k/yr. After about a year at that company, I had a friend put me onto a job as an offshore Geotechnical engineer. 

My hourly rate currently is 31.25 (65k @ 40hrs/week) with 2 weeks paid vacation. The reason I took the new job is because on my offshore rotation, we work an 84 hr week, which more than doubles the pay. The offshore rotations are 4-6 weeks depending on the vessel, and I work 12 hr shifts every day of the rotation. When I come back on shore we get 1 day of R&amp;R for the first 3 weeks and 1 addition day for every week worked past 3 weeks (6 weeks = 4 days, 4 weeks = 2 days). After we take our R&amp;R, we are hybrid in office 3 days and wfm 2 days.

At the quoted 40% of the year offshore from my offer letter, I should make around 93k but I am planning on volunteering to do closer to 60% offshore to be closer to 105k. I am just curious what yall think of this deal and if you would take it. I am 24 y/o and single so I've got nothing keeping my at home, and I figure I'd grind for a couple years to bank some cash.

Let me know what you think!"

So I recently had an interview for quite a well established company, it went well, and from an email received today it looks like I am going to be offered the position.

My problem is, that during the interview I found out more about the role, and felt that ‘drop’ in my body finding out that the main focus for the length of the scheme would be with a client who’s sector I am just not interested in at all.

I got an intuitive feeling that though this company is the closest I’ve got so far to the industry I want to work in, I feel I’m going to be so unhappy, uninspired and start to dread the role. 

I have other applications in progress with companies I really am passionate about. 
Going off the feelings during the interview, would you go off the gut reaction that it’s just not for you? Despite the disappointment that brings?"

I just found out after two weeks of patient waiting that a job with a particular phone provider at a local store where I’d be a salesperson had been filled. I’ve been out of work for a month after previously being in the mortgage industry. 

I wasn’t notified as “candidates selected to go forward are only reached out to” whereas I thought they were still interviewing. I was told none of the other stores around are hiring or will be and bid good luck. I would have made more money than I could ever hope to make ($24 an hour) which would have led to moving out of my dads house at 28 and a potential new vehicle. 

Every job that pays over $20 has done this to me. I don’t know if it’s worth it to keep searching for things paying this much as I know it’s what I need to make to accomplish both goals above. 

I’m losing hope I can find a good paying job. How do I keep my head up?

I am struggling with my next move. I graduated in 2021 but received my license last September due to scheduling and personal family matters. I have been applying for jobs since then up until now. In total, I've had four interviews - the fourth coming up next week. I never expected the job hunting process to be easy by any means, but I also didn't anticipate for things to take this long and it's giving me anxiety and has me thinking if I should pursue something else. I've applied for even the franchise/chain spas with no luck (massage envy, European Wax, hand and stone, etc) I know a large part of this is due to my lack of experience as a new graduate and I need to set myself apart from others. But what has me feeling discouraged (probably this means I was a bit naive) but I didn't anticipate not having a career sometime after graduation. I am at a point where I just want to make money and support myself. I know some are lucky while others build their career in the first few years, but I am almost 28 years old (I know I'm still young but yes I've set myself up to achieve something by a specific time) and I'm just at that point where I am scared of wasting time. I have thought about just keeping my license as I pursue something else and during this time I could take up learning extensions/lifts and perhaps do house calls and build clients that way. I am thinking of going into the medical field for surgical tech, and the program starts next month. Feels like I need to make a decision fast."

I found a new job as a waiter a week ago and it's not going well at all. It's a very busy restaurant, we serve about 150 to 200 lunches a day and I've never worked in a restaurant so busy. The place i worked before served like 10. It was chill and the boss was very relaxed.

Here the environment is super professional, super rigid and that is killing me. Every little mistake is pointed out. Very trivial things tbh. But what kills me the most is the pace. It's 8 hours of running around, 8 hours of stress, 8 hours of people asking me to do 10 things at the same time very quickly and if i take a little long then the bosses are very unpleasant to me. 

I'm starting to limp a lot because i'm just not athletical enough to run 8 hours straight. I'm in a lot of pain. Mentally I also can't handle the stress. I thought i could but yeah, I couldn't make the transition from serving 10 lunches to 200. It's chaos.

Another thing that pisses me off is that i'm just there for a week and I don't know a lot of stuff and they don't have much patience to teach me. I end up not asking cuz when I do I get comments. But when I don't I screw up and it's even worse.

It's good money but I don't think i can do it anymore. I feel like such a loser and inferior to people that can actually do this.

What is your advice?"

I’m not sure how much I can do in this position but I figured I would ask so I can get some opinions on how to proceed.  Long story short, during the offer I was told that I would get a full 10% bonus, even though I technically would not qualify since I didn’t start at the beginning of the year.  Well of course, what ended to happening was that today I was rewarded a 5% bonus for half a years work.  The person who offered this bonus to me previously was supposed to be on the call today, but was not there.  Instead, I spoke with my manager who said he wasn’t aware of what have been agreed to be that i should reach out to the other guy.   (Side note: I also didn’t receive an annual raise because I haven’t been there long enough supposedly, but that was never promised so I don’t know what to think of that.)

During the whole thing I was very polite, cordial, etc.  I didn’t get mad or show any disappointment.  In reality, I’m not terribly upset but it certainly is annoying that they aren’t going through with what was promised.  I like my job and coworkers, but if this doesn’t end up happening I’ll probably just end up leaving after a year or so.

Anyways, the point of this post is to ask how I should approach the guy who promised me the bonus?  Both in terms of attitude, and forum.  Should I email?  Schedule a call?  Slack him?  Should I show any disdain at all, or just remain respectful at all times?  

If anyone would like to help with my approach, that would be great.  I realize this probably happens to people all the time and it sucks but I think it’s worth putting at least a bit of a fight…"

At my company we have a department called corporate wellness made up of disability managers who take care of leaves. My disability manager has repeatedly told me she has to keep everything between us and cannot tell my supervisor what I talk about. Her job is to follow up on my progress during my leave. A few days ago we had a call and she asks “I forgot to ask when you started your leave but do your mental health issues have anything to do with work”. I said yes that’s part of it but no all of it. She asked if I would like to file a WCB claim against my supervisor/department. I said I already discussed with my doctor before and I don’t want to do that. She said she would send me some info on it in case I change my mind about it. She sent the email but I did not respond as I did not want to file a claim. 

The next day I get an email from my disability manager stating she went ahead and filed a claim on my behalf. By the time she emailed me she had already attempted to call my doctor (who is not my family doctor) to discuss it with her without my permission. She also went ahead and told my supervisor why I went on sick leave when she told me she would keep the conversation confidential. She said my supervisor can now assume that I am off work due to mental health because she told him he gives me too much work. I called her when I received her email and she told me all of this. I cried and argued that this was a violation and she had lied about keeping the conversation between us. She apologized several times and agreed she should have asked me first but said she was busy and didn’t have time to call me so she “hit the panic button” and filed a claim under my name.  

Since then I have emailed her supervisor and told her how I felt this was wrong and a violation of my trust and confidence. I went into detail about everything that was said. 

Is there anything else I can do about this? I no longer feel comfortable going back to work knowing that my supervisor has this personal information on me, is under the impression I filed a claim, thinks I can’t handle my workload, all while I am still on probation."

Which is insane to me because this job is, supposedly, 'prevelant'. My concern is idk what to do when i run out of jobs, or i find jobs posted 4 weeks ago (not worth even applying to). Do I just try out different keywords? Apply to other fields? Not really sure what to do or what i'm missing. Maybe try other job sites instead of Indeed+LinkedIN? Dunno."

I was making excellent progress through my training period, which was not even real work, but “pretend” work. 

Basically they gave me old already completed projects and had me do them over so I would learn the basic skills before i got into the next stage. I was really fucking good at this stage of the detail oriented work…but i would get distracted and unable to focus on it alone in the office (everyone else gets to work remotely except for me until my 6 month training ended and the secretary) and as a result did not use every minute of my time productively. 

They became aware of that, ans without a warning or reprimand told me that I was terminated. 

So now i’m on the hunt again. Lesson learned, I take responsibility for my mistakes and poor judgment. And this does give me more time to give towards my part time side hustle working for an attorney to learn more from him and gain more legal experience (which is where I want to end up anyways - am currently midway through a paralegal cert course and will be applying to law schools next year) 


But a bish gotta eat and pay bills and get her own house, so I need to find something full time stable with benefits asap. Before i need to tell my parents and explain to my entire family that was finally proud of me for something a week ago that i fucked up and need to borrow gas money….


I’m 32, female by the way. This isnt my first rodeo with job hunting or living in survival mode. And i’d never been fired before. I’m sick of it honestly. I want stability and to move forward with my life. 

How can I twist this unfortunate circumstance i’ve brought upon myself in my favor with future job applications and interviews?"

I didn't get it and moved on to a new different company and industry. That new job was...not great. I left that job and took a different job in the same industry. It started out solid, a couple key ""wins"", I got along with my boss, but something seemed to sour about 3 months in. It's now been 6 months. I am fuming and freaking out that I'm stuck in a really challenging situation. 

I just left a multi-day conference my department was staffing. 12+ hour days, no breaks for us. Doing manual labor (not what I was hired for) but I was mostly standing/sitting around with little to do (long story but this conference is for ""Division A"" of the company and I'm in ""Very tangentially related completely different skill set Division B"". Like, HR running a career and educational conference for accountants, so both networking and actually focusing on the content was of limited value--and honestly, this isn't a ""lifelong"" industry for me). I really, really didn't need to be there.

**No thank you to me for the work**, from my boss as I was leaving, just a ""okay, see you next week"". Cold shoulder and a general vibe of ""oh, are you still here?"" throughout even though it wasn't outright rude. This was grueling and if I had known I'd be staffing **two** of these f--ing things in 6 months I would have declined the job, I was juggling multiple very interested interviews, some of which were zeroing in on an offer. 

Of course now the market's changed and I'm having trouble finding listings to even apply to. 

Honestly this is mostly a vent, but if anyone has success stories about turning it around from this vague eggshells ""everything I do is wrong"" vibe I'm very open to that."

 I’ve (23 M) been doing all the right stuff; went to college, did the internships, got a degree in physics, got a great girlfriend, got a job, saved 50% of each paycheck and an currently sitting on about $70,000 of stocks with no debt or expenses besides food and rent. 

Since graduating college, I have been working as a remote SDR at a tech startup for about a year and a half; it’s boring and stressful, but in this economy I’m just happy to have a job. 

I had gotten a STEM degree to “help change the world” but quickly realized that’s a bit of a pipe dream without any capital or experience. It’s not that I am ungrateful or unhappy for the things I have, but this far adult life has been extremely underwhelming and devoid of higher meaning. 

I have thought about joining the Air Force, starting a renewable energy company, becoming a teacher, and a few other things, but have been heavily discouraged. What would y’all do? 

If any of you out there have jobs, careers, etc that add meaning to your life beyond “make lots of money”, what do you do, and how did you get into it?"

I replied saying that I do, and that I've been putting feelers out there because I've been experiencing a lot of emotional burnout. And I said I feel guilty bc I love everyone there.

She said don't feel bad (this was all via text, she was texting me from down the hall). But for the rest of the day she was kind of cold and short with me.

If I don't end up landing this job I feel that I just put myself in a bad position. However, if I lied to her and then put in my notice shortly after, that would also make me look bad. Part of me is relieved the cat is out of the bag.

I've emailed the contact to clarify and waiting on their response. Having been out of the market for a while I'm inclined to accept the role, but it would be a significant cut to salary vs previous role(s). The role sounds interesting but different to what I've done previously.

I'm still pretty unsure what to do. It seems odd that despite flagging 50k gross (and seemingly okay with that figure during discussions) they've now offered me more like 38k. A salary is better than not, but this is quite a haircut which is difficult to stomach (especially given my experience)."

A co-worker of mine told me yesterday there was a restaurant hiring nearby and they’ll probably be willing to train me to bartend. I tried calling the hiring manager, no answer. Called the restaurant today. They said to come in and fill out an application, so I did. 

As I was finishing my application the hiring manager, let’s call him J. Sat down to speak with me. 

As I was explaining I’m looking for a place that’s willing to take me on as a server and start training me he asked about my schedule. I told him it was super random (bc it is) and I would be willing prioritize whichever company gives me more hours.

He cut me off and just started talking about how much I could make in tips, never looked at my application by the way, didn’t ask about my experience and just briefly mentions “15.50 plus tips you’ll be going home with money each night” that was the only mention of pay in this entire interaction.. I was trying to ask him what my responsibility’s would be, and where I would work considering he’s hiring for 3 different locations that are all walking distance from eachother. 

He never quit answered me, told me I would need to be patient and willing to learn and then asked me if I could start tomorrow night. 

I was taken back a little, but I am dead broke.. so I told him I could start Saturday. He shook my hand and told me to buy none slip shoes. 

I was extremely confused and asked him if he wanted to see my schedule, he said no. I’m not sure how that’s gonna work out… like. I have a schedule my dude how you gonna hire me and not care when I could work? He started to walk me out and I’m kinda just disoriented asking where am I gonna be working, he pointed to the two restaurants ahead of us, while walking me to my car, “so, can I pick up shifts at both places?” He nodded his head as if like “of course you can” and told me he’ll see me Saturday while waving me bye. 

I’m a bit concerned and I’m not sure if I should be. The last time I got hired that easily was at a very crappy work place that fired there employees on a daily for no reason while revolving new ones that would be just as quickly fired again. 

Is this a red flag? What would you do.. should I just not go and continue looking else where? Pay wasn’t even discussed but I rlly do need the money and training."

Thanks in advance for any advice."

However, I only get 2-5 tickets a day, and my manager doesn't like me studying azure, ccna, or anything outside of the university software because he said if it's not related to the software that they use that it's all ""theoretical."" Would it be unwise to apply to jobs with all the layoffs going on? 

 My dad and family were telling me to stay stop thinking things are better somewhere else or having fomo about moving to bigger cities. They said that although the salary may be a little bit higher: the rent, car insurance, groceries, electricity, taxes, and gas are more. And that if I don't stay 5 to 10 years at one employer it will look like I'm roaming. And that I'll never reach a higher or senior level position, because I'm not getting embedded into a specific organization. Do you think these things are true though?

Lastly, he said that even if I took a job making more now, he said that's short term thinking. Because the pension if I stay 30 years would pay out 33k a year based on my current salary. He said it would be impossible to find something in possible that pays that much in retirement, and even if I make more yearly I would have put much more of my salary into investments and hope salary goes up to make the same return. The 33k is also based off of current salary and not off of any promotions I get. 

However, most the people at the organization have been there 15 to 25 years so idk how realistic it is to expect a promotion. One of my freinds said to leave because times have changed and no one stays at one employer 30 years now, that I could be missing out on other jbos that pay more than the yearly raises the uni may give me, and I'm not getting the experience or growth that I need. I also had to move away from family and pay 1500 in rent on a 55k salary. So, I'm debating how much longer I can keep this up. 

My dad said just stay longer and I'll get promotions and yearly adjustments along with a way better retirement that the private sector, and that if I leave now I'd be too focused on the short term FOMO of the higher salary. He also said the work life balance may be horrible in private sector and I'd hate my job. But, then my friend said any higher paying job will expect song things, but I'd also learn more and it wouldn't be bad all the time.

I've done some interviews for instance a smaller company of 100 people for a remote role that paid 70 to 75k. But, since it's a smaller 10 year old startup idk if I trust it. Plus it's an MSP so maybe higher work life balance, but maybe the pay would make it better.

Which, view do you think sounds better though staying like my dad said, or leaving like my friend suggested I do?

I've been at Company A for 2 years, straight out of grad school, and was just promoted into a senior role. I had to accept it.

Before my promotion, I applied for competitor Company B who have now offered me the job, same title and seniority as the promotion.

Both pay similarly (a couple thousand in difference) and have the same benefits. I've had some minor qualms about the somewhat toxic culture at Company A but I'm incredibly well liked by most, can handle 'toxicity' and have a thorough understanding of the company, processes, systems and politics. Company B is offering managerial experience (I'd have one person report into me) and it's a fresh perspective on the same industry, offering new insight, skills etc. Though, I am walking into the unknown in terms of culture, people and politics. A friend who has worked at both Company A and B said to me 'Same shit, different fire.' 

What should I do? Would appreciate any thoughts or advice."

Had an interview for somewhere else today, they called me while I was there, and I listened to the voicemail, basically the standard ""Reaching you about your application, call me back on XYZ number.""

Problem: They said my name wrong, but like barely. The second letter is a vowel, and they're using the long vowel sound (they're saying it like an ""o"" as in ""tone"") when it should be the short vowel sound (""o"" as in ""top"", to stick to the O example).

So it's wrong, but barely. When I call them back, how do I correct them in a way that clears the air, but doesn't hurt my chances at getting the job?

This isn't even the first time it's happened either, I had a similar job over this summer (I left them because they needed me to be available 24/7 so they could put me anywhere on a rotating roster, that was okay this summer after I finished school but not now that I'm going to university), and one of my managers pronounced it the same way this other person did. I forgave that because that manager wasn't a native speaker, but this new one sounds like they're born and raised here in Aus (and over here we're told that ""Two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking"" rule, but there's a double consonant after the vowel in my name, so that doesn't apply, so quite frankly I don't even understand how a native speaker is getting the long vowel sound at all but I won't say that because I don't know people's circumstances), and I don't want to have to do this every time. I'd say it's about 50/50 in who gets it right and who gets it wrong. But it is kinda getting on my nerves, this is the equivalent of a candidate called Gabbie getting called Gay Bee all the time.

So basically. Pronunciation on my CV. Like you know how one's name is normally in the top left hand corner of their CV? If I just put a guide on how to pronounce it between that and my contact details, is that a good idea, or would that hurt my chances at future applications?

I'm not talking the IPA symbols, because I presume most employers aren't gonna have the time to decode that (then they'll either still get it wrong or think I'm just a showoff and immediately not like me), and those acrostic poems where it goes ""X letter for Y word that starts with X letter and is pronounced like X letter in this person's name"" might take up too much space (I have six letters in my name). I'm talking like all the sounds separated by bullet points, with a ""h"" after the vowel to signify a short vowel sound.

Alternatively, there's a much more common name that rhymes with mine, so could I put a note under it saying ""rhymes with &lt;this&gt;""? Any other suggestions if neither of those sound good? Or is my whole ""Pronunciation on CV"" idea just not a good one at all?"

When I asked about any 401k benefits, the hiring manager said that they do not match but they do “dump?” I have no idea what that means. Any idea?
I also looked at their reviews on Glassdoor and on Indeed and it looks like some of these reviews are fake. Multiple reviews from the same position/s on the same day with 5 stars. 
Should I stay clear with them? I already signed the acceptance letter but I’m not afraid to tell them I am no longer interested."

But the other day, some buffoon saw me leaving at 5PM and he texted their HOD group. And like almost everyone knows about this already and it’s putting me in a negative light. Should I still stay? 

And I’ll always sit at a corner with my friend from another department and my manager said something about my ‘visibility’ that I wasn’t connecting with my team enough. 

I honestly just want to clock in, do my work and clock out. I’m also an introvert and like don’t really talk much to people.

My office is free seating though. And since that thing happened, it kinda stemmed from my (I just got to know) ‘incompetency’. 

Basically this girl gave me her work to do but never told me what mistakes I did (so every time she had to redo my work) which I think she told that to the buffoon (her boss) and like that made him think like TF why is she leaving early she’s always making mistakes - to which I wasn’t even was aware of.

So at the end of it all, they told me to shrug it off and prove myself to everyone so that they can move past this and see that I’m ‘competent’ enough to not disturb me anymore.

What do we think about this situation? Should I leave? This role that I’m in a a contract admin role. What should I do? To make them stop the goss?

Please advise. Thank you so much"

Been at this company almost 2 years. They offered me a ""promotion"" of 5k increase and more responsibilities once when the person in that position quit about a year into my current position. I said not as I did not feel ready or capable enough ans really don't want more responsibility.
Someone else quit, for a similar lateral position as before. Again it got offered to me at same rate. 
The new position would incur a lot more responsibility in a team ive never worked with nor understand how their department works.
I like the team I work with, very proficient and excel ar my job as a admin assistant, my attorneys love my work and appreciate me immensely  and feel like the HR is pressuring me into it again.
 Im conflicted because there are only so many positions there. And they might write me off from promotion in the future as I've turned them down twice if I say no again.

Any advice?

Thanks!"

I need a job pretty quickly but I don't feel very confident in my portfolio, which still only consists of school assignments. I know video showreels and custom websites showing off videos are a thing, but I don't feel like the work I have is very usable in that way nor am I skilled in web-building. My personal style is more about 'filmic'/tv-like work and way less the flashy, jumpy motion graphics mumbo-jumbo that's everywhere nowadays. 

I do have a Vimeo page featuring all my work. [https://vimeo.com/janmelkebeek](https://vimeo.com/janmelkebeek)

Do you guys have any tips on how to present my stuff in a compact, attractive way that's relatively straight-forward or easy to do? Also, feedback on my work is very appreciated. To me, it's far from 'wow' or even 'good enough'. 

Up until now I thought of doing some more improved projects to add to it but my time to look for a job is running out since I'm getting kicked out of the house (for the better) and need a steady income to secure my own place. Should I apply with what I have, or build further on it while doing some random low-profile job? Problem is I'm not convinced the latter would convince a landlord to accept me as a tenant.

1,2023-03-03,Struggling to find a Job That's Right,u/JennKitCat,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11gxppz/struggling_to_find_a_job_thats_right/,jobs,"So, here's the long and short of it. I have a high school diploma, and did a few years of college but never got a degree. I have had several jobs in the past, in retail and fast food. I am not looking to work in fast food again.

I am introverted, was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child, and have occasional anxiety issues. Put simply, I don't like high stress or high speed environments, at all. I get overwhelmed by them quickly. I have a compulsive disorder that causes me to pull out my hair. So in order to look professional I require some form of head covering. I cannot work with plants or animals (With the exception of cats) due to allergies.

I am polite, honest and responsible. I have standards, and don't like my work to be sloppy. I show up to work on time. I follow instructions well, but they have to be clear, and I tend to ask a lot of questions if they aren't. I learn well on the job so long as I'm not rushed, and am good with electronics.

My ideal job is doing menial, repetitive tasks all day while not having to talk to anyone other than employers or the occasional co-worker. I'm an artist, so I can easily sit in one place for many hours doing a task, and if I can listen to music then I'm even more productive. I'm not very strong, so working back areas to move large boxes around would be difficult, for example. I'm not great with math, but I've gotten much better at it over the years after counting out cash registers.

I have two examples of tasks that I enjoyed that were part of other jobs I had in the past. 

1. The retail stores I've worked at would fill carts full of merchandise that customers decided they didn't want and would leave at the front. We would bring these carts to their assigned areas and return the items to their proper places. I also enjoyed stocking shelves and straightening the items in them.
2. The fast food store I worked would prep things for the day in the morning. Putting rows of biscuits evenly spaced on baking pans, mixing together ingredients for coleslaw to give it time to set for use the next day, making bulk sized tubs of mashed potatoes and gravy, putting freshly baked cookies into individual paper sleeves and stacking them neatly into a plastic container.

Please keep in mind I don't want jobs that involve me going back to college, having to take a course or class in something, or having to do internships. And I *do not* take my work home with me. Period. Once my shift is over that is my time, and I will not do work that I'm not being paid for, outside of working hours. I know my own limits.

I'd prefer a job where I don't have to move around too much, and I do not want a job driving vehicles to places. As I said, I am not a very strong person, so I get nervous about going to areas I'm not familiar with by myself, especially the homes of strangers, so things like Doordash are off the table.

That being said, I'm just curious if anyone has any suggestions for jobs that might fit what I'm looking for. I know it's a lot of criteria but I'd really like to find a job that I won't be stressed out or miserable doing for many years."

1,2023-03-03,"Should I give this job application my current job's HR phone for the reference, and which supervisor should I choose for the reference?",u/ThrowThinkAway,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11gyxpc/should_i_give_this_job_application_my_current/,jobs,"I'm on the reference check phase of this government job. To be honest I don't want any hopes up because I've been let down too many times. It's asking for 3-4 references from my 1st current part time job + previous part time jobs. 

This 1st job is weird since the main team (coordinators and HR) basically has little to no contact with me and the actual workers, so I hardly have any impression with the main coordinator, let's call him A. Instead they cooperate with a different company, and that other company has a supervisor who is pretty nice and cool, I'll call him C. 

I want to have C be my first reference because he can vouch for me AND it keeps me safe from letting the main company know that I am job hunting elsewhere, but technically he isn't part of my company. And the bigger problem... the form asking for references has a section specifically for Human Resources Dept. Phone number, so I can't avoid giving them a way to contact the main company. And then that may cause two issues:

1. The main company is wondering why I am job hunting
2. They'll also wonder why I chose C, who is outside the company but supervises us on-site, instead of choosing A who is technically my real superior (off-site)
3. If HR causes a stink, the government job employer will wonder why I am causing a mix-up as though there's a red flag.

Would it be an issue to go ahead with C? Or should I go with A?

What about the HR phone, since it doesn't seem like I can avoid it? 

On my resume I don't think I mentioned my 2nd current job which is a part time and in the same city government system (just not same department) that I only picked up recently. I don't think I should bring it up because I haven't been there for long, and I think the supervisor there doesn't like me because I've been late a few times (thanks life for causing me issues...). And of course the same issue, I don't want to alert them that I'm looking ""elsewhere"", nor do I want to alert the job employer in case this current government job says negative things. What do I do? Just refrain from mentioning the 2nd job since it was never brought up?"

It sounds like a flatterer. To me I can see that it's not written by a human, because it is so generic and rewrites the same sentences from the job. Like how can a hiring manager not see it? It doesn't really add unique EXAMPLES and it is not very personalized. And when I then paste my CV/resume and ask it to rewrite the cover letter based on my CV, it just repeats/rewrites somd bullet points and sentences that I have on my CV. Your cover letter should not repeat your CV right? So I don't understand why so many people think ChatGPT writes good cover letters. I want to write my own letter but at the same time I keep reading so many positive reviews about ChatGPT and don't know if I should just trust that it's good.

She's known him for at least two years, and yesterday I attended a meeting with the two of them to discuss mechanical design issues. I reasoned that I'd follow up with him to thank him, and maybe slip in some language about how I'll be entering the job market later this year and wanted to pick his brain about it. 

So today I got to work and asked my boss if she could give me his email so that I could ""follow up with him"" (the extent of what I said), and she got very cagey about it and wanted to know why I wanted it. She eventually did give it to me, but it's his personal email, not his company one, and for that reason she asked that she get to read anything I want to send him and that I cc her on anything I actually send. Which struck me as a bizarre and invasive request, but I also get that it's his personal email and she doesn't want to hand it out willy-nilly. How should I proceed? I can't milk this connection for a job if my current boss is breathing down my neck about it, but I also now feel iffy about reaching out to this guy behind her back for fear that she'll find out (and regrettably, I do need this job, because I'm doing my masters thesis with them).

My wife works for one of the largest insurance companies in the US. She scheduled her maternity leave and communicated her start and return dates to her manager. Although her manager is an older woman who has been with the company for nearly 20 years, she has only been a manager for about a year and admitted to my wife that this is the first time she's had an employee go in leave so she's still trying to figure out how it works. My wife then started her leave the day our son was born in early December with her scheduled return date being the end of February.

The day after she started her leave, her manager texted her on her personal phone saying ""I need you to log in and resubmit something for your license."" Having gone through such a major life event and being totally exhausted, my wife was very frustrated that she was being told to do something work related and even more upset at the complete lack of empathy as her manager didn't even acknowledge the fact that she was asking her to do something knowing full well she was sitting in a hospital bed. She chose not to respond and complete the task upon her return.

About a week later my wife was texted again by her manager asking when she would be returning to work. At this point, my wife and I were struggling with severe sleep deprivation that comes with a newborn. Seeing a pattern starting to form, my wife reached out to NY Life who was handling her maternity leave claim including FMLA and short term disability. They informed her that her manager should not be reaching out to her (especially to complete tasks) and that they would contact her employer to get them the information they need. She was told not to respond.

Her manager continued to reach out weekly from that point asking when she's returning to work. NY Life continued to tell her they would handle it and not to respond.

Finally in early February her manager sent a text demanding a phone call saying she was expected to be back to work and had not shown up. At this point my wife was dealing with postpartum depression but feared she could lose her job by not responding so called anyway. On that call her manager said she had no idea when my wife would be returning to work. My wife told her that it was all documented with NY Life and to contact them. After her manager refused and said it was my wife's responsibility to be in constant direct communication while on leave, my wife then verbally told her all the same dates that were previously communicated to her regarding her leave. My wife said ""I'm a bit frustrated that you have been contacting me when this was already communicated to you."" To which her manager responded saying my wife was being condescending and unprofessional and then hung up on her.

On my wife's first day back to work she reached out to get manager (she works remotely) saying her passwords had expired and she could not log in. Her manager responded immediately saying she would work on it and to give her a few minutes. Her manager didn't respond again all day so my wife reached out again at the end of the day asking for an update. When get manager responded the next day she said she would work on her access issues when my wife returned to work. When my wife reminded her that she returned yesterday her manager said ""she forgot"" and that she would work on getting her access immediately.

With all of that being said my wife is now being told she must pay for license renewal out of pocket since she didn't renew it while on leave, she is not getting paid for any of her time spent on her first day back as she troubleshooted with IT all day trying to log in because her manager didn't know she was supposed to be working, and on top of that she was written up for being unprofessional while on leave.

Shouldn't my wife be protected in some way under FMLA/short term disability? HR told her that her manager did nothing wrong here but this feels like retaliation to me. If anyone has any guidance they could give I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm at a loss at this point..."

He’s also not telling anyone about mistakes anymore. We have a technical procedure that step by step tells you what to error check for and it wasn’t discovered until he was out. He also is the type to suffer in silence until the final hour than ask questions the longer he’s here because he feels he should “get it” by now. I can definitely empathize with that so I do offer guidance proactively.

My manager and other managers know about it but they aren’t taking action or setting him up for better success.

My body hurts, some of my co workers do not help me (despite us been told numerous times that ""If you have free time, help someone else""). Don't get me wrong, some workers are nice enough to help me and I always help when I have the free time but they are starting to not care to help me at all leaving me do more than what I signed up for..by a lot...far too frequently now. The managers don't say anything to them either, they just watch. Sometimes my entire area goes for a small break and I'm still working (if I take a break, the entire fast food place lacks behind). Thinking of moving to an office job in which it won't be as physically demanding.

2,2023-03-03,Advice re: PIP,u/KitMix5532,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11h9wk4/advice_re_pip/,jobs,"I’ve been given a PIP. The document has provable factual inaccuracies &amp; says things about me that just flat out aren’t true. I’m being asked to sign it via DocuSign but I don’t really want to sign it without being able to write in comments pointing out the errors in the document. I’m really uncomfortable signing something that is inaccurate - especially since it’s going to be in my employment file.

Can I print out the PIP, add my comments, sign it, put it into a PDF and send it back? (I don’t want to ask for permission.)

Backstory: I’ve been at my company for several years. Have always had positive reviews, and have received merit increases every year. Covid has been tough for our organization, and it’s been much harder to close deals. My whole team across the country, and my counterparts in every market are seeing the same thing. This past year none of us quite reached our goal - though we were all close.

My supervisor got promoted, and now I report to someone new. The new supervisor put me on a PIP after only a few meetings. Part of it was me not reaching my goals - but no one else on my team reached their goals either &amp; I’m doubtful that they got PIPs. I don’t think my supervisor was properly briefed on the work I’ve been doing, and made a lot of assumptions - and this is why the PIP is so inaccurate.

My boss has been trying to get my pumped for this possible promotion for a bit. I did apply and had 2 interviews. They are down to myself and another candidate.

The are bringing in the other candidate for a 2 hour tour of the business. They asked myself and other managers to interact and possibly have lunch with the candidate.

I did request that I also get a 3rd interview since they are and my boss agreed. I did bring to my boss attention that I am in full support of whoever they bring into this role since I truly want the best candidate. I did express my concerns that I am not sure how I feel about giving feedback on someone when I am also going for the same role. My boss told me “I am giving you the opportunity to interview an individual that could potentially be your boss. And the questions you ask could provide more insight into if this person could be a good fit or not”.

Couple questions am I clearly out of the running? Also, is it wrong for my boss to push this on me when I expressed my concerns?

1. If a job posting has a spot for you to put in your work experience, but also submit your resume, will my application just be skipped over if I submit my resume, but skip entering the same information manually?
2. During interviews, when they ask ""Describe a time you were frustrated and how you resolved the situation?"" Do they want a highly specific answer or a general idea of what you did? I feel like I either over explain or under explain. I'll go into a lot of detail about my previous work that may the interviewer may have no idea what I am talking about because its a different career, or I'll be  overly general and sound like a generic answer that doesn't inform them. How do you personally answer this?
3. What do they do if they ask for references from a direct supervisor and I have none? A lot of my older jobs had toxic managers that I did not get along with that I can't really use. 
4. When and where in the conversation do I ask about compensation if they don't bring it up?
5. Often at the end of interviews they ask if I have any questions, and I don't know what to ask. What are some usual answers?   


I am sure I will have more questions but thats all I can think of for now. Thank you for all the help!"

I recently got a job to set up a PC gaming arcade, and I've been excited to get started. I've gone out a few times to the location to take a look and advise on the placement of the PCs and recommend a layout. However, I wasn't paid for this advice, which I find concerning.

Last week, I worked for the owner for six hours and asked to be paid $18 an hour. However, I've realized that this rate is lower than what I should be making. I think I should have been making at least $25 an hour.

I'm not sure how to go about asking for this new rate without coming across as rude or unprofessional. I don't want to jeopardize my working relationship with the owner, but I also don't want to continue working for less than what I'm worth.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you handle it? What's the best way to ask for a higher rate without offending the person you're working for?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

idk if I should pursue masters or higher education (but honestly I want to do it for me and the right time). And I have thought about it before I leave this earth I do want to h pursue all my goals in life which I think it does include education. I was thinking if not SLP probably become a counselor (pursue social work or something) 

I also have other drams as well like model, actress, art (sketching/drawing), become influencer (social media), open a business. But I know I have to be realistic too."

The last time we talked they said I could pick a day to start training and I said I would really like to have Saturday off but any other day would work.

What do you guys think about this, does it seem like a reasonable ask of a completely new hire? I had already made commitments to drive some way away and spend valuable time with family. I said sorry I have plans that can't change, and they said that they didn't have anyone to cover the store and needed me to come in anyways. I don't feel committed to this $9/hour job to make serious sacrifices, what do I do?

I was offered a job 2 weeks ago that I accepted and I am starting Monday.  I was just told I will have another offer from the place I want to work Thursday.

Do I tell the business that I am not comming in Monday as I accepted another job   note. I do not have the offer yet but 95 percent sure I will.

Or do I go in there to work and quit once I have the other offer?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit.  Thank you all so much for the advice it looks like going in is the better option according to everyone so far.  Anyone think the first option?

I was honestly just so burnout and overworked to the point where I was considering checking myself into a psychiatric institution because I was having extremely dark thoughts. Both jobs required me working 12+ hours a day and had extremely high turnover rates. I was working as a Business Analyst in IT for both roles and both were fully remote.

The jobs I worked were so disorganized, had no training, no work/life balance, my managers wouldn't even show up to 1:1's or answer my messages. I currently have no back up plan. I am looking into maybe going to get my masters in another business field or maybe studying something completely different. I am also contemplating possibly just trying to find another entry level business role and hope that it has good training + work/life balance. I'm trying to use this time to just figure out what I want to do and to get help with my mental struggles because I reached a breaking point. 

How difficult is it going to be for me to find another job since I quit 2 jobs in less than a year and now am going to have a gap while I figure things out. I'm only 22 so I know my life isn't over or anything but I am getting a little worried. I'd appreciate any advice."

My manager kept setting up meetings with his boss to discuss my role but the director would just ignore it or never give a concrete answer, even though my position is very needed as my manager and his team needed all hands on deck.

This would have been a chance to find out there was no wfh and the job title was not the same. I show up on my first day and find the title is actually admin assistant and no WFH days, I was in shock that it was completely different than described. It led to a pretty awkward conversation with me and HR when I was trying to get more info on the WFH days, which I was told ""oh no you don't get to work from home"". I tried to stick with the job, but my education and experience were far too advanced for this position, they micromanaged me like I was an incompetent high-schooler (i.e. was asked to make a monthly calender on word, I made a really nice one and they made me change it all because they didn't like the font colors etc., telling me I didn't complete my work correctly and when I went back to check it was done correctly. Just generally treating me as incompetent when I was over qualified for the position to begin with ), lots of whispering and office gossip made me super uncomfortable, HR were weird and kept track of me using the restroom, among other things. I quit on Monday of the second week because 1) the job title and responsibilities were different than originally stated, 2) no WFH days as promised. 3) other issues mentioned. The whole thing felt like a sham. I felt so guilty for quitting but I think I was justified. Idk it all felt super off to me. What do you guys think?"

My prior work experience is all over the place, from emergency services to politics to business. In October, I was laid off from the firm and have spent the months since doing applications to no avail. I have applied through LinkedIn, indeed, and directly through company sites. I even had a professional firm tailor my resume and cover letter.

I have decided that what I want to do is investigations for the federal government (1811 positions). Those on the r/1811 sub have been helpful. However, these roles take months to years to get. In the meantime i’m looking to pivot into potential entry level roles that will help in the 1811 hiring process. These roles are Investigator, Investigative Analyst, Intelligence Analyst, Regulatory/Government Affairs, Risk Analyst, or Compliance Analyst. I’m looking for these roles in New England.

However I haven't been trained on much and only have around 2 to 3 tickets a week. My manager also says certs are theoretical and that hes been in the same job for 20 years and doesnt have any. The teams are also siloed and some people on different teams haven't said anything to me since I've been there. Not sure on career progression since most people have been there 15 to 25 years.

However, my dad says I should stay and even if I leave for a job that pays more that's thinking short term. The pension would pay out 33k after 30 years, but he's saying I could also make 45k a year if my salary were to go up to 75k, and I would get yearly cost of living adjustments which companies in the private sector don't often do. Rent is also high at 1500 month. But, my family says if I move to a bigger city and make more: the taxes,gas, car insurance, food, rent insurance, etc will all be 2 to 3 times more expensive so it wouldn't be worth it.

He also said the private sector may have poor work life balance, id hate my job, have to travel, or be on call. I'm also worried with the huge layoffs going on of taking a job somewhere and being let go after 2 months for no reason because I've had that happen before.

For instance, I had this remote role interview me for 70 to 75k. But, it's a small startup cloud msp that is still in stage 4 of funding and only has 100 employees. In the interview they also stated they had management problems before with culture issues with personality clashes but things have improved in the last few months. But, anytime I do get an interview it's with a company like that. So, my dad keeps saying to stop thinking things are better and thinking the grass is greener on the side.

My friend suggested to leave because not many people stay at 1 place, I'm not learning much, workplace sounds toxic, and I could make more so why stay at 1 place 30 years. But I would have to contribute double or triple each month to a 401k to get even close to the return of the pension.

So, should I try looking for other jobs or am I thinking the grass is greener on the other side? I have comptia trio, ccna, and Microsoft Azure certs, so I feel I can find something better, but I've had poor luck with applications lately. I filled out 100 apps and got 2 interviews. So I'm not sure if I should take that 70k job that seems suspect or keep looking?"

Last week I finally got an employer offer letter through a well known job search engine. The email was very professional and the manager replied when he could and only during business hours. Things became sketchy when he mailed a check to me to buy office supplies and my first weeks pay. The check was from a different company but looked legitimate. The manager told me to take the check to the bank and follow up after it cleared. When it cleared the following day, I emailed him and he said that he had a contact from an office supply company that could process everything I needed to get started. He asked that I send a portion of the money to his supplier so that they could build the order and ship it out. The contact was a personal email address and the red flags went up. The manager said that he had the person on the phone and started to rush the process. Like an idiot, I sent them a portion of the money through my bank account. As soon as I sent it I knew I had made a mistake. I looked at the picture of the check I took and immediately called the company on the check. When the company manager answered he began telling me that something happened to their bank account and they were looking into it. I informed them that I was hired by the company and they sent me the check. He had no connection to the hiring company and that I had a fraudulent check. I immediately reported it to the bank and told them everything and gave them all the emails and messages between myself and the fraud. I’ve been working my butt off trying to catch up on bills and haven’t made it to the bank. They have now closed all of my accounts and for some reason deducted double the amount of the check from my account. They also disabled my mobile banking so I can’t access anything. I am devastated and feel like I’ve failed. I’m totally screwed now and am becoming very depressed. I plan to go to the police and file a report when I get back to my state. I’ve been playing the fraud and acting like I’ve been having issues sending the remaining money. He is still thinking he will get it. I wanted to keep him on the line for the police department but I think it is fueling my depression. I don’t know what to do. It really makes me sad to know that there’s people out there that are such trash. I just want to give up."

Once, because i was stressed/tired because of a tight deadline. The second time was for a work sexual harassment issue that he was very empathetic about. And i thought twice was enough. But this week (and over the span of 6 months) i cried a third time....

This time I worked really hard to make a deadline only to have it fall apart anyways and i got criticized in an email for being ""late"" by the head of one of our departments. It was something out of my control but no one cared (other than my boss who was nice about it). but as we were talking about it i started tearing up and had to wipe my tears right infront of my boss. He didn't mention the crying but was very understanding and empathetic about the situation (he stood up for me in his e-mail to the person who critiscized me)

He was very nice each time but three times now i think has completely ruined any credibility I have at this company. Is there any way to have him take me seriously despite being emotional? For context i'm 26F. Should  I start looking for a new job if my reputation has potentially been ruined. Also, my boss is an older guy: in his 50's.

Thank-you for any advice or insight!"

I’ve been in my new position for about a month now, as an assistant in a corporate office. I work with several different managers helping them with their work. Most everyone has been great to work with- they’re very helpful and thorough with explaining processes and helping me to learn their computer system (which is new to me). 

However, there is unfortunately one individual I am struggling with. She doesn’t take the time to really train me in her area of the business as thoroughly as the others, doesn’t really show me how to do things in the system like others do. I feel a bit like with her, I’ve gotten thrown into things to learn on my own, and it’s become extremely stressful. Almost every time I do a task for her, I have to reconfirm exactly what I’m supposed to do because it’s unclear. Sometimes, she doesn’t even answer me if it’s a question done via email (we often work remote so this is the only option). I constantly am doing things wrong and then sending them out to other people in the company and even to our overseas partners incorrectly. There’s been times where she doesn’t fully tell me the way it’s supposed to be done until after I’ve already done it (incorrectly) and then sent it out - things I never would have known without being told. I’ve wasted a lot of time because of this, and have caused myself a lot of anxiety. It feels like she wants me to learn by figuring things out on my own and by learning from my mistakes, but for me this just doesn’t work. 

I’m not used to making so many mistakes at work - and with the other people I report to, it isn’t happening and everything has been great. I’m not sure how to approach this as I see her quite frequently and don’t want to make things awkward by complaining to her higher up but I don’t know what else I could do. I’ve never been in a situation where I feel like I’m being set up to fail. Advice is appreciated."

I didn’t study history to do factory work. My field won’t make any good money, the job I thought I wanted is a lot different in reality. I disappoint myself by working this job because it’s a nonsense factory job. I didn’t go to college to do this. My degree has not helped me once.

I don’t really like people. I work in a factory. I don’t care for being nice or mean. I’m indifferent. I’m there to get my paycheck. Nothing more. I’m not passionate about this job. I can be happy on my off days. This is how I’ll be until I find something new.

I do walk around angry because things don’t go the way they need to go. But I have also made severe mistakes at work and have a bit of a reputation for negative things. It’s pretty clear I’m just there for money. I only want to move up in the business to get more money so I can pay bills and buy things that will make me happy. 

My manager has hope in me for some reason but I’m stubborn and don’t really think my mindset is wrong. The money is all that matters. If someone is a screwup, fire them. It’s simple. Even for me, if they had a problem they should have just fired me instead of wasting time trying to improve me. He’s spent months trying to “help.”

I believe people are tools in the workplace and that friendliness is unnecessary. Especially in a workplace with no customers. Why would I bother being fake? I hate this job and only want to do the bare minimum so I do not get fired. 

My manager is worried if I don’t change my mindset that my mental health and attitude will just get worse and worse over time until I quit out of anger, do something to get fired, or go off the deep end and go crazy. 

My parents say they’re proud of me that I moved out and make money but they also tell me everybody hates their job and it’s just something you do for money. But they also don’t know the bad things I’ve done at work. I’m not gonna tell them either. 

How do I change this mindset?"

What should I do?,u/Imtryingmybest0987,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11hrxwj/theyre_giving_me_a_raise_but_i_want_to_quit_what/,jobs,"Background: October of 2022, I was hired as a marketing assistant for this fashion brand. I was hired as a contractor through a staffing agency so there’s no benefits, etc. My rate: $26/hour. It was only a 1 month assignment so I didn’t mind the pay. 

First week of December, employer told me they love and are super impressed with my work that they promoted me to Marketing Coordinator. I was happy because promotion usually means a raise but I didn’t get any. AND the director told me that for 6 months, I would have to be a freelancer because that’s how their “hr” worked. 

I called the staffing agency to see if they could at least give me a slight raise because the brand did promote me for the coordinator role WITH MORE responsibilities. Staffing agency told me that they tried but the brand don’t have the budget. Whatever. I tried, i needed the money so i suck it up. 

Fast forward to today, March 2023: I am burned out. For the past 3 weeks, I’ve been working 50-60 hours per week and even working on federal holidays so I can catch up. I would start work at 9 and sometimes end at midnight because they keep piling up projects for me. As a marketing coordinator, I am: processing invoice, creating retail assets (idk why because we have the graphic design team for that), helping out with PR, leading marketing campaigns, assisting with drafting contracts for influencers, packaging PR gifts, owning the TikTok channel (again, idk why when we have a social media manager), administrative tasks, checking in 300+ pieces of clothing samples, Google analytics, Narvar, simplifying a lot of their processes, improving their excel usage, and a whole lot more. I am exhausted. All for $26/hr. 

Two weeks ago, i told my manager that i was overwhelmed and was wondering if some stuff can be taken off my plate. Two days later, director had a meeting with the team for the role duties of everyone in the team and they didn’t take away anything off my plate. In fact, they added more. 

So i immediately called the staffing agency to let them know that I want to start getting job ads sent to me again because i am open to work and ready to leave this job. It was taking a toll on my mental + physical health. Plus, i want to have a remote role now because I am the caretaker for my sick parents and commuting 3 hours per day doesn’t help with my already long hours. BUT i don’t think the staffing agency listened to me when i said i wanted to leave because they called my director to give me a raise last week. My director immediately pulled a time from my calendar for a meeting next week for a raise. First, my employer didn’t take things off my plate then my staffing agency wouldn’t send me any new job ads. Seems like no one wants to listen to me ?!!

I have the meeting on Thursday. March is my 5th month with this company (remember the 6th month rule?) so i think they want me to be a full time with the brand now and potentially a raise. But the thing is, even with a raise,i am not staying at the company because I now prioritize my life, my parents, etc. 

I’ve been applying to new roles ofc but I know that takes a while. 

Question: what should i tell my employer on my meeting on Thursday? Accept the full time role with the raise (hopefully), and then dip immediately once i find something better? OR tell them I’m not interested but then they might fire me because why would they want me working there if I’m not staying long anyway? Does that make sense?

Thanks all. I’m really really exhausted."

Potential new job is same pay ($60k) and less time off than my current position (2 weeks vs. 3 weeks paid). They offer 401k and sick time though. Commute time is cut by about 20 mins. From 55 to 36. 

I feel like because my current job has 401k + pension I need to stay, but I am unhappy with the amount of work I do for the pay. I have too many sub-jobs I’m expected to do plus now I need to lead my team with no extra pay compensation. I have asked my manager if I’m getting a pay bump since new associate hires are getting paid more ($55k) and he said no. 

So basically I worked my ass off for 3 years to be only paid $5k more than a complete new hire with no experience. 

The other company is very small, around 40 employees. My current company is a fortune 200. Both are essential businesses that would not go out of business any time soon.

I found this strange because everyone on my team that knows me understands that I put in the work consistently each day and am always happy to help others. Well, apparently my supervisor told me my performance was at standard and I did get a small pay bump but not promotion. 

Then, all of a sudden my supervisor breaks the discussion and gets very angry and upset with me. They told me the walls have ears and information is being shared to him that can hurt his reputation and he will take action if he needs to if I am the one sharing information that hurts the image of the company.

After that conversation I was shocked that they made the accusation against me without showing me evidence or sharing exactly what information is being shared. I have not been able to sleep tonight and now am considering moving on from the company because I don’t feel valued or receive the recognition for helping others on the team. I didn’t get into discussion with him in the meeting because I felt completely blindsided in the meeting and was processing what was going on (I’m still processing this issue, but I’ve decided that I will need to move on)."

Basically, I got my undergraduate degree last May and had a bit of a hard time finding any motivation or serious work for months. I started to get things together when I found out I had the ability to afford a graduate degree, and of course that's when my job search started to improve as well.

I am getting accepted into lots of excellent programs in cities I'd love to live in. I'm craving a change of scenery and I love the academic environment, so returning to school to learn about the field I love is extremely appealing. Not only that, but due to more complicated social reasons, I'd rather not live in the Midwest.

As luck would have it, I received a job offer in the field that I want to get into and it pays pretty well. The field, urban planning/economic development, is heavily reliant on networking. So, this is a great position and opportunity to make some connections (and money!), but I would probably still go to grad school in the fall. Is it wrong of me to accept this position knowing I'll likely leave in 5-6 months? If I work hard and make good impressions, will I ultimately burn those bridges if I leave?

Thank you for the input, I'm very conflicted.

I'm skilled with computers, but have no formal training or certificates.  Other than that, I really don't have any applicable experience.  I'm looking for advice on what to do when I'm filling out applications with such an empty long gap.  My current plan is to simply say, give me a chance in an interview and you will see my value.  Any other advice would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance."

1,2023-03-04,How to choose between two internships?,u/5393hill,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11hveor/how_to_choose_between_two_internships/,jobs,"I have two internship offers right now. The internships right now are for a career change, with me starting college this fall.

Offer A: Is with a company with many offices throughout the state.  Start date is late May. In a city 3 hours away.

Offer B: Is with a smaller company. But still good reputation in the area. The biggest pro is that it is less than a two minute's commute to where I live right now.  I can start in two weeks. I can work with them during school year/next summer.

Neutrals: Both companies were  recommended to me by the college where I will be going to this fall/pay is the same/ both offer what  I am looking for the internships/ both work with the DNR &amp; DOTs/ both companies offered on the spot offers/ both said they hope this turns into a full time job after my two year program ends.

Biggest con for me at the moment is that I would have to move twice in a 4 month period if I take offer A. But offer A has more offices I can transfer to. 

Either way, I have till March 6, 2023 to let them know one way or the other.  The college program I plan on doing I will have to move to a city 1.5 hours from where live now.

I am currently leaning towards offer B because of how close it is, but offer A sounds like it has more options. 

How else should I narrow this down? Or why I should consider offer A more.

Edit: I took offer B"

Hi All,

I am considering a career change in Data Science and have been doing some research into what

the wages are like in the industry. I have come across a lot of recruitment company job ads with published daily rates of $800 plus super per day.

I believe these are mainly consultancy jobs on short duration contracts, I don't seem to see any other jobs advertised directly by employers/consulting companies at this rate. I wanted to ask if this is legitimate?"

For context, I am a strategy consultant and I constantly work 75-80 hours a week. I work in a southern european office and unfortunately these hours are quite common.

I am also a first gen and my family is extremely low income (example: I never did any vacation until I started working), with both my parents being farmers.

I know this is not a healthy life but I just scored 740 in gmat (last weeks were super hard as I was also studying in the weekends on top of my job) so in 1.5 years I think there is a good chance I enter a M7, given I am also a top performer at work and I recently became the youngest manager ever in my firm.

I guess 90% of people won't relate with this post, but for those who do, I would love to learn strategies/tips to make my life healthier for the next 1.5 years to avoid burnout or similar consequences"

I was very excited to work here because I knew all my coworkers from before and i get along with them very well. The problem is that I have been feeling very anxious lately (in and out work hours) due to my boss behaviour. 
The other day when we were revising my work together, he found a mistake and got so mad that he punched the computer screen. In other ocassion i knocked on his door, get in and found him watching p#rn. He usually screams when he finds something done wrong and looks angry and nervous all of the time.
Yesterday I felt so anxious I didn't want to leave the office in case I saw him.
I don't know what to do, should i look for another job  should I talk with him? The insecurity of this being my first job gives me the idea that im not going to land another one in such a short amount of time without the propper experience."

I posted here about a pm position for a local general contractor and I ended up getting the job! No college degree and just 5 years experience in construction. I am super stoked to start and learn a bunch of new things.

With that said.. I gave my two weeks notice as soon as I signed the offer. I am the only experienced person left in my department. All the others have left because of the boss. He's condescending and a stickler for the rules.

He didn't take it very well. He said well you could have gotten promoted here as well you know. Even though I was passed up for the position he's in. He's not my original boss. He asked me to stay until one of the jobs that just came in is done and I agreed. My next employer wanted to be clear they would be more than happy to give my current employer all the time they need.

Fast forward a couple days anytime I talk he says if you're just going to talk I'll kick you out. I said to him this two weeks notice is for you not for me..I'll be just fine I have plenty of vacation.

Then I'm coming back from lunch and I was two minutes late (not an uncommon or abnormal thing not usually a problem) and he says just because you're leaving doesn't mean you can break the rules. I said I left to lunch a little late and he argued with me and I just took the stay silent approach.

How would you guys handle these last two weeks I now currently have ahead of me?

Thank you"

And I really dislike this job but let's hear it. Am I being sensitive or is this actually toxic? 

It's a big tech company and started from day 1. There was no real on boarding. Just thrown into watching training videos for weeks. 

The job itself is nothing what I expected or that was described. I feel like I've been thrown on projects that don't utilize my expertise. Needing to learn skills that don't transfer. 

Manager seems out of touch and only wants to meet their metrics. Talked about what work I want to do but no change. Or change for the worse.

Nobody really talks or works together. I have yet to made any connection with anyone as everyone is siloed and top busy with their work.

There is no structure. Stories that are handed to me seem to be copy paste vague comments from a meeting.

We have meetings all hours, all days. (9pm, Sundays you name it). Oversea teams but also very unstructured and can be booked the same day.

I've also been put on 3 projects with tight deadlines that were set by someone else. And these are hard deadlines. Where you're expected to ""just get the work done"". No matter the cost. So many people here seem to just work a lot more than the 8 hours.

When writing this I realize this is just toxic. But is there any way to tackle it than finding another job? And does anyone recognize this in big tech or somewhere else? Or was this just bad lack joining a toxic team"

Usually, there would only be two people working in a shop together, and I can't believe how overwhelmed I've felt already from having to memorize and remember too many things at once, I feel like my head's gonna explode.

While I'm still learning, I find that I work best with written rules, but the job I'm having is a ""learn as you go"" kind of thing. I also wasn't aware that it's a semi-hard selling job and that I always have to stop whatever I'm doing like stocking and follow the customer around. I'm not being told these in an interview call with my boss (whom I've only met her in person on the third day), and not even being given details that I have to constantly APPROACH the customers and push them to buy our products. God. I like talking to people but I do have my social energy too.

Even if the customer doesn't need any assistance, I'm still being pushed by my manager to look over them and I can sort of feel their slight annoyance to this. I feel them. Imagine having to tell the sales assistant to fuck off lime 3 times in a row so you could shop in peace. I can't do much unfortunately. 

Besides that, we have a tax change in our government this year and I still have to manually change the price on the POS system and it's already March. Huh? This only gives me a slight inconvenience especially as a newbie myself because then I'd have to remember the price. Too many things to memorize, hallmark greeting cards currency conversion, measuring gifts and estimating the price, and pushing customers to join a membership. 

I'm always going home feeling terrible and stupid because I seem to frustrate my manager. I'm always being told I must remember almost everything, remember passwords, codes, membership detais. If I made a mistake he'd go, ""But I taught you that! Why can't you remember?? You can't do this.""

It's not my first time working in a retail environment because I've worked in a bookstore before and I was MORE SANE than I am working in this gift shop for now. I mean, at least in a bookstore I can leave these customers alone unless asked and I can focus ONE THING AT A TIME. I was working as a team with multiple people whom I can rely and ask general questions as a newbie without feeling bad or making them annoyed. I can still remember general things and I don't have to memorize every single deals, memberships or whatever either. The reason I left from that bookstore was because it was a temporary job that was closing down soon and the salary was super low.

So anyways, am I being too overly stressed out? Are these red flags?"

I'm also doing my masters additionally to woking full-time.
I'm basically doing work of a Junior Brand Manager - which will be the next step.

Last week I've had a yearly self-assessment with my manager. Basically, she told me a lot of good things, like me being organised and structured, goal-oriented, diligent, communicating with distributors/agencies/HQ well and working independently.

The last bit surprised me, because one of my main problems was that I always had to double check things with my superiors before making a move, even little things. But it did get better now.

What she said I have to improve though (and I agree) is my self-confidence. She said it in many nice words but the message was to grow a spine and don't appear as a pushover/stop being so nice.

I also feel like I can do better. I have trouble speaking up in meetings, voicing my ideas, and I get easily swayed if someone is pushy. I am honestly just scared of appearing as rude, disrespectful or stupid.

Honestly I feel like my low position and young age are the main issues. When I work on group projects in my university, for example, I am not afraid to take initiative/speak up/argue for my idea etc. Even my friend said they could feel I was angry when someone didn't do their part.

My situation was over Christmas break where I am on travel for work for an extended time (5 months). I was required to be within 30 minutes - 1 hour away from the work premise. There wasn't a set time for on-call, it was expected to be 24/7 for 2 weeks. I wasn't able to spend time with my family over what was considered ""lockdown"". I was expected to respond to any request, though none happened, at any point in the day.   


My standard hours worked each day is 9. My manager told me I was supposed to charge for 9 hours. I asked if I could visit my family over Christmas and it was denied, same as new years, my dads birthday and my birthday (they all fall in the same week). Our workplace pushes all holidays to the end the of year so we get a long end of the year holiday break. I was able to charge part of that time as holiday time, but I still wasn't able to use my private time any way I wanted. Basically confined to a hotel room for 2 weeks. I was one of about 5 people who didn't get to go home for the holidays.  


Would it be illogical to charge 24 hours each day for those 2 weeks while on-call?

0,2023-03-04,Did I just get screwed over?,u/leozaid1991,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11i8xaa/did_i_just_get_screwed_over/,jobs,"Working as a Sr. Project Manager at a med-tech firm and just had my review after completing a year and I'm not entirely sure what to make of it.

The job I interviewed for and joined was L4 level and asked for 15 years experience. I only had 7 years but the hiring manager went ahead with me anyway cos ""character &gt; experience"". 6/7 months in, My title randomly changed in some of the systems from Sr. Project Manager to Sr. Program Manager and I asked to clarifythat a while back so they changed it back to Sr. project manager. 

I was reporting to the VP until 3 months ago until he introduced a layer as all his other reports were Director level. My new boss, a Director, asked me to trust him to take me where I want. And that I just need to be a little patient while I continue doing the great work. I will be getting the title I want along with the increase in level back to where it was. 

At my review with the director, I was told that they are ""right sizing"" that across the company now and I've been shifted to Level 3 as a result, which had comps maxed at ~$170k for my role. Since I'm making more than that but they won't cut it to the max in the range. However, my 4% merit increase would be in the form of a one time lumpsum bonus amount as I'm above the max in the range. If I was at L4, I would've had that reflect in my base salary. More importantly, they could pull this on me again next year and say I'm already maxed. 

I got a 150% bonus for individual contribution and a decent overall review so it's likely not about my performance. It just feels like a demotion and I'm getting screwed over for something that was broken for no fault of mine even though they've kept my title, my pay the same and given me refreshers.

I trusted my org and love the culture and people here but this just feels wrong. Am I missing something?

Would love some perspective."

With reorganization comes the possibility of job loss. I am on a team of 2 and both our jobs could be seen as a bit redundant. We create forecasts that don’t get used for anything.

My coworker on the other hand constantly brings up the reorg and how we are “definitely getting let go”. We recently met with our VP and my coworker brought up our two positions and presented it in a way that makes us sound unneeded. I wanted to intervene and tell them to speak for themselves but it really wasn’t the time for it.

I guess what I’m asking is how do i navigate this situation i want to tell them to stop worrying about it and to just keep working because in the end we have no control. But I also feel like its not my responsibility. I spoke to my supervisor about all this and they told me “thats just who they are and to not let it bother me” but it is bothering me because it’s starting to make me worried."

For context, I have around 2 years off and on professional work experience, with a little over a year working at a full time job. 

Even though I work one full time contract job, I’m only making $25.5k a year there. That means I am also working a second job on the weekends to supplement extra pay to help with rent/groceries, etc. in total I make around $29k-$30k a year. Due to both jobs being fairly seasonal, during the winter months I bring in an average of around $1k total, although that gets supplemented in the summer where I was making about $3,500-$4,000 on average. A consistent full time salary where I at least get weekends off would be nice. 

Any job/career suggestions would be much appreciated as well.

A few general things:

* I have a disability - I am completely deaf in my right ear.  As a software engineer, this doesn't affect my performance in any meaningful way.  I'm guessing most places want to hire some to get some kind of federal benefits (I'm based in the US) and I know they aren't \*supposed\* to discriminate based on that, but we all know that discrimination when it comes to applications is incredibly common.  So, should I mark that I do on applications or not?
* I've heard people say the best option when prompted for salary requirements is to leave it blank when possible, and if it's required either put ""negotiable"" or ""0"" depending on the input requirement.

On the tech side:

* What's the best way to search?  My previous title was Software Developer I.  I've used a combination of indeed, glassdoor, and dice.  This isn't new to me having experience in the field, but is there some best way to do this?  I end up scrolling through tons of dumb bootcamp ""jobs"", and a bunch of Senior positions I'm not qualified for, however in my experience, most of the options to filter something like ""mid level"" are iffy at best.  I've tried searching using the language(s) I'm most proficient, but that still leaves me with the same problem.
* At my level (a few years of prof exp), what are people's reads or opinions on how open companies are to hiring if you are less familiar with their stack?  Obviously, if you know one, it's just a matter of learning new syntax, libraries, efficiencies, and that isn't nothing, but it's also not a huge hassle.  I had to pick up multiple APIs, languages, IDEs, and applications for my previous job, and while it took some time, none of it was particularly challenging.  Should I apply to anything that's roughly at my experience level?  I know it might depend company to company, but there's so many tools, languages, programs, etc that it seems insane that any place would have hard requirements for someone at my experience level - I'm not applying to FAANG companies here."

It started off really great I was making double minimum wage and asked for a minimum of 20 hours a week, they started scheduling me for 25 to 30 hours a week and even got one of my friends to start working here.
About a month and a half into the job I broke my finger and was out of a job for about a month which was a hit to my finances as I need to purchase a vehicle.

When I came back I was getting around 20 hours a week which was fine but over about a month they've drastically cut my hours regardless of me working my ass off even when the managers aren't watching (I have been getting compliments and tips from the servers due to this) and one of the managers has been rather hostile towards me.
It's gotten to the point where I've been scheduled for 4.5 hours next week and have been asking to be cross trained on other positions and they said they would and nothing has come of it.
I cant help but have a feeling that a new busser who likes to talk about people behind their backs (I have had a few friends who has the same class as him has been talking about me being lazy and not doing my job, nobody liking me, etc and he does this talking about other workers to me) has been getting over 30 hours of weeks despite his poor performance has been due to some sort of sabotage. 

I have been thinking of quitting recently but I'm afraid that if I do that only working there for less than 6 months and barely getting this job due to retention I wouldn't be able to find another job thats even close to the money I make here.
I'm feel stuck here and am not sure what to do any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR; Job barely giving me any hours despite asking for more and trying to find solutions with the managers."

I’ve had couple positions in university but haven’t had the opportunity to get real work experience in this field. I’ve been unemployed for ~10 months now and received around 30-40 interviews, several where I decided to cancel, many where I failed either to get past the phone screen or do poorly in the 2nd, and a handful of final interviews where the company decided to move forward with another candidate. 

I’ve always struggled to communicate my ideas clearly in many aspects of my life and it’s obvious this is negatively affecting my ability to get a job. I’m not good at selling myself. I’ve practiced the behavioral questions quite a bit but if there’s an unexpected question that catches me off guard, I stumble over my words and the interview ends up progressing poorly after that. 

I’ve had multiple interviews now where I get an interviewer that comes across as uninterested, cold, and unfriendly. I do poorly in them.

Hello guys, thanks in advance for any useful feedback or sharing your own experience.

So I had a bank job in Loans dept for about 6 years until I quit a few months ago. By then, I had tanked my credit score to about 620. ( 75% utilization ) ( approx 38k out of 53k ), mostly CC debt. Payment history is about 90% on time. 

I had to quit to visit my home country as my father was not doing so good health wise. 

I am back now, and I've given a few interviews that have gone really well. In all the positions, i will have access to the bank's corporate accounts with 100s of millions and also the swift payment system. But it's not like it's possible to steal anything or send some money to your personal account.

My main concern is the credit check part of the background check that banks do. That may be the only thing getting in the way of me getting a job or even my old job back. 

So please, if anyone in the bank HR or someone with a similar experience would like to share or advise.

PS- I know. I've messed up by overspending and quitting a good job, like a complete food and deserving of anything coming my way. I'm honestly  just waiting to be put out of my misery."

1,2023-03-04,I don't know if I messed up or not switching careers.,u/disisdashiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11iljtr/i_dont_know_if_i_messed_up_or_not_switching/,jobs,"So I've been in Medicare remote wfh since covid. Sales. I was making $17 hourly w commission which ended up being 45k annually. I felt I could earn more at other places. So I decided to look elsewhere. Within Medicare. You can't easily switch to another company. You gotta wait at least 6 months before you are able to go somewhere else once you quit. The carriers and the upline don't allow it

. So I figured I'd find ssomething. Got a gig canvassing fiber. Made decent money but my knees don't let me do it full time anymore. I kept looking and landed somewhat of a dream job I've been wanting. 


A solar closer position. Which basically is the guy who comes in after the canvasser gets the appointment set and closes the deal. Closers make 2-6k for most deals. I'd been a canvassing manager for a very successful solar company for years before covid and always envied the closer positions. A presentation to close is at most 3 hours of work. 
So I got the job somehow(I've always been told I don't have closing exp. Which is true. Medicare is pretty much is for closing experience foe me.) But I got it. It's commissions w2 which is rare. And they're moving into a city I live in and next to.  

Now comes my worry.
1 before they send me leads I gotta shadow 10 apps. I've done 1 in 2 weeks because the ones I show up to get canceled on. (Pretty common in solar) then I gotta close 5 on my own and then they'll send me leads. 


But. I'm one of 6 people who got hired as closers. And there's less canvassers than closers. So I think I messed up. There are places I could have a much lower red line and therefore much higher commission if I was canvassing to close myself. Which is what it's looking like. I guess I'm just ranting because I really don't know what to tell my wife. I thought this was gonna be great and it turns out to not be so great. I'm living off savings. I've got maybe 1-2 more months before I have to start dipping into investments and then after that I'm broke. 😅  I really thought this was it. This was my ticket to a good life."

1,2023-03-04,Unsure about a new job I was hired for. I feel sick and anxious just thinking about it.,u/IronworkRapunzel,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ilp5a/unsure_about_a_new_job_i_was_hired_for_i_feel/,jobs,"So I recently got hired at a small, local jewelry business to do their photography and graphic design. Other tasks include answering the phone, maintaining displays, assisting customers, etc. I really don't know if this is the right job for me because even though I have a bachelor's degree, I never really thought of GD as my ""thing"". Even after the interview, which went really well, I was thinking to myself that I fucked up, and how much I didn't actually want this. 

I had seen the job posting on Indeed and it was the first one that looked fairly decent to me. Didn't have a laundry list of qualifications like having 5+ years of in-house experience, an extensive portfolio, or an amazing skillset. Most of the other job posting were incredibly intimidating because I didn't have any of that. 

I worked at Target for a little more than 4 years. And while I don't *love* my job, I always saw it as the easy, comfortable, safe choice. I got to walk around and get exercise, the people I worked with were more my age (I'm 26), and the work wasn't difficult. And while there were some OSHA violations here and there, it wasn't like my life was ever in danger. It was more of an inconvenience, and I only had some small bruises and the occasional paper cut. I did dislike the horrid scheduling and my new lead being somewhat of a micromanager. But it wasn't AWFUL. 

I'm trying to find the positives in my new prospective job. It's a MUCH smaller team (like 3 people). The people there are super nice, by the way. It's less overwhelming, and I'll be able to have more one-on-one, more personalized interactions with customers. Answering the phone isn't out of my wheelhouse either; I mentioned in my cover letter that I had to answer the phones at work all the time. Ill be closer to the city and I'll be closer to the places/things that interest me. 


Maybe it's the new schedule I don't like? It's Tuesday-Sat instead of a traditional Mon-Fri and the day goes from 9:30 to 4:15. I was used to working 11-4:45 Mon-Sat with Fridays and Sundays off. More hours are really nice, but I feel like it's a big shift for me. Maybe it's because I have to dress more nicely than I've usually dressed? 

The one thing that bugs me too is that I don't even know if this place offers insurance. I know I should've asked during the interview but I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask so soon. And if they don't offer insurance, should I still stick it out?

This whole ordeal is making me nervous and so sick, I cried in the shower after I got home. I haven't put my two weeks in (I'm planning on it Monday when I go in) but I'm thinking maybe I should just go On-Demand?? I had a coworker do that and he eventually returned after his other job fell through and I want a backup just in case this new job isn't the one. 

It also doesn't help that my emotionally abusive father yelled and screamed at me calling me an idiot, the new job ""shady"" and that if something were to happen to me, it would all be my fault. He said there was something ""really wrong"" with the job and that it sounded scammy and that ""no job hires you on the spot"". 

What do I do?? I accepted the job knowing I can finally put my degree to use and not be in an ""unskilled"" job with a degree and that my parents can stop complaining about it. I got the job so I could put something more ""desirable"" on my Hinge profile on not be embarrassed by working in retail. But I'm worried that what I'm doing isn't for myself, but just so I can be perceived better by other people?? I don't want this to be a drain on my mental health."
1,2023-03-04,Wage transparency question,u/Upper-Echo-1393,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ilud7/wage_transparency_question/,jobs,"Hi all,

Applying for a new job in my state. New wage transparency laws state that employers must tell applicants the wage range for a position before making an offer or at the applicants request, whichever comes first. Since this is my first time applying with these laws, I’m looking for some guidance on how to proceed. 

The hiring manager (would be boss) emailed me stating the timeline for when they will review applications, and under the veil of transparency and not wasting time, informed me that the wage range for said role is x-y. He asked if I would like to remain in contention in light of this information. 

I want the job, but only for pay in the top third of that range. 

Should I be transparent with my range before interviewing, or should I go through the whole process before showing my hand? 

On one hand, if they’re not willing to pay too 1/3 money for me based on my resume and experience, then why waste everyone’s time. (For reference, the bottom third of that range is less than what I’m making now for lower position)

On the other hand, if I interview with giving them a range and they like me a lot, they may be more willing to meet my expectations. 

Anyone have any insight from experience? 

Thanks!"

I'm in Australia, I've been studying an undergraduate degree for 3 years now, and I'm entering my final year soon. In my final year of study one of my core subjects is to do a work placement in a relevant field. To this end I opted to try and get ahead of the curve by seeking out a volunteer position in the career I would like to pursue. I figured showing that sort of initiative might be seen as a positive. I was able to get in contact with the manager of this workplace who asked for my resume and cover letter. I sent that through and they liked it, asking me to come in for a meeting.

For clarity, the position is in a state government department in my local town. I had my meeting which felt very short (around 10 minutes), but the manager did offer me the opportunity to come in for some volunteer work and asked me if I could find out more details for my work placement (such as how many hours I would need to do so they can sign off on them etc.) In the meantime they would conduct a background check on me and get back to me with a time to start. I thought the meeting went great and I got those details as soon as I could, a couple days later I sent them through, they thanked me and said they would get back to me soon with a plan.

That was a month ago, and I haven't heard anything since. I want to send a catch-up email but I'm afraid of looking too pushy. I was wondering if anyone had advice when it comes to state government departments, do they just take a long time to process these things? Or have I just been ghosted? I am posting today because it has been somewhat bothering me mentally. This is the first time in my life I'm really trying to develop my professional side and take a decent shot at improving my station. I would welcome any recounts of past experience or advice.

Thanks for your time."

I took it to the union who fought my case and I was provided a settlement of 1 months pay and was officially changed to a resignation.

I’m sick of my job, it’s getting me down to which is making me very unmotivated to even do my job. And now I’m getting performance reviews with the higher up management. The store managers talk down to me and make me feel like worse. It’s not even the job itself it’s the people who run the place are utter w*****s

At this place you never get rewarded or told you’re doing well it’s always told off for doing things wrong. 

Got caught on my phone yesterday and the way the manager shouted and swore at me in the office surely isn’t right. 

It’s making me very down and depressed, but I need the money. I’m applying for other jobs but I can’t do this anymore, cannot wait to hand in my notice.

Edit: my store manager is on holiday so it’s the assistant managers that are in change and the powers gone to their heads I think. I get treated like utter shit, they know my mental health ain’t the best and I’ve recently had 2 bereavements. I was on my phone because my nan had text me her biopsy results. So fuck them! I just need to find another job asap. I wish I had the money to just leave

This job was meant to be a stop gap between college and an apprenticeship in aviation engineering however covid stopped that as the apprenticeship had its funding cut. This year it’s back on and I’ve literally just applied for it but I need to work right up until I start the the apprenticeship, that’s if I get it."

I've been with the same company the entire time, trying to move up with every opportunity that is opened. I've been stuck at the same level for three years. The last attempt to go up a grade ended with my boss stating ""you are by-far the best candidate, you simply need more experience."" When I asked what the experience would make me better with, I was told ""nothing, you just need more time."" I don't know if he was trying to save face or what, but I don't think you ever tell and employee they just need time to learn nothing.
I expressed my distaste with my boss, and explained I have no desire of being complacent or just sitting and waiting for 5-10 years with no guarantees. The only thing he kept repeating was ""well I will fight to keep you here.""

 I've been searching for a new job for 2 months, with about 33 applications, so I could have an opportunity to force my boss' hand to ""fight"" to keep me, or just move on. I have not had a single response from any company, even with me hand-tailoring each resume to the positions I apply for. I'm not entirely sure where I'm going wrong, or if my age is just a warning to all companies looking for mid-level management. I have a tried and true track record of performance, risk management, EH&amp;S, and anything and everything logistics with multiple awards both from the company and customers. 

I'm just kind of lost here. Should I just flat out ask for a raise? My last was a year ago at 8%, with performance reviews promised but never given. Should I become that desperate and just apply for entry-level positions at more promising companies? At least that way, when I discuss placing my two-weeks I can allow my boss to counter. I have no desire to lie and state I accepted a position else where with no truth to it. Just looking for some advice"

I am 3 months away from graduating from my final year of college. I study part-time and recently I got a beginner level job relating to the field I am studying in, I find the place 'okay' but it is affecting my mental health currently, especially having to worry with projects that I am starting to fall behind on because I constantly have to drive 1 hour up and down and I couldn't arrange an agreement with my managers to let me leave on time because I constantly arrive late to lectures, when I come back any other day and want to work on my project I can't because I am too tired and cannot think and that started to impact me mentally.  


I would just like to know what is the best choice?

  
Drop the job behind and at least finish college.

My mother was on sick leave and then Arbeitslosengeld (unemployment pay) for the last few years due to her medical conditions and was recently diagnosed with long-covid.

The doctors who did an evaluation of her to see if she could still work, misjudged her (in my opinion) and said she still had to work.

In addition, she needs a few more years of work before she can go into early retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to her state of health, she is not allowed to lift anything heavy and can work a maximum of 20 hours a week and not several hours at a time.

Is there any work my mother can do, preferably from home? She only has experience as a Einzelhandelskauffrau (trained retail saleswoman).

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want to ask in this post if anyone has an idea of a profession that my mother can still do here.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably also an important info she is Austrian we live in the border area with Germany, so a job in Austria or Germany would be possible."

But since I am not a permanent employee I get NO vacation/sick time or any paid holidays. This didn’t bother me at first but has increasingly made things very difficult for me especially during the holidays. I also am over the job itself as it is very stressful. We are short staffed and I am sometimes doing the job of 2-3 people. I have a B.S. in Public Health and 5 years of work experience. But the area I live in does not have a lot of opportunities/ not higher than what I currently make and I’ve had no luck with remote jobs. I am also willing to pivot and do something different career wise. Would it make sense to leave my current job for one of similar pay that has full benefits or should I keep holding out until I finally land something that pays more too? I’ve been looking for jobs for 6 months already and I’m burnt out. Moving is not an option but I do plan on moving within the next 1-2 years.

Also, if I get the position the pay will be up to 25% more a year than I make now. Is it common to make such a big salary jump with a promotion? I don’t wanna get my hopes up with the chances of making a lot more money. But I don’t wanna sell myself short by asking for less.

I wanted to get peoples' thoughts on some advice being given within my industry regarding the use of LinkedIn for networking and job searching.

I work in a very niche profession. There is a prominent individual within my industry who has become what I call a ""LinkedIn influencer"" - part influencer, part recruiter, part educator (they host paid courses). They post on LinkedIn every day, including the knowledge posts which are becoming very common where people who claim to be an expert on something posts information to try to make the post go viral. Their posts contain advice such as that we should be posting these influencer-eque posts  *every day* in order to gain followers, that we should host webinars and advertise them via LinkedIn, and that we should be on LinkedIn for 3+ hours per day networking to try to find a job.

I find this advice and behavior to be very griftery. I am personally against posting on a public forum to advertise myself as an expert when I am not one. I also think it's ridiculous to be messaging strangers online for 3 hours a day. This also brings up the issue that I don't think many employer want their employees to be very vocal/visible on social media- I don't want to risk my job by posting too much publicly.

**Is this type of LinkedIn activity becoming normal across various industries?** Or is this just 1 person giving bad advice? I'm not opposed to using LinkedIn to network occasionally, but this seems very over the top."

I am wrapping up an internship in DC in a few weeks with a Member of Congress as a legislative intern. I will be attending law school Fall 2024. I am interested in working in District offices in my home city, or my state Democratic party until then. My problem is, what else is out there? I feel like I could work well with political casework, I have a degree in criminal justice and find any political work involving law enforcement, prisons etc interesting. I have also worked in an activist group with a foreign affairs focus. I feel like there are a lot of paths out there I just don't know about them. Thanks for the advice!"

I worked as a paralegal for many years; however, as anyone in this industry knows, there’s many different areas of law. I have no knowledge of the law this firm specializes in. The atmosphere was also completely different. I was a paralegal at a corporation who basically kept tabs on hundreds of lawsuits our company was a defendant in (never had to draft pleadings - just review/edit them). This new position is at a firm representing plaintiffs, and I’ll be in charge of drafting and filing pleadings.  I also haven’t worked in this field in over 5 years, which also has me feeling a bit nervous. 

How can I sell myself knowing I really don’t have the experience they are looking for?  Should I be upfront and say “I know I don’t have the exact experience you’re looking for, but here are reasons I think I’d still be a good fit for your firm…”, or should I avoid bringing attention to the fact I’m lacking this experience?"

What about the higher paid people who are also the best at their job?  Wouldn't companies want to retain the best employees, especially when they are higher producing and have a better skill set?  Yet that doesn't always seem to be the case.

Its a temp job with possibility of extension. Someone left the job and didn't come back.

Very boring mundane job that turned out to be data entry mostly. Not what was promised although manager says its due to initial training months and stages.

My notice period is 1 week on the contract but I guess it would be courteous to give them 2 weeks?

Current job, accepted job offer under the rouse of 2 -3 days in office and it became 5 days a week since they loved seeing me in office and as part of ""training"" even though i'm a BI developer. Need the damn focus without people talking all the time.

Long story short: got a permanent job elsewhere, fully remote, and I accepted it. Starting there at on 3rd Apr 23.

* What reason should I give to leave? My manager is expecting me to develop things that are going to take more than a month anyway or its not my problem?
* Do you think I should mention this 1 month stint, in CV, even though there wasn't much I could develop? I can hardly think of more than 3 points.

This is sorta long, so hold on for the ride. The past 3 years I've been working at a pharmaceutical company where we manufacture drugs. I worked my way up from a technician into the quality side of things. Recently got a promotion in November 2022, where I work the ideal office hours. Monday-Friday, 0800-0430. I don't particularly hate my job but I don't love it either. It has it's own set of mental stresses and I know I could be happier. And I also hate having to be tied to a desk all day. I don't even have any windows in my office to the outside world. Corporate America can just be so soul sucking 😔

My FIL gave me a proposition of running a local t-shirt shop. He hasn't bought the shop yet but it's an already established business. It would be uncharted territory for him as well but he seems pretty confident that there's the potential to make  lot of money. My previous background is customer service jobs. Before my job in the pharma industry I managed a GameStop. I have zero experience with the type of machinery in this tshirt shop but I do have management experience/customer service experience. Plus I was able to change industries before, why not do it again? 

I'm highly considering this because I'm pregnant... And I would be able to always be with my kiddo which sounds amazing to me. I'd have more time for my family and be able to make my own schedule. However, I would be going from $65k a year to $52k. Plus there would be no benefits like my current job. And it's a big leap of faith so to speak because it's not promised money or future. I can see myself being so much happier though. I can see my daughter being with me and running around the shop. It also sounds so much less stressful. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading all of this. Just looking for a different opinion than my own."

So. I have an interview for a part time gig at Walmart on Tuesday. I've already pushed the interview back once because I needed to get some more people clothes. After I scheduled that interview, I applied at a place that I would much rather work at (if it isn't as terrible as the reviews of past employees say it is) but I haven't heard back from them yet. I'm hoping that's because I applied on Friday night and they're closed weekends. 

My question is, should I go ahead to the Walmart interview on Tuesday, just in case this other place doesn't reach out, or they do and it's absolutely awful and then I end up needing the Walmart job? I don't *want* to work at Walmart but I'm not having much luck with my job search. 

And then, if Walmart does offer me the job, and I haven't had an interview with the other place yet.. what then? I know I sound like a child but I haven't had an interview in many years (aside from when I was a nanny briefly) and I feel kinda lost. 

I also have a ""meet and greet"" on the 10th for a whole different place that I might enjoy working at over Walmart, but again I don't know that they'll offer me that job either. 

I hate this whole process. Wish I could be a famous YouTuber or some shit but I don't think that's in the cards for me. I appreciate any input. Thanks!"

The thing is though, I have to keep all of these jobs or I won’t be able to make my bill payments. Any tips on how to manage a 7 day a week work schedule?

Update: people have been asking so I work full time as a behavioral technician at an autism center from 8-4:30, 4:30-6 as a coach for high school swim team half the school year and a coach for the middle school school team the other half of the school year (there’s about a one month overlap where I’m coaching both teams at the same time, I’m head coach of my own swim club of about 55 swimmers and 4 assistant coaches from 6-8, from 8-10 I do admin work for my swim club, from 10-11 I cook and eat, from 11-12, I shower and get ready for bed. Every other weekend I have a club swim meet where I generally spend about 20-24 hours across two days, when I don’t have a meet I work as a supervisor at the aquatic center on Saturdays, every Sunday whether I have a meet or not I work as a personal trainer for 3 separate clients. 

I make a alright amount of money, but with credit card debt, insurance, phone, internet, cable, streaming, car, food, vet bills, supplies for house I don’t make enough money to afford rent so I live with my grandma who has dementia and take care of her needs and her house/animals when I have the time.

Edit: 
I make 17/hr at autism center, salaried at 17,000 as head coach, I make 500 per season as middle school and high school coach, 14/hr as aquatic center supervisor, and I make 40/hr as a personal trainer. I get no income from taking care of grandma, but I don’t have to pay rent or utilities.

Assistant coaching for high school and middle school was a requirement of a pool rental contract for my club, I’m what’s called an elementary coordinator and my purpose is to facilitate the instruction and flow of new swimmers into the high school team to make us more competitive. It benefits the school teams and my team greatly. I get swimmers from the middle school team, train them in my club, and then send them off to the high school team. 

Edit 2: 
During pandemic is still worked 40 hours a week but I was salaried at a job that I used to only work 10 hours a week. I ended up making 2.50/hr for about 6 months while covering rent, utilities, food, and all bills for both my girlfriend at the time and I. My biggest mistake was not going on unemployment. 

Edit 3: 
My current situation is much better than the situation of a couple years ago. I worked a factory job instead of at the autism center so I spent 10 months on only 2-3 hrs of sleep a day. Had me loopy and walking around/slurring words like I was drunk. But I did the math and I experienced an entire 3 extra months worth of waking time."

1,2023-03-05,Received Offer from Company A but Company B Seems Keen - Need Advice!,u/Double_Leather_7476,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ji0o8/received_offer_from_company_a_but_company_b_seems/,jobs,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently attended an interview with Company A and was pleasantly surprised when they offered me a position the very next day. However, I went for another interview with Company B, which seemed very interested in me and is a larger company. The problem is that Company B has yet to send me an offer letter, and there is a possibility that they may not be able to hire me due to their lack of a SPass quota. Currently, I hold an EPass, which is increasingly challenging to apply for due to the higher salary requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Company A has already reached out to me, requesting that I confirm the offer letter within five days. The downside of accepting the offer from Company A is that they are a small team and located an hour's bus away from my home.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if it's okay to contact Company B and inquire about their hiring decision soon. If not, I may need to accept the offer from Company A. I'm torn between the two and would appreciate any advice or insights from fellow Redditors who have been in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for your help!"

Do you think these will show up on the report? Do you think they will prevent me from getting the job? Do you think the employer, if they saw these things, would at least give me a chance to explain myself? I’ve had a clean record besides these things and am a safe driver overall. 

I’m very anxious because I really want this job and I’m so close to getting it. Anybody go through a similar situation/hiring process? Any information about how hiring for this kind of job works is appreciated."

I chose to resign and then when our car got fixed I tried contacting her again but she started ghosting me. So I started job hunting again but I feel like I'm not cut out for this. I have depression and anxiety and I feel unreliable as an employee. But at the same time I don't want to be broke all the time. I wanna save up for a car. With only two jobs as experience on my resume and employers are able to see I didn't stay for long I feel that decreases my chances of getting hired. Idk what to do."

The same day I was asked to come in this week for a in-person interview. Now I’ve recently had a incident where I was pulled over for no proof of insurance and had to go to court and such. The prosecutor offered to dismiss the case with the following terms. 1. Pay 250.00 fine 2. Provide proof of insurance. The fine will be paid and full by tomorrow morning and the proof of insurance has already been provided. Now upon checking my own background report today with the state of Michigan the charge “Misdemeanor: Fraudulent Activities”is showing instead of “Misdemeanor: Invalid Certification Insurance” which is on the court record website and the packet I received from the court themselves. It shows the same exact dates just completely different charges ! My fear is that the employer(s) I’ve applied to will see this and won’t give me a chance . I was thinking to call the public attorney or prosecutor in the morning to at the very least get a written or typed letter stating there must be a mix up in the charges and hope for the best ? I’m really not sure what to do I’ve had multiple employers contact me to schedule interviews this week but I’m sure they’ll be spooked with this inaccurate charge on my background! Any help would be much appreciated thanks !

They recently got a new supervisor last year, and they went and apparently asked if they were getting a shift differential, as they work a later shift. Needless to say, my uncle was more than a bit clueless to the question, and obviously answered negative. 

Much to his surprise, he had been supposed to be getting a differential from the time he got hired, for around 2+ years or so.

The differential apparently was more than $1 an hour, (don't know exact amounts, sorry) and the new supervisor worked with finance/payroll to get the back pay reimbursed. 

About a month later, it seems that the differential was paid back...Partially, but not in full, in his words.

Supervisor &amp; management has apparently been going back &amp; forth with finance/payroll, but apparently the reason more was not paid, was because there was some variety of 'resolution' that was reached, which was less than the amount mentioned in the original employment agreement he signed.

Apparently, department management does not agree with finance's agreement, and my uncle never went and actually signed any kind of agreement with relation to this issue.

He's mentioned that apparently the new supervisor finding out about this discrepancy sort of set off a hornet's nest, because apparently he is not the only one affected by this. The last thing he mentioned, is apparently their legal dept is getting involved with this, though I'm not entirely certain it's for his benefit...(more like covering their own asses)

It has been around 4-5 months since the initial discovery of the discrepancy. I have mentioned bringing this up to the local Dept of Labor, but he isn't sure about potentially (figuratively) painting a target on his back by being a whistleblower, in spite of what apparently their handbook mentions about having a no-retaliation policy in their culture.

Should I try telling him to take it to the Dept of Labor anyway? 

With apparently other people (don't know exact number, exactly, nor do I know about these people's nationalities) being affected, I'm not sure this would lead directly back to him. But being more than a bit cynical, I couldn't say that everyone doesn't necessarily, &amp; currently, live in Hell Dimension, either. (/s)

So, sorry for the short novel. Thank you for reading, my uncle would appreciate any insight!"

After dropping out of college twice, I finally asked my dad if I could work with him at his construction job and he's hooking me up with a job. I'm just slightly worried about if my physique is going to be an issue. I'm 6'1, 145 pounds. I'm not very strong, to say the least. I was kind of hoping this job would actually help me build muscle, but I'm just slightly concerned about how the first few weeks will go for me. I know those guys like to talk shit, so I'm not so worried about what people will say to me, more so I just want to be able to do a good job. Did any of you start a labor intensive job as a skinny guy? How did it go?"

There was never any formal layoff/rehire process between these change-overs, though I assume there was paperwork done to take of all of that in the background. However, I feel like I should avoid listing all the different companies and periods for fear of giving the impression that I was hopping between jobs. I also don't want to just put the entirety of my experience under the current company name either since that's not entirely accurate. My work/duties never changed between all these changeovers.

I have 4 years of experience working as a high school English teacher. I’ve taught every grade in high school and pretty much every English class you can think of for high school. I have had good relationships with my bosses, colleagues, and students. 

However, I was diagnosed with PTSD in the past six months and resigned from my last position to pursue intensive treatment. I’m doing a lot better, but don’t think that I want to go back into a classroom. 

I have a bachelors in English and a Masters in American Studies. I also have an English teaching credential and am AP certified in Lang and Lit. 

Being a teacher was always the goal, so my education and work experience has really been tailored to that. So now I’m feeling unqualified for other industries and don’t really know what would be the best fit. 

I work well with teams and individually. I am very goal oriented and organized. I really just want a job that I can work hard at and not have to take home or think about outside of work— unlike teaching. 

Any help, advice, or words of encouragement are appreciated!!"
1,2023-03-06,How to negotiate a raise?,u/CamanderOne,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11jsc3j/how_to_negotiate_a_raise/,jobs,"Context:

I am a Jr. Financial Analyst that works remotely for a small accounting firm (in the US) in our advisory department. I am about to reach one year of experience, having graduated with a degree in Finance last April. My base is $62,400. I got about $18k in bonuses last year. With benefits, my total compensation is probably close to $85k.

My job duties include:
Creating and maintaining financial models for clients. Developing valuation models for clients looking to raise capital. Compile monthly accounting/ad hoc reports. Prepare slide decks for clients for the benefit of raising capital or for board of director meetings. Participating in client meetings to go over budgets/forecasts.

What I’ve greatly improved over the last year:
My google sheets/Excel skills have increased significantly. I’m able to use advanced excel formulas while also being efficient. I’m starting to take on more client facing responsibilities where I lead client calls going over budgets and financials models that I’ve created. I’m able to communicate much better with projects I’ve worked on. I’m a team player and always reach out to those in my department asking if they need help with anything.

What I’m looking to improve:
Increase the complexity of my financial models. Becoming more efficient on ad hoc projects that I work on. Improve my ability to find and fix errors inside financial models.


Performance reviews are this month and I’ve already talked to my supervisor about a raise. We both agreed that I deserve a raise, but didn’t discuss by how much. I don’t have any experience in negotiating a raise and would love some insight, especially if you work in the field of finance. How much of an increase would be acceptable? I personally was thinking at least over 10% over my base salary, probably around $70k. My wife and I are looking to buy a house sometime in the next year or so and having extra income will help quite a bit.

TL/DR:
How to negotiate a raise in a job that I’ve been at for a year? What’s an acceptable raise %?"

I've been working the opening shift for the past few months, and this week I find that I have a few closing shifts out of the blue. I notice that the person who usually closes is working the morning. I decide to ask my manager if this was intentional because the schedule is largely decided by a computer algorithm. My manager tells me that the closing person is on a waiting list for a daycare for her kid, and that she needs the morning shift for the next few weeks because of it. She says sorry for the inconvenience more or less and well hey at least your getting a week off next week. Fair enough. After she leaves, I speak to another manager who tells me this daycare story was a lie, and that I got ""bumped"". I guess the closing person wanted my shift, and they just gave it to her. 

I feel totally angry and helpless, and I don't know if talking to my store director would help me at all. I'm constantly reminded that my hours are never guaranteed. I've been told that restricting my hours to the morning shift will cut the hours I get in half. I don't want to step on anyone's toes because of there obligations to there kids. I would understand the schedule change if this daycare thing was true, I would understand even if it was permanent. But the fact that I was lied to, just to soften the blow, it just makes me feel like I'm not seen as an adult worth respecting. 

Should I say anything to upper management? Should I just find a new job and quit?
Maybe this is just life and I should just accept it? It's not worth the hassle of finding a new job, so my stepfather says.

The person who took my shift is about a year my senior, so there's that to."

I recently got offered a job with a local law firm, which has amazing offices in the city centre. It’s a 30 min nice walk to work. However they couldn’t offer me my expected salary, but due to location (and desperation hating my other job) I accepted anyway. 

I’m due to start next week but I’ve now been offered another job. The company is amazing (huge global company), the job is pretty cool, plus the salary is £10k more than the one I accepted with lots of extra benefits. However, it’s in the same bleak business park my current job is. Which is one of the reasons I hate it so much. There’s nothing there and it took me about 2 hours to get home the other day due to traffic. 

So do I pick somewhere with less money and less “status” but in a location where I can have a good work/life balance. Still a pay rise on what I am currently on and I’d see my husband/friends more. 

Or a better company, job, pay and perks - but in a boring business park out of town where people go to die a corporate death. But my CV would look great and I’d be in a better position to buy a house etc

While I'm sure it sounds boring to a lot of people, it's low stress, peaceful, and not exhausting which is what I care the most about in a job (a very nice shift from 3 years of food service).

However I have been unsuccessful in finding anything and Im just really tired of doing nothing. 

I’m also trying to change my career path. I originally studied social sciences, but I got really interested in UX during a university project. I’ve been self-studying in the past couple of months and put together a little portfolio. I will be starting a masters more closely related to UX this October as well. 

However would it make sense to do a 6-month internship for €200 a month as a UX design intern in the meantime? It’s completely remote and while technically it would be 40hrs/week i was told by the HR employee that they don’t really care and as long as I get things done it’s up to me how much time i actually spend on it. 

I feel like it would be a great learning experience especially for someone who doesn’t have any connections to this industry. But being paid around €1 an hour just sounds grim."

My company is hiring a manager to oversee a team of 7 case managers, several of my collogues have applied for this position as well with me and one other guy being the two obvious standout candidates for the position. I know the job very well and have built a strong rapport with a lot of local agencies several of which have sent feedback directly naming me to our program director. I am the youngest on my team by at least 15 years and don't have any formal education or relevant degree, I was hired based on my experience with at risk youth. 

The position would be a huge opportunity for me not only pay wise but to continue to grow and expand professionally, plus I enjoy the work I do and I am very good at my job and this company seems like it would be great to grow with. I am looking for any advice as far as what kind of questions may be asked or some of topics I should touch on, thank you."

What do I do?",u/_backfatbetty,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11k0gp1/lied_to_potential_employer_about_my_current/,jobs,"I lied about my salary during my interview. I under negotiated my current job when I got it 7 months ago and now I am currently underpaid af for what I do. But I was stupid then cause I didn’t know the market, my last job really severely underpaid me. Anyway I figured I’d apply to new jobs to get that salary jump, and I found a company who’s looking for my profile but it’s not as well-known (or doesn’t look as great on CV) as my current job, and they are a much smaller company.

Here’s what I lied about:
I told them I am currently making 72k.
I am actually making 41k.
Their offer is 59k.

My current position is supervisory level, their offer is “head” level. I honestly think I have the upper hand on this situation. I’d sent them some sample work, collaterals/strategy sample, and the CEO loved it. They also work 1h less than my current job, so I really would love that job. I currently work 10h a day, which is normal for my country. 

Anyway, I want to negotiate, cause I feel if I accept, it would look really bad. I could really use some advice tho!

Thanks a lot!"

I(25F) graduated college with a computer science degree in September 2022 and since I couldn’t find a job that would hire me with no professional experience in tech, I went back to retail after taking time off from working to focus on school and unfortunately while driving to work one day I got into a car crash and fractured my wrist. 

I was in the process of trying to complete a UX design certification course with Google, but the accident set me back a lot since my hand function was extremely limited. I lost a lot of confidence and motivation in almost everything dealing with the trauma, but now that my hand function has gotten a lot better I am ready to start job hunting again, but I feel so lost. 

I don’t even know if UX design is something that I want to do anymore. All I know is that I want to work a full-time job that I can possibly enjoy and that I definitely will not go back to retail (I’ve been working retail since 2018 and never felt like it was for me) but I really don’t even know where to start when it comes to finding a job now.

On my previous project, we were a small team, led by our superiour. He just became a father, thus he had to be home quite often.
I was the first person to start on the project, and later several juniors joined.

Naturally they had a lot of questions, and it made sense for me to step up and guide them, even though de jure we had the same role and responsibilities.

Now, the juicy part: after the project ended, some of them complimented and thanked me.
One said that only because of me she started to enjoy the job. Another that he survived on the project because of me.

I knew I will get a compliment from my superiour, but I never expected it from de facto subordinates.

The question: should I write that on my resume? It feels like a high praise, and more important to me than a compliment from above.

We are currently understaffed and management does not want to hire any more people to help staff out. Their priority right now is saving costs where possible which means that each team member is currently doing about 3 persons worth of work. This has been causing me to make mistakes at work which has ramped up the pressure on me. My manager says she understands that there is a ton of work but besides telling me to push through it, does nothing else to help.  
The way my job is set up also makes it impossible to have a work life balance. I have to be “on call” at almost any given moment to respond to urgent work situations. This means I am responding to work related issues at 10am on a Sunday. I have been told by my manager that this is part of the job which means at times I am working way beyond my 40 a week And into the weekends. The pay is also very little for what the job entails.

The job is incredibly stressful with harsh deadlines and tight turnaround for tasks. I am drowning in work and it has been eating away at my mental health. I’ve been feeling stressed, anxious, crying every weekend, even shaking with stress and anxiety.   


I want to quit but I am worried about finding another job in this current job market.

Imagine you are a recent hire for a full-time tech job at company **A** (which you want to stay with) and a part-time degree at school **X** in the evening. However, due to a scholarship arrangement (eg. scholarship-for-service) that pays for that part-time degree **X**, you are required to intern full-time at a different company **B** for the summers only. It is mandatory to do part-time degree **X** with this scholarship-for-service condition.

Ideally, I want to do A + X during non-summer seasons and do B + X during summer. (Explicitly, after the summer of B + X, I return to doing A + X in September.)

Is this possible? How would I go about asking for this? I'm okay with taking unpaid time-off from A, but I'm worried that A won't let me return after summer. Also, should I be considering any other factors during thought experiment? (I'm discounting opportunity costs for A that incur due to a summer at B.) 

(Also, I shouldn't mention during the interview that I would take the summer off to do internship with B, right?)"

I then was asked to complete a project, which I took me a significant amount of time to finish. At the end of this process, I was offered a position, but it was for the support portion. The salary offered was 30k, which I did not know because that is not the role I originally applied for. After having another conversation with the director, I decided not to take the job. I honestly felt bamboozled and lied to through whole process. Was I being too picky or is this sketchy behavior by the company?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit for some context: I am currently ok financially and as I live near NYC, I felt like the salary was a complete low ball offer (barely minimum wage for the area).

A company I am very interested in working for invited me to a second-round interview in person and are covering all the travel expenses. I got an email today with a bill for the rental car (covered by the company) and I am just shocked how much a company would invest in a candidate if it didn’t mean I had a good chance of getting hired. My partner is lovingly encouraging me not to get my hopes too high because companies do this frequently. I’m new to the professional world as I’m finishing my masters degree. Just curious for others to weigh in, do companies fly out multiple candidates/routinely expend hundreds of dollars on potential hires? Were you ever flown out and then turned down?

The prosecution made me two offers:

1. Take a conviction for time served already (I did not have enough money to bond out so I served about 4 and a half months in jail)
2. Take a 5 year deferred adjudication (which means a 5 year probation but the kind of probation where you are able to seal your record from the public by filing for non-disclosure). The problem is I have to wait 5 years after my probation is completed to file for having my record sealed.

Most people are advising that I take the probation, so that I don't have a felony conviction on my record forever. But I am not excited about being on probation for 5 years with strict conditions, and which would also turn up a felony charge (without a conviction) on a background check, unless it does make a difference in terms of my chances of being hired for an engineering job.

So my question is, would most engineering hiring managers view a deferred adjudication/probation/felony charge without conviction more favorably than a felony conviction? Or do those two have the same effect on my chances of being hired?"

Is it better to ""resign"" from assisting her in email or in person? I will still be working ""with"" her and around her on any team projects and our desks are right by each other, so it isn't as if either of us are going anywhere, I'm jut relieving myself of her direction.

Rarely is there a benefit for YOU to over share information. You're just giving someone else ammunition that can and will most likely be used against you. Moving onto a new opportunity and it's an amicable relationship? Thank your previous manager for the opportunity to work at &lt;insert company/organization&gt; and that you've accepted a role that aligns more closely with your career goals. Or that you've accepted a role at your dream company and want a new challenge. If asked ""what are your career goals"", respond simply with to be able to provide for my family or live the lifestyle I want. If asked ""what company"", respond with that would be something you'd be willing to share once you begin employment. 

Unless you have a tactical advantage, telling your boss you landed a $25k raise won't do squat. Share that info if you are offered an exit interview. In the rare instance you have some leverage and the current company has proven they are willing to play ball, sharing info then may be useful. I've seen such a situation go two ways. Guy tried to flex by boasting he got an offer from Goldman, only to find his job offer yanked. I've also seen new spots created, salary increased, retention money offered. This is where you need to do your own due diligence. 

In closing, keep it simple. The mushroom approach works well, feed them shit and keep them in the dark. The less info your soon-to-be ex-employer knows, the less damage can be done. With social media/LinkedIn etc, three degrees of separation no longer exists. People are linked often layers deep, especially within the same job sector. If you opt to share information, make sure the disclosure benefits both you and them.

Edit: should your soon-to-be ex-employer offer you more money to stay, my recommendation is to still leave. It comes down to both you and your employer knowing your worth. And if their motivation to add salary is only due to the threat of you leaving, what gives you any indication you'll see a dollar more in the future?"

I took them to my boss and asked him to match the new salary and that I wanted WFH full time (we had WFH during the height of covid). They met my requests (I am the only one who knows how to do my role), so I stayed on. I go to the office on Monday and Friday mornings to do some filing work and sign invoices.

The issue comes with a few coworkers. Some lf this is second-hand, but I know the individuals. I've heard them badmouthing others. I think I should just ignore them, but I am unsure. One of them is always making snide comments about me working from home. She'll tell others, ""At least I come into work."" I wasn't there, and my production planning coworker yelled at her that, ""she does work, just from home!"" One of them also asked one of the women I worked with what companies I applied for so she could see if I was working two jobs. 

When I go into work, I take a 10 minute walk around the building every 90 minutes to keep my calves stretched (had a health issue due to too much sitting). I've overheard one person complaining about me walking around at work. One has even asked me, ""Oh, did you come to work to walk around?""

I get that most of them are just jealous about the wfh. They're always grumbling about it. But I don't think it is my fault that they have not approached their boss to negotiate for it. Should I just continue to ignore them as I have been?"

I currently work as a sign holder which I maintained for one year and 18 months but I’m not working full time 40 hours a week. I work part time all year round whenever I’m needed as a sign holder. In the winters I work as a snow shoveler. Im a 30 year old man with a college diploma in business finance which I got when I was 24 and graduated from a normal high school when I was 18. I was in special Ed from grades 4 to 8 because I scored 55 to 70 on the iq test back in elementary school which got me diagnosed with low iq called mild intellectual disability. I also have job gaps due to anxiety and depression along with the pandemic. Longest job gap I had was 18 months and the shortest 16 months in my late teens and 20s. Anxiety affected me in a job like I’m worried about my job performance and if I’m competent enough for the job like job performance. So far I’m only good at sign holder jobs because I worked a lot of them and have gotten email from two temporary sign holder jobs saying I have done a wonderful job with the sign holder position and I work well. In my current sign holder job the owner and managers who are millennials and generation x are saying I’m doing a great job and invited me to a Christmas party. I never mention anxiety or depression and low iq in my job interview. But I seem to have a hard time finding a non sign holder job.

I’ve worked at, in order: a grocery store, insurance (for a friendly of the family and then at different office) and then a grocery store. I hate my job. The management is awful. The hours are awful. The only thing it really has going for it is insurance.

I’ve been scouring LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs but it just feels like nothing is there. I’ve submitted well over 80 applications since October and have received almost 0 correspondence. I was going to get potentially one interview but then the guy realized I didn’t live in Texas despite the position being listed as remote, so he no longer wanted me.

I feel like no job I find that I’m qualified for offers insurance. Some don’t even offer full time. Some offer less than I get paid now (15.65/hr.) I’m in a small city and there are almost 0 tech related jobs here from what I can tell.

I’m just gutted honestly. This certificate was expensive and feels pointless, especially because my mom helped me pay for it hoping she could help me get out of where I work now.

I don’t really know what the point of writing this was. I’m just depressed. I just want to work somewhere that’ll pay me enough to live, give me insurance so I can see a doctor, and maybe pay me enough to have ANY spending money, and even then that’s a big ask."

I have a manager (because it's always the manager) who has recently become a lot my critical of my work, looking for any and all reasons to tell me I did something wrong. I'm not perfect and do make mistakes, but since end of January this year I actually took to recording in an Excel document whenever I make a mistake... as well as my manager. Hers is much longer than mine at the moment.

Background on this manager, she has loves to talk shit about other people, especially former employees and current employees who aren't around at that given moment. I have no doubt she talks about me as well. She's also forgetful and will almost NEVER admit when she's wrong. Just today she asked why a time sensitive report I was in charge of wasn't done yet (to my co-worker, not me). I had to remind her that SHE told me to wait until Monday because it would be good training for a new hire. This is only one example of MANY and it is constant. Im never given the benefit of the doubt, I'm never told about an issue directly and I'm never allowed to explain my side of the story.

I'm feeling targeted and frankly bullied but its just a feeling with no proof.

After having a meeting with my co-worker and our regional manager last week (I'm pretty sure about me due to some documentation I saw) she has been extra cold and just on the razors edge of professional/rude. 

This is effecting my mental health outside of work. I was worried sick (literally) all weekend. I can't relax when I'm home. All because this manager can't discuss issues she's having and not giving me the chance to change them. Should I go to the regional manager who she's already spoke to or is this a matter for HR?"

I’ve recently started looking for a new job and whenever I get accepted for an interview I immediately start wondering why on earth they have picked me. 

One of my thoughts was even, “I must just be a filler applicant”. 

I know this is completely ridiculous but I can’t shake the imposter syndrome. For example, when I’m preparing for the interview and looking back over the job description I start questioning HOW well I actually know the roles and skills they’re asking for even though I currently do them in some extent at my current job. 

Do you ever get over this? I got my first job after university through networking and so the interview was extremely informal and I didn’t apply in a traditional sense so this is my first time dealing with interviews and applications. 

I was just wondering if other people struggle with this and if they have any comforting thoughts/tips about it?

Thanks!"

I have a VERY strong suspicion I will be let go. I had a one on one recently and boss said I am making mistakes no one in my profession would make. It was extremely negative and belittling, like he was suspicious I somehow cheated my way into the role. He was there through both rounds of the interview process. I know I did really well on the technical screenings; however, I should say the role’s responsibilities are VERY different than the technical interview rounds I experienced. I feel blamed for the things brought up in my one on one, and no plan was made to offer me more support for onboarding.

The role is fully remote, and the entire team is around 40 people. I know no one else at the company of 200. He does not want me to reach out to other teammates for help, only him. When I do approach him for help, he offers little to no guidance. All of my work assignments lack requirements and I have no metrics defining what success is.

I’ve been in this profession for about 10 years. I’ve never had an issue with understanding my role before. I think a lot of the questions I have are related to being a new hire, not fundamental questions about my industry.

I have no interest in staying and I already have interviews lined up elsewhere. I feel confident I will have a new position quickly. What I’m trying to decide now is if I should quit or wait to be fired. This has been mentally exhausting logging on every day, but I feel like the right financial option is to continue getting my paycheck and possibly unemployment. I was hired on with a diversity initiative, and I’m wondering if HR is dragging their feet/making things miserable on purpose so I quit.

I’ve never been in this position before and I’m really anxious and unsure what to do. I also feel lots of guilt for the insinuations I’m an under-performer and incompetent. How do I decide what’s best for me? If I stay, how do I stop letting this get to my confidence?"

Right now I am studying coding and plan to transition to this in a year or so.

For almost 10 years I was a freelancer, and lately, I had to stop for various reasons (mostly income wasn't good enough to sustain myself).

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have these two jobs I can ""choose"" from.

**One is technical support WFH** (I still don't know what I am going to support, but it will be through emails, chats, and calls) and the company seems kinda ok from what I have managed to gather. (Good reviews on Glassdoor).

**Cons:**

1: From what I heard you might need to work nights some days.

The issue that I see with that is that I will be moving from my cozy house in the suburbs to renting a room in an apartment in the city (Ie being a roommate ffs..) and I am quite sure it will not be possible to work nights in a house with roommates. (it's temp until I find an apartment - might take 2 - 3 months).

2: Not providing a computer, health insurance, or anything at all.

**Pros:**

1: WFH

2: You are mostly on your own (Could also be a con tho)

&amp;#x200B;

Or

The other is being a **moderator on Facebook** but from the office.

Now, I don't really like customer service, it gives me anxiety (I am working on that), but I also don't really want to work from the office for a couple of reasons:

**Cons:**

1: Commute (Not awful but not great 45 minutes in the car, but I am planning on moving to the city, so maybe 20-30 minutes in the metro).

2: The office culture is crap, you have to leave your phone in the reception and the job is heavily ""moderated"" (feels like being a kid in kindergarten).

**Pros:**

1: No customers.

2: Fixed schedule.

3: Health insurance (They pay half so not really a full one and anyway we have good free health insurance here - Europe).

4: Vacation days.

5: Food card (About 200 Euro a month for food which is a very nice amount here, last time I worked there I accumulated over 600 euros and me and my partner went to a Michelin star restaurant).

I have done this job before but from home and it was ok (albeit soul-crushing), but now they moved everyone to the office (idiots).

I still don't know what is the pay for the WFH (will know tomorrow), but it should be in the same range as the moderator job, maybe a bit lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Some clarification, I am moving away from my amazing house because my so for the past 5 years wanted to take a break (IE separate and think things over), there is no public transport here and I'll need a car which I don't have and cannot afford right now, so I must move out, also the house is expensive for one person, it will be 70-80% of my salary, and no one would really want to rent a room here, it's not in the city..)

I've explained it to our bosses as it has turned into an official problem with paperwork and all, but he's got 22 years in the place and I have 1, and they've very clearly decided he is in the right and I'm wrong. Even though the person who did the thing I'm being blamed for has admitted they did it, I'm still being punished and am on probation. I love my job, but I'm almost ready to just quit. This is not the first incident where I was not treated fairly. They made an issue out of giving me bereavement leave when my grandfather passed and then made it to where my leave fell on holidays I was already off. I asked for a day after the funeral off, they refused, I stayed home anyway because the man that basically raised me had just died. I've been complemented by literally a dozen people I work with on how good and thorough I am. I volunteer for all the difficult cases, and this is how I'm being treated. I just don't understand why."

Long story short, another department has been trying to push its way into taking over marketing since I started, and then when we got a new President in December, they succeeded.  

* One of their arguments was that they recently purchased a subscription to HubSpot Marketing edition (Marketing team, 2 of us, had no platforms).  Who purchases software that is made for a job that a different department does??? 
* They took our 2022 Facebook/IG ad budget ($35k), and used it on a CRM system... then used the fact that we had less leads from FB/IG as a reason that they should take over Marketing.
* The new President did not ask for a single presentation, report or analytic about our 2022 efforts.
* For me, it was a crazy rollercoaster.  I had 5 different job titles and job descriptions proposed over 2 months. 
* I ran a digital marketing department of an eCommerce clothing retailer for 4 years before COVID $500 mil rev/year.   Prior to that, I was working for a digital marketing agency.  Now I am ""Communications Manager"" doing PR and media outreach  (neither of which I have background in).

If I had done a bad job I could understand ... but I built a brand new WordPress website for minimal $$$, got us approved for Google Grants  (Saving us $50k a year), and increased our organic social on FB and IG by 35 and 40%. Sales were not great last year, and yes Marketing could be better, but marketing was not the (only) reason why sales were down.

Everyone keeps telling me, wait for them to fail... but I don't think they will.  Which is great for the company.  Fact is they have the advertising budget, a marketing platform,  and a team of 9 people vs 2.  

Anyway, I'm just so pissed.   I'm supposed to be working side by side with these people on a daily basis, and I just want to scream at them!  

Yes, I'm looking for new work, I just have to trudge through and work with these people for now :-("

She’s been getting interviews recently but has taken the approach of not turning her camera on during them unless the interviewer has their camera on. She’s been rejected from two roles now.

I told her that she should probably think about putting her camera on for an upcoming interview because it’s easier for the interviewer to connect with someone that way and that it’s harder to reject a person than a teams photo.

She says she has “RBF” and that she’s more comfortable with it off.

At the end of the day, it’s her choice, so I’m not going to push it anymore…. But for my own sake, I’m curious what others think. Is it important to always interview with your camera on? Or is it really not that important"

We spoke and she notified me that I was still absolutely in consideration, but there was a finance delay that was slowing things down and that she wanted to let me know. She also told me that I would hear from HR directly by the end of next week. This would be roughly a month after my final interview. She also confirmed that there were no more interviews and that she did not think someone would be onboarded before April (I brought up potential notice period).

I have no plans for it, I don't know why I'm doing it, but I don't want to stop. I'll find some use for it eventually.

I am on 320 so far, just from LinkedIn, Indeed, and some company specific websites. I haven't finished LinkedIn or Indeed, haven't touched ziprecruiter, JobCase, HandShake, or other company specific websites, etc. Starting to realize that Indeed removes a lot of jobs since a few that I interviewed for arent showing up. Idk how I'm going to track places where I physically applied.

Idk why but it doesn't actually feel that bad. At first it was frustrating seeing all the rejections again but my response rate was almost 40% and much higher than I thought it was, even though almost all of them were rejections. So far only 3 places were definite scams which i think is pretty good.

Feels bad at first but I would actually recommend. I come from a ""if you don't get the thing you want, you didnt try"" kind of family and it feels like I can kind of quantify how much I've been trying.

I’ve gained an interest in IT and alongside my part time job I have been studying for a comptia certification.

But I still wanted to experience a hands on IT related job and I finally may have the chance too. The interview went shockingly well, (they called me 2 hours after I got back lol, which I’m still iffy about)I’ve been offered a 3 month contract IT analyst role with training involved and it pays really well. I’ll be earning way more than I have in the past year so it seems like a no brainer. And obviously there’s a chance of renewing my contract but no guarantees, I’ll be happy with the experience either way.

However after speaking to a supervisor they mentioned getting an umbrella broker which I’m still trying to get my head around. I think it’s because I’m a temp worker the company I will be working for can’t do my payroll unless I’m permanent so the agency who helped get me get the offer have told me to find a 3rd party company to sort it for me. (Which involves taking a bit of a chunk out of my pay as payment to them)

The only reason I feel hesitant is because no one I know has heard of this process before and I’ve been in a job  in the past where I’ve been scammed or exploited for my money I should say. Not to suggest the same thing will happen I’m just not trying to get ahead of myself and make sure I know the best way to go about this. 

My supervisor gave me some contacts to discuss negotiations to find the best value brokers so I’m hoping to get some elaboration tomorrow. The offers I’ve been getting so far seems but high which also makes me uncertain although because I’ve never heard of this this may actually be the general charge for most situations? I’ll be earning around 3k a month and they’ll deduct 500-600 pounds off that from some of the brokers I spoke to.

I just wanted to know if anyone has heard of or done something like this before and how they went about it.

Many thanks in advance"

A bit of a dumb question I think but couldn't find exact guidance, so just writing here. I'm part of a typical business organization where I'm managing a technical team. The challenge is due to the nature of a technical team, we're 100% males, while we do have some racial diversity. We do have a position open and wanted to leave room open for females, but was wondering if this is what typically organizations typically do to meet gender ratio goals, etc? (just a hiring manager explicitly say we'll hire male/females for this role or I just deal with it alone internally in my head somehow?) Being a visible minority, I believe in power of diversity and inclusion when it comes to generating new ideas and less bias, just that I'm a bit newbie when it comes to this kind diversity hiring. Of course their skill sets are the highest priorities, but do I just inside my head set a goal that I'll be hiring this particular gender or some form of mandate/official methods should come from my leadership or consult HR? any advice appreciated. so far it's pretty much that I was told by my boss 'hey this position is open, so work with HR and post a job, and get going with pre-screening and interviews'."

After applying and applying I took the first job that accepted me. 
       The commute time is of 23-35 minutes, and 45-55 minutes to muly way back home. I don't have much time for myself anymore, I just go home, eat, sleep, take a shower, sleep and get ready for the next day. When I applied it said I would be a receptionist, but now I am just making calls (like a call center), barley a month in and they are changing the script on me again, having me to present and do hospital rounds. My coworkers are nice but they are draining me emotionally (as a introvert) they keep interrupting me and talking over me and when I want space for myself during lunch they make remarks of why I am not with them and by myself. This job is just draining me.

But I feel bad for leaving a job I thought I would like for just a month. Especially knowing that I just got accepted to graduate school and I need to move to a new state in 5 months. So I tell myself to keep it up and not be a quitter since its only 5 more months. And maybe to change my perspective and maybe try to learn something new. Or maybe talk to my manager of the things that will help me do my job better. Everyday I tell myself I will make the most calls and meet the quota but after saying the same script over and over again is draining.

So now I am thinking that I should just keep this job until I find another job. But my issue is still the 5 month timeline until I move for graduate school.

Feeling a bit lost.,u/Stromboli8675309,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11knanx/help_with_career_transitionchange_from_technical/,jobs,"Hello. I apologize in advance for the long post, but could use some advice or reassurance.

I'm a late 20sM living on the east coast (USA). I gained my mechanical engineering degree and have worked as a technical sales engineer for 5-years now. I'm a 1099 contractor, not a W2 employee at my company. With an extroverted personality, engineering degree and business/sales experience, I feel that I can be extremely valuable in any career I set my mind to. While I make good money ($250K+ gross in 2022) and can work from home some days, I am finding myself in a depressed state quite frequently for the last 8-12 months.

My company is kind of a toxic work place in my opinion. I work with a bunch of older guys who have a ""bro"" mentality. One guy isn't allowed to work in the office anymore because of how many people he was pissing off (but still works at the company). The job revolves around mainly building relationships with clients, but there are such few available clients that you either have to partner up with other salesmen or grind your way through the mud with the low level clients you have. I'm on the latter end sadly, just based on the cards I was dealt. There are some good days where I am making sales and doing good work. There seem to be more and more days though that I find myself with little to no work to do, or more than one fire to put out due to reasons outside of my control. It's hard to trust my colleagues as well, as some deals or partnerships I was promised ended up not happening for me based on a later changed decision.

Whenever I am spending money on clients (entertainment, lunches, etc.), I am only reimbursed half of my expenses. I do not get a company car, phone, etc. As a 1099, I also have to get my own health insurance and do not get a company matching 401K. I have ""unlimited PTO"", but you get looked down upon if it is used. Even when I am out, I still feel the need to work, answer calls, etc.

I have been struggling for a while now whether or not I am in the correct career and just need to keep chugging along, or if my thoughts/feelings are justified. I just hate feeling this depressing, empty feeling, or that I am not doing enough. However I want to provide for a family one day and with the income I make and can make, I don't want to hurt myself and them in the process.

Has anyone been in this situation before? What did you do? Or if you haven't, what advice do you have for me? Best ways to look for a new career? I thank you in advance for your help. I just feel so lost."

I’m getting my degree in psychology and I have an extensive background in customer service roles in retail and food service, I’m okay with another retail job as long as it’s not at a big store with a ton of people. I currently am working a sales job so I have sales experience too. 

I did look into Library/Bookstore positions but unfortunately they don’t pay enough without advanced degrees. I’m looking for a full time job that pays $17+ hourly with benefits. 

I know I have a lot of things I’m looking for, but I’m being picky because I’m autistic and I know I’ll burnout at a job where the environment is noisy and super fast paced.

I'm going to my 6th month and my colleague told me that one of my executives have been suggesting for me to be out of the company ever since my 2nd month working because of slow progress, not being present at work (I only took 3days of leave because of a vacation that was booked because I was hired and I explained it to my senior, I thought he understood). 

However, when I was evaluated by the HR and told me what I lack and my areas to improve, I HAVE BEEN TRYING to work on those, I took notes of my weaknesses and I took it as a challenge. 

They had issues with me, initially, filing for vacation leaves OFTEN TIMES (which I'm certainly not), and if I'm sick, I aim to finish my urgent ones before I file for sick leave (but not always) 

Currently, I'm in a middle of sick leave because I have an infection which my physician suggested for me to rest for 5 days. I don't feel like going back to work anymore after I've heard a lot of things about me, like them finding another event organizer, them realizing that I am not a good fit for the company. 

I'm just so confused and not motivated to do my job anymore. I'm an event organizer, I used to love my job, I used to be happy and now I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'll need an advice for this one.

Update: I told my boss that I'll be leaving."

I am working as a Senior Software Engineer in India for a startup and recently interviewed for a company outside India. I applied for a Senior Consultant and communicated the same via email. After the interview, they made an offer of a Consultant role. 

When asked, they said that it's based on the feedback of the interview process and your tech skills and they will consider the role change after six months. IMO, they should have rejected me if I was not good enough for the role. I am not sure if they will consider it later as they already denied what they said earlier.

I recently handed in my 2 week notice for a job I was working for about 2 years and it essentially has been going downhill since one of my previous colleagues also walked out - his responsibilities got handed down to be despite me never receiving any pay rise or appreciation for it and I got sick of it hence the 2 weeks.

Back story aside, they're now requesting I train my colleagues in the work I did despite the fact I never received any training for the work I have done with my time in the company - it was also never in my contract.

I was wondering if I am legally obligated to carry out this training or if I can just say fuck it and walk out and not work the next 2 weeks? I already have signed the other job offer and it's set in stone and I have enough money to keep me going for the 2 weeks.

I only gave my 2 weeks because I felt bad for maybe 2 people at that company who I knew that me leaving would affect but with how management have been treating me the past 48 hours since handing them in, I really just wanna dump my things (work laptop, keys, etc) and walk out and not show my face at all but I don't wanna get into any legal trouble!

I took it as a sign and took that blind leap of faith. 
It was originally and owner/operator situation but about 3 months after my hire, the company was sold to a guy who has absolutely no experience in this industry. The day to day operations are led by a group of us project managers so that’s one saving grace. 
I do have to say that during my first month I felt like I had gone back in time 30 years. We’re a little bit isolated from the rest of the state and there are lots of little signs that some people think that isolation makes them unique and special. But I see it as being somewhat ignorant of how leaders in this industry are operating. 
The cringey part these days is the new owner has a woman managing the social media and she knows even less about the industry. Meaning that her posts are full of inaccuracies. She met with us once and we have her feedback on what we want for the social media but she doesn’t even check to see if these posts are true. 
She’s started tagging some high companies we work with which will draw them to us and their followers. And they’re going to see these posts which are just nuts. 
I’m so stuck. I’m looking for another job but I’m just so stressed I don’t want to tell anyone where I work. 
I should have investigated this place much more thoroughly. I just wanted to move and this seemed like the right thing to do."

After a year or so I got a promotion and filled the role of my boss.

Things in this company are very shot-gunned, but successful. The work load has burnt me out and even though they've been rewarding me I just don't think I can do it anymore.

To make things suddenly worse management is starting to clean up its act, meaning trying to start to make things 'better' by blaming my team for problems that are mostly caused by our sales, operations, and development teams.  For example; sales team not communicating deadlines and over-promising on what my team (implementation) is able to do.  Operation providing little to no guidance, tools, training, etc... for my team.  Development releasing buggy system patches that my team has to cleanup, work around, and pacify customers over.  Most of all; we can't find the caliber of talent we need to perform high-tier implementations so almost all of it still falls on me (""director"") and my boss (""vp operations""). It's a clusterfuck.  And the lack of respect of ""hey one in 20 of your projects failed and one of our clients doesn't like you personally, shape up"" is about to make me choke someone.  Never do I get a ""you're doing amazing keeping things moving"".  Management doesn't even check in.  I've received one review.  Ever.

This is my first 'real' job ever and I've done very well but I don't like the direction it's taking.  So I'm bracing for what seems inevitable and getting my resume ready, but I don't know really where I fit or what I should be looking for.

I'm sure I can pull off a 60 hour workweek as that's what I could do if I worked overtime.

The thing is, I attend and hardly anything happens because they aren’t busy. I’m trying to be proactive and ask when their busiest times are etc, but there’s so far been no reply.

I’d go to another voluntary role but I’ve been hopping from one voluntary role to the next because of the issue above. I’m 22 and will hopefully be starting an access course soon, so I can enter university and enrol on to a course I want, but it just feels hopeless.

I was hired as an assistant to someone who never had an assistant before, helping with purchasing items and keeping a budget. I was trying to learn two new systems, but was having difficulty understanding them. I always asked if there was work to do because I wanted to prove myself, but often times my supervisor just asked me to study up on university policy (I work for a university). I was hired during the least busy time for my department and there wasn't a lot of work to do. I started getting lazy around mid February because of the lack of work and started making more mistakes, not taking the training as seriously.

2 weeks ago I didn't answer a question correctly and that was the straw that broke the camel's back for my supervisor. She said she was disappointed by the work and alarm bells started to roar in my head. A week later I was called over by my supervisor and her supervisor to a meeting where they said my work wasn't great and I was more of a liability than an asset. We came up with some action plans that I could do to improve and they said we're going to take this by a day by day basis for 30 days to see if I improved.

A week later I feel really uneasy because my head is on the chopping block. I was immediately given more work, asked to do more research, more projects, etc. I made sure to double check my work, ask questions, and asked my manager to check anything before I submitted anything per the agreement laid on the action plan. I'm being more careful now, but I still feel like I'm making mistakes, my supervisor isn't responding to some of my messages now, she's talking in a more condescending tone with me, and isn't being as helpful anymore.

I feel like I'm going to lose this job either by the end of this month or by June once my probation is over. I don't like where things are going and I don't think they'll improve.

I am looking to transition from my current job as a project manager to either a new company or a new role. I've been a project manager for 2 years which is fine, except I am seeing some warning signs and I want to get out while the getting is good, plus while I have the ability to negotiate. I've seen some poor signs listed below which make me leery of staying

* I was part of a batch of 20 hires after 13+ people quit in a quarter on a team of 60
* We have recently done layoffs
* Job conditions are declining
* We manage 40-60 projects simultaneously
* Declining internal metrics team wide
* Had impactful committes that I came up with reassigned from me to others that they are trying to promote.
* I am seeing entry level positions with my clients that pay more than my current wage.

Rather than fight for a promotion, or hope of higher wages while we just did layoffs, I think I would be better off working elsewhere. The only negative piece to my employment is that I currently do not have a PMF.   


Should I stay or transition to a new job. If I transition, should I stay as a PM, or what other closely affilitated roles pay more that are looking for Project Management experience?"

I recently quit a high powered position for several reasons, including stress reduction and a desire to move to nonprofit.

1. A totally remote sales position in an industry I know and love. I would be working with several close friends with a company I trust. The earning potential is low to mid 6 figures. 


2. Two Director of Development positions in my hometown with nonprofits that have a direct impact on my community. 50-60k to start. Work is in office, no remote possibilities. 



I'm torn. I know if I take one of the Development positions, I could eventually get a nonprofit WFH position in my original industry (my goal). However...I'm in my mid 30s, and have put a long and incredibly stressful 12 years into my career already. I have two children, and a husband who makes pretty decent money. We live in a low cost area. 


I'm afraid if I take the sales job I will be giving up my last chance to move into the nonprofit space. But I'm exhausted thinking about starting over totally and building my career again. I'm also afraid I won't feel intellectually stimulated or challenged in the sales position. 

But also. I want to stay in my industry, WFH, make a lot of money, and have a non toxic work environment. 


I'm so torn, my friends. Looking for any advice, thoughts, comments. 


If you got this far, thank you."

Now it is March and I'm wondering if I should start applying for jobs now but tell them I won't be available to start until July, or wait until closer to July? Will they even keep my resume or remember me? Is it even worth it?

I am looking for/prioritizing jobs in the work from home, customer service sector. (So think Sutherland, TTEC, Concentrix) My second choice would be anything front desk/administrative (hotels, optometrist offices). And last choice is general customer service jobs.

I'm not concerned about being replaced as we have a workload that requires more people in my role and I've been getting more responsibilities, not less. 

They are willing to pay a new person, with half my years experience, almost double what I make now. Two weeks later, I have my annual review and it's good - it's always good. I ask about the market rate for my position and my manager admits that I am underpaid. I ask to be brought up to that salary and am given a fully noncommittal response. 

Since then, it's incredibly difficult to give a crap about any of this. I do my job, smile and am accommodating to clients as before, but any internal communication or company mandated fun culture.... no please. In weird timing, HR is now forcing everyone to have their cameras on in all meetings - internal and external. So now, I'm just staring at these people and they can see that I'm not my usual, enthused self. I mostly keep a very straight face to hide that fact that I'm actually furious inside. I've been here for 9 years and have invested so much of my time into helping grow this firm. Now I'm pissed that I've wasted so much of my time here, when I could've job-hopped to the salary that I do deserve. I'm also embarrassed that I essentially drank the ""kool-aid"" and allowed them to take advantage. 

This has been a difficult, but very necessary lesson that I needed to learn. This is why the younger generation job-hops and it will ultimately benefit them more than loyalty to any company ever could. I hate that I have to reenter the job market, but I'm a good employee and I need to remember that I have a lot to offer. I'm just feeling really crappy about the entire thing - I feel like an idiot. I should've left years ago. 

I guess I just wanted to vent."

1,2023-03-07,Left Firefighting for IT. Did I make a good choice leaving?,u/ElectricOne55,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11l4mns/left_firefighting_for_it_did_i_make_a_good_choice/,jobs,"I worked at a fire department for around 3 years that paid around 35k, 42-44k counting overtime. We did the regular 24 on 48 off. But, because the fire department was so short staffed 1 to 3x a month we had to do mandatory overtime where we did 48 hour shifts then 1 day off. 

I switched to IT because the job offered more career progression, was less taxing on the body, and higher pay. Sometimes I still debate if I made the right decision though? Because I had to leave home away from family and rent whereas before I stayed with family so even with a lesser salary I was saving more money. But, especially since rent prices went up, I didn't see how I would be able to afford living on that salary. I currently make 55k, so I couldn't imagine ever living on my own on 42k. 

Promotions were also hard to come by in my department. You had to wait at least 3 years. And they forced everyone to become drivers to get a promotion, plus do extra ambulance shifts where you would get 10 to 20 calls a day sometimes. The regular fire stations averaged 6 to 12 calls a day. 
So with all of the days without sleeping it started to break me down a bit. 

The politics of the departments were crazy too. Like one time my LT wrote me up because he said I didn't ask him for a drink of water at then end of a fire and supposedly called that freelancing. Certain stations that would want their firefighters to get off the truck with this or that tool. Some wanted us to memorize street names, whereas other stations would use Google maps. Some trained every day for hours and would do quiz sessions where they would cuss you out and call you an idiot if you didn't know something. Captions that would write people up over petty stuff like not keeping a bunker door locked. 

However, some of the people I worked with I miss to this day. Because office jobs literally are like office space where people ramble on in meetings for an hour about nothing. And I feel no one knows nothing about me. Whereas, in the fire department people almost get too personal, call you out for not being married, say your stupid for doing this or that. 

Overall, though considering all the negatives, did I make a good choice leaving my department? Even with promotions they would only increase 3000 to 5000 with each promotion. The break down of the body. Internal politics. Long hours. Were all the reasons I quit. Should I go back, or do you think I'm in a better position now? 

And has anyone else left for the same reasons and did you think it was a good choice or regret it?"

1,2023-03-07,Did I make a mistake?,u/Snow_Da_92,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11l6xvd/did_i_make_a_mistake/,jobs,"Tldr: which is better, a more secure job making $3000/month, or a less secure job making $4000/ month. Edited to add: the 3k/month job is very little stress......but it's mind numbingly dull. The 4k job would be much more stressful.

I work in the car industry, specifically as a service advisor for a dealership. I recently was let go from my job due to a change in management (not uncommon in dealerships)

I much prefer service to sales for a few reasons, mainly being it's more secure as people always need service, and in my area most service advisors (the exception being large, high volume stores)  get a salary plus commission. 

After being let go I plastered my resume all over town and got interviewed by 2 dealerships at the same time.

 One was for a sales position with a biweekly draw of $2000 (meaning if I made less than 2000 they would give me 2000 which I would pay back once i made over 2000) average commission was about $500 per car, give or take.

The other was a very low volume store as a service advisor. Salary is $700/ week plus 2-5% (depending on csi/kpi) commission paid monthly. 

My area is kind of expensive but nothing compared to LA or New York. My rent is about 1600 plus utilities. 

I took the advisor position because it's more secure, I don't have to worry about meeting a quota to keep my job, and honestly I kinda hate sales people. I'm guaranteed 2800/month plus commission.

Today is my second day on the job and we've had 2 customers in the last 6 hours. Yesterday we had 6 all day. 

On one hand it's nice that I get a salary that's more than my previous job (600/week) with a fraction of the stress. I'm essentially making 700/week to sit on my ass and occasionally answer the phone. 

On the other hand if 2 to 6 customers a day, split between me and another guy, is average then I'm looking at very little commission. Probably 200-300 a month. For reference my old job was much higher volume and my average bi weekly check (including commission) was around 3000. 

Sorry for the long winded post. I tried to simplify a few things for those who aren't in the dealership business. 

My main question is: which job is better, a less secure job making 4k/month, or a more secure job making 3k/month?"

I am working at an agency. My role is a marketing manager.

I work closely with the client and we have a very good relationship, however we do not discuss budget. The budget is discussed between the client and the senior management. However I am in conversation with the client daily, she even gives me tasks to create procedures for her company, sometimes I cover her while she is on leave (we work closely together even though it's a client-service business model). The client is outsourcing so that's why we are not in the same company, but we are part of the same team (if it makes sense).

My problem here is that the client is paying by resource, and for my role they are paying 150k a year. I found out by accident. It is for my role specifically (and the client has mentioned in the past that if my company doesn't ""give me the salary I want"", I should talk straight to them). 

I receive 25k/year. I asked for 25k three months ago because I was receiving even less lol. They granted it right away and I was happy. 

The client has said in the past how they would like to keep me on the project and how they don't ever want to see me go. 

Now I have this concern that my agency has told the client how I am asking for 150k (which I didn't ask for) and the client had to pay that much to keep me..... Wouldn't it be better if I just joined the client's company, huh? I feel embarrassed as I have no idea what kind of discussions they had in background. Other roles are not paid that much.

I am also concerned because I don't think this is normal at all.... I even thought about telling the client I am not getting even 50% of what they pay but I know this would be extremely unprofessional.

What do you think? How should I approach this? I don't care about receiving 150k, I just don't want the client to think I am being extremely greedy just because they need me, while in fact someone else is being greedy."

Construction/manufacturing background. I've been at my current role for 1.5 years. Its awful and they overwork me- I'm doing two roles in one. I received an offer for a role that is half of what I currently do responsibility wise (AKA a more balanced, realistic workload).   

&amp;#x200B;

Current job:  

* $86,200 base + up to 15% annual salary bonus (the bonus depends on company and personal performance, not always 15%) 
* 19 days PTO + 10 paid holidays 
* Remote except for travel out of state once every 6-8 weeks for 5 days at a time  

New job offer: 

* $82,500 base + 8% annual salary bonus 
* 15 days PTO + 9 paid holidays + the week off paid between christmas and new years day (equal to 4 paid holidays) 
* Hybrid- 2 days at home, 3 days in office- commute 25 minutes one way, no overnight travel 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to at least get the offer to look something like what I currently make regarding pay and PTO, but at the same time I really want this job. Insurance premiums, 401k match, and other benefits are the same.

I asked for a range for this position when I initially applied and she did a damn good job not giving it to me, so I don't know what the salary band is. I can't find this exact engineering position on Glassdoor with this company, but Glassdoor shows they pay their other engineering positions with experience similar to mine anywhere from $78k-88k. Based on that, I'd like to get at least $86k and a few more PTO days but not sure if I'm undercutting myself with this.  


What should I ask for? How should I ask for it? Should I do it over the phone or in email?"

I left the position rather abruptly after circumstances changed my availability and I could no longer work the later hours they required for me to maintain my position and continue to go to school. I've been very honest about this when speaking to potential employers and have a few interviews set up this week. One of the interviews is for a receptionist type job at a local business that acts as the middle man between insurance companies and people buying cars with salvage titles. The position has a decent pay and the hours lined up where I needed them to except for Wednesdays when they want a start time that interrupts a class I have, but they listed the schedule as flexible so I put in my resume and got a call back today. 

Ever since the call I can't put my finger on the bad feeling I got from the person who called. She answered my questions about working with my class schedule as ""we can talk about that if you're hired"" and sounded a little standoffish when she asked why I left my previous position and I gave her the honest answer, and asked if those obligations had to do with my class schedule. I answered that they did not, that it was a family issue involving close family that made me have obligations that weren't compatible with the work schedule, and that my partner works in a higher paying, more technical field so it made the most sense for me to make a career change. I have an interview with her tomorrow afternoon but I'm honestly considering calling her and withdrawing my application because I cannot shake the feeling that it's just not worth the time given her reactions to being told the reasoning behind me working and my class schedule on Wednesdays."

This an uncommon role for me, and I wanted to understand if there are any drawbacks I needed to know before even discussing these things with the CEO.

In my mind, I can imagine some clauses or duties such as minimum time for stay in the company or having to deal with the investors. 

Maybe I am overthinking about it, but I was wondering if such roles usually also imply any sort of guarantee from my side to feed the company with my own savings or other oddities, during difficult times. Sure, if I get the offer, reading the contract would probably clear some of my doubts, but I wanted to be prepared before. Thanks."
3,2023-03-07,Mass apply or tailor resume for every single application?,u/FireDragon737,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11l97t2/mass_apply_or_tailor_resume_for_every_single/,jobs,"I'm a bit confused on what I should do. I have been told numerous times by this sub and many others that it's all a numbers game and I should be mass applying. In order to mass apply, I've been using the easy apply functions on Indeed and LinkedIn. But, I don't tailor my resume/CV when doing the easy apply. I have gotten contact from employers in the past from mass applying. But, I saw a post awhile ago about someone complaining about jobs having like 300+ applicants and one comment said that ""many people just apply to see what sticks"". So, is it bad for me to mass apply?

I do tailor my resume and CV to some jobs if I'm interested in them and they don't have an easy apply option. But, sitting down and tailoring every single resume, every single CV, and filling out the same application forms on another workday account gets exhausting after a time. I usually only have enough energy to do that for 2 or 3 hours and I only get in maybe 6-8 applications that way. I have also gotten responses from potential employers this way as well.

By mass applying, I can hit anywhere between 15-30 jobs in one day. By tailoring resumes, I can hit anywhere between 6-8 applications a day. I have gotten responses from both methods, although I don't really get many responses due to me being entry level. But, I am unsure which one I really should be focusing on. I've kinda just been swapping between the two."

First time posting here, thought you guys can give some advice for my situation. Here it is:

First of all, I have to say that I worked at 2 jobs before, but left each one after only 1 week. The first one was making projects in AUTOcad, but the boss was....a jerk,  he didn t pay on time and the enviromment was very stressful. The second one was a remote job, working in a call center. This was the opposite of the first one where what I did I actually liked, but hated everything else. Here I hated every second of it and let s say that I respect way more phone agents than I did before. 

All of this happened last year. I haven t managed to find another job since then. I m going to rewrite my resume since I didn t include student volunteering. Why? Because I m an idiot. I am afraid that won t change much, though. My location also doesn t allow me to work jobs in my domain because every remote job(other than call center) have high requiements, apparently and I can t move for personal reasons.

Does leaving 2 jobs in a short amount of time matter that much for an interviewer?

Even though I have a BD, I still feel like I know nothing. I recently learned how to use Photoshop and Illustrator a bit and I cand say I quite like it. However, the only jobs I have a slim chance of getting in are UX/UI and that requires a lot of work and knowledge. Should I continue on this path?

Currently, I work in a small company where I basically run every single aspect of our eCommerce website and digital outreach on my own.

I'm definitely not very good at reading contracts, or knowing about the employees rights, but on the Termination Clause, it clearly states ""10 day notice"".

The reason why I'm only getting back on this now, it's because I had asked for a upfront payment known as ""Deel Advance"".I assumed they'd pay these 10 notice days into the platform, and they'd collect it, so I never bothered to login and verify if all was good until I've got an email from Deel threatning to pursue legal action.

I've reached out to the Founder and he like ""Don't know what you are talking about"";Then I highlight the Termination Clause where it shows the 10 day notice and he's like ""Man, you didn't know what you were agreeing too? I'm just speechless!""So, pretty much trying to gaslight me...

Edit: thanks everyone for the advice. As of now, I don't plan to mention the bonus anywhere (resume, cover letter, interview) but may mention the ""landmark achievement"" comment in the cover letter. In the resume I'll just describe the work itself and the achievement that warranted this praise. Unfortunately I don't have obvious quantitative metrics but will try to think of something."

Those of us who have stayed around and shown promise, on top of taking more responsibilities including training new hires, decided to band together and insist we deserved a promotion/raise. Well after a few months, we have been told they created a new position (lead), that we are all being promoted to. It is coming with a raise, unclear how much. 

My question is how to bring up my want for a larger raise than the others, as I have more responsibilities and directly generate more revenue. This sounds easy when typing it, but the only way I see myself bringing up this topic is by directly asking what they are making, and *then* saying I deserve more than them. Not only do I feel like this is childish, since I am pretty much saying no matter what our raise is, I want more, but also I feel I would be directly opposing those of us who stuck together to get this.

I’ve been with the same company for 11 years. 3 internal promotions, from entry-level to middle management. Now I’m trying very hard to get out and realizing that I’ve never interviewed for a non-entry-level position outside of this company (which has very weird interviewing practices.) My resume was filled with internal jargon that only the people there would understand; I had to re-write it to be legible outside the company and the industry. 

Interviewing for non-entry-level jobs is pretty different and I wish I’d played the field a bit previously, to build up experience, stay on top of what options are out there, and keep my interviewing and resume-writing skills sharp.  It also would be less intimidating to be doing this now, I think, if I hadn’t been cocooned in the same safe place for so long.  Now I’m watching YouTube tutorials on interviewing."

BF is in a pretty crappy manual labor job right now installing pipe insulation for the oil industry. He works long hours, out of town (in fact he's in a completely different state/region atm), and doesn't really get breaks while on the job. He hates this job and wants to find something else, but we have no idea how he is supposed to hunt for a job when he's never actually available for an interview. 

His only days off are Saturday and Sunday which is when anyone interviewing him would also be off. I told him he might just have to schedule interviews anyway and just not go to work, but I'm sure he'd only be able to do that once or twice before it started to look sketchy. Going into work late isn't an option bc as soon as he goes in, he and his team get in another vehicle and leave town to go work on job sites that are often out in the middle of nowhere. He's usually at work by 8am at the latest and often doesn't get home until after 7pm. How is anyone supposed to accomplish anything with a job like that, much less an interview?

Have any of you been in this predicament before? Honestly I'm not an advocate of quitting a job without another one behind it, but in this case, it may be necessary. However, the problem is that this is the first job he's had since before the pandemic with the exception of a brief stint with Doordash back in '21, and he's on his 3rd month so that probably wouldn't look the best on his resume if he quit this job 3 months in after being unemployed for over 3 years. 

He's gotta get out of there. The pay is good but he's running himself ragged and he's absolutely miserable. The only reason he took the job is cause he was desperate, but this has got to be by far the worst job he's ever had. For me, it eats up our time together and we want to do things like buy a house and eventually have kids but idk how we're gonna do all that if he's never around long enough to accomplish anything. If you've been in this situation, what did you do and how did you find another job? Any advice is helpful!"

The first day, he spent about an hour lackadasically asking me vague business questions. I answered best I could. I kept trying to get details about the actual job but he didn't really tell me much other than to send my banking info to an email address. He said I would start working the next day.

Day two: I wait over an hour for the CEO ""Amar"" to join us. He finally does and basically says, welcome to the club. 

Now Josh says, there's one more test we have all new employees do to make sure they can follow orders. We will mail you a check. You'll deposit it, then we will provide transportation for you to meet with a prospective client.

I'm like, excuse me?? I said, that's shady as anything. I was hired to do Excel.

He immediate kicked me from the Workspace, no more said, no reply to emails. Done.

So, clearly they're money laundering and also were they gonna sell me...? Idk what was going on but it wasn't legit, I know that much.

As someone with schizoaffective disorder and ptsd, it’s been hard to imagine what sort of job or career I’d have. I’m about to be in my mid twenties and don’t want to be a freeloader on my family forever.

I’m a creative type of person, but I’m very unreliable. I’m the annoying one who gets an idea and is all excited and ready to change my life and then immediately lose all interest and discard it for my next fixation. I also don’t do well in jobs like fast food or retail, been there and tried that and wow, I sucked so bad. I can’t drive or operate heavy machinery due to my medications. I’m pretty bad at a lot of things tbh.

So I’d like some advice or just some recs for jobs that are easy, for lazy and dumb and pretty much incompetent people. I don’t need anyone to say “you’re not dumb!” because I’m well aware of my own limitations and I’ve sorta made peace with it.

Really, just looking for any ideas. Thanks in advance! I really do appreciate it."

He explained that I didn't get a link and was taken by surprise when I got the call but I still went with it despite being unprepared.

Then I replied to the interviewer that I found the link and what happened and this was an unfortunate miscommunication and re stated that I was interested in the position.

1,2023-03-07,"When you've searched through 10+ pages on Indeed, how do you find jobs?",u/paymeinapples,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ljwr5/when_youve_searched_through_10_pages_on_indeed/,jobs,"I should mention beforehand that I'm currently conducting a ""haphazard"" job search. By this I mean that I don't know what I want in the short term except a job that is full time. My goal this year is to save money and talk to a career counselor to figure out what I want to be doing for the next 5 years or for the rest of my life.

I'm a former teacher, and I've left teaching for personal reasons and have no interest in going back to education. That being said, I have no field I'm pursuing but I'm keeping my options open. I recently quit a warehouse job because I knew that I wouldn't be able to meet their standards for pick productivity within a few months, and it was seriously depressing me knowing that I was trying my best but my best wasn't going to be enough.

It's important to note that I have high-functioning autism, which may be considered a disability, but certainly gears me toward certain job and makes me steer away from others.

I am amazed when I hear from people on here and elsewhere that they applied to some 200 jobs. I have to scroll through 10+ pages of jobs on Indeed just to find maybe one job that I'm interested in, qualified for, and am not likely to quit within the first two weeks. Once I find a job this way, I tailor my resume before applying. Admittedly, I'm picky, but this is because I have a track record of not being able to hold down a job for very long.

I live in a small city, and there aren't too many opportunities here. My frame of reference is having lived in the Seattle area before as well as living abroad as an English teacher. My degree is from a liberal arts college. I may want to move up to Seattle where there are more opportunities, but I would need to get my shit together first and have a lot of money (and a job up there or some idea about what I want to do).

Just to give you a sample of what jobs I'm looking at on Indeed when using the search term ""full time,"" here are the first ten jobs I find:

Speech Language PathologistCookWarehouse AssociateState Farm Insurance AgentMerchandiser for BakeryDelivery DriverWarehouse ProductionGrill CookHotel Room AttendantTurf Installer

Out of all of these jobs, only 3 slightly interested me: the two warehouse roles and the merchandiser for the bakery. But then I have to rule out one of the warehouse roles because they require night shift and I have no car. And I already applied for the bakery job.

This routine of looking through 10 pages of jobs and maybe being interested in applying for one has seriously made me depressed. I just don't know where else to look for jobs once I've looking through everything on Indeed. LinkedIn has very few opportunities for my area.

So today I did something different and resume bombed (aka shotgun approach) with almost no filter and zero resume editing. I'm usually very reluctant to use this method, but after being rejected by Walmart after an interview, I'm desperate.

Immediately, I got an automated text, for better or worse, from one of the security officer positions I applied for asking me to do a video interview where I have to record myself on my smartphone answering their questions. On another note, one employer instantly sent an automated rejection.

But back to the point of making this post, how do you all find jobs? I can't even take the age-old advice of treating your job search as a full-time job because I run out of pages to look through. What's the secret? How do you all do it? And what advice can you give to me?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an interior designer, and I'm faced with a choice between a big company (compromise of architects, engineering, and interior design) with big projects and a professional team but no business opportunity within the company or a small company with smaller projects, a small team, but with a verbal promise of potential business opportunity.

The big company can provide stability, valuable experience, and skills working on large-scale projects with a professional team. However, there is no ownership or share in the company for potential business ventures in the future.

The small company's boss can offer potential business opportunities, like being the design partner and having a share within the company. However, the projects may not be as large-scale, and this was just talked about verbally, with no black-and-white written agreement on the offer letter. 

As an aspiring entrepreneur, which one would you choose? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic.

This is my first post here and I hope it is the right place for me to get a perspective about what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started working for an IT company in January 2023 and from the start it felt like I have been there for a long time, the job was very intuitive for me and my dream job which is why I excelled. 

From my first day I got a raving review from customer, I also covered for another person (she was on holiday+medical leave) who used to record training  videos which I recorded myself just so they are not behind when they need to send videos to clients. 

The boss was in awe and ecstatic about my performance, so was the team and they were all nice and professional. 

The boss was amazing and he did trusted his team including me to do the job and he didn't want to add rules or very strict things to follow, just maintain professionalism, solve client problems and be friendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward  to March, I have many clients reviews at this time that leave 10/10 reviews and I was very happy with that, so did the team AND the boss, he expressed that has amazed and I excelled all expectations. 

On that same day the colleague who (is 8 months senior to me) was on vacation came back  and from the start, she created a secret group telling me that so many things need to be discussed regarding this project, it is my project I started it and it came across a bit bossy but I let it go.  We are in the same environment and I'm dealing with a client, as soon as the client leaves she started being shouty and accusing me of ""not following protocols, not following the rules and there is a process that I am not following"" and used a super bossy and condescending tone. 

 She said that there is an employee manual that she and one other team member are working on that we need to follow (mind you this document did not exist and only on my last few days at the job she added me and the file had little data in it and doesn't make sense).

I messaged my boss immediately after that and asked if there is anything that I'm doing wrong and he said no and if there is anything he'll let me know. 

Had a monthly meeting a few hours after the incident and for the first time since I joined the company, this is the first time the meeting that you can cut the tension with a knife and I couldn't tell where it is from. We had to voice our concerns and what we would like to see happening. So the girl goes straight to state that there are rules and processes that we need to follow so we are not telling clients the wrong information and misleading them etc etc, then she follows with (isn't that right, Maria? \[ Maria wasn't aware of the incident and wasn't around when it happened\], Maria sort of confused, but agreed with her just as a reassurance.  (I messaged my boss privately and asked for a meeting immediately after the current meeting).

My boss weighed in and said there are no rules and he wants to make sure that we're comfortable and free doing our work. 

Meeting ends, I join my other meeting with the boss and he seemed tense and I figured straight away she had a meeting right after she insulted me and started talking lots of shit about me and I don't know what it is because the boss seemed a little annoyed. However he said she is a bit territorial and whatever, and I'm like... but I want you to make her understand that I can't work under this much monitoring and being watched like a hawk; every step is like an egg shell. All I wanted him to make sure that she understands that I'm an ally not a threat. I told him I want to withdraw from the video project since it is her project and I had no idea, unless he wanted me to stay.

March 2nd she came in and didn't say good morning and I didn't either, the whole day we didn't speak (I think she was continuing to spew shit about me to the boss that I don't know what it could be) 

March 3rd, the boss asked for a meeting to discuss the situation and I was told she has problems at home and stuff and we need to understand each other and I was told that he'll talk to her as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, a few hours during that day she said hello and I said fuck it I'm gonna take the high road and talk to her, I spoke to her nicely and I told her about the tension looming and want to clear the air. I asked her to tell me about herself a bit, I shared stuff about myself too. I told her about that I appreciate her intentions to help me but the approach and execution were not great and we really need to kind of work on that; she claimed she has a Borderline Personality Disorder and she gets misunderstood because this happened before (wtf?) .... and she is like ""this is me, i am just trying to help you"" etc etc. I made sure she understands that I'm with her not against her and then the tension diffused and we discussed new video ideas, food, regular life stuff etc and I thought that was the end of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 4, I start my day at 8AM and we have a daily meeting at 10... so .. the day starts normal and we talk and stuff from 8 to 10, comes the meeting at 10 the entire team is there including other department we all have our regular tasks of the day to share and discuss and many of them had stuff to help me with like accessing accounts or client portals etc as it is a perfectly nice normal day. Meeting ends at 10:15 and my boss messages me please call me, we have a meeting and I say good morning and he says ""I really have nothing nice to tell you XYZ"" and follows by ""I'm quite disappointed and I've decided that I'm going to let you go"" I thought he was joking and I'm like what? why? He said he can't get into the details (I'm on probation) he said no reason given at this time. I told him I cleared the air with my colleague etc, please go and ask her, he disappeared for a minute or two and came back, he said the decision stands and I'm not changing my mind XXX will come and pick up the equipment from your home in a few hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

What in the hell did I do wrong? what do you guys think happened? It has stressed my out so much and I do not know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight on what could be the reason would be much appreciated, sorry for the long post!


Edit: I'm a guy.

also some people have been saying there are some missing details. 

The only detail I think of now is that the girl who was training me was very nice with me and helped train me etc and we were respectful and professional. She also complimented my work to the management just a week prior but after I the conflict occured, I found out that her and the toxic employee are friends so all I can assume is that they falsified some complaints to get me out. That's all I can think of."

I’m looking for full-time, remote roles as a Senior Copywriter or Associate Creative Director. I have 7 years of copywriting and content experience.

I’ve applied to nearly 50 jobs, and I’m not getting much traction. Compared to previous climates, it feels like there are simply not enough open roles to go around. Here’s what I’m doing for each role I apply to: 

* Searching on LinkedIn and Indeed daily for openings that have been posted in the last 24 hours 
* Researching for fit/Glassdoor 
* Including my new portfolio in each application
* Tailoring my resume with special keywords from the JD 
* Tweaking a cover letter template with a custom paragraph about how I can help further the company’s mission  
* Reverse searching the email for \*both\* the HR lead and dept. head for follow up (I send my first follow up 10 days after application submission; the second follow up 10 days after that)
* Maintaining an extremely detailed log of where I applied, when I applied, etc. for future reference 
* Attending weekly meetings with a career coach (these have been fruitful for refining my resume, cover letter, portfolio, etc.)

I’m starting to feel a little helpless. So I’m here to ask: is there a tactic I’m missing? Are there any special tricks or hacks you’ve picked up along the way to get a phone screen?

I know referrals are useful, but should I just schedule a chat with a current employee and hope they give me a referral? It comes off slimy to me.

When I’ve done this in the past, a response (if I get one at all) on LinkedIn/email can take weeks, so I go ahead and apply because I don’t want the job to close.

Thanks for reading all. I appreciate any insight you guys have for this market from a hiring perspective."

I work in hospitality by choice. I have a BA in psych but hate working in it. I’m in graduate school now and will have an MBA by the end of this year. My restaurant was bought out by a hospitality group. It’s been downhill since. 

Today, I took an order for over 50 items for 11:20 tomorrow (it happened to be pizzas) so things need to be prepped and we open at 11AM. I simply let the kitchen staff know that I took this order for tomorrow morning. I let the executive chef know and I got flipped out on. He asked why I told his staff, I’m trying to do HIS job, I’m to do nothing but “take orders”. I repeated myself that I simply just told them about the order and he went off again. I’ve NEVER been spoken to in that way in any aspect of my life and I’ll be damned if I’ll allow it to happen at work. 

I’ve been looking for an out as I see the writing on the wall but wanted a back up plan first. This is the riskiest thing I’ve done - quitting a job with no back up. But more than anything, I’m happy to draw the line and know my worth.

I have enough money to get by if I didn’t work for 3 months and be completely fine. It’s not ideal but I can absolutely do it. 

Do I take this time and do some self reflection, really hunt high and low for a job I want or do I accept the very first offer solely to have money coming in the door while continuing to search?"

I graduated some time ago with a BS in Computer Science. Wanted to go into web development, so I started teaching myself over the course of a year. Once I felt good enough, I spent the next 2 years desperately applying for any entry or junior level roles. I even went to a coding bootcamp. Out of all that time spent applying, I only managed to get 3 interviews, all of which I was not selected. I have since lost any motivation to keep trying to become a software developer. 

Since then, I had tried setting my focus on doing something in the skilled trades, such as becoming an electrician, welder, or plumber because I had always heard these fields were in very high demand. So I tried applying for any and every apprenticeship program I could for almost a year, only again to be rejected or just outright ghosted by recruiters. Even the companies that expressed a preference for hiring veterans did not want me.

And NOW, I have just been rejected by McDonald's after applying there some weeks ago. McDonald's for crying out loud!

I am honestly done at this point. Literally, I am back at square one after all this time. And the only thing left for me is the military... again.

Am I crazy for wanting to rejoin? Or is this just another big mistake? Would anyone here go back to the military if you were in my position?"

Literally 2 hours after the interview I got the call saying they wanted to give me the role and that I’ll have to start on the 30th as there are a few other candidates starting as well. 

Now for some reason, the agency who helped me get this have asked me to find an umbrella broker? (Something I’ve never heard of) to run my payroll. 

Apparently because I’m on a temporary contract and not permanent, the company I’m working with can’t officially do my payroll. So I have to find a 3rd party to do it. I was given some contacts to call and see what ‘offers’ they have and it seems they’ll be taking a bit of a chunk from my pay? 

For example, one guy phoned and said with my gross pay being around £2.8k a month they’ll deduct £616 including tax and all other essential deductions etc. imo this feels too much and was wondering if they take a cut as well which is what I’m confused about.

I spoke to my bank, friends and family and no one has heard of this procedure before. And even though this will be a good opportunity for me I’m unsure if I should go through with it because I’m still trying to wrap my head around this process. 

I tried to get them to ask why it needed to be done like this but all they said is because I’m temp. It just feels unnecessary. Maybe I’m wrong and that’s just the standard but it feels weird to be charged by a company to deal with my monthly pay as Ive been in temp jobs before and usually been paid by the agency themselves.

I was wondering if anyone has heard of such a process. I’m going to try contact some other advice places in the meantime but wanted some other opinions. 

Many thanks in advance"

Either you know how to use all these new models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion etc or you will be outsmarted by a candidate / colleague that does.  


And then it talks about jobs that are being disrupted, like voice actors. I'm quoting:  


&gt;If you are thinking that this is a gimmick because synthetic voices suck, I have bad news for you. Modern AI has revolutionized the text-to-speech field, as we used to call it, and today’s voices are nothing like the robotic voices you heard until last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a third project to announce. Next week. At that time, I hope you’ll realize how incredible voice synthesis technology has become. Until then, you should really try this *Language of Love* audiobook. First of all, it sounds like a masterpiece of literature that should be mandatory in schools. Second, the voice is really impressive.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, audiobook narrators are not happy at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shubham Agarwal, reporting for Wired, writes:  
&gt;  
&gt;Gary Furlong, A Texas-based audiobook narrator, had worried for a while that synthetic voices created by algorithms could steal work from artists like himself. Early this month, he felt his worst fears had been realized.  
Furlong was among the narrators and authors who became outraged after learning of a clause in contracts between authors and leading audiobook distributor Findaway Voices, which gave Apple the right to “use audiobooks files for machine learning training and models.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Surprise!  
&gt;  
&gt;More from the same article:  
&gt;  
&gt;“It feels like a violation to have our voices being used to train something for which the purpose is to take our place,” says Andy Garcia-Ruse, a narrator from Kansas City.  
&gt;  
&gt;Does this mean that, in the future, the job of audiobook narrator will disappear? Perhaps. Or, perhaps, it will disappear in its current form.  
&gt;  
&gt;Perhaps, only the professional voice actors gifted with the most alluring voice will continue to work, selling the rights to synthesize their voices for royalties, and allowing companies like Apple, Amazon, Spotify, etc. to use those voices to read millions of books instead of a handful.  
Or the celebrity of the day. Because who doesn’t want to be knocked out by the voice of David Attenborough narrating a torrid novel titled *Language of Love*?  
&gt;  
&gt;The good news for the rest of us is that, at the expense of the audiobook narrators of the world, we can now create our own audiobook at a tiny fraction of the cost of the past. Now, we just need to learn how to write something that is not garbage. Actually, nah. There’s ChatGPT for that.

It never said anything about this on the application apart from being a British National it never mentioned being a sole British national.
I am completely lost and demoralised on what to do next.

Edit1: 
After further look into it I found out that I need SC level security clearance and after some research it turns out that to gain this clearance you certainly do not need to be a sole British citizen. I am going to give them a call tomorrow and appeal the decision as it’s starting to smell of potential discrimination as I meet the eligibility criteria but am being refused solely based on my nationality which is illegal under U.K. law.

I’m working two jobs atm, totaling 40 hours. It’s my first time working these kinds of hours. They’re both temp and my first job is wrapping up soon, so I only have around a month of this schedule and then I’ll be working much less. So it’s really not that bad in the end. But it’s been quite an adjustment learning how to adjust to that kind of schedule when I’ve only worked part time, and it has me worried for when my expenses will go up and I’ll need to work those hours more regularly. But I know 40 or more is fairly normal for most people. 

It seems like all my time is either spent working or recovering from how tired I am after working most of the day. I take some seemingly-short breaks and then all of a sudden I have to work into the night to meet my hours. I don’t get how people have the time and energy to go to the gym, get appointments when no one is available on the weekend, have the motivation to engage in hobbies, etc. Some of it you can cram into the weekend, but I don’t want to feel like my whole career is going to be spent waiting for the weekend or vacation time to arrive. I don’t mind the work I’m doing now, but it’s still work.

So, how do you fit in the rest of life with a 40 hour workweek? I want to work to live, not live to work. I don’t mean to sound entitled or self-pitying in asking this. I haven’t quite learned those time-management life skills yet."

I need to put something on my job applications / resume for ""Reason No Longer Working"" that wouldn't be lying, as that would be bad, but would at least be neutral enough that someone viewing it would skip over it without thought. As I imagine if I put ""Terminated"" I would be ghosted more often than an episode of Ghost Hunter. And going back to teenage level jobs at my age (1 more year shy of the big 50 ) would be very difficult So I am trying for at least cashier (it was what I was at my last job) or better. My cash handling is excellent, only got called up on the carpet once in the 7 years and only because I had gotten in a rush and taken a fake bill. That annoyed the heck out of me as usually my fingers can tell the difference pretty quickly, been cash handling for many years prior to my last job. 

Oh I know someone is going to ask why I got terminated. Fine. Attendance points, basically I was late on occasion, but the points accrued enough to get a final then last Sunday was the last straw. Stupid Uber driver cancelled which pushed me to two min over but still in my grace period, but the second Uber driver was being slow at getting to my location, complained her phone died, and that pushed me to 20 min over. Corporations don't really care why your late, just that your late and that's a point. And a point when your on a final, yeap, see ya later. Anyway. Need to find another job but need to find a way to phrase this so I am not lying but also won't get my app tossed or ghosted. I mean, this might be like putting a pig in a dress, but one can hope there is something I can do / say so they'll focus on my cash handling skills, not my punctuality."

I've just been very kindly and politely told it's not working out AGAIN in a job I'm technically qualified for and was working really hard at.

Some of it's not my fault, they hired me to do Job A, and the business went in a different direction and now needs Job B which I'm much less qualified to do.

But my boss specifically mentioned my lack of relationships and lack of reaching out as a factor. 

So some of it IS me. This is the second job in a row and the third overall where my seeming complete lack of ability to read between the lines, understand politics, make ""friends"" or even network has torpedo'd a good job. I have ASD and I've struggled with appearing normal and making relationships work my entire life (I married a fellow autist at age 42) and I'm just an odd person. 

I AM skilled and have won awards and when the job fits, people love me and are thrilled by my work. But I keep getting the next step up (product/process manager) and losing it about 6 months in for vague ""it's just not working/you're not a fit"" reasons.

It just seems really presumptuous and unnatural to walk over to someone or set a meeting, and the few times I have, it's actually bitten me in the butt--a project idea comes out of it and it's a ""no"" or the person I asked for the meeting is haughty, rushed, snappy, can't be bothered, etc.

I could really use help and advice here. Right now the solution is to step back down into the comfort zone roles and that's okay but it's frustrating and very demoralizing."

I’m a production manager at a concert venue/convention space, and it is as cool as it sounds. I love what I do. But it’s almost all I do. While I do have some time for family and friends, and try to take one vacation a year, the events world is unpredictable and inconsistent, and so it’s hard to reliably plan anything outside of work. You cannot have recurring commitments because your hours are different every week based on what’s been booked in your space. Slow season is fine, but when busy season hits it’s 60-80 hour weeks, sometimes 10 or more days in a row with no days off, unexpectedly having to work when you thought you might finally get a day off…

I still love the work itself, but I want more out of my life. My friends get together regularly and I can join maybe a quarter of the time because my schedule is the odd one out when everyone else has nights and weekends off. And I’ve missed family birthdays and get-togethers more than I would have liked. As much as I’d miss events and the excitement of the industry, I find myself thinking more and more about all the other things I could do with some routine &amp; consistency in my life. Weekend trips. Weeknight art classes. Friday nights out with friends. Regular times for exercise/running. Seeing the people I love as much as I want to. The ability to plan and have other things to look forward to sounds really nice.

Is it better to do the 3rd interview and receive an offer, but then try to negotiate above the salary range given at that point?

I currently have a good job, but my new manager has been rubbing me the wrong way. I was reached out to by a recruiter to interview for a position that a company has been struggling to fill due to there not being many candidates available in my job field. I have completed two virtual interviews thus far. 

The potential job would be only a slight pay raise, but the title is better than I currently have. The work seems as if it would be much more fulfilling than what I currently do, and it would be more focused. The only issue is that I would be servicing multiple facilities within a 3 hour radius of where I live, which means I would have some late nights each month. Between one facility being in a different state and trainings, I would be expected to have 15 overnight travel days per year too.

I am interested in a 3rd interview, especially with my current manager acting the way he has towards me and other team members, but I also cringe at the idea of traveling. This company has gone through the two interviews with me already knowing that I would need the top end of the job posting's salary range to consider accepting, but after learning more about the position I think I would need even higher than the top end of the range given. They asked for me to come in person for a 3rd interview, and I said I would have to think about it and discuss it with my wife first. How would you respond given this information?"

- i was told a whole list of things i have to improve on. e.g., mistakes i made (including the date and time and cost incurred if applicable). my boss asked why i made those mistakes. i was told to work faster, to make less mistakes at work.
- i was told to come up with my own action plan to tackle all of these problems by friday and present them to him. i feel a bit confused because my boss's requests are so vague, and i don't know how i can, say, type faster.
- was told i'm not performing at the expectations i set for myself at my interview &gt;1 year ago

i understand that i may have been underperforming. however when i spoke to a few of my friends they said that this is basically an unofficial PIP (we're so small my boss is the HR also) and that i should leave before they fire me (friend said that here in Singapore there's no mandatory severance pay).

does this sound like an unofficial PIP and should i leave on friday?

If you want detailed specifics about how I landed here, just ask and I can put a long story in the comments. But I’ll just focus on what’s driving me out.

I started in the beginning of August ‘22 as a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor, full-time while I pursue my Master’s in Clinical Mental Health Counseling that I started last January (intent to become a licensed therapist). By September, the main boss who was great left for a better job at her old high school. They promoted another counselor, also great, to supervisor. She left barely 2 weeks later in October as she got accepted for a transfer to an office closer to her boyfriend of 2 years. So then not only were we down a supervisor, but another counselor as well. We didn’t have any help and each had caseloads of 150+ as complete newbies. In mid-November, they promoted “Shauna” from another unit and transferred her to us. Since then…

She refuses to help with a massive project. We are struggling to complete work as our caseloads are too high and 3 of us are still relatively new (takes a year minimum to really learn job, I’m max of the newbies at 7 months experience), we only have 1 specialist for assistance when we should have 3, so their project got put onto us, now. Shauna said we now lose our remote days to cover the work, but… she still does work from home herself 2 days a week. She will not help with this project. She will not take cases to ease the burden, even though it’s suggested in the job description when caseloads are as high as ours.

She micromanages. She bullies. She has put down such severely meticulous orders that it literally adds 20+ minutes to EACH file and case to meet her expectations - just hers, not the company’s. She talks poorly behind others’ backs. Today she raised her voice and yelled at me about my shoes, which have been fine thus far. She made up a new rule about shoes that the other units next to ours do not have to follow, and that the company did not suggest. These aren’t all, just some of the biggest.

I complained to her boss, Emma, twice. We just had a company meeting via Teams where Emma said we need to follow Shauna’s rules and that they were both there for “emotional support,” saying they know we have it hard because they have been through similar. Then shouldn’t you know how to ACTUALLY provide useful support?!

Cherry on top: during this meeting, Emma told us that since the other units were almost fully staffed now, we’d be obligated to give up 2 of our offices. Shauna suggested that since mine is slightly larger than the others’ (no reason I got that, random luck), I should move to accommodate for the specialists to use as a group (even though we currently only have 1). She also wants another coworker, Abe, to lose his. Where would we go? Oh, we could take turns in HER office. A shared desk will be moved in. Other than that, we can ask the other counselors to share and “work out” times to be able to use their offices. I mentioned why not the conference room? Apparently we can’t because of HIPAA concerns. But sharing an office is cool?!

I recently got approved and registered for full-time school now, can use my loans carefully to help pay rent while I work part-time someplace else, and be free of this craphole. I want to walk out, rather than deal with this stress for another 2 weeks."

23,2023-03-08,I'm looking for advice/assurance - Found a new job and am stressed about putting in my resignation at my current one,u/Serene_brownmouse144,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11m0rih/im_looking_for_adviceassurance_found_a_new_job/,jobs,"I never thought it would happen for me.  I got a great opportunity.

I've been stuck in a place where, although the job itself is tolerable, my boss and co-workers are abusive as he-- and make my life miserable.

Long and short of it, my current boss is horrible to me.  I got moved to his department two years ago because everyone else kept quitting and they ""asked me to help out temporarily"".  Which turned into full time.  There is no way out of this department for me.

I'm doing the job and doing it very well but he finds any reason to give me bad reviews/no raises/no bonuses.  He micro manages.  We have daily one on ones where, even when I am out performing everyone else in the department, he will literally yell at me for dumb things like, ""I told you to call that guy and you emailed him instead.""

My review this year, I put hours into doing my self-eval, he spent 5 minutes on to put zeros in every line, his only comment being ""I don't like you.""  THIS WENT TO CORPORATE.

He will literally schedule meetings with me and tell me, ""I have you for an hour, I'm going to spend this hour telling you what a piece of garbage you are."" and then ripping me when I get up and leave the room because I refuse to sit there and listen to him browbeat me for fun.

I saw the writing on the wall last year and starting applying.  It took many months but a really good company gave me an offer.  The REALLY want me.  Offered me 20k over what I was asking.  Rolled out the red carpet for me.  I cannot believe it.  

I have over 20 years in my field (highly technical) but my confidence has plummeted to an all time low working for an abusive bully who takes delight in tearing me apart on a daily basis because he got into a fight with his wife the night before and wants someone to take his anger out on.

I have the new job lined up.  Jumped through all the hoops.  Background check, etc.  Got the start date.  Signed the paperwork.

The thing is, I'm terrified to put in my notice because my boss is SO abusive.  And when I leave, the department will be sunk because there are only two other people in it and they cannot find anyone to hire who wants to do this type of work.  Me leaving will tank this department.

I'm thinking of just going in Friday with all my equipment and firing off a resignation email to the boss and HR and then leaving and blocking his number from my phone.

My mind is made up about leaving for this new job.

I just am terrified of getting cornered by my boss before I leave for another session of him screaming at me."

Hey!

So I applied to a medical assistant training program with a local healthcare system before moving to my current city, so… in like August 2020. I had an interview, but in the end, they decided to not proceed with my application due to my lack of experience. 

It’s now March 2023 (obviously). Since that time, I still don’t truly have medical experience. I did spend a few months as a chiropractic assistant (I was ultimately fired BUT it was after they moved me from the back where I tended to the patients to the front desk. I was let go the same week because I hadn’t caught on to the system yet… that I hadn’t been trained on yet). After that, I’ve worked as a sales associate at an optical office, and an admin at an orthotics and prosthetics office. I would still very much like to train as a medical assistant and do actual work in the medical field. 

They say you don’t need any prior medical experience to apply, but obviously those who do will have preference. So… is it worth applying again to this same company? Or should I just look elsewhere?"

Job ad listed salary as $55-60k. Verbal offer of $23/hour, work hours 7:30am-5pm with 1 hour lunch plus two 15-min breaks. 

Once on-site, I was told 30 minute lunch break was automatically deducted from pay and implied that taking the break was “optional”.

It was also implied that the working hours, after training, would be 6am-6pm. 

Then I came across a section of the employee handbook that stated any employee caught discussing wages/salary would be terminated. Which is very illegal in IL, where I’m at. 

I quit after a week. In addition to all of the red flags mentioned above, my supervisor was planning to send me out of state for training (which I was also told was “optional” during the interview). My team leader took it upon himself to choose another name to call me, since there was another “thebat” on the team, and ignored my requests and suggestions on what I would prefer to be called. 

I put all of that plus PDF files of the handbook, job ad, and my offer letter to the IL Department of Labor. I anxiously await a reply. Thanks to all here and on the various job subs for encouraging me to take action!!"

These were some of the questions and my responses:
They asked about a time I dealt with a diverse client I explained how occasionally I may come across a patient with eating preferences based on religion and I will offer them those types and upon doctors approval and as a result they get meals catered to their satisfaction.

They asked about how I handle keeping public info private I related it to hipaa and asking permission from patients before disclosing info to family and friends

They asked about an unforseen circumstance I mentioned how I was the only who showed up to work and how I had professionally expressed that to patients, I expressed their concerns to manager so they could follow up. I asked for help when needed but I remained focus and was able to feed everyone on time that night.

They asked about a time I failed from not following steps. I replied the time I worked in a cash office and didn't follow the proper steps so my count was off and I has to call my trainer for assistance and she walked me through the steps to get my count back and as a result I followed everything step by step and never had that problem again"

Now, I feel like I have to act completely different than I was prior in the office. Before I was myself. Unapologetically. During the interview the company prided themselves on being transparent and to be honest they have been transparent about everything up until today. Up until it’s cut throat.

At my first job, I was an intern, after which they hired me. Stayed there for only 10 months since they made me work night shifts and it's unsafe to commute at night where I live.   
Left the first company to join a small kitchenware company where I was overworked to death. Like putting in 10 hours of work each day. Colleagues were abusive and made it a hostile environment to work in. Lasted there only for 2 months. Omitted this experience from my resume and wrote it under freelance experience even though I worked full time.   
After this second job, got an offer from now what it is my third company in my employment history, and which is where I presently work. I am pretty much satisfied with my current company in terms of work life balance, but what makes me want to quit this job is that I am made to do customer service work like coldcalling in addition to my current job with no additional pay. The company justifies this in the name of the venture for which we have been hired for as new, so we have to do whatever work that's given. Also, the company's IT is too slow to provide me with the right set of software (Adobe CC) and is expecting me to work on free software and deliver the best quality which is not possible unless I have the tools. This is deeply impacting my skills in the software as I am no longer professionally working with it and am afraid I can't keep up with the latest software professionally.  
Now that I have close to two years of experience, the job hopping has been much easier and I am getting multiple offers. But am fearful that this habit of changing jobs in like 6 months to a year is going to bite me back some day. The job hopping comes financially since I am the sole earner for my family of 4 and we live in a HCOL area. My salary actually can't keep up with the rising costs for basic necessities. I know that no job is perfect, but at the end of the day, job hopping gets me a better raise than staying in the same company."

I (36) am living in Vancouver, Canada with my wife (36) and two kids (5 and 3). I recently got two job offers.

First offer is a big4 manager position. Office located in Vancouver and can work from home. Salary is just okay. They offered $100K CAD/year and I was trying to negotiate to $120K CAD/year.

Second offer is a chemical engineer position of a start-up company. It requires me to relocate to Kansas City, USA.  Salary is $200K CAD/year after currency exchange.  They also offer $20K USD relocation assistance and $10K stock options.

Both are good jobs with promising career growth path. The compensation gap is very lucrative for me to move to the US. However, as middle aged adults, we have family considerations.

1. My wife is not working currently - she takes care of the kids in most of her time. But she plans to return to the labor market later this year and work part-time. Her anticipated income would be $20K-30K CAD/year as a part-time worker in Vancouver. If she moves to the US together with me, she will not be able to work in the US with her visa status.
2. In terms of cost of living, Vancouver is brutal. If I sell my 1000 sqft condo in Vancouver, I can pay off my current mortgage and buy one 2000 sqft house in Kansas City in a good area without any mortgage.
3. In terms of kids, my kids love Vancouver. We are Asian families and enjoy the diversity and inclusiveness in Vancouver. There is not much diversity in the central US like Kansas City. I heard people are very nice in rich regions of Kansas City, but I certainly don't want my kids to be exposed to bullying, Asian hate, gun violences, etc. this sort of things.
4. In terms of healthcare, US is way more expensive than Canada, but US health care system is generally faster and better. I did some calculations. In the US, I probably have to pay $5000CAD more to get the same level of healthcare in Canada.

I don't have to make a rush decision as the potential employer understands family relocation is a big decision. Any advices from you guys are much appreciated! Thanks!"
1,2023-03-08,Advice on Quitting a Job,u/Dear-Bat5204,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11m38n8/advice_on_quitting_a_job/,jobs,"Hey there!

So heres the situation: I work at a small nonprofit (team of 10), doing work that I like and I think is important. Problem is my boss sucks and makes the job 1000% more stressful than it needs to be. She doesn't treat me particularly well, I have little autonomy over my role, and half the time she literally just doesn't seem to listen to anything I say. I have been thinking about quitting for a while.

I have a new opportunity lined up that is exciting that I really want to and plan to take. It's time sensitive (can't defer) and basically this would more or less be my only chance at it. If I quit \*today\* it would be about a month and a weeks notice.

Problem is, I would be leaving at a very inopportune time for the nonprofit. I work in agriculture and the growing season is fast approaching. I am more or less the only one on the current team who can regularly manage/attend to our gardens (aside from my boss - who is planning to leave on a sabbatical soon (from a fellowship - not self paid)). My boss - despite protests from me and my coworker (who helps in some of the broader management of the gardens) - is also looking to expand the amount of gardens we have. If I wasn't planning on quitting I would be extremely stressed/annoyed about how I was supposed to manage them all without any guarantee of the necessary support/no mention of a pay raise. A lot of my job is currently looking to be turning into large scale volunteer management for this and that is absolutely not something I want to do.

Anyways I don't know how to quit. Or I currently feel really, really bad about quitting. Literally last night when talking to my coworker I was mentioning how I don't know how we're supposed to handle all these new responsibilities and and she said ""it's ok - we have each other's backs"" and just oof. It's really making me second guess taking this new opportunity even though I KNOW it's something I want to do. I also know my boss will be pretty upset and possibly angry over me quitting. Before I took the job I agreed to do two years (was just her asking if I could do two over a phone call - didn't sign anything, etc. She mentioned not wanting to look for someone new each year). It has been one year and the nonprofit funded a training class that I took. This is honestly the main thing keeping me from quitting, potentially facing my bosses scorn and loosing out on a good reference. I've thought about lying about why I'm quitting (have to go take care of family? Say I had a mental break?) but that just doesn't seem like a great idea - too easy to get caught on it?

I don't know. I can't tell if I'm in the wrong for quitting, but increasingly I feel l like this work environment is just not for me anyways. I even tried applying to another job a month ago in the same field and the guy more or less said they wouldn't hire me because it could upset my boss (who's working relationship is important to them). That doesn't seem right and feels really shitty and I just want to try something new with my life. I'm 25 and I want to explore more opportunities while I have the chance. I regret agreeing to 2 years as I now realize that that's just not realistic as I'm trying to figure out what it is I want to do but I feel like I really dug myself into a difficult hole with this job.

Advice or anecdotes highly welcome. Thanks for reading :-)"

Yesterday I found out I’ll be working frequent Saturdays for events held and it’s my responsibility to be here (6am-7pm typically). I knew it’d be a Saturday occasionally but not this often. 

I told the boss it’s a concern and he apologized to not been transparent as he didn’t know either but he keeps insisting I stay. *He even offered to have my son sit in his office and watch tv while I work those weekends.* But I don’t want to work this many Saturdays as they are dedicated to my home business and family. 

How to handle this? 😞"

I have been hired as an intern in an important corporation here in my country for the same areas of concern of the master I will be attending. 
Thing is, except for a specific regulation that I actually studied in university, I studied in a non-academic, non-professional but rather general and first approach manner some of the regulations (which are still only a part of my job) that I am required to know for this internship. Both the recruiter and the manager who did the interview actually liked me, but they never asked me too technical questions. 
Some of my colleagues on the other hand, coming from a completely different studying field from mine, asked me in a somewhat inquisitive but still non-hostile manner how I ended up here, and even the chief of my manager I think kinda has seen through me. 
Furthermore, despite not being hostile at all, I have the impression that they are giving me the cold shoulder, since some of them not even say hi when they see me at the corporate cafeteria. 
I have to say that I have not lied at all on my CV, nor to my manager. Although I think he gave for granted that I knew some other regulations which are fairly common but I did not study at university at all. 
I am not considering quitting my intership though, but I want to hear your opinion on this matter. 
To be precise, I graduated in law, I got hired as a GRC cybersecurity intern, and all my colleagues have an IT or engineering background."
1,2023-03-08,Do I tell Company A that I'm waiting for an offer from Company B?,u/ollypockets,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11m4vxy/do_i_tell_company_a_that_im_waiting_for_an_offer/,jobs,"This is a variation of a very common question but grateful for any advice. I've recently been interviewing with two companies.

**Company A** \- I have undertaken one interview. They have \*just\* emailed to invite me to a second interview next week and to tell me I am essentially the preferred candidate as no other candidate is being interviewed during round 2. Note - it is unlikely they can change the dates of this 2nd interview.

**Company B -** I have undertaken two interviews and a task, and am waiting for their response tomorrow or Friday morning.

I'd prefer to work for Company A (due to the nature of the role and the responsibilities).

Do I tell Company A I may receive a job offer from Company B as soon as tomorrow/Friday? The aim would be to ask them to speed up the 2nd interview, or even to encourage them to make a formal offer.

My friends think I should do the above.

However I think it's less messy if I just wait until I see if I even have an offer from Company B and then ask Company B if they can wait for my response until after my 2nd interview with Company A, next week. I would also then tell Company A to see if they could speed up their process.

The risk is obviously that Company B say they can't wait for my response, and then I somehow don't receive a formal offer from Company A after the 2nd interview leaving me with nothing...

Thoughts very welcome and appreciated."

Hello!

I’ve made it to the third interview for what you can call my dream job, yay! However, I can’t keep worrying about how I formatted my resume. I worked at Job A for a year, left for Job B, and after 3 months at job B I realized Job A was the better fit. Job A allowed me to return, and I’ve been back at Job A for another year.


On my resume, I didn’t list job B. I didn’t think it was worthwhile as it wasn’t an accomplishment of mine. I listed job A as continuous employment from 2021-2023, even though there was a 2/3 month span where I wasn’t employed there. 

The job I’m interviewing for currently is a large financial company who I’ve heard does employment history checks. 

Is this something I should be worrying about?

Thank you for your time!"

So, what do you love or hate to see on LinkedIn when looking up applicants/job seekers? 

Side question - do you care about assessments, and should I continue filling out the ones on Indeed, or should I only do them if it's required to submit my application?

Hello,

I was hoping to get some insight, or to see if anyone else has had a  similar experience? A professor who's research I have been interested in  had recently had a job opening for a research associate. I match the  job description very well, and I am extremely interested in the job. The  job listing said that they will begin reviewing applications in  February and are aiming for June to start the position. I hadn't heard  anything about the job after three weeks of February, so I reached out  to see if there had been any updates to the position. They responded  within five minutes saying that they were still collecting applications  and haven't started the interview process but would email me to give an  update on my application once the interview process had begun. Now it is  March, and I still haven't heard anything. I am currently an RA and  trying to find a new position in research I am more interested in. Has anyone had a similar  experience to this, or any ideas as to what could be happening? Thank  you &lt;3"

2,2023-03-08,"For those who've successfully sought internal promotion, what was the experience like for you?",u/digitalUID,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11m6om3/for_those_whove_successfully_sought_internal/,jobs,"I've always been someone to go after what it is that I want. As such, I've received most of my career promotions from external moves every 2-3 years. I'm finally at a company that I like, in a role that I am pretty good at and would like to keep. However, I found out a few months back that I was hired in at a ""junior/entry level"" pay grade despite nearly a decade in the field, degrees, etc. I took the job despite this, because it's still okay pay and I was pivoting out of a failed career change experiment. Ergo, I had no leverage.

I've been communicating with my manager the past couple months about moving up. She agrees that I am being underpaid based on the internal career framework that we have. That said, the process seems incredibly daunting and cumbersome. From what I've gathered from our discussions, this process might wind up taking months, if not another full year.

I don't think it should be this difficult, especially since I am already performing at a senior level. So, I figured I'd ask those who've successfully gone through this internal process. How was the experience? Was it worth it to you? What would you say that success primarily boiled down to? Was it more about the right timing than it was about already doing the job? How long did it take? Part of the problem IMO is her lack of political capital. The other part of the problem is that we're operational support for a legal department. When the department does get nice things, chances are it's going to the attorneys.

Thanks in advance for your insights. I'm trying to decide if this process is worth it to me, or if I need to take matters into my own hands."

This covers things from natural resource management to event planning, so either way I will have the same degree. I have wanted to be a park ranger my entire life and I thrive outdoors, but as it gets closer the low pay and multiple years of seasonal jobs are starting to sound like too much. I have thought about being a wedding planner before but I’m not really sure how to get into that.

Park ranger-

Pros: The Dream™️, very passionate about public land conservation, I have lots of experience in the outdoors, high physical capabilities, already have a summer internship through Northwest Youth Corps

Cons: paid like crap, the multiple years of seasons sounds extremely stressful, I don’t want to be forced to uproot my life for 4 months to get paid minimum wage, takes a long time to become steady, not really a thing in other countries so I would never be able to live somewhere else if I wanted

Wedding planner- 

Pros: sounds extremely satisfying (I love seeing people happy and in love), I’d love to work specifically with queer couples to provide them with a wedding just as amazing as a straight couple, I hate the idea of “bridezilla” and want to empower people on their special day, seems easier to get into, and I’m very routine based and a bit of a control freak so I think I’d be good at it 

Cons: from what I’ve seen online the pay isn’t great, idk how to get into it, I’m very anxious so I think I’d feed off the stress of the wedding party, and the idea of having certain days I couldn’t take off (in the case of an emergency is something) or I’d lose my career is super stressful, also most of the wedding planners I know have their own business and idk if I could do that

The first job I had was out of college, which I stayed for 2 and half years.  I liked everything about it, but I felt like I was over looked for the work I did an wasn’t being compensated for it, and really the raises were very low.

Someone contacted me about a job basically said it should be exactly the same. However it came with a 22% salary increase.

Came in the first week, and it’s honestly rough and not anything they said it was. 

I can do the work but in reality this isn’t where I want to be. I will never fit in here, and the atmosphere is awful.

I guess I never thought of any of this stuff. Since my last job I liked everything besides the pay.

Both jobs were in defense, an honestly I want to get more into private sector. I know I should have been more prepared and more motivated to make that jump, but I was honestly just comfortable in my old job.

I guess what I was curious about is can I start applying now to jobs while holding this job down, and while I apply, should I even put this on my resume?  

The only thing that is going to suck, if I don’t put it on currently is that I now have an end date on my last job making it look like I quit.

I don’t know what to do, I really don’t want to wait 6 months into this job to start looking but I think that would possibly be the best choice so it doesn’t look like I’m just completely skipping out on a job when applying again.

Currently I make  in the low 100K with my experience I’m unsure if I can really even get that again,
What I do have now is actually be motivated to get out of this place."

My boss pulled me aside while I was working and asked me. I really need the money which is why I started working here in the first place so of course I said yes. I'm super thankful and am willing to work hard. But I'm worried that the 15 or so people who work in this department will resent me because I just started. They are all senior to me. My co worker who has been working here for almost a year asked me what the boss wanted. When I told them, they thought it was ""interesting."" Any one have thoughts on this? 

FYI I would still have to interview for the job and my boss said I could step down later down the road if I wanted to. Also, this is a factory job with a high turnover rate."

So far, it seems like broadly speaking, you can 'sometimes' just send them your resume and they'll reach out whenever they have roles (?) or, you apply on the job board on their website and hope you get a call back.  


is that it though? As it kinda feels like im just applying as normal on Indeed/LinkedIn... Not too sure how this works."

It's been a few days now and I would like to send a follow up email stating I am still interested in the position for the place I applied if available incase I have been forgotten about. Can someone please help me with tips or a rough template? I'm a little bit lost on the wording unfortunately.

2. What is the culture like working in this field?   

3. What would my daily responsibilities look like for this job?   

4. What does typical pay and benefits look like?   

5. What are some examples of continuing education I would need in order to stay in this career?

I'm a single guy with no kids and pretty cheap rent (about $700).

I just accepted a job at a local garden shop chain for $17 an hour as their ""driver"", delivering anything from plants to landscape supplies to patio furniture.  Today was my first day and I was told numerous times by the boss that I will have days that I don't drive at all, and most days I'll only be leaving once, maybe twice. And in the meantime they basically want me to be a sales associate, which was never discussed and I honestly wouldn't have accepted the job in the first place if I'd known that. But they're all super nice and are really welcoming and excited for me to be there. I personally however have zero desire to work in a retail setting.

In the last week though I was offered another job that pays a bit more and I'd be driving all day which I like and am very used to as I used to deliver for Amazon. I liked that job but I hated Amazon's constant bullshit so I left. This job also will give me the same schedule every week and a 2-day weekend, where the garden shop rotates every week and it doesn't seem like I'll have 2 consecutive days off unless I ask for them.

Anyway - my dilemma is that I think I'd rather do the latter. But I feel really bad leaving the garden shop already as today was my first day, but it drove the point home that retail is not something I'm interested in. How should I go about this? Tell them in person or shoot a text? At this point a two week notice seems like a waste because they could be training someone who actually cares in thst time. So I feel like letting them know sooner rather than later would be wise for both me and them but again I feel bad haha and I haven't ever really felt bad for an employer before. Any advice is appreciated"

7,2023-03-08,What is considered too many jobs for employers? I guess I'm considered a job hopper?,u/AN0nUSeR007,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11meh9q/what_is_considered_too_many_jobs_for_employers_i/,jobs," Hey  guys, I am curious about how my life decisions may affect me for future  jobs, or not. I'm currently 30 years old and had 4 jobs since 2016, but  one I don't have on my resume. I went to school (originally) for  Political Science, hoping to work in intelligence, but that won't  happen; at least not in this degree. I feel I wasted my time and my  money (and parents money) going to school for it. I'm now going back for  Cybersecurity (online). I have 90 credits transferring, so I basically  just need the core Cyber classes. I *think*  I'll do well, but we'll see. I'm curious if my current resume would  matter much after I get the degree and eventually ""hack into the field?""

1. What is considered too many jobs in x amount of years?
2. How soon is too soon to change a job?
3. Will my current resume matter once I get my new degree and IF I get a job in that field?

Here's a break down of my resume:

1. Grocery Store- worked up to Frozen Manager (7/13-10/19)
2. DA's Office- Clerk Typist 1 (10/19-05/21)
3. Took job at dealership from May-August; not on resume. Started work again at job 4
4. Student Loans CSR Rep 2 (Nationally known Company). (02/22-02/23)

I  had a few ""good"" things I could write and talk about for between the  DA's and the Student Loan Company. I was never fired; attendance isn't a  issue. If I like the job and do well, I'm a good worker and dedicated.  But what do you think HR pros would think of me?

I'm  not working right now, but have an interview at a local Sheetz tomorrow  for a Team Member, well below me. But it would be PT work, while going  to school and possibly help reset my resume when I graduate. But I'm  concerned about longevity, how I look, etc. I wish I had 1 or 2 jobs  since graduating in 2016. Not 4. Technically, 3 cause that's all that's  on the resume. My parents and friends are worried about how I can ever  progress somewhere with the ""short stints."" Here's the thing, IF I get  the degree, do well in school and get a job in that career, I am  planning on staying in that field from let's say 31/32 through 65-67. If  I live a full life and enjoy the field enough.

What  do you guys think of me? Should I be worried? I saw online the average  is 12.6 jobs throughout a career and life, I'm already at ""4."" No one is  at that dealership from the time I started as they have a super high  turnover rate. Same for the loan company. I'm just concerned about  myself though and my future. Should I be? What would advice would you  have for someone like me?

Thanks  in advance! I'll reply if necessary. -I've got a clean background, no  drugs, never arrested, etc. So I have at least that, that'll help me  out- if that even matters much. lol"
2,2023-03-08,"What to do after being told you're ""not a good fit.""",u/Consistent_Train128,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11mema4/what_to_do_after_being_told_youre_not_a_good_fit/,jobs,"In January I started a new job. It was as an outside sales rep. I had no experience in the industry or sales, but some general managerial experience and the stated idea was that it was a sales into management role where I'd sell for 1-2 years before taking over as a manager. The outside position was meant to be someone who was out of the office the most of the time interfacing with existing or potential clients.

In the offer letter it did indicate the first 60 days would be ""introductory"". When I started they indicated I would start off working in the office to familiarize myself with the products, customers, systems, etc. 

Most of my co-workers were significantly older than me and had a decade or far more experience in the industry and much of my training consisted of sitting at the desk answering the phone and annoyingly asking them questions because I knew nothing. 

I slowly gained knowledge and last month they sent me to another office to shadow another outside rep for a few days. The other rep was knowledgeable, but all we really did was go see clients who he'd worked with for 20 years and was friends with. A great picture of where I would want to get but little in terms of how. 

When I returned my boss let me go out one day to some company's I'd googled, it went like a first day would, OK but not much to show for it. She then turned me onto a different website and said we'd work on a better schedule next week. She wound up being out sick most of the week, so I did what I had been doing in the office. Towards the end of the week she came back in and said I need to be out meeting with more potentials since I was the outside rep. I said great and propsed one or two ideas. She then said I should try and make a majority of my daily meetings arranged in advance instead of dropins (which is fair, though different than the rep I shadowed had told me). This was last week. I spent Monday and Tuesday cold calling. I mainly got voice-mails or got told to send an email to x address, but did manage to schedule two meetings for later this week.

This morning, at 60 days, I was let go for ""not being a good fit."" I asked three times for a better description/reason for my own professional growth and future employment prospects. I was given none. I was told I was smart and that I could have future employers reach out for a reference (doubt I'll take them up on that).

Although this was rather unexpected until a few days ago they obviously a lot I could've done better. The place was low stress, the was office empty by 5 (very different from other jobs I've had). When I asked questions I was told I would learn this stuff with time. As a result I never developed the sense of urgency or initiative that they must have been looking for from me. I didn't think I was supposed to be leaving the office until 60 days, but in hindsight I shouldn't have let that allow me to become complacent with it. In addition, I had low interest in the job/industry and had taken it largely due to the total comp being about $100,000 (when factoring in the office center profit bonuses) plus lighter working hours. These are mistakes I don't intend to repeat. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm 26 and single with no kids, I have a degree and other work experince, my only debt is a car that is 60-70% paid off. I've got at least 6 months of my salary saved, don't live beyond my means, can tighten my belt a little, and I'm not above driving uber to help with cash flow. Plus if all else fails I've got family I could fall back on (I'd rather not let it get to that, but my point is I'm not headed for the street). I'll be alright. 

My question is how do I put this experince on my resume? My LinkedIn profile? What do I say about it when asked in a job interview? I had a decent resume with four years of experience prior to this. Other acceptable job offers I turned down. Have I just thrown that away in 60 days because my most recent employment ended like this? Just looking for some advice on the best possible way to move past this without letting it wreck everything I've done in my life up until this point. Thanks in advance. 

Sorry for the rant and the vaugueness. Just looking to get my thoughts together before I speak to friends and family about this. Not that they won't be supportive, I'm just personally and professionally embarrassed for lack of a better word."

In my 18 years of working, I’ve never had more than two, so I’m wondering how to best prepare for a third. 

The first one was a 30-minute phone interview with the head of the department. They described the position’s primary duties and day-to-day to see if it was something I’d be interested in. 

The second was a one-hour sit down with the same person, where we talked about my experience as it relates to the position. It went great and felt more conversational than anything. 

The third will be with the General Manager and President/CEO, so not directly related to horticulture. Will the questions be similar to the second interview or will they have a different focus/priority? I’m not sure how to approach it, at least as it relates to the position I’m applying for. 

Any guidance would be appreciated."
1,2023-03-08,sign on bonus,u/PaulaBeany,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11mf860/sign_on_bonus/,jobs,"Hoping someone can give me good advice. I am a new grad nurse who signed a two year contract with a $7000 bonus. the bonus is paid in halves 3 months after start date and at the one year mark. I am currently 6 months in, so I got the first $3500. I want to renegotiate or cancel the contract but not necessarily quit. After starting I realized things weren’t really the way I was told they would be during my interview (staffing and ratios mostly, I know it’s a nationwide problem but higher ups are pushing the limits to cut costs). My manager is amazing and my coworkers are amazing too,so the issues aren’t because my manager lied in the interview, it’s the higher ups who are changing things.  Also, I know the pay of nurses who started a few months before and after me, and i’m just not happy with the terms I agreed to anymore, AND I know that if I do quit now, I can get paid more elsewhere. I don’t want to quit- but i’m not afraid to quit either of that what it comes down to. 

so basically, I want to ask to change the contract in some way. either drop the second payment and change to just a year contract (3500 sign on for 1 year), drop the entire contract and i’ll pay the 3500 back (no sign on, no retention- just a hired employee), or keep the 2 year but renegotiate pay instead of the second payment (3500 sign on, raise, 2 year contract). is there a specific way I should go about this or any tips? If I can’t get a shorter contract or just work without a contract then i’ll probably end up quitting anyway sometime before the year mark and the second payment and just repay the 3500. 

TIA !"
3,2023-03-08,how to tell a potential employer that you have another interview?,u/WealthWooden2503,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11mf92b/how_to_tell_a_potential_employer_that_you_have/,jobs,"Hey y'all! I was here not long ago with a different question. Again, sorry if this has been addressed recently, but I'm not sure how to handle this potential situation

So I have two interviews back to back next week (Monday and Tuesday) one for full time, one for part time. Hypothetically let's say I'm offered both positions, since I've heard that both places are fairly desperate for employees and I am qualified (I know that doesn't mean I'll get the offer, let's just say I do). 

I would like to check out both places in case one is strikingly more to my liking than the other. I've heard that company A will often offer the job on the spot after the interview. So with that in mind, if they do offer me the job on the spot, how do I tell them that I need a bit of time to decide because I have another interview the following day? Do companies get offended by this kind of thing? 

Also, let's say I decide to take job A (after having done both interviews) and it turns out to be awful and I can't hang. Is there a way to tell company B, professionally, that I would like to try out company A and if it doesn't work out then I would love to take their offer? 

This is probably disjointed and I apologize if so. I'll take any input or thoughts! By the way, these are both basically minimum wage jobs so it's not like I'm interviewing to be CFO or anything, if that makes a difference. 

Thanks!"

It went well and I was told to expect an invitation for the next round. This took about a week. After the second interview, I waited 4 more days to hear back. I had made it to the third round and it was 5 more days until the next interview. After the third interview I was told that I would be moving on to the 4th round. The 4th round would involve at least an hour of research, a writing assignment that would take 1-2 hours, and a 5 minute presentation to prepare. This was scheduled for 8 days later.

After my 3rd round interview with company A, I heard from company B. They had emailed me with interest and asked me to fill out a couple of qualifying questions and a calendar link to schedule my first interview for the next day. The first interview went well and I heard back that afternoon to schedule the next interview for the day after. Second interview went well and I was invited to the office to meet the team for the day after. Things went well and I received the offer the next day.

I was in my third week of the interview process with company A and in the time it took them to schedule an interview, I had gone through the entire process and signed an offer letter with company B. 

I understand that the market is competitive and employers have to do their due diligence, but at what cost? They are losing good employees to more efficient companies.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?"

I feel the background explains why I'm up against the wall and could really love some advice or suggestions.

Background: 

I had a job I loved. I was really **good** at it. I went above and beyond and feel I made a difference for my clients and for my team.

* I became sick and was on intermittent FMLA. I didn't have a choice, but not a week went by without my needing 1-3 days off during the week. This went on for months.
* Of course they hated me. I hated me. I tried everything I could do to maintain 40 hours of productivity in sometimes 16-24 hours.
* I could not, of course, maintain my previous performance level - I fell behind, asked for help, and some of my workload was transferred to other coworkers. 
* I was  fired for spurious reasons, but I couldn't get my union to even answer my calls, so I just chalked it up to lessons learned and moved on. 
* I've heavily reflected on my time in that position and have invested significant time in addressing my personal performance and my personal failings. I also recognize some very toxic aspects of that job, and how I inadvertently contributed and allowed things to continue. I'll be a stronger employee and a better advocate for myself in the future.
* Additionally, the illness and all related issues are well-controlled now and will not reoccur.

I have no references from that job. The people I would have asked were all involved in my firing and the spurious reasoning behind it.

The job was primarily an administrative job with heavy and challenging customer service, and some really unique organizational, technical, and mathematical situations. There was a great deal of knowledge and research involved. I'm bragging, but I was **good**.

* I have a phone interview with a company in the same field. I'm not sure how to address my reasons for leaving, in particular, or any other related questions they might ask.
* I can confidently speak of my performance, additional tasks I completed, and some successes I'm quite proud of.
* I  can't get beyond my firing and my lack of references - I feel like that might be irreparable harm and prevent me from ever working in this field.

There are other jobs out there that would utilize my skills, but I've never seen anything else that fit me that well.

Can anyone offer advice? Suggestions?"

Yes, you can become a commercial pilot at 250 hours of flight time, but you can NOT get ANY jobs besides a flight instructor, if you don’t like the idea of teaching, sign offs, paper work, etc. don’t think of becoming an instructor, you will live at the airport for $12 an hour, maybe a little more if lucky. I’m currently looking for low hour jobs other than instructing and there is nothing out there, you’ve probably heard of pipeline flying, fire watch, sightseeing, or aerial photography, that will hire at low hours. Those jobs get so many pilot applicants that now they are requiring 1,000 hours or more, those low time jobs aren’t low time anymore. Before going to college and flight school you better think long and hard about how long you want to be unemployed because the aviation field is a complete nightmare unlike what you have heard. Don’t fall for the trap and look into other career fields, flying might be fun but doing it for a career is an expensive, long career path that doesn’t guarantee anything after training. Good day."

I have been job hunting for a while, and it has been rough. Initially, I was doing it more to scope out the market, but took it a lot more seriously after getting laid off recently.

The thing I noticed is that a real, human recruiter who actually views my resume is significantly more likely to talk to me at all. I realize that the majority of the time, no one has ever even seen my resume because it’s getting tossed out by computer scanners.

The reason Workday pisses me off so much more than others is that it requires so much more work. It expects you to basically rewrite your entire resume for every company, only for no human to ever see it. Over the course of my entire career thus far, I’ve probably applied to hundreds of companies, and I’ve never, ever heard back from a single company that used this fucking piece of shit.

It’s getting to a point where I question if it’s even worth applying to a company that uses it, but unfortunately its popularity keeps growing - especially at major companies. I always try to get internal referrals, but that’s not really possible when you don’t know anyone at the company.


So, as it seems like there isn’t much choice - how do you get past a system like that? My resume is filled with tons of keywords, but what else can I do?"

So I spoke with the HR recruiter, who told me that the company I was interviewing for (internally) is in the midst of a hiring freeze until, at least Q2. She told me that she will inform me of updates or when the position is approved.She said that the hiring manager is confident that they'll unfreeze this position, possibly sometime in April but no definitive time-line was said. 

She also told me that the hiring manager is extremely interested in me, and that there was great feedback from all my interviews with. Essentially it was implied that if this position was approved and there was no hiring freeze, I would've gotten the position.

I'm trying to formulate an email to the hiring manager and HR recruiter to thank them, touch base but also somehow mention or indicate that I was informally told that I got the position. What would be the best approach/phrasing/email for this situation?

Asking for a friend.

They  both have similar descriptions just one is remote and the other requires relocation. Would it be unprofessional for him to apply to both?  Worried abt the fact theyre diff levels of seniority and maybe the company would see him as unsure if he applies to two different levels. He has about 2 years of experience and could technically fit into both as the description isn't that specific. 

Seem to be on diff teams as well.

My manager is extremely supportive of me and my colleagues are wonderful to work with.

However, despite my manager’s best efforts, I got royally screwed over in the promotion cycle. I’m the team’s top performer (I’ve been rated this consistently by not only my team manager, but also also department leads as well) and they promised I would get a hefty bump this cycle. I don’t say this to brag, but I’m hoping this gives some context around why I had high expectations for an compensation increase. It turns out I was offered a measly 2K increase when the standard is around 10%— I’m already making around 25K less than my peers because I didn’t negotiate the last promotion cycle, so this would put me way behind others.

I know it’s hard to negotiate with companies and my best bet is to leave, but I really do love my team and the work I do. I don’t want to leave but I’m not sure if I’m confident enough to negotiate to the level I want (I’m pretty inexperienced when it comes to haggling salary, I’ve never done it and have always accepted what was given). However, I’m scared to start somewhere new and lose the trust, comfort and familiarity of my current position. Has anyone had a negotiation turn out well for them? Or should I cut my losses?"

I'm at a career crossroads,u/TeacherA,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11mooo1/what_would_you_do_im_at_a_career_crossroads/,jobs,"I'll do my best to keep this brief. Basically, I have been with my company for almost four years now. Company is slightly an organizational mess due to numerous poorly executed acquisitions, but the people are generally good and the products are decent.

* Was hired originally by someone very senior and tenured at the company, he's the best boss I've ever had. My role is essentially in sales support and management and my teams had some great success in the first 2-3 years. During this time, for complicated reasons, I moved from W2 to 1099.
* After our company was bought out by private equity, an internal org change took me away from his team, but I reported to someone new who was also great and senior at the company. I made it known I wanted to move back to fulltime from 1099 and we agreed we would work on that, including a decent bump in pay to reflect the success we'd had in the previous years.
* Fulltime employment offer never materialized, told budget constraints made it difficult but boss was advocating and pushing for it. Got to the point where he said salary was agreed and that it was a matter of timing around the FY 23 budget.
* Boss wants to expand my role, possibly give me a better title. I start working on important, high level projects in operations with very senior members of the company (OOO and VP level). This is also being used to internally justify going back fulltime at a better salary.
* I am enrolled by my boss (2nd boss) in our internal management training program. I graduate from this just before the FY 23 budget is released.
* Budget finally released, lo and behold, no dice on fulltime hire/promotion. Further, with the budget comes layoffs and a big org change. My boss is promoted, I am assigned to a completely different team no longer reporting through the COO but through the CRO's office. I have no prior relationship with my new boss. My new boss is more siloed in the org with less scope and has told me, reading through the lines, he prefers to reign in what I am doing on the operations side and wants me to help him out with his narrow focus in the company.
* Since no fulltime offer is ever going to come (was told that decision was for an indefinite period due to budget/headcount issues) I propose a new amendment to my 1099 agreement which would fix several things and bump my pay (important: they converted me from W2 to 1099 1:1 on pay instead of bumping pay 25-50% as is customary). They have been reviewing for three weeks with no indication of what's going to happen.
* Last straw, asked for updates on contract, get very cagey and short responses. Same day, get personally insulted over teams by of of my former SMEs who was promoted themselves (most unprofessional communication in my career). Am now actively applying for jobs.

Want advice, what should I do? Pros for staying are: the people are good and I am well liked for the most part by leadership and my peers. Being 1099 I have great scheduling flexibility. Despite everything above, my current compensation is very good for where I live, but not up to average standards for my profession, globally speaking. Getting a fulltime job where I live will be slightly more difficult and will likely involve a paycut and less flexibility. However, I no longer see a longterm future at my current company. Despite assurances made on a personal level by several coworkers/leaders, the behavior of the company itself indicates that the value employees feel I bring is not a structural concern for the company. 

So basically, do I continue to just put in the minimum, enjoy my flexibility and ride my 1099 as long as I can knowing there's no long term plan here (including saving for retirement btw, the lack of a retirement benefit is weighing heavily on me)? Or do I cut my losses and attempt to rebuild reputation and success somewhere else in the hopes of finding career progression there?

Thanks in advance everyone"

I have an interview today for a founding team data science role at a startup in India. All other rounds are over and today is the final call. In the earlier rounds, they told me that the startup is well-funded. I graduated from a top IIT and have about 4 years' worth of work experience, although not in this domain. But I did do an extensive program in DS and ML recently. Given that the office is in BKC, Mumbai, India, how much CTC do you think I can ask for?

Until now, I have only worked in organisations where salary negotiations were straightforward and so, this is a bit new to me.

I don't want to undervalue myself, nor do I want to scare them off with an exorbitant number. So, as per the current market rates for data science roles, could you please suggest a ballpark figure that I can ask for? It would be super helpful if I can understand the breakdown as well. Anyone with advice to offer, feel free to chime in.

Thanks a lot in advance :)"

The work conditions have been pretty terrible all throughout, I don't get breaks, we are understaffed every shift and my manager is incompetent and sort of abusive.

Its a no brainer that I should quit. I've got two shifts this weekend, sat and sun night, but I'm debating quitting tonight (thursday) or tomorrow morning (friday). It's obviously not a lot of notice, but the plan was to call in sick to both of my shifts and also quit. 

I live in Australia and the laws around casual workers allow me to quit whenever I want and not go to any shift I don't want to, but I'm worried about my bosses reaction and possibly him giving me a bad reference due to the short notice.

For reference, I have been working two shifts a week for the last couple of months, and I've been a great worker. I show up early to every shift and dont call in sick often. I'm just sick of the place, and its getting hard to keep up with schoolwork while maintaining a job like the one I have.

I need some advice on whether it's worth riding out the last two shifts (although i really dread going to work) or if I should just quit without leaving much notice. Thanks."

I had my first interview about 4 weeks again and my second about 3 weeks ago. Since this is a company I previously worked for, I do this have some connections within. 

My friend reached out to me on Monday saying they spoke with HR and that I was going to be offered the job however it is now Thursday morning and I have heard nothing. 

I informed them during my interview that I would be able to start after March 7th, however another issue has arose where the weekend of the 17-19th I have family coming into town unexpectedly. If they were to call me today and offer me the job to start Monday, I would need my first weekend off (this job entails working on the weekend). I feel it would look bad if I was to push the start date back since my start date has changed a bit. Also they are desperate for help so I figured I would have heard something. 

When are Jon offers typically given? Is there a certain day of the week? Do I reach out and inform them of my change of start date? If I do, will that impact my chances of getting hired?"

What is everyone's PTO like nowadays? When I started with my current company in 2011, I was given two weeks of PTO and the option to buy up to 40 hours of ""flex time."" At just shy of my 12th year, my PTO is fully maxed out at four weeks + five floaters, in addition to your standard holidays. We have ""unlimited"" sick time, but a doctor's note is required if five days in a row are missed.

One of the reasons I'm hesitant about leaving my job is because I don't want to potentially ""restart"" at the bottom of the ladder with one or two weeks PTO at a new company despite having 14 years of overall experience. 

I recall reading in various posts in this sub that more companies are starting to base starting PTO on overall years of industry experience instead of years with the company. I think this is a fantastic idea, but can also see the issues that could cause; a 10-year employee that started with one week PTO would be understandably miffed to see someone with similar experience starting at 4 weeks PTO, for example.

What's everyone's experience with this?"

They went radio silent and today (9 March) they sent me another email asking for a zoom call on monday as the job position is open again if I am interested.

This is exhausting and I feel like either I cannot trust them or the job. I dont know if they are firing people they are hiring for this position every month and thus keep coming back to me or either they are playing or idk.

My actual job sucks so fucking much and they are not giving me a raise but I am scared to leave the stability I have for something that can have me out of employment in a month. 

Has anyone got any tips on how to proceed with this? Anyone been through something similar?

Thank you so much!"

Edit: In short: Do these exist? I have an undergrad in communications and environmental studies, if that helps; job experience is mostly blue collar, most skilled role being a stint in a prototyping facility. Some written work published but only by self and in student newspapers. 

Right now, it's end of season, so many part-time jobs are no longer available. Still, I would love to rebuild savings... You take this job for the memories and the snowboarding, but you can't pay bills with memories. I'm also worried a tad my skillset is declining. This is my first year out-of-college and my college friends all note the market is still very competitive.

There are jobs outside of the resort, but we aren't allowed to park our cars within the valley, only in an overflow lot several mountains away. Big orange has a location several mountains over that's hiring- but I'd have to sleep in my car or risk walking 3 hours along the highway.

I write as a hobby, but freelancing isn't famous for having a great market right now. I may try writing some portfolio pieces as it's a good hobby to have in a town where all there is to do is drink afterwork, and drinks are $20 a piece. The people I've met here who've been evicted or ""couldn't make it"" generally fell victim to the bars, not gonna lie, and the bars are savage... your bartender is your bestie until you order something non-alcoholic.

So, a flexible online part-time job seems like the best fit- seems higher-skilled than a lift job, and fit my schedule, while not risking mountain travel- but it seems a little ""too good to be true"".

Anyone have any experience or luck finding such a gig?"

People say it’s different on the second go around but not sure how true that is. 

The company is fairly small and my team was on the smaller side as well. I learned a lot and had a lot of exposure, but I’m afraid that in only 9 months I won’t have enough “experience” (&lt; 1 year) or transferable skills (I’m a data/business analyst). I scrolled through LinkedIn for a minute but decided to stop and go get some air to clear my head. 

I’m also worried financially as I don’t live at home and wasn’t prepared for this since I really didn’t see it coming - the company has been hiring recently. The layoffs were not isolated to one department as far as I can tell since the email was sent to the whole company stating that there would be a follow up call for those “affected”. 

Any advice?  Feeling pretty down on myself right now."

The pay is okay and my coworkers are decent, but I am not liking it so far.

For context, I have anxiety, depression and autism. I’ve been at my job for three weeks. I had an internship at a different company but gave it up for this full time job. Now, I’m thinking that wasnt the right decision. The main problem i have is this job has me sitting at a desk all day. I dont feel like im learning anything new or interesting, and i basically rewrite press releases to go onto the website. I feel like I’m not doing meaningful work that’s important to me. I’m bored for most of the day and this makes my anxiety run rampant. I’ve fallen into a bit of a quarter life crisis and am wondering if this is what life is going to be like after graduating. 

I like something where I feel like I’m learning new things, meeting people and getting new experiences. With this job I just feel like I’m being left to rot away. I always told myself I didn’t want a desk job, but here I am. I also have to be here 9 hours a day, and its a 30 minute drive from my house, so i’m taking 10 hours out of my day everyday to be here. I barely have anytime to recharge between shifts. I haven’t been eating due to stress. As a result, I feel miserable but am wondering if I’m being a baby or if I just need to stick it out.

Because of my autism, change and transition has always been difficult for me. But I’ve done internships and jobs in the past that haven’t made me feel like this. I’m thinking about contacting my old internship and asking if I can come back. I’m just afraid to have a gap in my resume. I’m also applying to other jobs. I live with my mom, and she says she will support me if I decide to stay or not, but I’m not sure what to do. I talked to hr about my situation and she just gave me a cold, corporate response and a number to a crisis line. 

I feel like I want to quit, but I’m also considering sticking it out. I just feel empty, anxious and numb everyday. If I quit then I’ll feel guilty for wasting everyone’s time and like a failure for not pushing on. Even if I was offered accommodations I just don’t think I like the work I’m doing. I don’t like to say no to people and I consider myself to be a determined person. I hate quitting things, which is making this really difficult for me."

Ive gotten 3 interviews but no offers. I saw an add for google certs, which include project management and data analytics. Many of the jobs I apply to have one of those two skills listed. I just want to know if a cert like this would help with getting entry level jobs? or do they want experience only? I see tons of job openings in the sustainability field but most want 2 years experience at a minimum. The jobs for recent graduates are few and far between. 

My university (Arizona Sate) also offers a few certs, like ""principles of ESG and Sustainability and business"" and ""Sustainability analyst fundamentals specialization"". I can also go for a Microsoft certification, but I already know Microsoft office pretty well, I don;t need anymore education in it to use it at a job. 

These certs seem easy and affordable to get, but would my time be better spent just sending out as many applications as possible, or would they actually help me open more doors?"

I'm in graduate school for an MBA full time. I worked within this restaurant where I've worked at in some capacity for over 10 years. The previous owners sold and there was an M&amp;A in December and I was promoted into a lower level management position. 

On Tuesday, I simply let their executive chef know that I took a large catering order for the following morning. Long story short, I was cussed out and disrespected so badly. I previously worked in mental health and encountered people incarcerated, losing their kids, mentally unstable, people I've written CPS on and this Chef took the cake. I finished my shift, crying the entire day (I NEVER cry) and when I came to my senses, I said I'm not coming back. This is NOT the first time he's been flat out disrespectful and I've mentioned that he needs to learn how to speak to people but this was beyond anything I've seen out of anyone before. 

I sent an immediate resignation letter that night to others in my management team and to HR. The CFO of the company called me 9:30 that night absolutely appalled and apologizing to no end. He asked if I would be interested in other areas of the company because of my education and not wanting to lose me. I told him I'd be open to a conversation. 

HR followed up with me the following morning and again, I got multiple apologies and was told there were going to be major consequences for this chef. He too echoed interest in using me elsewhere. I sent him my resume as well as the CFO's marketing director. 

I'm awaiting phone calls regarding the recruitment and the marketing. I haven't written off the opportunities but at the same time I'm unsure what I want to do. The CFO and others in management have no ill feelings towards me, in fact, they've all went to great lengths to encourage me to come back. I told them it's out of the question for me to return to my previous position if he remains employed which they understood. In cases like this, is it best to end the professional relationship or really embrace the move and see where it goes?"

We recently had yearly reviews, and I got a raise similar to people on my team but nothing more for my extra responsibilities.

Can I ask for a raise to be compensated for the extra responsibilities I have? I was trained on this whole other job over the course of 3 or 4 months.

From what i understand its similar to salaried work except that you dont get the employee benefits and it only last for 6 months to a year until renewal. But im not sure if the loss of benefits equals the ability to negotiate a higher pay or not ... especially given i am relatively inexperienced.

I thought I could tell them that I accept as long as they know I will continue looking for something long term. Family says I shouldn’t say anything because if they said the job was temp, then they know I would be looking for other positions.

I was so baffled on why she even scheduled the phone call when I gave most of that information in my cover letter. I wrote an email to the company outlining my experience with her and I’m anxious to see how they reply. 

Has anyone else gone through something crazy like this?

Edit: she just called me for an in-person interview with the Director and the rest of the team I would be working under/with. No mention of my email so who knows if they’ve even read it yet.

Edit 2: I had my in-person interview today and it went sooooo well. Immediately after the recruiter emailed me to schedule a virtual meeting with the rest of the team later this week/early next. There’s been no mention of my email lol

Final Edit (3/28): I received a job offer! Still no mention of my email and the offer was exactly what I asked for."

6,2023-03-09,Looking for a new job and don't really know what I'm qualified for,u/GothMothLite,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11n96rk/looking_for_a_new_job_and_dont_really_know_what/,jobs,"So today I was part of a company layoff and now I'm in search for a new job. I went to school for geology (but graduated with a BA in individualized studies in environmental science), worked a few internships at state parks until we got kicked out because of COVID, worked retail, then went became an admin assistant, then a WFH ""researcher"". Between all that I worked retail.

I don't want to work retail all my life, but I don't know where to go from here. My dream was working in the parks, but I can't afford to do more internships for experience (they pay next to nothing) - same with seasonal work. I owe a LOT in student debt so I just can't afford it (and now regret going to college). 

Most careers in geology want a BS and usually different licenses (that I can't even afford if I wanted to) and even then I haven't seen anything that interests me. No zoos or museums near me are hiring in anything related to my major (mostly retail or cafe). Other jobs I don't even know what to really search for that I would've qualified for.

At this point I wouldn't mind working in an office (my last two jobs were somewhat office related), but I kind of stumbled into those accidentally. The first was a promotion in retail and the second was my friend worked there and recommended me. So I honestly don't know what I would even look for when searching for an office job. Maybe administrative assistant? But if I'm being honest my admin job was mind numblingly boring.

I love baking, but never went to culinary school. And I love creating art and have my own shop, but barely get orders. So I feel those aren't really realistic. 

Kind of a rant, kind if hoping for some help/guidance. If you got this far, thanks for listening! 

Tl;dr: I have no idea what to do anymore. Almost every job I've held I've hated or felt like a fruad. The only one I enjoyed was my internships in a field that doesn't pay enough to pay my loans."

My boss (owner) is looking for someone to fill his shoes so he can take more of a backseat and enjoy life since he is getting older. He is offering up a GM position, but wants to also look at outside candidates to see what will fit best. I find this to be reasonable. The salary is 65k to 75k based on experience and knowledge. 

He is using a business coach from out west which I’ve spoken with in the past, but was not impressed with his lack of knowledge in our trade. Either way the boss has him doing the first round of interviews and he wants 90 minutes of my time for an interview, even though we’ve spoken about such things for over an hour in the past. 

90 minutes seems very extensive for this, at least from where I am standing. I already run the shop for the most part, including keeping employees busy and handing out tasks as needed based on what needs to be done. 

So is 90 minutes a bit much? Is there a more suitable timeframe I could do this in? Perhaps something like 30-45 minutes given we spoke before? 

Tbh I’d like the job, but I choose to be the man in charge of this interview. I have the utmost respect for my boss, but this other guy is going to waste my time.

So here I am in Boston in March, newly unemployed; school starts August in Oregon (my field rarely offers full rides, so this is a great chance). Last week I took a part time job in the service industry that I'm honestly very excited about: it's a place I like with a great culture, and I've been saying for years I want to do a less brainy, honest job. It didn't come up in the interview what my plans were, and it took place just a few days after I accepted the grad school offer.... so I didn't tell the manager I will be moving. My first shift is tomorrow, and I am torn with guilt; the better they treat me, the guiltier I feel. Should I have told them? What do I do if it comes up in conversations with my coworkers? I wasn't sure what kind of job besides gigs I could get if I was transparent... but sitting for 4 months without a job isn't great either, or applying to short-terms constantly...

My fiancée is the breadwinner for us and works in the finance industry. She’s currently in the interview process at another firm - if offered she would get a base salary increase of $25-35k and a total comp boost of nearly $60k for the same type and amount of work, so it’s very appealing. The job is 4 hours from our current location and we would live at the beach.

My job is in the HVAC industry and not remote, so I had to look for a job as well. There are very limited opportunities in the area we’d relocate to outside of retail/hospitality. After her first interview, my fiancée was told she was moving to a final interview, so I submitted an application to the one open position I found in the area assuming it could also takes several weeks and run past her final interview date. To my surprise, they called me quickly and were impressed enough with my resume that they offered me the position after a quick phone interview. This was the day before her “final” interview.

Well, apparently her interview went so well that the company now wants to consider her for a more senior position than she originally interviewed for. My offer letter originally had an expiration date of tomorrow - I asked for more time and they gave me a final extension of Monday 3/20. Her interview for this new position is 3/15, but the company has said they may not make a decision and offer until the end of March. When she mentioned that I already had an offer letter, their response was essentially “that’s between the two of you to decide how you want to handle that”.

Should I accept my offer, and back out later in the event they don’t offer her at all? The cost of living is too high for us to move on one income, and her job opportunities would be very scarce as well outside of this company. We feel like it’s likely they’d offer her the original position if they don’t want to give her this second opportunity, but we’re in an awkward place and not sure how to proceed.

Any advice is appreciated - thanks in advance!"

Problem:
I am a college senior graduating from a semi-decent engineering school in the Midwest. During my time in college, I majored in mechanical engineering but also partook in the pre medical illustration. I took the mcat and did well enough to get into a medical school. Alongside my medical experience, I have worked as a part time software developer for a large agricultural company to pay for school. I have passion for both fields but now it’s time for me to choose which path to take. 

Personal Variables:
There are a significant amount of variables that are effecting my decision. To begin, my mom has medical issues which will prevent me from venturing out too far. Her disability forced her to retire early and my father is not much of a support system for her. She has been disabled since I was in grade school and I have always envisioned myself becoming a doctor. When picking majors in college I decided to choose something stable, hence the mechanical engineering degree. Now that I am graduating, I was offered full time employment at my current job (SW) and the full compensation package just breaches the six figure mark. This position is of interest to me as the job will be focusing on AI, however most of the time I feel like and idiot as my education has not prepared me for this position. I enjoy software engineering but have come to despise traditional mechanical engineering roles. In comparison, I really enjoy natural science and have done significantly better in this area compared to the software role I have been working in. I love supporting people and think I would make a great doctor. One of the drawbacks of medicine is that I enjoy having free time too much. I know that if I start school in August my 20s will be gone in a flash and medicine will cause me to miss out on family events (parental and spouse). I would love to combine these roles but the area I live in does not have any biomedical engineering jobs. I also interned for a biomedical company and was very disappointed in the pace.

What advice do you guys have for me? I would love to be a doctor but there are significant drawbacks. I enjoy the freedom SWE provides but know that I may not produce in the fashion I would like to. I would appreciate if Redditors in each field would chime in."

I am a college student and I was hired for my first management position as I am about to graduate in may. This was a management trainee position but I was referred to as the assistant manager, I was thinking this would be a good job to get on my resume. 


I had a pre interview where I guess she was just trying to see who I was and just put a face to name. After the pre interview she wanted a formal interview and I got the job on the spot. I started working a week from then and everything was going well or so I thought until today. 



I come and clock in and ask what I could do because I’m still new and I’m not familiar with retail whatsoever. I get told 1 thing to do and I do it and after that I walk around the store, shovel the snow out front of the store, and try and find things to do as my manager is in the back doing paperwork. I’ve shadowed as told by my manager different employees, I’ve sold shoes to customers, I like to think I have good people skills as I’ve gotten good reviews from customers since I started on Monday.



 (For reference as I want to be transparent with the whole story, I am not inferring anything, I am a POC and I am the only POC that works here, all my co workers are not POC and all the customers that come in aren’t POC). 




My managers husband is in the marines, and he came in today to get their daughter, as she brought her in with her today into work. Her husband came in through the back as I was up front and as he was walking he talked to some of my coworkers, walked about halfway of the store and me and him made eye contact (my first time seeing him and his first time seeing me). As soon as we made eye contact he turned around and walked back to her office. He came back to the front with their daughter, I said hey how are you expecting a convo, all I got was a head nod down and he kept walking out the store with their daughter. 




Fast forward 30 min I clock out to go on my break, head to the back to grab my lunch out my bosses fridge and she goes “are you going on lunch” and I say yes and she goes “can I talk to you real quick” and she asks straight up do I like the job which I reply with yes, and she follows up with I am getting the vibe that you are disinterested with the job and that this isn’t a good fit. I then try and reassure her that I like the job and that quitting hasn’t crossed my mind at all, and it was like everything I was saying she was trying to combat, she asked if I see myself here long-term and she thought that in the long run she didn’t think that I would like the job and she also asked is this what I thought retail would be, she told me that everybody likes my personality, and she thinks that I get along with everybody well as well and I tried to reassure her multiple times, but she ended up saying I’ll let you go on lunch and I’ll let you decide what you want to do and I told her straight up then and there that I want this job and I like working here and I basically said it’s up to you on what you wanna do and she said I think it’s best if we part ways, I will have your check mailed to you and I will continue searching on what I’m looking for. 




I am just shocked that this is so sudden and so fast, I have so many questions,  and just don’t know what to think, I would love to know what you guys no matter how harsh, I will answer any questions you guys have also.


UPDATE!!!!!

Just spoke to HR, I was given a more formal reasoning as to why. I was told it was performance based and that my manager had made up her mind on Wednesday, 3 days into me working, and Thursday was the day she was going to fire me. I told HR it couldn’t possibly be performance based as this was a management trainee position and that I have asked question after question and have went above and beyond in my short tenure to please my manager, but she is saying performance based. This would also get rid of the theory that her husband had anything to do with it unless HR was covering but I don’t want to spread rumors, these are just the facts. But I can assure my performance was not poor, my second day which was on Tuesday I worked a 10 hour shift which was longer than my manager, it was longer than anyone that worked there that day. My performance is not a question."

In that time, I’ve gotten my ears pierced and have starting stretching them (only plan on going to about 2G) and have grown my hair out (haven’t gotten a haircut in about 15 months). These are both things I’ve wanted to do pretty much my whole adult life, but never could because of my choice in careers. I’m not 100% against cutting my hair and removing my gauges, but would like to find a company that is a little bit more relaxed when it comes to these types of appearances. Would it be an acceptable thing for me to “screen” potential employers by first contacting their HR and asking for their dress code?

4,2023-03-09,Being used as a scapegoat by my team/division to save face. Terrible review from my manager that very clearly is intended to save the groups reputation. It literally says that my performance could've damaged their reputation - makes it clear to me why many details are left out. First review.,u/International_Melon,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11nevoa/being_used_as_a_scapegoat_by_my_teamdivision_to/,jobs,"As the newest member on the team we ""lost"" a project to another division because of missed deadlines. I really like my immediate coworkers, my boss might be pressured into doing this. Let's say its just the last half of the year we are talking about so 6 months July though December.. I was the sickest I had ever been in my life for 2 months of that time. I was actually chronically sick last year, but there were two times relatively close together during this period. 

And about during a month of that time it was well known ( I had made a schedule) I needed  my workers help during this critical period. They took almost a month of vacation in total, I was given about a days warning. 

The review is total bullshit. I got no raise because of this. I'm losing the privilege's to WFH has much as I would like before. I am going to be put on a PIP - my boss said this was not a strategy to get rid of me - and I believe him. I just think it's them tying up their loose ends. They can save face and put the blame on the new guy - rather than own up and no managers get any blame. 

Every time I bring something up that contradicts the narrative the answer is a ""a level 9 sorcerer should be able to..."" I've never even seen the definition of a ""level 9 sorcerer""  or any of the levels.

I don't want to leave this job. I'm living paycheck to paycheck even though I make a comfortable amount I really needed the money to pay off debts. I can't sit by and let me lie about me though. 

How do I tell my boss ""this is total bullshit, I'm being used as a scapegoat and I am disappointed by this behavior"" in a polite way? I don't even know how to broach the subject. We already had the in person meeting but I didn't read what was written until after; and I didn't really process how bad it was until I saw it written down. As more and more time passes it becomes more upsetting. 

The 0% raise seemed like it was meant to insult me, I believe it was. I obviously didn't perform at maximum during that time period largely because I got sick. What do I do?"

Seemed like a pretty solid job and the pay from the tips made it more than worth my while, enough to where I was able to move to the downtown area of my city with a friend of mine. As time went on I began to loathe that job, but I graduated with a degree in Communication in December.

Since I graduated I had been applying for jobs here and there for a few weeks, and then I, as well as about 20 other employees, got laid off about two weeks ago. I'm not even entirely sure what jobs I want at all, but having worked in food service and retail for the past 6 years has made me look at office jobs a bit more favorably. My roommate has also worked the same types of service jobs, but he quite enjoys the cannabis industry whereas I couldn't bring myself to care much about it after the novelty wore off. I'm 22 and do not have any ""professional"" experience, but have been applying to quite a lot of Administration Assistant, HR Intern/Assistant, Office Manager, Data Entry, etc types of jobs, specifically the entry level ones (duh) even though the pay isn't amazing, but nothing yet. 

I do not really have a problem working in a grocery store or food again, my main concern is how will I eventually move to a more professional career if employers see I'm just working at a restaurant or something. I'm also a bit hesitant to put the dispensary job on the resume because I don't want employers to think I'm some lazy pothead but maybe I'm just anxious. I'm looking into getting an A+ cert and maybe working in IT since it seems like a stable job, but I'm not sure about that just yet. 

I did also technically get hired this week as a substitute teacher for an education staffing company, I'm honestly just overwhelmed at the thought of going in and subbing for the first time without much formal training besides an online presentation sort of thing. Also most of the schools are in not great areas, two of them I just do not want to go to at all because I already had my car broken into once last month. I do plan on actually starting next week, though, it cost me almost $100 for that certification!

I'm rambling, but basically I'm just a bit flustered with the job search right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Just graduated college, anxious about getting more towards a professional career when I do not have much experience and also need any regular job pretty soon"

However, with the new board they want to mix up the internal team and ensure they have trusted outsiders in key positions. My immediate boss is one of the external recruits and she wants to bring someone in she's previously worked with to replace my role.

That means the options I have are to gracefully exit, get a 1yr pay as an exit fee\* and hope I can find another role - or stay and potentially take a pay cut of around 10-20% (though I'm hoping to negotiate same salary, because they don't want to make it messy or lose my knowledge).

Normally I would take the money and find my next opportunity but in the UK we're facing a potential 3-5 year recession/market cooling and part of me thinks - even a pay-cut leaves me on a good salary (dropping from 96th percentile to 93rd) and my new role would be easy - is the stress because I'm personally aggrieved at the loss in status worth throwing away a cushty job setup? During the growth phase my work life balance has been stupid, and it would be nice to focus in on that area of my life (just had my first kid too) - a friend has already said to me to just take the time to enjoy family life now instead of hamster wheeling to the next project.

*\*The reason for the exit offer is because it would be constructive dismissal in law because I'm not at fault and they're not making my role redundant. The offer is what I would receive if we went through a legal process so they're just short-circuiting that.*"

I graduated in January with the CDL to drive semi trucks. I received several job offers and was able to pick a company based on different qualities. I chose the company I ended up at now due to being told I would work 40-50 hours per week and be driving in rural areas- both good things for a new driver. The job offered to train me for 4-5 weeks. Once I started, I was told I would be driving in a major city, not in a rural area any longer. I stated my hesitation as a new driver in these areas and was told they would keep me on the outer edges until I felt more comfortable. Next, during training I worked between 12 and 14 hours per day Monday to Friday. I immediately discussed not wanting to work 60-65 hours as our previous discussions were for around 50 hours. I was told that these changes were due to my training period and that it would reduce to 50 once on my own. This week, I started to drive on my own having passed the training program. I have worked 13+ hours per day without being able to take breaks and have been in the very busy parts of the city. I expressed my concerns about hours worked as it feel it is unsafe being a new driver in such congestion while exhausted but was told I need to speed up if I want my hours reduced. 
Overall, everybody is very friendly except I get gaslighted when I try to voice my concerns.
In this scenario, I would typically give my 2 weeks notice, but at this point I feel too tired to go on safely. I am still in the probationary period and am considering telling them it will be my last day. I have a new job that has guaranteed limited hours and fewer stops for new drivers. 
Looking for advice on whether it would be appropriate to just leave in this scenario. I’m still in the probationary period without benefits for another month.
Thanks!"

Since that time I applied to a higher position at a different department within the company. I have an interview scheduled next week. My supervisor has not said anything to me since then and the recruiter within my company required that I notified my supervisor that I am applying to other positions within the company (I actually would have never told him if I didn’t need to).

Long story short my supervisor’s boss called me this week to tell me I was always in a position to get promoted. However during my review, my supervisor told me his boss signed off on only giving me a small raise, so at this point their words mean nothing to me.

I will take the most capitalist opportunity possible and if I get an offer next week within my company, I’m guaranteed a promotion.

I have also applied to jobs outside of my company but at this point I’ve decided I will be moving on from the current department I work in. The secrecy of my supervisor and his boss not sharing any conversations they have to the team as well as my supervisor being an incredibly disorganized idiot that doesn’t understand the field we work in is the reason I’m leaving."

Back to back to back, no buffer, and each one goes right up to time. I'm talking 15 meetings on some days. Usually on days like that, I'll be double or triple booked at certain times too. Having meetings is not my job, doing stuff that results from those meetings is, but over the last 6 months I very very rarely am finding the time to actually *work*. Today is Friday, my lightest day meeting-wise, and I have 9 meetings to go to starting in about 20 minutes. It's still fewer than the meetings I had M-Th though. 

I'll add that I work remote, in tech, and many others do too. I have a fair amount of responsibility and only 1 person to delegate to.That definitely increases the meeting volume, but it didn't used to be like this. I've been remote the whole time (3 years).

How can I fix this? Is this normal? These are 90% internal meetings. We also use slack and email heavily. Can I coach people to communicate differently that doesn't involve a meeting but they still get what they need? Are there any tools or workflows I can adopt?"

Ok so I once had an interview and a recruiter contacted and told me 4 times to let them know if I get an offer from another company. As I waited for their response, I wondered if having an offer from another company would automatically get me an offer from this company.

Unfortunately, that was my last interview so I had no other options. But I thought about lying and sending an email that I got an offer from another large company. 

Would lying have been a bad idea? How would they know if I am lying? Would lying to them about a job offer or telling them about a real offer at a large company automatically have gotten an offer from this company?

Why else did she tell me to let her know?"

My partner is out of town on a work trip. Here is some back story to the night. Partner thought they were the only ones there from the company and ran into 2 coworkers from a different side of company. They met for drinks, partner had one drink &amp; blacked out. They have never blacked out before. They ended up calling me that night &amp; it was apparent they were very messed up. I could barely understand them &amp; there was a lot of silence. I've seen them after several drinks &amp; they never sounded like they did. They texted and called me a bunch a few hours later after they passed out in their hotel room trying to figure out what happened. 

I told them what I could. They told me all they remember was getting a beer &amp; food then waking up in their hotel room. That one of the two coworkers was pounding drinks like crazy. The other drinking normally &amp; assumed they were getting along well as they were all talking about their relationships.

Turns out one of them said they made the other very uncomfortable. My partner very confused and worried asked what may have happened as they have almost no recollection of the night. They left them on read.  They also tried texting an apology to them &amp; was left on read as well. When they saw each other later in the day they fist bumped like nothing was wrong and went on with the day.

My partner then got an email &amp; call from their manager that they will be having a meeting with HR &amp; that he will be on their side during the meeting.

They had the meeting today &amp; told them nothing about what happened and said they would be in touch next week. 

Is it normal for HR to not tell you anything at all? The meeting was an hour long and they learned nothing about what happened. They just gave their side of the story. My partner has absolutely no idea what they could have said or done. They think its based off salary bc they make a lot, but idt an entire HR meeting would be set up for pay discrepancy &amp; talking about it. 

Anyways the main point to this was wondering if it's normal to not be told anything about why HR is talking to you even from HR themselves.



**Edit to clear up some questions:  was more concerned with anonymity than gender when initially making the post. hindsight seeing it was needed.   partner is male, reporter is a female, other coworker is a male. both coworkers maybe 10 yrs older than him.  i also brought up the idea of something going into his drink bc it was very alarming to me that after one drink he had no memory at all going from eating to waking up in his bed at 2 am frantic how he got there (also the state of his speech &amp; lack there of. ). stating maybe she tried &amp; you denied so she reported you. i know the alternative would be him actually trying/saying something to her but on numerous occasions, i have been told all he does is talk about me and our dogs when out drinking with friends and other coworkers after work. He even once told me about gushing over me to his uber driver on the way home a few weeks ago. i know this may still be the case regardless but confident it may be low or possibly him talking sexually about us. bc i've seen that before when we are out with friends. 

he is also thinking his blood pressure medication might have something to do with him blacking out, but he has been taking it for months and nothing like this has happened, nor even hindered his tolerance in any way.  The idea of roofie wasn't brought up until later last night. Unsure if he may be able to still test for it without doing a hair test. He is flying back today, but we have discussed him getting tested as well."
3,2023-03-10,Turned down my first offer (UK),u/rdavies_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11nrimr/turned_down_my_first_offer_uk/,jobs,"The first decent offer this year I’ve had to turn down, because of the hours. 8:30-5:30, Monday to Friday, which for most people wouldn’t seem too bad. Pretty standard. £20K a year in a finance assistant role. 10-15 minute drive commute wise. 

When I was sending the email to turn down the offer, I felt bad. They gave me great feedback after my interview, and said I was exemplary in how I came across. I think this all ties down to my prior experience at my last job, where I got let go for tardiness. I was late numerous times, despite trying to get there on time. It’s unfortunately ingrained that fear in me, that the earlier a job starts, I end up not trusting myself to make it on time. I think I’m going to focus on something part time instead, or with less hours. It’s great that the 9-5 works for some people, I have a friend that has a 9-5. But I don’t want my life to become my job. 

Has anyone else had to turn down an offer for whatever reason, til you’ve maybe found something better?"

I have been interviewing at other places, and am wondering assuming I get a job offer what would be the repercussions if I just left? People have said things about references and I know with my new job that wouldn’t be an issue but maybe if I leave that place and go onwards?

Maybe I’m sadistic, but I really want to watch all of my managers squirm while they fill my spot. They can be nice people to your face but have no problem hurting your position to help themselves financially.

The interview with the board of 5 members went super well. All cracking jokes with each other - answered all their questions swiftly and confidently. 

 The NEXT DAY they wanted to set me up with a 2nd in person interview with the Senior Executive Director of Technology and said in their email quote “we really did enjoy talking with you and would be excited to see you in for a 2nd one”. 

I come in for the 2nd interview and he asks me where’s my resume? I tell him every interview I’ve attended had it either printed out beforehand or at least pulled up on their desktop during, so I did not bring it. He made a half-joke and said “man so you’re unprepared today”. He said there was an issue with one of the answers on my application (I answered incorrectly to the conviction question) that I would need to contact HR to fix before we proceed with the 2nd interview. He said, “I’m very excited about you, I just want to make sure when you show up that you’ll be prepared to be here, and I also feel you’re too casual coming today. You know, we have these polos with our logo on it ect and I just want to make sure that if I bring you around MY bosses that they don’t look at you and ask me who the heck did I bring in”. So we rescheduled the 2nd interview for next week after spring break and he said “I’ll forget today even happened, get with HR and then bring your resume next time and I’m looking forward to making a decision on you”


How can I interpret that last part about casualness ?!

I am on the autism spectrum so i take things very literally sometimes. I assumed he meant how I acted? I felt like I was specifically trying to not be nervous. Sat with good posture. Yes sir no sir. But still came off as comfortable in my environment like I belonged to be there. I did not want to be seen as a nervous wreck stumbling and stuttering. 

Was he referencing attire only tho?! 
Everyone was wearing company polos and blue jeans. I wore blue jeans and a nice plain brown tshirt. Black hat, watch, and boots. Was that my mistake? 

Please help me so that when I do go back in I knock this out of the water. I did buy new outfit to be sure but I want to make sure it wasn’t referencing my demeanor as I felt very good and confident about how I conducted myself there. 

Thanks guys"

At the start, I told the HR rep that I knew the salary scale and would prefer the higher end. 

The range is only 12K but my current salary is at the top end of this job's range. To try to negotiate, I mentioned my current salary, more than 10 years of experience, and PhD (both of which relate exactly to the job) as leverage. Does that sound ok?

Depending on my amount of control/involvement over the recruiting funnel that would sometimes mean personally writing several different versions of a rejection email and scheduling them to be delivered at a strategic times: e.g. middle of the week, middle of the day, 2-3 weeks after the application was received.

But now I'm rethinking the rejection email altogether.

I've been working for the past 10+ years at a few different companies...very unstable companies where any day could be your last. So despite consistently having a job I feel like I'm always looking for a job. And the rejection emails just never stop. Sometimes I get them within hours of applying which despite having received probably hundreds of them by now remains insulting - particularly when my experience aligns nearly perfectly with the job description.

So my question is: Do applicants even want rejection emails at this point? Or does the timing and wording in them make a difference?

**Edit: I should have made it more clear that I'm questioning the utility of rejection emails in general but rather only at the very initial screening phase. Not suggesting ghosting somebody who you've interviewed or have any other sort of direct contact with is ok.**"

In 2019, I worked for a job that is the same job I'm getting an interview for now. However, I loved my job in 2019 and was fired unfairly and bullied by management - I was blamed for a technical issue despite me telling them weeks in advance for this issue. Since that issue, they had started giving me more jobs that were impossible to get done within the day and used that against me to fire me. Including my week of illness as an excuse...
I worked for that company for 10 months and I loved the job itself but the management were very nasty.

In 2020, up until now, I have worked at a different company but just in retail. I love this job but it isn't paying enough and managed to get promoted here with no pay raise, however, I missed my last job as it was different and had my interests in it.

I have an interview this Monday for the same job as I had in 2019 but a different company. In this interview, they will most likely ask why I left this job if I'm so passionate in it. How do I even explain I was unfairly fired without sounding... Awful? The owner that I worked for in 2019 is well known within the industry and well hated too. But I don't want to mention names and I don't want them to use that employer as a reference either.

Any advice would be welcome, I miss my old job so much and have been looking forward to being passionate within a job again."

I'm a full-time artist and of course that doesn't pay very well, so I've been seeking a part-time job to pay the bills.

I figured Hobby Lobby would be good because I go there often, it's near me and they're seeking a part-time sale associate with the hours I'm looking for.

My last job was a retail general manager (not a big resume gap and I quit with 2 week notice) and no gaps before that. So I applied online and called the store the next day and the woman I spoke to said ""the hiring manager is on vacation, please call again in 2 weeks on Tuesday, we will be going through applications then."" 

Okay so I called on Tuesday (this week) and asked if they're still hiring for the position and this lady said ""Yes! We are, but I would come apply in person because I'm not sure if we're doing online applications anymore? I would apply in person just incase and we're going though applications next week.""

I felt like this was super strange? Or am I tripping? I'm wondering if I should go apply in person or if I shouldn't bother and they're trying to make me go away lol"
2,2023-03-10,I have two choices- Help!,u/dhorxt_27,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11nvuoo/i_have_two_choices_help/,jobs,"I (20 M) am currently a penultimate year university student with 3 years of experience in sales (2 years B2B). I study Business Management but a degree would not be ESSENTIAL for me to secure jobs long term. However, I understand some employers (especially within large businesses) value a degree and so I want to finish university.

I have recently left my current role (which was mainly within account management) and wish to gain some work experience in Business Development. dealing with the SMB base. As much as I have enjoyed sales so far, i want to take the next step up and work out whether sales is actually for me long term. My current goal is to continue learning how to do B2B sales and work with corporate businesses.

I have two job offers and want you to offer some advice.

Option 1-

A Small business where I will have to sell legal compliance software, targetting larger to corporate businesses.

Basic of 22k, OTE 27k. (will be proratered with university)

Will allow me to continue my studies as normal so will only work 3 days / week during term time.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2-

A much larger business (industry leaders) where I will sell training courses specifically to corporate accounts.

Basic of 24k, OTE 36K

Will need me to work full-time, however, have found me a top-up degree I can do which takes the place of my third year at university and I will get a BA (hons) in Business Management for half the price.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had already graduated I would choose option 2 as the pay is higher, better future development and I want to gain skills working with corporate businesses.

However due to my degree, I do not know if the top up degree will actually be seen as equivalent to a 'normal' degree to future employers. 

What do you think?"

I recently got invited for a touchbase with my boss. Which normally isn't a big thing. My work is up to date, I haven't gotten in trouble. However, I was the only one invited from our department.

The only thing that I may have done bad, was saying in a teams call to a coworker, that if I don't get a position I applied too, I will start applying outside of the company, so I don't get blacked out from applying to another department. But that was days ago, and I haven't received a notice from HR for saying discouraging things in the teams call. 

So, I am confused, to add more, I had applied to a senior position which my boss had interviewed me for, and so did another coworker. However, he was not given a touchbase meeting. So now I am anxious on what could this touchbase be about if I am meeting the numbers, haven't gotten in trouble, and the latest thing that may be considered bad was days ago and there was no email or anything from HR (normally they let people know the next day if they catch something). So maybe I am thinking of the worst case scenerio and maybe she wants to let me know I didn't get selected for the job in person. I don't know. What would you guys think this touchbase meeting could be about?"

I moved to a new city and applied for a bunch of jobs, did a whole bunch of interviews and had a hard time finding one. I went a few months without even a hint from some retail stores. I interviewed with a couple places in different industries that I have schooling and/or experience in that I felt would be great fits as far as culture and career growth. However, none seemed to stick until I got what is my current job(government).


It was in the industry I wanted to work in most, the manager and director of the department are awesome, we are building a new division within that department so its an awesome experience in creating something from the ground floor. All of this to say I generally enjoy the job. The people are great and the work isn't horrible, but it does have its problems.


First, I am the youngest of my coworkers... by +20 years. I feel some resentment from a few of them. A rumor I've heard is that one is sending my boss emails complaining about me in hopes of getting me fired... I've heard this from my boss... The pay is substandard in this position, we are severely understaffed, and (because of the previous) the hours are horrible. I have had little to no on-boarding/training, using software that I was never taught or even briefly walked through, and questions about processes and procedures seem to get answered by ""I don't know, why don't you go find it for us"". Its VERY frustrating.


Despite this, the majority of people are awesome, the upper-management work hard to make sure things run as smooth as they can, and I enjoy most of my coworkers. I've also only held this position for **2 MONTHS**.


Come last week, I get a phone call from one of the other companies I thought I fit in with really well culturally, and they want to interview me for a position that I feel is a level above the one I applied for. I say what the hell and interview. It goes AMAZING. After a few days of waiting they call and offer me the job. It is a 75% pay increase, 8-5 M-F (rather than the nights and weekends I'm currently working), and pertains to work I find EXTREMELY interesting.


I've accepted it already, I am absolutely taking the position. However, I can't help but feel like that guy, ya know? I had someone I know contact the director from earlier and talk about me to help get the job, that same director talks with other higher ups about me saying things like I'm a great candidate to become a higher up, we are so understaffed I've worked 33 hours of OT per week and me leaving only exacerbates the problem, and, again, I've barely been here **2 MONTHS**


Am I ""that guy""?"

HireRight and I both had tried to contact this previous employer too with no luck. They are saying that verifiers/employers should verify my employment history with them at ExperianVerify. I'm worried that my future employer would want to call this previous employer directly over the phone. My ex manager also moved to another company, so I cannot ask her to provide her number for this.

In my current role I haven't really had much to do, and haven't been trained on much. Only 2 to 4 tickets come in a week. And there's a lot of silos within the department and some people haven't even talked with me since I've been there.

When it comes to references idk who id even put tho put from my old jobs? Amd would it reflect back to where my current manager would see that I applied. 

I have my first review in a month and don't know what to expect. My and my friend were both saying the management in our department just isn't good and they tend to show favorites. But, the other department may not be much better.

I've also had recruiters messaging me for roles that pay 80 to 105k in chicago but I would have to leave and go to a state I've never been tk far away from family. Give up the pension, pto, and free tuition benefits of rhe university. And break my lease and hope I don't get fired at the other job which I'm worried about with the economy being the way it is.

So should I stay on my current role, apply for the promotion, or apply outside the university and take one of the Chicago jobs?"

I don’t want to come across like I’m being too pushy, but I also don’t want to start off being a pushover about this because in my experience workplaces get used to not respecting your availability if you let them.

I just wanna hear some opinions, maybe even a job offer if anybody has. Do you think, that somethings wrong with me, or are just people and employers such jerks in general?

I'm 19/m and I've finished in my countrys best IT related secondary school (networking and programming) with straight A-s. During my studies in this school I've gained a bit more than CCNA knowledge and yesterday, not even a year after finishing my school I passed my second CCNP level exam and obtained the CCNP Enterprise certification.

It was really hard for me to get a job as a network admin/engineer and I got a salary, that thanks to the inflation, today is worth less, than the minimum salary of a beginner network admin, that has never seen a switch in his life before. 

Most of the time I get rejected to jobs because I'm either ""too young for the team"" or I don't have enough work experience (For a Junior position...). I've been practicing and taking labs with Cisco devices for 4 years in school, I've been practicing and learning at home by and for myself and I competed and got far better results than most of the university students on those networking competitions, still I get rejected, because people don't believe, that despite my young age, I'm capable of designing and/or operating networks. 

I know that certs are not everything, but I bet they don't see CCNP certified people below the age of 20 every day. Shouldn't it be at least a sign for them? A sign, that I'm probably more capable even than some university students, that are just older, but in most of the case don't know a lot more? I mean, ok, they probably know math better, and maybe even physics, but will they use it as a network engineer? I don't know how is it in other countries, but here, a student coming from a university has at most the CCNA level knowledge about networking. And that's something they learn for 5 years.

The other thing is experience. I know, there are tons of cases, where experience is needed (for example to identify a bug, or to encounter an issue multiple times and know how to fix it), but how the hell am I supposed to gain experience, if they don't want to hire me to a better position, where I'd do more than just managing som ACLs and things like that on firewalls or updating firmwares, or setting up some basic portconfigs on switches?

And the other thing. At my current workplace, instead of congratulating me on my CCNP, most of them just said ""meh, you should rather gain more experience and not plan your way to CCIE"". Just sain, that we're a Cisco partner company, but other than me, maybe 3 other people have CCNP, and all of 3 of them are senior network engineers. And they can go to hell, and they can say whatever they want. I'm going to at least try obtaining CCIE before my 25th birthday, I don't care if it's ""too soon"".

At least my ex-colleagues from my previous workplace congratulated me...

How could I possibly attract the attention of other employees and prove them, that I'm not just a regular 19yo, that just wants to mess his life up, or whatever are the others doing. My ""graduation project"" was according to my teachers on the level of a project that needs to be done for a masters degree, not for a secondary school.

I know this sounds like I'm an egoist peace of sh*t, but believe me, I'm not. I'm just really tired of peoples assumptions because of my young age, and I feel like I just waste my years by doing this low paying job, where I can't even use my CCNP knowledge. I want to work for a company with a big and complex network, or for one that operates and designs networks for these kinds of companies, or maybe for a service provider. Can anybody by chance help me with this?"

I also understand that it’s hard to get a well paying job this young, so I leave the years I attended school off my resume. 

I applied for a Client Relations role in my city and had a great first phone interview. 

2nd interview was zoom (with my ‘to-be’ direct) It was amazing and I was told I am perfect for the position. It was all going well up until I was asked my age, after that the interview kind of went eh.

I got put through to the 3rd interview and was extremely hopeful, but it seemed like so much tension between us, he kept asking ridiculous questions like “do you think that a 22 year old is qualified for this role?” and then questioned my competence numerous times by saying stuff like “we cant hire someone that doesn’t understand sales force works” and i didn’t want to be a dick but I’m sure I could teach my 10 year old disabled dog how to navigate sales force.

Finally today HR reached out to me saying “We love your work ethic, skills and knowledge but would prefer you in a sales role because of your experience.”

I get that this looks like ‘kid wants a job and didn’t get it so it must be their fault” and I really hope that they might have found someone who was more well-suited; they just made it seem like I couldn’t handle it because I’m some dumbass kid but with this job I would be taking a pay cut and taking on less responsibilities.

My name is FirstName LastName. I came across your profile on Workday and I see you are a partner for the Consulting practice at Firm. I am currently an Administrative Assistant in Tax at Firm and I’m very interested in working an internship/associate role in Consulting. I was wondering if there is an opportunity to apply for a position in your team. 

Thank you!

I'm only on a temporary work contract with the firm for 3 months and it's my absolute dream to get an entry level role or even just an internship in the Consulting practice. My degree is in Biology so I don't really know how to leverage my skills into Consulting. I've been taking the Google Data Analytics course so I've been learning a bit about SQL and Excel, but I haven't finished it yet. I want to network as much as possible with my very limited time with the company. Please help me! I don't know what else to say in the email."

The subject matter (outdoor recreation, public lands, that sort of stuff) isn't directly related to what I do (communications/copywriting), but since writing makes up a great deal of my work, I think it could be relevant. 

Similarly, do you think this would be worthwhile to include in my resume? I have mentioned it in cover letters before because of transferable skills, but have not used it on resumes.

So I started at this company as an intern for a 4th month contract. The company decided to extend my contract with a pay raise for 6 months, which I happily accepted. 

Then last month my boss asked me if I wanted another contract extension for 3 months and I said sure why not. 

Two days ago, my boss told me an employee quit, so they wanted to know if I would accept another 3-6 month contract doing both my current role and taking on that old employees responsibilities. 

She said their ""might"" be extra compensation and we would work out how my responsibilities would be divided and I would report to her and this new manager. When I asked if I could express interest in the role and then see a contract/get details, my boss said I had to accept first and had a day to respond. 

Mulling it over, I had no idea what this role would be and if it'd be too much work. I told my boss no and she set up a meeting basically saying ""were dissapointed in you and this would be a good opportunity to expand your skillset"" 

I told her that while I appreciated the consideration I wanted to focus on my current role. My boss then was like ""conversations with senior management are already starting"" which I don't know what that means. 

Then she asked me okay what about ANOTHER 3 month extension with just my current role and I told her I'd need time to think (probably should have just said yes but I was kinda flustered with the info dump). 

Anyway, now I feel bad and think management hates me. I honestly probably wanted to explore options outside of this job anyway but I'm worried I've burnt a bridge."

I've had chronic illness since high school, so no work experience or internships. Just going to class and passing was a struggle (MSM was online). I thought the MSM would’ve given me more options for less physically-demanding jobs. I found out that I’m not business savvy. The program was basically bullet points and math homework.

Brain fog, exhaustion, and hand neuropathy are the biggest hurdles for a job.

The “*entry-level needs 3+ years experience*” issue sucks. Thinking about it, “management” implies experience, so that’s weird.

The advisor was not helpful. She said “you can do a lot with this degree”....Thanks.

Social Security isn't paying enough, especially with inflation. I realized that maybe I need to suck it up and accept the extra struggles. I just feel completely lost and unprepared for everything.

I’m in Florida, and would like to stay in the Southeast, but not move too often. I’m willing to get certificates. Work-from-home would be ideal, but office work is fine. Full-time or part-time is fine, depending on pay &amp; intensity. I’m introverted, have a manager's personality, and good at science.

How do I approach this?,u/Financial_FreedomPlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11o6ssf/my_new_boss_wants_to_potentially_meet_in_person/,jobs,"To backtrack, my current boss has recently resigned to pursue a different venue in his life before retiring. While I'm unsure the recent drama going on had anything to do with pushing him to do this, I suspect it was part of it. I posted about it here.

His current boss will now be my boss, as they shift me into the role my boss had. The conversations have been ok, and I anticipate they will continue to go the same way. The work will definitely be very different to me, as I'll be answering a for a lot more. It will be challenging. I've been really shining in a remote role these past few years.

However, in our conversations, he had mentioned to me that he would suggest that I meet up with him and his boss about 2-3 times a year. The suggestion was for another state. Due to a medical condition, I am unable to travel in a vehicle of any sort. The condition is documented by my doctors and surgeons, but the inability to travel is not.

With that said, I set the tone early to let him know that I am unable to travel due to this condition. He seemed to be OK with it and mentioned that he's never a big fan of needing to be in an office. However, his boss may take offense if he isn't meeting someone in person a few times a year. He then went on to suggest that we would all probably need to adapt to all of this.

While it sounds like this won't be a big deal or issue right now, I worry that a few months from now, it is. I am doing my best to try and get this resolved but it's been a nightmare for me for many years personally because I've been missing out on so much personally due to this condition.

My question is, how do I approach this or what steps should I be prepared to take if this is an ask down the road again and I still cannot travel? A letter from a doctor, copied to my boss and HR, stating my inability to travel? Getting to a doctor's office alone is also a challenge. Should I be prepared for backlash if I do not go to a meeting? Start looking at trying to qualify for some form of disability insurance? To be clear, I'd personally prefer to meet in person if I was able to.

I’ll start off by saying I currently wfh in a new position, however I’ve been with this company for 6 years. 

My responsibilities involve me being on camera a lot, so sometimes when the on-camera work is complete, coworkers will hop into each others zoom rooms while we work on admin tasks together and we’ll have a little powwow and chit chat for awhile. I do enjoy my time with these coworkers. 

However, recently, I noticed some of these coworkers talk a lot of crap about people. Sometimes about people’s mannerisms and I refuse to engage with that. But recently they were talking about a particular person and then they turned to me and said “wait! You know them really well, how do you feel about them?”

I then proceeded with my honest opinion, I said “well, I don’t like being micromanaged, and that’s how that person made me feel”

I mean, it was honest, but I can’t help but feel icky that I even made a comment. Like it was so unnecessary of me, even if they were prying, I should have just not engaged with it.

1,2023-03-10,federal background process concerns,u/plain4trax,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11o7w0w/federal_background_process_concerns/,jobs,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. 

I was offered a seasonal internship position that is hosted by several organizations, one of these is NPS. I was selected over 90 applicants and would be a benefit to the program, as it would greatly benefit me. This requires multiple background checks due to multiple orgs and one of these is a Federal eQIP/public trust clearance. 

I've not been particularly wanting to work in fed gov, in part due to the difficulties I hear with getting past the application system and rigorous beaurocracy that never lets up. I'm a graduating master's student hoping to work with more state/local or nonprofit orgs. I've held several academic, research, and organizational roles in addition to school, but I'm trying to break full-time into the environmental field now that I'm graduating.

The issue is I have an arrest and dismissed misdemeanor (due to lack of evidence) for domestic violence. I'll provide more details at end of post for those interested, but, trust me, I know how bad it sounds... I am not a violent person, most would describe me as quite calm and easy to work with. I have never had an encounter with the law before or after (4 years ago). 

None of my previous roles have ever asked about this. Its never affected my work or personal performance, even when the case was going on. It's not shown up on background checks to my knowledge. I filed a petition to destroy my fingerprints, which was approved and completed to my knowledge. On most applications, I do not have to disclose this because they usually only care about convictions and felony-level crimes. Less often, I encounter positions asking about arrests, but I admit I avoid applying to those. 

This incident that happened is not a defining characteristic of my life story and I do not want to be put into situations where I have to relive it and justify it to people. I have worked very hard to develop past that time of my life. The type of charge I received immediately brings a prejudice and I don't think all my professional efforts should be discounted because this happened.

The federal forms for this process do not care if my case was dismissed or expunged, because they can require I report all this info from 5-7 years back. My case is only 4 years out.

On a much lesser note, I partake in state-legal medical marijuana and have for several years to relieve a back injury. 

They would start this background process when I accept the temporary offer. Only about a month before... I would have to move for this position and it is a risk because I don't know if I would pass the check and don't know if they will revoke the offer based on this alone. Additionally, I do not want to form any bad associations since I am so early in my career.

**Based on the facts, my questions for those who have gone through the fed process are:**

-How likely would this indiscretion prevent me from passing this type of background check?

-If I am unlikely to pass, is it better to recind myself or risk having a possible denial? I worry about the possibility of applying to federal positions in the future with a previous denial

 -Would it be advisable to wait the 2-4 years before pursuing any more fed positions to avoid including this? As I mentioned, I am interested in workiny with other types of organizations, but I would like to keep the federal possibility open.

#**I'll also take any advice you can offer! On the background process, or what you would do if you were me. And/or how to navigate this and potential questions concerning this with employers in the future.**



More info on my case: Also long story short, my mother held a knife to my stomach. I pushed her away in self defense. I consider myself a decent person and was raised to tell the truth (to a fault). When I told police my version of events, they laughed at the implication of my mother with a knife and arrested me when I got to the part of pushing her away in my own defense. As mentioned above, there was no evidence either occurred, I lawyered up and the case was dismissed. But, as you can imagine, this is not an easy thing to live through again or explain to people. Most people have loving mothers and could not imagine theirs doing something like that to them, so they assume I'm the instigator."
2,2023-03-10,Is the way I was treated at my last job normal?,u/JW_2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11o80a5/is_the_way_i_was_treated_at_my_last_job_normal/,jobs,"Afraid to re-enter the work force because of the way I was treated last time - is this normal?

I was hired by a Fortune 500 company in Fall 2019. The office was small - Manager, assistant manager and me. Manager was working from home because she had cancer, so it was just me and the AM.

Here are the things I recorded in my notes of the assistant manager doing:

* My first day she told me the Manager has a camera pointed directly at me and microphones hidden throughout the office to listen in on us while she works from home

* That Covid was a hoax designed for population control

* She would tell me about her nights drinking/getting drugged

* Her BF would come in and they would make out

* Called my ideas ""stupid"" many times/yelled at me

* Accused me of theft, didn't apologize when she found what had been ""stolen""

* Threw papers at me

* Told me she could hire someone for $10/hr to do my job

* Homophobic and racist slurs (neither directed at me, but used in conversation)

* Telling me about underwear she brought her boyfriend and other intimate things they do

* Used company time to do personal things, then would yell and get into a tizzy when on a deadline


Really an awful working environment so I left. I feel some of this stuff is tantamount to sexual harassment. Told HR in an email after I left and they did nothing, she still works there and got promoted.

Is this normal for a job? That people can act as shitty as they want as long as they get their work done? It makes me never want to work for someone else again."

They gave me the option of leaving after three weeks while I look for a new job, or just taking this new position, which they've already given to me. I'm assuming in this scenario I can do a third option that they didn't mention, which is collect unemployment, since my precious position was eliminated. Is that correct--can I collect unemployment in this scenario, and is that the choice I should probably make? Or will I be burning bridges by doing so instead of taking their three week offer? Or, did I already nullify the unemployment since I've already been doing this job for a few hours? Either way, they gave me no time to decide, they told me they need to know today and I basically have a couple more hours to make my decision. Please help!"

My primary concern is my wife is a stay at home mom, so job security and benefits are important.

First off how is job security? As I understand, I would still be able to get unemployment if the contract is up and they decide not to hire me, but does it work the same way as if I were let go from a permanent position? What benefit is it to the company to do contract to hire? They say it takes risk off the company but I ask what that means and they are purposely vague.

Second, how much more would I be expected to pay in taxes, health insurance, and all that?

The recruiter asked how much I want for my salary and I said 100k and they asked how much for contract and they suggested 10 percent more but I said 20 percent more and the recruiter just rolled his eyes.

Any help you all can offer would be great because I’m getting the vibe the recruiter doesn’t have my best interests at heart."

10,2023-03-10,I received a job offer for my 3rd choice company. I am strongly considering accepting,u/Miatia404,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11o9mxi/i_received_a_job_offer_for_my_3rd_choice_company/,jobs,"I (22F) am new in my career. I currently work part time at a digital marketing firm. My hours were cut from 40 down to 25 and I have no benefits. I love my co-workers but management is toxic. They don’t value their employees much and our turnover rate is extremely high because they’ll cut anywhere to save a buck.

I have 3 jobs that I’m really hot on and have finished the final interviews for. I let them know I received another offer and will be making a choice within the next few days but am still very interested in their positions. They have been really slow to get back to me even though one of them said they are “very interested” in moving forward with me and that I am in the top 2. Yesterday I got offered a job as a marketing coordinator for a large real estate firm. It was my lower choice. The pay isn’t great, it’s barely above what I’d be making hourly now but it would be full time and the benefits are amazing. I’m sure it would offer so many amazing opportunities for the future, within the company and allow me to meet some great people in the industry. My main downside is that it’s fully on-site.

The company was really understanding and said I could consider over the weekend and would be able to answer questions I may have. I let them know how much I appreciate having the weekend to consider. I want this to be the right decision for everyone. I’ll admit that I really had my heart set on a remote job. I’m an introvert and being able to work from home is my dream but I understand that one offer in hand is better than 2 in the bush.

I’m worried that if I take this job, I’ll still be hoping for a remote opportunity down the road and won’t feel fully settled. Maybe I’ll be ready to leave in a year or 2 but I don’t want to look like a job hopper. Deep down, I’ll probably never be fully satisfied with an in-office 9-5 but I also acknowledge that at my age, it’s hard to get the perfect job. I have to face reality. The job market isn’t great and I feel like I could definitely thrive and grow in this role, it just isn’t what I had in mind. Do you have any advice that could help make my decision clearer? I will me making a decision on Monday and I’m trying to clear my head."

They aren’t actually opened and working but they are hiring crew in order to get it running. I showed up to my interview 15 minutes before it was scheduled and signed in on the clipboard. The interviewer called me over after they were done with the person they were interviewing when I got there. The interview was very general and the questions were easy to answer. After he heard my availability, he told me all the spots were filled for my time, this interview lasted about 5 minutes. However, he liked my first impression and wrote me down on the first call list in case anyone drops off. 

Fast forward to 5 days later, I get a text saying positions opened up and they’d like for me to come in for a second interview. I’ve heard these are a great sign because it shows interest so I was pretty hopeful in getting the job. I showed up to my interview the next day, which is today, 15 minutes early again and a new guy that wasn’t here the first time called me over to interview me. I told him I came back for a second interview and he told me that the girl who was doing the second interviews left some time ago before I arrived. He decided to go through a quick interview to gather more info and this interview lasted about 5 minutes again. He told me that he would text the girl later about what she thinks about hiring the people who were called back for a second interview. He also said before I left that I would most likely have to come back tomorrow for a third interview.

 When I got home I was kind of expecting an apology from the lady if she texted back because she didn’t show up to the interview she scheduled with me that we both agreed upon. I got a text a little bit later from the girl saying that they are moving on with other candidates for the time being, no apology.

Is this something common with jobs? Getting a second interview but the person who was meant to interview you leaves before the interview was even close to starting? She included in the text that maybe I can reapply in the summer when more spots open up but I’m not too sure I want to reapply there. I know everyone is human and maybe some type of emergency happened but I kind of just find it disrespectful that she didn’t at the very least include some type of apology. Or maybe at least show interest to try and interview me again herself like she was meant to. I don’t really know, thoughts?"

I was verbally offered a position with my current team but nothing official came through so a manager from another department made me a different verbal offer.

Then, he rescinded that offer and I was officially offered a position in my current team. I’ve now become aware that’s because one of the senior managers for our team blocked my transfer.

We then move on to where me being promoted within my current team except now someone anonymous has lodged a formal appeal with an external body against the promotion of myself and 2 other people (clearly a disgruntled employee upset they were passed over) because we are the government these offical promotion appeals are possible.

So I can’t officially commence my role permanently until the appeal is resolved but to get things moving I’ve been promoted temporarily on higher duties. You’d think that is the end of it but no!

I start my first day in my new role, a newly created job in my team so no one has previously held the position and my boss is off sick so I spend the whole first week with no clear guidance from anyone including managers the next level up who I asked and no previous employees work to build off.

Finally my new boss is back and we have a meeting and in it he tells me basically I have a reputation in the office for being on my phone too much and effectively not focusing on my work.

It’s becoming clear that people don’t like me as much as I thought at work.

But surely it says something if despite my laziness, youth and lack of experience compared to some other staff that I still got the promotion and they didn’t.

I’m thinking it’s time to start looking elsewhere to get out of this underhanded backstabbing environment."

We both worked at the same hospital. She is very nice, extremely smart, but socially awkward so people pick on her. She was bullied by others (it was obvious) to the point where she left after a year. Then she went to work at another hospital with my sister. My sister told me that this coworker was bullied by their boss to the point where she only stayed for a year.

2 years later, I got offered a nurse manager at my current hospital. This coworker applied and joined. I was a part of the interview committee, so I saw her resume. She lied that she was at her second job for two years. She didn't put the hospital that we both worked together on her resume. I mean, she has been a nurse for two years, but she decided to take the risk to put all her experiences in one hospital so it doesn't make her seen like a job hopper. 

It has been two months, and everyone seems to like her. I am very happy for her because everyone is nice. However, I feel like it was immoral of her to lie about her employment site. Should I just feel bad or snitch?

*EDIT: Sorry, another manager asked me how come the coworker didn’t know a famous doctor who worked at the coworker’s 2nd job. That doctor left a year before she started. The timeline was off for that manager. I know deeply inside that the coworker was with me at her first job, so I felt guilt but didn’t snitch on her."

I'm also interested in how people decide to take jobs if they are looking for a part-time and experience.

Let's take a look at a scenario:

Person A has worked for a year at - FOR EXAMPLE - Apple, a well known company.

Person B has worked for 2 years at Johnson's Tech Private Limited, a small firm.

So, 

1. As someone who is hiring, who would you choose?
2. As someone looking for experience would you work at a reputable company for lesser pay or a lesser known one for a slightly higher pay?"

I have just been feeling so frustrated with how the process for recruiting and interviewing has seemingly changed in the last few years.

Since the start of this year I have been actively applying to jobs. Call me crazy but it just seems like the recruiting process has added unnecessary extra steps. Most of the companies which are not even fortune 500 companies have you complete these hour long assessments. Some are cognitive, some are personality. On top of that, you then have to complete scenario assessments. After you are contacted by a recruiter that usually works through an agency you go through all the logistics questions. Side note: you need to make sure the recruiter actually knows the job description and requirements. Ive heard of candidates losing out because there was miscommunication and the recruiter is just rushing through their phone calls to make their quota most likely. 

Then they forward it to the new employer. Then if they decide to finally do an interview, these interviews last at least 1 hour with no break of constant beratement from at least a 3 member panel just throwing questions at you one after the other. 

I can understand if the benefits were out of this world, unlimited PTO, salary in the 6 figures, whatever. But these jobs are just pretty basic. They're mainly unknown companies that do call center work where no fancy degrees are needed. They don't make the top company fortune whatever list to work for. And most of these places would pay me less than what I am currently making. 

Then after the interview your time will be further disrespected by having you wait weeks or a month to only get an email that they moved on with other candidates. 

I just think this process could be simplified. Why do these interviews need to take more than 20 mins?? You have my cover letter, resume, LinkedIn info, references, first interview with recruiter, assessments, etc. Now you have to berate me for over an hour without providing any type of break or making the process a little more comfortable??


I just need to vent. I have become to disillusioned with the process and burned out. They expect you to put in all this time and effort on top of working. Then when/if you are offered the job they expect you to start within a week. That also happened to me too. I was happy of the offer but I made it clear when I could start and thought it would not be a deal breaker due to the fact they did not put a start date on their posting. 

Its like the image these companies have are these candidates that having nothing to do but devote their time in trying to get a one shot interview and fight their way to the finish line. But there is no returned effort or respect."

Taking into consideration, I don’t have a degree specifically in 3d art or anything like that (unless you think Media Art is close enough) and I will be self-teaching through online courses. From what I’ve seen, environment art is the more available and accessible of the two for people without professional experience, but how much should that really be a deal breaker?

I want to break in to full-time positions so I can have consistent work.

A company I applied for a in house full time position with asked if I’d be interested in initially freelancing in-house for them.

I’m open to contract-to-hire but I’m pretty confused by this offer.

Do you guys have advice?



For context the company is not a Graphic Design agency, they’re a manufacturer of their own products.

I’m considering letting them know that I’d be interested in freelancing if they matched a higher freelance rate, as I’d be responsible for my own taxes and benefits during that time. (I’m still learning how that works)

And if they don’t want to pay a higher freelance rate that I’d be open to contract-to-hire or the initial full-time position. 

This is the first company to respond to me after graduating so I’m not sure what I’m doing lol.

I also posted this in r/freelance earlier but was told it’d be better here!"

How do I juggle the contract work with continuing to interview for perm roles?

Should I withdraw my application?,u/kitty_1713,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11osg2b/rare_eye_disease_could_prevent_me_from_driving/,jobs,"I'm transitioning from a career in the arts to a career in non-profit communications. I have a lot of marketing and communications skills that are transferrable. I also ended up working on an electoral campaign creating content in Spanish after loosing my job during the pandemic, but unfortunately that contract ended. Because I wasn't sure which job would be a best fit for me, I decided to cast a really wide net.

**I have a lot of anxiety around driving because I was in a car accident**. After the accident, I started developing issues with my eyesight and have not been able to get a clear diagnosis until recently. While I was experiencing symptoms **around a month ago, I went to the ER and the emergency ophtalmologist said I have pigment dispersion syndrome**. Based on the description of my symptoms, the **ophtalmologist said they think pigment floating around my eye is blocking the drainage canal and causing angle closure glaucoma.** 

I got a referral for a glaucoma specialist but I won't be able to see them (or get a proper diagnosis) until 4/20.

**For one of the jobs, I got very excited about the position and the organization.** However, they require me to drive 1-2 hours multiple times a week to attend in-person meetings. I decided to apply anyways and see if me driving was really necessary - as some jobs have given me accommodations after I explained the situation. **When I got there, I realized they require everyone to work from the office everyday and drive 2-3 times per week to their offices which are all an 1-2 hours away.** 

After I left the interview, I started seeing bright halos around lights with rainbows and had to suddenly pull over. It was quite scary. I usually get attacks at night so I thought I would tell them I can't drive at night but this attack came on suddenly during the day. 

I have anxiety around driving so I didn't know this could happen until I left the second interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: I probably have a rare type of glaucoma so I don't feel safe driving. For most jobs, even if they say I need to drive, they will make accommodations once they learn about my condition. This position isn't set up for remote work so I would need to drive 5-8 hours per week for in-person meetings and events. I had to pull over after the interview because all the lights had massive halos in one of my eyes.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a picture for reference:

[This is how I see lights when the pigment dispersion syndrome gets bad - if I can see at all. I don't feel safe driving to the job like this. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsm6r449s5na1.jpg?width=337&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0a78cfef290dd63e20278fb13c8f609da51eea38)

&amp;#x200B;

Should I let them know? 

The third interview is an hour away and I don't want to travel all the way out there if I can't do the job. It's a waste of everyone's time. Especially since there are other jobs in my field that would not require driving. 

I've made it to the second round for several interviews, so I can definitely find a job that doesn't require driving."
4,2023-03-11,"Manager use to praise me, now he's micromanaging, passive aggressive, and blowing up at me...",u/terp_slut,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11osgh3/manager_use_to_praise_me_now_hes_micromanaging/,jobs,"I really just need some advice on how to move forward with my current work situation. I'm sorry this is so long I just feel like the detail is necessary. 

Back in August 2022 I was hired at a grow shop that specializes in helping customers grow house plants, hydroponics, other types of mediums, and selling seeds. Mind you out of all of my workmates, there are 4 of us including the manager, I probably have the least experience growing on an agricultural level, commercial level, and overall knowledge of growing. I'm like the person you go to for your basic house plants and growing stuff on your kitchen counter. Being there has helped broaden my knowledge of cacti, succulents, basic nutrient requirements, soil requirements, light requirements, and gardening zones specific to your regional in the US for growing. For example, where I'm at I'm in zone 6A. I'm certainly still learning and there's a lot to know so it can be very overwhelming at times, especially when customers come in with niche and specific questions that I have no prior experience with.

However, I have a lot of experience in opening and closing stores, cash handling, excelling in customer service, constantly trying to better myself, and working as hard as possible. I'm the person at the store that will always make you feel like you are noticed and I'm here to help as best to my ability whether that means I'm learning with you or from you. At this store we know that no one's going to know everything about growing etc etc. So, all those things listed were the reasons why I was hired and for my extreme interest in basic house plant care. And ever since the day I have been hired I've definitely learned a lot.

Unfortunately as of late, the original manager that had hired me had left for 5 months then came back, and is now instead of praising me for my ability to be computer savvy and be a key holder, is now insinuating that he has to hold my hand, doesn't appreciate my work ethic, and is generally not accepting of my customer service. 

In February of this year I've been told at least a couple or more times that my level of customer service is ""going above and beyond and what am I getting out of it."" I personally do not understand how greeting customers and chatting with them and building a rapport with them is too much in my manager sees it as me putting in too much effort and I'm too nice.... When every customer service job prior to this one I have been nothing but praised and recommended and sought after by customers because of how I make them feel and how I treat them.. also apparently I can't talk to a customer for 30 or 40 minutes, while literally no other customers are in store because it's been slow slow sloooow here, and assist said customer in understanding store products, price checking store products, and just overall building rapport with the customer. My manager told me that my conversation with that customer was distracting to him and that it wasn't me actually doing work. But when I explained to him that I was helping the customer and even juggling the phone and the customer was understanding, he backed off and said ""okay I stand corrected."" 

But this is where it really punches me in the gut: yesterday I worked with my manager and it was pretty slow but I still was able to get things done despite there really being anything to do... It's that slow. But when I got there in the morning I did a seed inventory. And a few customers came in between the times of me counting the seed packets, phone rang a couple times, and then it was close to lunch time so I took a little snack break. Mind you, I'm also pregnant in my manager allows me to sit down and eat if I need to since I literally am eating for two. I always like to preface when I'm doing something so I let him know that I was sitting down to take a snack break and he tells me, in an annoyed way, that I don't need to tell him that I'm taking a snack break.  And so after my snack it's around 12:00 and I take the time to go on the work computer to research more about grow methods. Like soil vs coco coir. Also, a couple customers showed up and I took care of them. Then it was around quarter to 2:00 and I took my 30 minute lunch break and when I came back in the store it was literally crowded with customers so I got back behind the register to help as best as I could. This was one of those days where customers had the most wild questions whether about nutrient requirements for plants or trees that I had no idea or asking for nutrients that we don't even carry. I did learn a lot yesterday about peach trees and a new grow method using physics lol. That one really threw me in for a loop. But my manager was definitely answering a bulk of the questions as he has literally the most experience with agricultural farming and other growing knowledge because he's been doing this kind of work for over 30 years. 

So it is fast forward to the end of the night when it was around 5:30pm and my manager just tells me that the plants didn't get watered yesterday. I worked that day and so did another workmate of mine and my other workmate said he was going to do it while I did another list of items that needed to get done and I completed those tasks. I told my manager I apologize that it didn't happen I was busy doing the other things and that I was still really sorry. 
He asked why I didn't water the plants today and I just kind of felt really dumb because I wondered yeah why didn't I but I didn't think about it because he didn't ask me to. He just told me that he was disappointed it didn't happen and then that was that... No direction, no nothing, just a passive aggressive tone. So he decided to water the plants and when he did that I went to check up on the jade plants I had propagated and they were still moist and all the other plants were still okay and didn't need to be watered. And then he literally tells me at 5:33pm to start closing the register, in an irritated tone,  even though we close at 6:00 pm.
As I'm counting the register, my manager just starts going off saying ""I don't know how to say this but I'm going to try and say this is nicely as possible"" and proceeds to say things not nicely at all. Said that I pretty much sat on the computer till 2:00 p.m., that he's holding my hand, that I can't answer basic customer questions, and that he's upset that he has to stay here till 9:30 at night doing manager things, and that there's a productivity issue here, and that even though people want to keep their hours he's not impressed and is going to have to start doing reviews and it doesn't look good, and then when I start tearing up after I tell him all the things that I have been doing and still do and that he has been bulldozing me over when I try to talk to customers because he does have more information than me, a customer walks in and he ends the conversation. When he was talking to me it was more of like him gradually more and more getting read in the face and raising his voice and just insulting me. Saying that I've been here for 6 months and that I can't answer basic questions which isn't true.. he went back to a time where a lady came in and she had questions about fungus gnats and this was the second time she came in and the information that I tried to give her and help her with apparently didn't work (the infestation of fungus gnats was more than any of us had anticipated apparently), pretty much said that I needed his help and he's holding my hand. So as I'm cashing out this customer I feel the tears in my eyes begin to well up and customer leaves and I'm counting the register cuz it's like quarter of 6pm at this point, and my manager tells me that my crying is unprofessional and we can't have customers seeing me like this and I just say ""I'm sorry I'm pregnant and it's hard for me to control the tears when I'm feeling very stupid and inadequate."" He then tells me that my feelings are unprofessional and that I shouldn't feel stupid and he didn't call me stupid.  I couldn't help it and I said"" let me feel how I feel"" and I walk to the bathroom cried my eyes out and called my boyfriend. When I walk back out it's around 2 minutes to 6:00 p.m. and 2 minutes pass like paint drying and my manager says to me ""forget I said anything."" I'm still upset at this point so I just flatly say ""all right I appreciate you, bye."" Sorry this was so long but what the fuck..."
2,2023-03-11,How to get ahead of my employment gap (looks like I've only worked 6-7 months in the past 3 years) to potential employers when applying?,u/IGNSolar7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11oshp8/how_to_get_ahead_of_my_employment_gap_looks_like/,jobs,"Post-pandemic it looks like over the past three years, I've only worked 9-10ish months over the past three years or so. But I have 15+ years of work experience, and 10 in my industry. Obviously, covid happened, which led to me being laid off in March 2020, and the job I was in the final stages of onboarding for was put on pause. I didn't immediately run out and look for new work, since unemployment was covering me and I was hoping to get one of the two jobs back. Plus my city and industry were some of the hardest hit by the effects of lockdowns and travel bans.

Fast forward to mid-2021, I got a job in a respected agency, but had to leave after two months because we had a huge miscommunication about my qualifications. They admitted it was their fault, and we parted amicably, but given how short it was, I don't have it on my resume. Then quickly I became a Director at a smaller agency, but that only lasted 6-7 months...

Because I broke my pelvis in a foreign country and couldn't work anymore. 

So when you look at my resume, it doesn't really clearly tell this story, it looks like I've lazed around and had no inclination to try to work past six short months, when there's actually mitigating factors.

I have no idea how to represent this to employers, and I feel like my resume is probably getting trashed before I even get a chance to explain.

Any ideas here?"

2. I called out for being in the hospital after being dehydrated about a week ago

3.  Today I called out because I have tested positive for Covid and am very sick. I called out last minute because I was still planning to come in with a mask despite having Covid because I needed the money. 

I have notes and evidence to back me up with these things but I’m just afraid they’ll see me as someone who isn’t dependable because truth is I need my job. Also multiple other staff has quit so it’s just been the same people being overworked included myself. I hope they understand."

I’m starting a new position next week for a minimum wage restaurant job. I’m a student in college so theres not a lot of options for me and I’d like to earn a little extra money. However, I’m already noticing quite a bit of problems at this company in terms of management that is making me question even going through with the position. I’m not sure if I’m overthinking things or what. 

I got sent a list of rules about the position.
The rules seem very harsh and theres many warnings about how you’ll be instantly terminated for breaking any of them. Additionally, during the interview the hiring manager complained about a previous employee that quit and how she hopes I wont follow in said employees foot steps. I thought this was odd and unprofessional. I should mention this company is a small family owned business. Reading the reviews on indeed doesn’t seem promising as well. Many people complain about the management and the toxic work environment despite the owner + store manager assuring me they encourage a healthy positive workplace environment. I start next week and I can already feel myself dreading accepting the job. Should I try it out and see if I enjoy the job despite all the red flags or trust my gut and keep applying to other positions?  I’m afraid that quitting may be more complicated for me once I have already started as I dont want to waste their time."

In the interviews initially they said they were combining two roles into one for this position. 

I’ve been here for about five months, and through a mix of the job not being aligned with my values, micro aggressions (i.e., racism and touching my shoulder or back in a way that made me uncomfortable) and feeling like I was in way over my head after recently getting a developmental disability diagnosis and that this job wasn’t the right fit for me, I decided to put in my resignation letter. Then after being told by my supervisor, HR, and two other VPs that they wanted me to stay, that there’d be accommodations, and personally feeling like maybe I wasn’t trying hard enough, I decided to stay and rescind my resignation. It’s been two weeks now, and understandably the workplace environment is tense. I’ve tried to use the accommodations provided, but my department is only myself and my supervisor who has to work on many other projects. People have advised me to leave, but I am very scared to burn this bridge. I feel like I should be able to do these simple administrative tasks and my job or that I should be able to do 50-60 hour weeks for months at a time like other coworkers, but I’m still struggling.  

I am incredibly nervous and indecisive on whether to stay and tough it out like I promised my company I would, or truly leave this time. I’m scared that I’ve used my diagnosis as an excuse and I’m actually just not a good worker. I know this bridge will be burned, and I may need to come across them in the future as my industry is fairly small. My mental and physical health are declining as well as my social life from being consumed with this job and not having the energy to be fully present around friends. 

Sorry for the ramble, but I’d be grateful for any advice."

I found out that they use Sterling  background check and Sterling sent me a link to fill out my past employment information for verification. Thing is, my very first job was at a cafe shop and my second job was at another hospital working as an intern, both were very short-term ranging from a week to a month. I left my previous jobs due it either not relating to my major or schedule conflicts with my school. For the cafe job because it was such short term, I did not even bother going back to get my paycheck. Now, Sterling is asking me to provide proof with W2 and paystubs or references from managers. Due to my short employment period (technically I was still in training when I quit my past jobs) I highly doubt my past managers remember me or will give me a glowing reference to Sterling. However, my resume would have been a blank slate if I didn't put them as work experience because all I have is my clinical experience. I was really excited to graduate and get my first full-time job at a hospital, but now I am worried that my offer will get rescinded because I did not pass employment background check with Sterling. 

I'm not sure what to do now, wait until Sterling finishes my background check, talk to HR at the hospital, or start searching for another job? Although there is no guarantee they will not use Sterling as well or hire me because I will most likely leave out my short employment jobs in my next resume."

I have 1 year within insurance claims of approving and denying low and high dollar payments submitted by claim examiners within an audit queue. I got my current job with my previous QA experience and also previously having a multiple state producer license during an annual enrollment period.

I'm an engineer, my new company just set up a local satellite office. The person I have a cubicle next to insists on playing their little radio all day (usually jazz or classic rock radio stations). It's not loud, but I find it incredibly distracting when I am trying to get work done. I'm not someone that can concentrate with music unless it is something mellow or repetitive. I have told him multiple times I find it distracting when I'm trying to concentrate. I've turned it off when he goes to lunch so I can get an hour of concentration time, but it always goes back on when he gets to his desk. He's an otherwise nice guy, but just doesn't get it... 

You might say go to HR, well the person is HR, the manager doesn't seem to mind. I had a discussion with radio dude and a couple other people in the office just expressing it's easier for me to concentrate when it's quiet, everyone else said they find it easier to concentrate with music.

I really want the analyst position because I really liked the team and think the position would allow me to work towards my goals.

The Data engineering position also seems like a great opportunity to grow, but the only qualm I have is I didn’t connect with the team as much as the other position and I have no experience with data engineering. I think it is still a great opportunity because I am trying to figure things out and work in either data analysis/science/engineering. 

I was wondering if it is a good idea to ask them to match the other salary or try to offer me a more senior position especially since both offers are from the same company. I was also wondering if you think it is better to take the job that aligns more with my background and with a great team or the job that pays well and has a good opportunity to explore a new career Avenue."

I’ll try to keep it short. I live in a country where native citizens have the “right” to work in the government sector. Native citizens don’t have to go through the normal employment procedures of having a CV and trying to pass an interview to prove their qualification to work for the employer. Instead, oncethe citizen has a university degree, the country (employer) will be obliged to offer them work somewhere in the government sector based on their level of college degree and field.

This resulted in a saturated market of employees who don’t do much, including me. I’m an electrical engineer who works like an hour a day (if any) and I and I’d argue I’m not even needed. Honestly, I’m not complaining about my life or my current job, I’m living a comfortable life, but this lifestyle doesn’t feel sustainable and I don’t want to rely on this comfort. I would like to develop some skills to make income on the side but also have work experience for if I had to apply for a job outside the government sector.

I’ve been at my current company for 10 months.  The first 3 months I was on the lower end of the totem pole but the last 7 months I’m in a higher role on the corporate side .     I was promoted 3 months in due to a combination of my competency and right place right time .  I was so grateful and keen for the opportunity I didn’t discuss a new contract or a higher rate of pay.  In these 7 months I have not been given a new contract or a higher rate of pay despite conversations with HR and my direct manager, all I hear back is “be patient” and soon.     The kicker is I like my job and don’t want to leave but my newer role is much higher and the responsibilities and stress dwarves my previous position .

Advice would be appreciated , am I entitled to back pay?  Can there be ramifications for the company due to a lack of compensation and transparency?    I know I’m being screwed , I just want to know my options.

However, in order to succeed in this life you have to create a living for yourself. We must discipline ourselves to stay busy even if we have free time. ""You must pay the price for success"" \~ Earl Nightingale 

I've noticed that it's very easy to become accustomed to a job, even if you despise it. Job hopping into one's desired field is required in the industry I work in. Or, at the very least, work for a couple of years at a company while growing and learning. My job has turned into a chore. I'm sure we all have things we like and dislike about our jobs. It's difficult for me to find balance at work because I don't find anything fulfilling. Even the 2.5-hour commute to and from work is mentally draining and killing me. I discovered that in order for me to not be comfortable, I must find balance. 

I can no longer work a full week and not enjoy my weekend. It's depressing to work a full-time job and then spend my weekends alone, shutting out the rest of the world. It's great to get out of my comfort zone and participate in social activities, go on dates, and cultivate my talents. Today, I am proud to say that I did not sleep the weekend away until Monday. I was able to apply for three positions. It will take time to maintain the momentum, but it is a start. Start NOW and do not stop! It's all over once you stop. You will be trapped in a life of misery, working a job that does not make you smile or bring joy to your heart.

Don't be trapped in a job that fills you with sadness and depression. Someone I worked with died at this job, An elderly lady that possibly didn't have enough social security to retire. Promotions aren't like they used to be especially in this job market today. I realized that life is too short to complain and dwell on the negative things. Get up and move if you don't like where you are right now! You aren't a tree. You are free to leave at any time. Just wait until you have your backup ready. In order to get that backup it's up to you to put in the work. I'm cheering for you. Your younger self believes in you. We are all meant to shine and succeed in this life. And we all must pay the price. 

Life is not easy. I'm 28 years old and as an adult, I can feel the misery and pain around me. I walk into the grocery store and in the aisle I see a human being just like me. The struggles in their eyes, the darkness around their weary eyes. My mother always told me you know where you are but you never know where you'll end up in this life. Life is a journey and it's all about experience and connecting with those that have wisdom in this world. Don't be fooled not everyone in this life is out here to help you. Trust no one and always trust your intuition. It's not fun to be unemployed. I was there 6 months ago and I never wanna relive that experience. That is why I come to you today. Don't stay comfortable continue to keep your options open."

She did that on another sample test and got 20 right AND made it to all 50 questions which I read is rare.  20 questions is considered average intelligence and will get her the job.  What other tips do you have to beat the Wonderlic test?"

8,2023-03-12,How to Handle a Toxic Co Worker,u/Sweet_Cost306,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11p63ub/how_to_handle_a_toxic_co_worker/,jobs,"I have a co worker who is well known amongst her peers for being a gossip queen and shit stirrer. She joined us one and a half years ago and since then has brought a lot of drama into the team. In her first few months here, she tried to get some of the older colleagues here fired, telling the bosses that they were incompetent. During our boss' birthday lunch, she wore a very low cut shirt that revealed everything and kept leaning down and whispering in his ear. I've tried to warn my big boss about her antics, but he ignores me.

In general, my colleagues and I try to keep things professional with her and draw strict boundaries on our communications so we don't get drawn into her drama. But she frequently comes to each of us to complain about each other. She has stirred up quite some resentment and misunderstandings.

I recently had to work with her on an assignment. She called me up to discuss a subject with me, then told me about what another boss had gossiped about me. I was thrown off by the last bit. But I did give her the work content she wanted. Somehow, she mis conveyed the content I'd given her to her boss, who then called me up to scold me about it. Once the assignment was over, and I'd handed over all my work archives to her (as I'd left her team), I drew a firm line about not being contacted about it. Her boss was also looped into the drama, and understands and supports me. 

A couple days ago, I was having lunch with a former boss. I receive a WhatsApp from the girl. She deleted the message so I can't see what it is. Former boss (FB) then leans over and says hey Y needs urgent help with your former portfolio, did she ask you? I guess that's what Y's deleted message was about, so I drop her a ""?"". The next moment, Y tells FB that I am not responsive hence she needs to ask him. Mutely, I hold up my phone to FB and we look at Y's deleted message and my ""?"". FB advises Y to contact me. Y sends me a list of questions that I've already provided answers to in the archived documents I sent her. They are easy questions to answer so I reply quickly. FB then shows me the texts from Y that says that I'm not being responsive. I show him my phone and it's near instantaneous replies and timestamps. FB firmly tells Y that she should get the information from me. Y tells him reluctantly that ""she'll try"". 

Y goes on to tell me that she cannot find the information from my database because its shoddy and patchy. I give her the exact information she needs and she insists that my database is not up to date.

I worry that she'll go on smearing my professionalism and reputation with my other colleagues and bosses. I am angry because I always am kind and professional with her. And I think she's doing this because she's just toxic in general, and also because I refuse to join her ""camp"" at work. I am very neutral, and seen as someone competent. 

(That said, when I transferred to my new team, friends told me that she'd told my new boss and teammates that I'd offended my old boss and therefore got kicked out of the team and thrown into the new team. Lol luckily I've been working here in this org for a while and so some of the teammates did not believe her, though my new boss did. And i had a hard time proving myself.)

I am going to change a job soon. But its in the same small industry. And I fear that she will try to sabotage my new job. Just because she can. 

What should I do to manage her in the mean time, and when i change my job?"

I'm a current undergrad student from Uzbekistan currently studying and living in Warsaw, Poland. Recently I've been thinking about relocating to Berlin upon graduation. By the time I graduate later this year, I will have 4 years of international (United States, Uzbekistan, Poland, and Ukraine) professional experience as an editor, researcher, consultant, and content specialist. 

1) What are the top German companies that provide relocation assistance to those coming from the EU?

2) Is there a chance that I can get a  job in Berlin which would allow me to afford living decently (which includes renting a nice studio apartment and making at least some savings)?

If there's anyone here who has experience with relocation - please hit me up.

P.S I've already googled some things and checked numbeo.

I need some guidance. Some counsel.
 
Ive worked at restaurants, warehouses, and now I work at a meat factory. It all blows. Im introverted. I prefer working alone. The only job I kind of liked was being a food carrier via bicycle. That's because I was alone and could set my own hours. Plus I got an exercise in while working. Cycling is one of my favorite forms of exercise.

 I don't like a job where I have to speak to customers. With Uber eats all I did was greet them, hand them their food, and go my way. this isn't a job I could long term though. It paid good for a single man who doesn't spend  money on too much things, such as myself.  it won't pay enough to financially provide for a wife and kids though. I want a family one day.

I would love a work from home job, or freelancing. 

I don't know exactly what I could do. I have little experience but I would be willing to learn. I enjoy that freedom of being able to work on a computer while still traveling where I want. I despise getting up and going to a job working with people I don't like while being micromanaged my supervisors. This is torture. I can't stand it. I just want self autonomy. I want freedom.

Im 32. For the past 6 years I worked as an assistant to physically impaired students. It wasnt a full time job, more like 20 to 30 hrs per week, but the contract deal was very bad (no money when I was sick, had to pay insurance myself etc.), so it was mostly a side job when I was attending the university. I decided to quit and find a full time one.

For what its worth I was trying to find one for almost a year. Im living with my parents in a house, Im single and since my 15s I struggled with some mental issues (depression, feeling useless, low ego etc.). I also have serious spine problems (Im a hunchback) hence the chronic pain all the time. Im not taking any pension for that tho. A year ago I had to quit gym because of it. I loved gym.

So to get to the case. Six week ago I got a 40hrs/week job in a big finance company on the third try (different positions), so I got excited to start my career at last and make my parents and myself happy. Hell, maybe try to find a girlfriend again. 

First week was ok, I did some online trainigns etc. But since the second week I started to learn the actual work process it got harsh. Its completely out of my field (studied media on the uni) and man, its so complex.

I can work a lot from my home, so its really good for my spine pain, but I feel so stressed. My boss is very cool, very calm and generally really nice, but told me, that the whole team is really concerned about how I am stressing out, so they are affraid Ill will struggle in peaks and will not be able to cope with more difficult tasks. 

Im really trying to learn it. Its not that I find the work process fun, but I dont exactly hate it, if you know what I mean. Im really, really tired all the time and the sunday´s evenings are terrible. I feel like I will vomit. When Im at the work, its a little bit better, but sometimes I just wanna cry. 

I also write some articles soemtimes for internet magazine, but you cant make a living out of it here. Still Im very creative person and this job is not creative at all so far. I have some hobbies, but due to my issues its mostly playing video games and takign some small trips to the nature. Sometimes I ride an ebike.

So, what are my options? I really struggle a lot.

Sorry for any mistakes in my written english. Not a native speaker. Thanks for any and all advices. Have a nice day."
1,2023-03-12,Should I take a counteroffer? (Japan edition),u/Efficient-Top8251,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11pdovx/should_i_take_a_counteroffer_japan_edition/,jobs," Throwaway.

I know that in other countries, taking a counteroffer at your current place usually does not work out, and a lot of people are let go soon after anyway. However, given how it's more difficult to lay people off in Japan, does the same apply here? (A bit of a background for people not from Japan: The bar for firing people here is much, much higher than other places. You need a socially acceptable reason to fire someone - so what companies usually do is make work conditions so bad that people quit of their own volition)

I feel like I am very underpaid at my current company (6.2M base + 1.1 M bonus + 300k RSU/yr) with 8 YOE. There is a review cycle coming up in April, where I will get promoted (into management), but I am looking at a maximum raise of maybe 15-20%, bringing my total comp up to 8.6M - 8.9M. We don't make 100% of our bonuses all the time. The job, however, is, very relaxed, with tons of PTO, almost fully remote (you don't come in unless you absolutely need to), and, zero overtime. I also have a great working relationship with my peers and the management. I love the job, but the salary is a major issue.

I also have a new job offer for a principal-level IC position (12M, 100% base, no bonus), but this job has fewer PTO days and some expectations of overtime/weekend work. They are a big company outside Japan (think S&amp;P 100), but their presence here is limited.

If I quit my current job, I am confident that they will try to counter with something close to my new offer. I'd accept in a heartbeat, but I am worried it will land me on the chopping block when there's a round of layoffs. I have been trying to negotiate salary over the past year but to no avail (our hands are tied, etc, you know the usual corporate spiel).

15,2023-03-12,New IT Business Analyst getting destroyed in my new role,u/thotherside_10,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11pf8ky/new_it_business_analyst_getting_destroyed_in_my/,jobs,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m probably the only employee in my whole IT department who doesn’t have any IT education whatsoever. I was first hired at the company as an IT intern (after getting my Business Mgmt degree), then did pretty well, so the company kept me as a contractor for the past 7.5 years. During this time, I was super burned out and depressed so I learned as little as possible, outside of what I needed to do my specific job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to how I got in this situation - It all started when I was given an important client in Dec. 2021. I told my boss and the client I don’t understand why I was given this role because it’s not my expertise at all and I don’t know if I can do well. They said “oh your director gave you this role for a reason so I’m sure you’ll be fine.” HA. Ok, sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things went well at first, but about 2-3 months in, things went downhill because I didn’t have a clue what the client was talking about. Data files, prototypes, APIs, all that stuff had me so confused and looking like a fool trying to give them the data and technology they needed. There were two data engineers on the project but I was to act as the main poc and “project manager” even though I had zero experience. I had been a support analyst the entire time at the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the project took 6 months to get what the client needed, they said, “we’ll work with this person on your team as our main poc and if anything big comes up, we’ll loop you in.” They didn’t want to work with me after that! I was glad that the project was finally over, but felt very embarrassed and defeated by the whole ordeal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my boss and my director only got the positive end of the story of me working with that new client(from someone else, not me) so they thought things went smoothly and I was a good fit for keeping the client. I didn’t have the courage to tell my boss and director that I’m not the right fit or how things really went with the client. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, my department director strongly encouraged me to apply for an internal Business Analyst position. I knew it wasn’t the right fit for me but I was curious about how much money they’d offer, so I stupidly applied and then felt like I was in too deep to say no, so I accepted the job. BIG MISTAKE. 

&amp;#x200B;

6 months into the Business Analyst job, I’m again feeling thoroughly incompetent and I’m one mental health breakdown away from quitting without another job lined up or checking myself into a mental institution. It’s BAD. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m constantly on multiple projects at a time with very educated and knowledgeable people and I’m over here looking like a clown making myself and my project manager look bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea where to go from here. They hired me because they’re short staffed. But everyday I stress about this job from the time I waste up until I go to sleep, even when I’m off the clock. I have fallen into a very intense clinically depressed episode and I fear what I’ll become if I keep this job. I haven’t showered in a week or groomed my hair in a month, and I avoid my friends and family.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, the pay is great (low 6 figures)which is still barely enough to survive in this HCOL area in this economy, especially with me supplementing other people’s income in my household. If I quit, I’ll never be able to: 1) get hired in the same field; 2) get paid this much money again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need some straight advice. What should I do?

I’m on antidepressants, but they’re not helping."

The law here is that  employees are paid full salary for 2 weeks and then half pay for the following 4 weeks. A sick note is required upon return to work.

I've had 15.5 days sickness this year due to long covid and the regular flu like symptoms that come with it. I've had no issue getting paid for this time off until now.

I received a message from HR on Friday stating that I won't be paid for the previous week unless I provide a sick note, and if I do, it'll be half pay (I had 3 days off).

My contract very clearly states that I am entitled to full pay &amp; benefits for any period of sickness up to 4 weeks within a 52 week period. It also states that a sick note is required after 7 days of absence. 

I've been in touch with various work authorities within Gibraltar who've advised me that they can only enforce the Gibraltar legislation, however, in the circumstance where an employee has a private agreement with their employer (work contract) that is more favorable than the baseline Gibraltar legislation, it is to be honored. If a disagreement continues then it becomes a civil matter and is to be taken to court.

I no doubt have meetings tomorrow morning to discuss this. I've never done anything like this before, how do I convince my HR manager to not go down the legal route and just pay me what my contract states I'm owed?"

Hello,

I am a 28 year old from Lithuania who is thinking about studying for a Master's in Finance in Vilnius University. I have never worked in finance, but I love learning about finance and economics and I am thinking that master's will help me to change career path (I am currently a well paid coach, but would like a change due to long-term uncertainties). I finished my bachelor in economics 6 years ago (I learned a bunch of math back then like calculus, econometrics, statistics etc.) and I forgot all the math I learned back then. The biggest worry about studying this master's program is math, I will add the curriculum below and I wonder how much math will I need to relearn in order to be able to study this. I am not even sure I would pass high school exams at a high grade right now as I have not touched math for over 6 years. I am thinking that I should perhaps hire a tutor and try to remember as much as possible as my master's program would start in 6 months.

Any advice or input regarding math and whether master's in finance would help me get into the finance world is much appreciated.

Here is the curriculum (This programme is affiliated as a Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA) programme.):

Financial Ethics

Macroeconomics

Corporate Finance

Behavioural Finance

Alternative Investments

Derivatives

Fixed Income Securities

Business Valuation

Financial Reporting and Analysis Investment

5,2023-03-12,I need help with my future path. I'm a future biologist and im completly LOST.,u/TOMYCAT97,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11pkwqg/i_need_help_with_my_future_path_im_a_future/,jobs," Hello all. I'm an Argentinian 25 y.o guy who is completly lost about the future. I gonna divide the post in different parts so it's more organized. I would REALLY appreciate if you read the post and use your time to answer with your opinion/ideas/whatever come to your mind.

1. BACKGROUND

I study a ""licenciatura"" in biological sciences in Argentina. It is a career that is considered as ""bachelor's degree + master's degree"" abroad. I have been studying it for 7 years and I will graduate in approximately 4 months. Did it take me a long time to complete it? Completly. But the reality is that in Argentina the biology degree is much longer and also has the disadvantage that the degree is not oriented to a certain branch in particular as it happens with the masters. Most of my cohort has not graduted it yet / some are doing it these days / others will take longer than me. I'm going to graduate with quite decent grades, having done 1 volunteering, 3 internships, teaching practices, and some courses. I don't think I've really acquired tools that are in demand with internships/etc anyway. I am currently finishing my degree thesis in the area of ​​marine ecology, and my idea is to publish the thesis when I finish. I know how to speak/write English decently although I lack practice. During my career I realized that I like practically everything, when I get interested and learn it I end up liking it. But the downside is that I'm not passionate about anything. Neither in marine ecology, nor in microbiology, nor in molecular biology, nor in anything (what I like the least is actually molecular biology). The good part is that i really like science. Not only as a career path but also as a way of thinking. My profile is currently more oriented towards what is research in marine ecology (both because of the internships I did, as well as because of a scholarship that I have for research in marine sciences, and because of the thesis that I am currently doing). But I am willing to change course because I'm not sure on pursuing a research career.

I would like to try my luck in Europe (I also have Italian citizenship).

2) OPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE PATH

I have 3 options here (in order of priority): a) apply for an Erasmus+ scholarship (for that I have to take the IELTS) and spend two years in Europe doing a Master. Pros: maybe I can get contacts/language experience or living abroad/I wouldn't stay away from academia in case I eventually want to go back to Argentina and pursue a PhD. Option b) Go to work in Europe for 1 year in things that have nothing to do with my career. Advantages = I would get money/experience in languages ​​and living abroad that might help me try to find a job from what I studied at the same time. Disadvantages: I need to raise a LOT of money in Argentina (at least 6 months of work because I need to prove funds to leave). In addition, I would not have as much continuity with my academic profile. c) Look for a job as a biologist in Argentina (or remote, although it would be difficult to find) and raise money. I don't know what I would do with my life afterwards. This is the least feasible option I see. I would like to stay with option a) and failing that, b). The issue is that since I don't know what I want to dedicate myself to/or the availability of jobs abroad, it's hard for me to choose the master's program. I liked the remote sensing/gis part a bit but I have practically no experience of that at university. I was just interested. It could be something related to marine ecology, although I see it as very research oriented. Or perhaps microbiology, idk. Perhaps the best option for my profile is to look for a master's degree that will give me the tools for tomorrow to be able to work in industry, consulting, or research. Perhaps something related to statistics/big data? But I don't have a good level in statistics either and I think it would be more accessible for me to enter in ecology programs (although maybe I don't want to because I don't know if they would give me the tools I need for the future!) Age is a factor that worries me too. Taking a master's degree at 26 means finishing at 28 without work experience in the field. Here in Argentina it is relatively common. But it scares me because I know that in other countries it works differently and there is other competition. I'm afraid I won't be able to land a job of what i have studied.

3) FINAL CONCLUSIONS

I don't even know what response I hope to get from all this I wrote. But I wanted to get it off my chest. Any advice/opinion will be greatly appreciated. I would like to find a job that I like one day and to earn enough money to live nice, just that. Also, I would like to one day transition to remote work as well, to be able to work in different countries. I don't know how viable it is. I'm lost.

TL;DR: I need help choosing my path as a biologist. I feel a bit behind and want to choose a path that will give me some kind of stability in the future. Although perhaps stability is an illusion, idk. I would like to live in Europe for a while to test myself. Any comment is REALLY welcomed."

I was previously making $135k as a Media Director, but had to leave. The thing is, that was a remote role based in Chicago, and they didn't yield down my pay for my area. With the economy getting rocky, more competition out there, I'm willing to take less money and a lesser title potentially, as long as the culture fit, vacation, and lower stress levels can make up for it. Money's also getting a bit tight on my end.

I just don't know how to approach it, because I haven't been making it to initial interviews where they've asked what pay I expect. Compensation and title responsibilities change so much between companies. Here's my tiers:

* $135k+ - very happy
* $100k-$134k - happy
* $76k-$100k - disappointed
* $75k and below - very disappointed (this would be less than I was making four roles ago)
* $50k - probably about the minimum I could work with, and I'd expect to be working part time or in a really really cupcake role compared to my experience

Thanks to anyone that can help me come in at a manageable number or at least express I'm flexible for the right match."

Meanwhile I am looking for something that could get me some savings and fit my schedule, something 1 day a week. Remote would be ideal, something with a flexible schedule or where I could work when I want would be the best. There’s always corporate retail but making my own hours would be nice. I live in a rural area so it take me about 30 min to get to a town with shops that would hire someone for one day a week. 

Currently I’ve been working one night a week at a restaurant to make ends meet, but for what I’m making hourly, it’s really not worth giving up Saturdays (weekends are the only time I can spend with my partner). Plus this place is toxically chaotic.

Door dash and instacart are extremely over saturated in my area plus I have to commute 30 min just to start working so this is not feasible. Other gigs like rover, babysitting, etc are the same. Online English tutoring was a prospect in the past, but that’s become overcrowded as well. 

Are there actually any opportunities for people who want to work remotely for just a few hours a week? Just 100 extra bucks would really help me out. Even 50. I have a lot of experience in customer service. Thank you."

Gypsy people in Venezuela usually work repairing heavy equipment (forklifts, backhoes, tractors, etc.). But at this moment, finding that type of job is incredibly hard, specially in Guarenas, the city i live in.

I also don't have a car to move around because the engine is broken, so i need a job that doesn't require me to have a car. And even if i had a car, my parents wouldn't let me go by my own, so i need to work remotely.

I don't have experience in any field, because i've never worked anything else than repairing heavy equipment. I don't have the time to learn a skill because we need money right now. I don't have a computer because i can't afford one.

The only thing i have is my phone. I need a job that only requieres me to have a phone, no CV, no academic knowledge and no working experience.

I only need a job that gives me enough money to buy food. But it has to be something that i can do only using my phone, it has to be remote because i can't go anywhere and something that doesn't requiere me to have a CV nor academic knowledge because i've never assisted to any type of school.

New here. My primary job (Customer Support Specialist) is pretty laid back and minimal micromanagement. I want to take advantage and work a full/part time job alongside it so I can save a little extra for when I have to move in the early summer.  


It doesn't necessarily have to be OE, but if there is an opportunity, I won't shrug it off.  


The only constraints I have is minimal to no phone work (I already do it enough in my primary job), and minimal to no micromanaging.  


If I were to list preferences for jobs:  


Data Entry  
HR  
Customer Service  
Tech Support

2,2023-03-12,Input on Job Transition During Uncertain Times,u/throwtheempireaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11puz6x/input_on_job_transition_during_uncertain_times/,jobs,"Hey everyone! First time posting, why not make it in regard to some serious life advice! Thanks in advance to anyone willing to answer.

Some background: I graduated with a master’s degree about five years ago, and am just starting to develop my career. I currently work for a medium-large nonprofit in the US, managing a subregion for a direct service program that is spread over a good chunk of the state. I have been there for going on five years now, and due to some staffing changes am the most experienced staff member (a contractor has been there fifteen). I work in a pretty technical field so it takes time to build expertise, and I’ve also designed a great deal of the systems that we use day-to-day. On top of this, I’m a union member and have seniority over my coworkers in the program, and several outside of it. We are also grant funded and have at least a couple years of funding lined up. In short, I have a few buffers in the event of things going south.

Now, I had been relatively content at this job, hours are terrible in our busy season but I work with a great group of people, and my boss was the bees knees. Unfortunately, last year amid some cultural changes at our organization my boss found a new position, and the poor culture along with a ton more work made its way to my doorstep. In short, I like my coworkers, strongly dislike my supervisor, and feel that our HR person doesn’t care about employees and the organization as a whole is more unfriendly towards workers. Because of this, and the intense busy season I want to leave. 

I don’t have any specific position lined up, but have a couple promising irons in the fire. I’m not in a position financially to leave without a job lined up, and things aren’t bad enough to necessitate it. I’m not too concerned about hating the new job or getting into a position with a bad culture. My primary concerns with this transition is an abrupt tanking of the economy (maybe fallout from SVB) or organization which I may have been temporarily insulated from at my current job, but will be the new guy with questionable funding anywhere I go. My wife’s employer is pretty reliant on economic development happening, and we don’t have much in savings (working on that) to protect from both of us losing our jobs.

So to the question/advice piece: I was wondering what the people of reddit’s experience has been in a similarly volatile position. Maybe from the great recession or a sudden change in a company’s fortune. Did you make a similar change you came to regret due to a sudden economic/financial calamity, were you able to bounce back relatively quickly, or has it indelibly impacted your life? Are there other things I should be considering as I think about a move?

TL/DR: Young professional looking for a new job, concerned about possible economic instability after transition resulting in firing that I’d have been insulated from, and wondering what people’s experiences have been."

\- Reached out to family, friends, and former colleagues to let them know I'm looking for a job

\- Reviewed job boards in person and online

\- Applied to companies that were present at job fairs

\- Made myself ""open to work"" on LinkedIn, wrote and posted about being open to work

\- Applied to jobs outside of what I was originally looking for, jobs that I also have experience in

How likely would an employer look to terminate me for it being so soon from my start date? Any advice would be greatly welcomed. I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place."

I’ve got a job offer from company A that will expire in a couple of days (had 2 weeks to consider). Interviewed at at company B and currently waiting for an offer. My internship experience fits B’s role better which is why I am confident I will likely land the role, but as a fresh grad engineer I’m open to starting my first job at A to gain experience! 

Some back ground info. B is a GLC and is more established than A. Both are consultancy’s. A will pay slightly better then B and likely slightly faster progression and increment, but B has a more recognised name and opportunities in the industry. Slightly different roles specialisation, okay to do either as a first job, but B’s role is something I’m prefer more than A’s. 

I understand smart thing to do would be to play it safe, 100% secure one job before withdrawing from the rest to avoid potentially being left empty handed. I feel bad accepting A’s offer knowing that it B offers me later on, I will be tempted to renege and sign with company B, but I would rather not burn bridges.

Hi all, I was wondering if anyone had any tips for getting a job in tech industry based in the UK, I have industry experience with engineering (CNC, welding) and have completed a extended diploma in engineering. I have completed codecademys 'learn C++' course and currently taking the back-end developer course on there alongside the 'python3' course. As well as this I'm also taking the It automation with python course on google (coursera). FYI I know that codecademy only teaches the syntax and isn't really applicable for real world solutions.

As the tech industry is something I do not have much credible knowledge of, I'm looking for tips/resources I could use to gain a better understanding. I'm unsure of how my CV should be structured to highlight what I know/learnt. I'm interested in electronic engineering which can work closely with software engineering, hence why I started learning C++ first. 

I currently work as a machine operator and after months of applying to 300+ jobs, Its quite clear I'm doing something wrong. 

Thanks for reading"

Create more goals in February and final evaluation results by May. She gave me a week to come up with goals and back track for September, December and February.

Initially I understood but I have mixed feelings about this now as it isn’t fair to me to back track and create goals , have a mid evaluation and final evaluation rushed was it was my bosses fault for not informing me of this when I started . A part of me wants to do it and a part of me is like efff it…plus I think it’s unethical??? What do you think?

Lastly, I was informed that all staff has to vote to decide to keep me a part of the staff which I knew nothing about too.

Advice? Have you been through something similar and what happened?"

Helped my family at their bakery my entire life from taking inventory, baking, selling, maintenance, handling deliveries, cleaning, etc. I also tutored during a student during my time in university. I created an education start up with a friend of mine which we are still working on a little on the side, but they are currently working on getting into graduate school.  


I don't have any other work experience besides that. I didn't have a chance at getting an internship while in university due to covid and having to move back home. My home town is relatively small. I've applied to something around 150-200 different job postings now. My friends have also helped me revise my resume a few things and believe I should be able to get at least an interview with it, but even then I don't even get called back for an interview. I've done cover letters and had them refined until I was happy.   


I've applied to anything such as, a small cafe, copy writing positions, technical writing, transciptions, HR, warehouse, admins assitant, secretary, etc. I'm desparate for work, but can't find anything. The closest I got was getting an interview with this one sketchy company. I passed the interview and actually got the job, but it was for a soliciting company that pays based on comissions. It wasn't a stable job and required me to relocate, so I felt that I shouldn't have taken the offer. I havent received a chance at any other interviews. I used linkedin and indeed to apply for jobs.  


Has anyone else been in my position? Do you have any advice? Are there any other english majors with insight on what I can do to get some kind of job? I really want work, for the experience and to slowly work on building my portfolio."

Just started my new job a month ago. I liked the job until they started doing shady stuff. Long story short, left my previous job that was a miserable 4 years to go to my new one. New job was great until they asked me and tried to make me do things that I didn't feel comfortable with. So with my new job they want me to become a notary. This wasn't mentioned in the job description or during the interview when I asked questions. So it came to a shock but I started applying right away so I wouldn't lose my job. I asked if there were any specific ways they wanted me to sign up. They said no and to follow as my county wrote their regulations. So I did. I sadly got sick, lost 2 weeks of getting further with the application but soon as I got better I got back on track. So with my county's rules at this current time, it said in bold and underlined on their website if you're applying to be a notary for an employer you need a letter from them saying so. So I bring it up to my new boss and they immediately start getting defensive, won't let me show them what I'm talking about and tries to get me to apply a different way after all that time and money wasted. Then tried to say it'll take too long to make a letter when in the website there's no format. I told them I don't feel comfortable signing up for anything without it in writing and they now get snippy with me when it comes to notary work. CYA (cover your ass) always comes to mind first wherever I go for anything. But I'm already just tired of how this new boss is treating me. I already want to move on, but I just don't want to be in retail or customer service again. At my previous job, I just felt walked on. Especially when I moved up in position there. Now with the new job I damn sure don't want to be in an environment where I'm silently ridiculed for something I didn't feel comfortable with. It's been nearly 7 years since I graduated college (English, Literature concentration) and during that time I felt like career services didn't want to help me if I wasn't doing ""what normal English majors do"" (mostly teaching at my school). Does anyone have any suggestions on places I could either get career advice or a position that's not retail or customer service? Outside of work I'm a creative person. I make costumes and do video tutorials for each one which I definitely want to thrive in more but don't know how to progress it further into a thriving career."

I honestly kinda knew his work ethic was shit so I don’t know why I offered to get him the interview in the first place. I told him after that to just not accept the offer if that was the case and he is going to do that. He has a lot of money saved so he’s not worried about a job right now. 

Can my friend rejecting the offer reflect badly on me? I know I’m not going to get fired but I don’t want to have my reputation ruined at work. Does anyone have any input?

Pretty much copied and pasted what I posted there.

Hey there, everyone! I'll try and keep this as short as possible.

So I just started working for two guys. Each guy is his own separate business, but they share a work space and have some sort of partnership, the details of which I have no clue about. They're a really small operation, pretty much just the two owners and now me. It's a manufacturing thing, and they each have their own machines, but some days I use one guys and other days I use the other guys. So they're both paying me, but I haven't gotten my first check, so I don't know what that looks like yet. The pay is really good though, which is why I took the job.

Here's the issue; they had me register myself as an LLC so they can avoid paying things like workman's comp, overtime, ect. On paper I'm an independent contractor, but I'm pretty sure I should be classified as an employee. I didn't know that until I got the job and started looking into all this. So my question is how do I handle my money and pay my taxes correctly? Or at least what is the first step in figuring that out?

I've tried doing some research on the net, and can't really find anything that pertains to my situation, only things concerning business owners. I'm not really a business owner. The only reason I made an LLC in the first place was because these dudes made me do it, or I wouldn't get the job. I know about self employment tax, and I have a pretty good idea of what total amount of taxes I'll have to pay percentage wise. All I wanna do is take that percentage out of what they pay me each check, and put the rest in my normal bank account. Can I do that? Or is it a lot more complicated than that?

I know this whole deal is shady, and I don't necessarily like it. But like I said before, the pay is good and so far it's pretty easy work. I don't really wanna get these guys in trouble, but at the same time I wanna have all my ducks in a row so I don't find myself in hot water later.

Any help at all would be wonderful, and I'm more than willing to answer questions anyone might have."

So I wanted to know if you guys have any feedback on what i should try to do moving forward. Should I focus more on some personal projects or should I try to look for more internships. If it’s the later, any suggestions on how I could look for one easier as I’ve already applied to most of the ones on handshake.

This is my situation.

I am 28 years old and have been working in hospitality sinda ive been 16
I did a lot from 5 star hotels till cocktail bars and fine dining restaurants and my resume is good.
I am working now part time in a fine dining restaurant ( evenings ) and at day time in a another restaurant ( really casual and easy job )

I have been working already for 2 years for this restaurant then had a 1 year break ( to work fulltime in that fine dining restaurant ) and came back to do lunch shifts (in the other restaurant)

The manager there is new and doesnt now me ( from a year ago ). But he has seen that i did good sales in the lunch and said that being assistent manager would be a good fit for me. 

Now i recently had a talk with him and the hr about the possition and in that conversation then manager said that 
Before he hires me he want to do a friday evening shift toghether ( we never had a shift toghether thats why) to see if there is a click between us in the restaurant. 
He said i have to arrange this asap in the next 2/3 weeks.

Now my problem is is that i am already always working friday and saturday evening in my other restaurant. 
I am already planned in for the next 4 weeks so i can not get off anymore ( sinds they really need me there) 

I also got kinda offended because my excperience is good, i got compliments about my sales but still you wanna see first if there is connection between us? 
In case that if He doesnt like me its a No.

Im also just thinking if there is more toxic things comming up if i get the job.

In my previous job there was a time when we had a department MS teams call, and my manager was introducing the new head of department to everyone in her team, that I was part of. She introduced him to everyone in the team apart from me. I had to do the ‘put my hand up’ action on teams to remind her that she forgot about me.

I feel like it’s a reoccurring theme in my work life where people forget about me :(. I feel like it’s because I’m introverted and quiet.  Can anyone else relate?"

I was hired for WFH position, starting tomorrow. In the interview for non-technical position my future boss asked if I know sql assuming I am, based on my technical background, I coudn't resist but said that I have a little experience with SQL to get the job as I knew the job responsibilities don't include anything with database nor SQL in required skills for a position. To which she said that they have people that work with database and extract data with SQL but in some cases the task is easy and I should do it myself so I don't bother other employees. 
I don't know SQL. I saw commands and even write code bit it's a vague memory. I hope I can google commands in case I'll need to write query or ask other staff to do their job. But I'm stressing out - what if I couldn't do all these things and they'll find out I wasn't completely honest in an interview. 
What do you guys think?"

I need to tell work that I will be needing time off. How can I approach this?  


I am currently thinking of sending the following to my Boss.  Does it sound reasonable?  


&gt;Hi, Just to inform you. My Father has recently fallen critically ill; His condition has progressed far faster than expected, and doctors estimate he has a week or two left. I will need to take leave soon to be with him and support my mother through this.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Due to the unpredictability of his condition, Exactly when I will need to take leave is uncertain. Although I expect it will be anytime within the next week or two.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The amount of leave I will need to take is also currently uncertain, but I expect around \~10 days.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the next day or two, I will make preparations for people to cover my work when I need to take leave. In the meantime, I can continue BAU.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I wish to keep this situation separate from work. So that whilst working and when returning, I can keep my focus on work. I will also inform XXX of this; otherwise, I think it's best people are just aware that I will be taking some time off and that preparations are in place for them to cover for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the leave itself. What is the situation with Compassionate leave? I would like to use this where possible. Otherwise, I will request from my holiday days or could Sick Leave be used?"

I don’t use the word “persnickety” in common conversation, but it’s the word that comes to mind. 

She’s a superficially nice person but if- for example- I don’t delete an out of date excel file from our shared drive after saving a new one, trust me I’m getting a passive aggressive teams message about it. “Why’s there one file labeled March 8th and one labeled March 10th?” She’ll ask, like it’s a matter of national security. Oh, sorry that’s the one from two days ago that I haven’t deleted yet. My apologies for the confusion.

Our organization has two parallel databases, so there’s more than one way to locate a given piece of information. As you’d expect she’s very particular about her way being the best, despite managers more senior than she showing me different methods during my training. This supervisor has told me more than once that information obtained via other methods may be “wrong.”

That’s the level of ticky-tack things she concerns herself with. If you’ve had a supervisor like this, how did you manage it?"

Everything about the position lined up perfectly with my skills and personal experience. I had an excellent rapport with the hiring manager who is also the head of the department I'd be working in. I felt great and we even discussed moving forward with an in-person interview the following week. She wanted me to look over some things to prepare myself for the interview and said she'd get back to me the next week to set up the in-person interview.  

The position wasn't supposed to be filled for several months but the hiring manager told me it would be excellent if I could start sooner so the person in the position now would be able to train me for a few months. I thought I basically had the job at this point. 

I was excited, to say the least, this position would be a really good move for me. On the following Monday, I sent the hiring manager a text thanking her for her time etc. I have always sent a follow-up to thank you the next business day and it's always been well received. However, she didn't respond at all. I waited the entire week hoping that I'd hear back for the in-person interview but she never contacted me again. 

Now I am concerned that I might have come off as too pushy or something else went wrong. I am second guessing whether it would be appropriate now to send a follow-up email just wondering where the hiring process is at this stage? What would you do and how would you word a follow up email? I really don't want to screw this up it's the first time in my almost 40 years that I would be in a position I could see myself retiring at."

I am feeling like I'm just at the end of my rope. I'm burnt out, I'm exhausted, and I truly feel like my mental health is suffering from having to continue work here everyday.

I work primarily with the short term rehab residents. The resident's and families are usually fine, those aren't usually the problem. I'm just so tired of having to deal with insurance companies constantly trying to kick people out when they aren't ready and having to plan for a discharge last minute. Having residents and families then get mad at me as if it's my fault. If I had a dollar for the amount of times I've basically gotten yelled at because the insurance companies want people to leave when they aren't ready then I wouldn't need a job at all. Having to try to order equipment for people and every DME company be out of stock so I have to tell people they need to purchase the equipment themselves or borrow it which makes me feel so bad. I feel like I try so hard at work and it's never enough or never good enough. I skip lunch most days because I just don't have time to eat or I'm just too anxious to eat anything. Whenever I'm not at work I'm worried about it. I have such terrible anxiety from this job and this job is just really affecting my mental health. I used to have someone that helped me, but she put her 2 weeks in a bit ago. They are intetviewing people to take her place, but in the meantime it's just me. My supervisor tries to help when she can, but she has her own stuff to do, too. All of this is just very overwhelming.

Even before my coworker left I was thinking about putting in my 2 weeks, she just did it before I could. Now I feel bad if I put in my 2 weeks because then there will be no one and my supervisor will have to do everything. I know that's not really my problem, but I can't help but feel bad about that. I don't want to make anyone else's job more difficult or for anyone to be upset with me, but I know I also need to focus on myself and do what's right for me.

I've been looking and have had a couple interviews, but don't have anything specific yet. I am in a financial position where I do still live with my parents and have been saving up for a while so if I didn't have a job for a bit I think I would be fine. I just don't know if that would be a good idea. No job also means no insurance which kind of stresses me out a bit. I am a pretty healthy person, but just get paranoid that something would happen where I need insurance and I won't have it.

I'm just not sure what to do and not sure if anyone has been in a similar position and has any advice?"

________ 

I’m depressed. Im incredibly anxious. I’m currently recovering from substance use disorder after abusing alcohol for the past 6+ years. And I’m only in my late 20’s. 

I started out in another career field in another state, but decided after about 5 years it was too much for my anxiety and depression. 

I sold my place about two years ago and moved home. It helped a lot. 

Got a flexible job with good pay for the area. But there’s no room for growth and I’m capable of so much more than my current position allows for. I’ve been a lower-level manager before, and would love to move back into a management position next. 

Right now I have some money saved up and a good support system. I’ve never traveled. Never taken time for myself to go do things. 

I have friends all over the country and I’d love to spend the summer visiting them and seeing the national parks they each live by. 

I’m just so worried this will look bad or set me back in my career. 

That I’ll have to take a pay cut from my current job. That I won’t find anything for a long time. That I’ll find a worse job. 

I know that there’s no better time to do this than NOW… but I’m so scared of messing up my future and career path. 

Would it be stupid to do this? Would it be stupid not to do this?"

Even with the help of my former managers and coworkers to network and get some freelance gigs, the job hunt has been exhausting. For every 20 jobs I apply to, I'm lucky if I hear back from one. Out of the places that *do* get back to me, even fewer want an interview. I've gotten desperate enough that I've started applying to whatever position remotely fits what I think I can do, so in hindsight, I should have seen this coming.

This morning, I had an interview for a position that I thought might be a good fit, but actually wasn't. For the role itself, I wouldn't get to do what I wanted (I am a content developer and writer for health and wellness, and this would be for a customer service-type of position for a wellness company). And if that wasn't the kicker, the salary that was half of what I was getting at my last job sure was. I knew that if I did get the job, I'd be taking massive steps backward career-wise and money-wise. 

So I did something I never thought I'd do: I told the recruiter that I wasn't interested, and thanked her for her time.

It doesn't escape me that I am incredibly lucky and privileged to be in the ""choosy beggar"" position. In a lot of ways, it would have made more sense for me to just pretend that I was interested and do my best to get the job. But I didn't. Now, I'm back to sifting through LinkedIn, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter feeling guilty, sad, disappointed, tired, and relieved all at once.

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading. I'm not looking for pity or anything. It's just nice to be heard."

It also made me a lot more irritable, both of which ended up costing me my job. The place I was working also was in a tough spot because they suffered a lot of turnover recently, so the training wasn’t very thorough as I would have liked it to be.
* Job 2-Pretty much the same as the first job in regards to the medication. I have since stopped taking the medication. I was also required to have a 97% accuracy when processing the various applications that were part of my job, but I was only able to reach a 94% accuracy.
* Without these two jobs on my resume, I will have a two year gap on my resume, as I left the last job I had before those two jobs in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to throw this Reddit's way to get some opinions. I am without a degree and looking for a job that has potential to make $25/hr. So far, I have an offer from the post office and had an interview with an insurance agency.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are what I think would be pros/cons to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Mail Carrier

Pros:

No direct customer interaction (e.g. not having to stay in one place and deal with people directly)

Working independently

I enjoy walking

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

I think I would not like driving all day

Not crazy about working outside

I get pretty anxious just from these two cons alone

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Insurance Customer Service Rep

Pros:

More stable schedule starting out

Insurance is more interesting to me

I would enjoy working for a well known brand

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

It could be depressing as heck working in an office and being tied to a phone all day

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the pay is similar, though I think the post office wins in the long term as far as straight pay goes between the two positions. Would anyone with experience like to chime in?"

I (21F) am about to complete my undergraduate degree in May and have seven months of break until my grad school program starts. I’m looking to work full time over my “gap semester”. All of the work I’ve done up until this point has been customer service, minimum wage positions. I have some friends that are waitresses/bus tables but I’ve gotten very mixed reviews. I’ve been told it’s amazing for making a lot of money quickly, but I’ve also been told that it’s “not for the weak” and restaurants can have a very toxic work environment. Having never worked in food before, I’m a little bit hesitant to give it a shot. Is waitressing a good full-time gig? Is it easy to pick up for somebody who has never worked in a restaurant? Would you recommend working for a local business or larger chain?

Just looking for some input, ultimately I’m looking to save as much money as I possibly can during my time off of school. Thanks!"

Three months ago I started a new job as a Billing Analyst for a company. While I have some experience for what they were looking for, once I really got into my job role I realized how incompetent I am and just how much they're asking of me. It's like a complete different world than what I've experienced before. I can't understand anything they want from me, which is a shame, because this is my first good paying job. I try my hardest to learn and absorb, I spend time researching online but it just doesn't stick. I can only learn by doing it repeatedly under supervision, but I understand I can't have that in this case. They hired me to do a job, not to teach me. 

My boss who hired me has been out for maternity leave ever since I joined and she will be here in a few days. I'm terrified she'll see my incompetence and fire me right on the spot. I know I can learn the job, but I'm already testing the patience of a lot of people there with my questions and inability to do the job myself. I'm not sure how long I'll last, I'm hoping they'll see my potential and keep me around, but I understand this is a business and not a charity. I don't know what to do, I'm constantly under extreme stress and anxiety. Sometimes I'm working well past midnight to try and get things done which turn out incorrect. I want to be good at it and just hope they can see me trying. But I feel as though my time is running out. Any tips or words of encouragement is highly appreciated.

I've been in tech for over 10 years now. I started off as a field service tech, but eventually changed careers and trying to get into software development after losing that job and unable to get jobs in the FST field. 

I love tech its my passion, but I'm not receiving the same love back from the tech field. After my fst job I did nothing but contract and seasonal jobs for a few years, and even went back to school to study software development all while I keep getting rejected from full time positions

I am a single dad to one girl and I want to get into tech so bad so we can live good lives.

With the way things have been going as of late when the tech field burst its bubble I was wondering if its still worth going to school to increase my chances or just do a career change again. If I go the career change route I was looking into electrician, car mechanic, or HVAC. Like I said I really love tech and I know its a good fit for me, but I need to get some money too and there's no positions right now.

As FYI yes I have a GitHub and a website portfolio showcasing my programming projects.

Any suggestions or tips are welcome.

I dont have contact with any previous collegues or management that knows who I am at any of my previous positions due to the fact that no one Ive worked with is still at the companies and I dont have their contact info.

1,2023-03-13,Job promised I would receive the same pay working a 36 hour overnight shift as I would working a 40 hour day shift. They lied. Now what?,u/Bepis_Inc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11qn3l0/job_promised_i_would_receive_the_same_pay_working/,jobs,"Hey everyone! 

So I finished training with my job and we were assigned our shifts. I received a 3x36 shift overnight. I was going to request a change 
because I would be working 4 less hours a week (which I can’t afford) and 12 hour shifts are brutal for less pay.

I was assured when I accepted the shift that my pay would be adjusted to receive my same salary and with differentials I would actually make more every check so I agreed to work it.

Looking at my compensation, all they did was lower my Full Time Employment and never changed my pay, so now my salary is 6,000 less.

I’ve called HR numerous times and I’ve pestered my manager about it because I can’t afford to make over $100 less every check. My manager keeps referring me to HR. HR gives me a different answer every time, but they keep insisting that my pay per hour is the same so it should be fine.

At this point my manager is frustrated with me, HR is frustrated with me, and I don’t want this shift anymore. No one knows how my pay will look, and I’m tired of the runaround.

What should my next step be? Should I request a shift change and change teams? Should I be patient and wait for my next check? Should I just accept it?

**TL;DR** Job promised me I’d make the same on a 36 hour schedule as I would on a 40 hour schedule. Policy changed and they no longer awarded the 4 hours and instead said they would increase my pay. They lied. I can’t afford the new shift. HR and manager are mad I keep asking. What do I do?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11l0not/i_feel_like_im_going_to_lose_my_job_after_2/

Essentially, 2 weeks ago I was told my work wasn't great and I either improve or I'd get fired.

I got really scared and tried doing my best. A week ago I poorly communicated a scheduling conflict and got chewed out for it. Things are 'better' now, but I no longer feel comfortable in this job. I fully acknowledge that a lot of it was my fault and all of this has been a massive learning experience, but the whole situation has soured me to the job. I want out now and am thinking of leaving it if I can stay for a year or a year and a half, but I wouldn't be complaining if I failed my probation. I kind of feel like my situation can't improve now that this has all happened.

At the same time, I feel like this is a childish reaction on my part and I'm overthinking it. This was my first real job and I haven't gained enough experience to really get anything else of equal level yet. This was supposed to be my big break, so to speak. I feel like it can be fixed and that job hopping like I've been doing would be seen as a negative.

I’m (28M) based in Adelaide, Australia and have found myself thinking about career progression. I’m currently a Youth Worker (Diploma of Youth Work) and make decent enough money but there is no room for progression or growth and I feel as if I’m in a high paying retail role. It’s casual and the only way I can see myself getting ahead in this particular field is to start my own organisation which is just unachievable considering the resources you need to even care for 1-2 young people.

I enjoy the job mostly and the money makes up for when I don’t enjoy it, but knowing that I can’t make more without working more is stressing me out as I’d like to start a family soon and I’m unwilling to work 16 hour days as it defeats the purpose of starting a family if I’ll never be home to see my partner or children.

I’m looking for advice or suggestions on careers I can move to with minimal additional study (happy to study part time at TAFE or something similar whilst I work, but unwilling to go to university for 3-4 years). I make roughly 75-85k a year at the moment and happy to drop back to 75k a year as long as the career will have room for growth and progression over time.

I’ve done some research but it seems the only option I’ve found is Occupational Therapy or mentoring. I’d love to move into government and settle into something secure with the ability to climb the ladder as I’m still young and motivated.

Behavioural Therapy is what I’m looking at as the pay and ability to become a team leader and later manager are enticing but anything online is saying it’ll be 3-4 years of full time study before I’d become qualified.

I’d love to hear any advice or stories from people in similar situations and how you managed to find your groove.

Thanks"

0,2023-03-13,A Tale of two extremes? Need help deciding what to do.,u/ryanschultz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11qs28y/a_tale_of_two_extremes_need_help_deciding_what_to/,jobs,"So I've had an unusual? situation come up. Not sure if I can call it rare, or commonplace. 

So June 2022 I left my old job just due to being burnt out. I was experiencing stress from all sides (work, family, friends, etc). I wasn't a huge fan of the job, but it paid decently and I had a lot of good coworkers. Plus I pretty much never had a slow day as I was constantly busy. 

Ended up moving back in with my parents 1000 miles away and helped them with their issues. I kept my house I bought in my old city and rented it out as I didn't want to sell it yet and the rent more than covered the mortgage. 

Just before Thanksgiving, I got a new job near my parents house. The pay isn't what I'd like, but it's super low stress and I get to work from home 2 days a week (something that wasn't a possibility at my old job). I wasn't planning on staying at this job long anyway, but needed cash flow. 

Starting a couple weeks ago, a whole chain of events started unfolding. Truck broke down, my house that's being rented out got broken into twice (yes, twice!), vet bills for my dog, plus I got a new puppy (I know this one was avoidable, but I put the deposit in before the other things started happening). Basically slashing my savings way below my comfort level (still enough for another small emergency, but anything big is gonna require a loan of some sort).

On top of that, my tenant is moving out early and the new tenant hasn't moved in yet. 

But last week, a couple of my old bosses start texting me. Just casually asking if I'd be interested in coming back, what I've got going on, etc. One of them asked if I had time for a phone call and I told them I'd hear them out. They're offering me my job back (I left on good terms, never know when something might happen and I might have to come back). Some changes have happened at my old workplace (I've still got a couple friends I talk to on occasion there) that would take some of the stress off. Not all, but some. 

So the question has become, do I go back? Or do I stay where I am now?

Old job Pros: 

* better pay ($85k base plus $3500 moving expenses and bonuses)

* More active, interesting job. At least to me. This job is a mix of desk and field work which I've found suits me best. It's a construction based job though which I get isn't for everyone. 

* Minimal readjusting since I already know my coworkers and the job. Pretty self explanatory. 

* In my degree field. Well, kinda. This position is rather similar to a construction management role and my degree is in civil engineering which is common to find in the work force.

Old job cons:

* still a lot of stress 

* Crappier hours (roughly 55 hours/week on average, plus about 1 Saturday a month)

* No work from home option (but my house is only 10 mins or so from where the job is so it kinda balances)

* Still need to figure out if I'd have to buy out new tenant since they're are already lined up to move in next week.

* Back to taking care of a household by myself. 

Current Job Pros:

* Super low stress. It's basically an Excel IT/data entry job

* Awesome team. Super understanding and helpful, and we have fun and give each other crap at work all the time. Now my old job has some good coworkers there, but there's only a couple that I'd call awesome vs my whole team now. 

* Consistent Hybrid schedule. Mondays and Fridays I get to work from home, only Tuesday through Thursday in the office. Pretty much set 40hrs/week M-F, no weekends unless EOM happens over a weekend (which hasn't really happened since I started).

* Minimal expenses for the most part since I'm still living with my parents. 

Current job cons:

* Not the greatest pay (50k salaried). It's fine given my situation right now, but it doesn't leave much room for error once I get back into my own place. Not sure on the pay growth potential, but given the job duties I wouldn't bet on it being very high. 

* BORING! Basically all the job consists of is working on spreadsheets. Which I don't have much trouble with it, but it doesn't push my skill set and I'm not learning much if anything at this point. 

* Not much room for growth in department. The company is growing, but the needs for the department I'm in won't change much. They're expanding from their bread and butter core business, but the requirements for the new divisions aren't any different really from the core business and I'm pretty low on the totem pole in my department at the moment (only one guy has been there less time than me, but he's also 6 or 7 years younger than me). Could possibly work switching departments down the line, but my degree is in engineering and this is basically an accounting office for the company where I'm at now. So no guarantees. 

* Currently living with my parents. Yes, I have minimal expenses because of this, but they stress me out and I'm more than ready to be back on my own already. I know this could change with time, but who knows how long it'll be with being a landlord already. 


Now I could also stay at my current job and look for a different job here. But this feels rather like a grass is greener type of scenario except I already know what change of green the grass is on the other side."

And guess what, I still screwed up the simulation section. I got it all right except for the tracking number part. Looked all over for it only to find it AFTER I gave the wrong answer. Sheesh.... I'll probably get rejected again. They go through the simulation too fast and don't explain everything in full detail. It's like they expect you to already know their system.

And what's the purpose of the section where there are no ""right or wrong"" answers? If the answers don't matter, why ask them?

Anyways, I hope I get moved forward after this, but probably won't. We'll see in a couple days. Would really like to have a job again.

1,2023-03-13,I’m seeking a new job. How do I make sure it’s not a toxic as my current job/management?,u/FunnyCustard3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11qt7r9/im_seeking_a_new_job_how_do_i_make_sure_its_not_a/,jobs,"A year and a half ago I left my previous job to start a career in a brand new industry. My previous job was difficult and didn’t have a good work-life balance, with a small chance of upward movement meant less of a work-life balance. But I loved my coworkers, and I made really decent money, just below 6 figures. 

Covid took a mental toll, I had a close family member pass away, and I decided I wanted to see my family more. I had no time to even see friends, and my partner hardly saw me. I’m good at talking to people, and was able to get a job outside my industry and start a new career.

A year and a half later, things aren’t great. I took a $30k paycut with promises I would be making over $100k after 1 year (I’m not), I would have upward movement (I don’t), there is a great workplace culture (it’s not), and they were devoted to giving me continuing education (I’ve submitted many classes relevant to my job title, they are ignored).

I was brought in to a barely form role that I tediously was instrumental in forming, despite being new to the industry. My bosses are incredibly emotional, and my boss (who is also emotional) has lied to his bosses to control them while we got an intellectual grasp on things. To give you an idea why he would do this, it’s because they are highly emotional but in an “alpha dog” way and raising the alarm is when we can fix it is actually worse all around - including for the company. My boss is currently lying about something, and while I get why, I suspect it will roll down to me.

I recently had a phone call with a recruiter who was audibly impressed with my duties and responsibilities until my job role, and from everything I’ve seen I’m being paid *at least* $15k under what I deserve.

So my question is, what questions do I ask in the interview process to give me an idea of the work culture/management style?"

I am a non exempt employee.

One of my coworkers noticed i sent an email to a client over the weekend because they were CC'd , they told my bosses, and my bosses were mad that i didn't clock in for a few minutes. Not because they care about me but because they're scared of the department of labor god forbid i ever snitch on them.

I check my emails on Sundays to prevent anxiety on Monday mornings and having to respond to so many stuff. I started doing this because i learned from my other non exempt coworkers that they would do it and that everyone does it, just to have a clue of what to expect on a Monday morning. 

Sat in my bosses office, and they said effective immediately that they will be removing remote access because i did not clock in for the few minutes of checking emails. And have been told several times if i ever log in remotely, i have to clock in. Problem with saying that is that they are also restricting my overtime and i cant work more than 40 hours. Make that make sense.

But yeah, they're removing remote access from for this reason, i even told them doing that will prevent me from having to use a sick day if god forbid something were to ever happen to me.

They made it look like i was a huge threat, they made it sound like i was doing the opposite of basically clocking in and not doing any work.  When it was actually the opposite, yeah i can see their concerns because they're protecting the company. But dam it feels outrageous that HR also had to be CC'd in the email of removing my remote access."

In summary, my family has thousand's of physical photos which my mom would like to be sorted, scanned &amp; uploaded. Some of the best photos would also need to be made into physical albums, grouped by time-period, events, etc. 

My mom is looking for a part-time worker, for \~10 hours a week, for a few months. Pay hasn't been decided yet, as we don't know what market rate would be for someone like this. This person would also be working with my mom, as my mom would have to give some guidance / clarification on which photos pertain to which time-periods, events, etc. I figure about 70-80% would be spent scanning and uploading photos, with the remainder creating and organizing the physical photo albums.

So my question is: what is the best site / best strategy to find a part-time worker like this? I looked at Indeed, but a company name is required when creating a job posting, and of course we do not have that.

Thanks in advance. Unfortunately my sibling and I do not live in the area, so we cannot help (and my mom wants to start this long project ASAP.)"

I mean the job descriptions are SUPPOSED to say what you'll do, but almost every job I get, I'm not doing what the description says I will be doing.

I'm just afraid I'll apply to a job, get it, and even if it pays more which is partially what I want a long with any sort of actual life balance, I'll just fucking hate it and then I'm just...stuck there...kind of like I am now and basically have been with every job.

I realize this all sounds like ADHD rambling (because it is), but this has been a serious problem for me and it's constantly on my mind. As a result, I apply and look for less and less jobs because I'm afraid I'll, again, dislike it, then leave, and it'll become a cycle until I'm looked at as unemployable.

5,2023-03-13,Feeling depressed at current job,u/TheGlowingWight,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11qvrlm/feeling_depressed_at_current_job/,jobs,"When I started at my current job, I thought that my boss was freaking awesome. First few weeks were great, but then it went straight down the drain.

First major incident: I was still a few months in to job. My boss wasn't giving me any training and I had to learn by observing and asking workers. All of the floor shop workers are of the same ethnicity as me, so we all get along. My boss didn't like me talking to them. He called me into his office one day and told me that if he saw me chit chatting again, that he'd write me up. I tried telling him that I wasn't chit chatting and asking about a certain process. 

I should not have tried explaining myself to him as next day I was sitting in a room with him and HR. He was telling HR about how bad it was for me to be chit chatting instead of doing my job. I gave my side of the story, but he had counter arguments to everything (basically that me talking to workers distracts them and puts them in danger). Ignoring the fact that they all talk to each other just fine. One of the things my boss even asked me when he hired me was of I was okay with coworkers horseplaying and bullshitting with me.

So now I don't even talk to many coworkers, despite needing to, to get updates from them. 

2nd incident: One day while on my lunch, he yelled at me over something that happened on the floor. He didn't care that I was on lunch as he expected me to be there and take care of it when the incident happened. 

Still new, I apologized and started taking my lunches several hours later, after crews were done for their shift, almost at the same time as my own shift ended.

3rd incident: I was in the restroom when boss got a call about some missing materials. At this time, I was in charge of precuring materials for certain projects. Boss called me and I didn't answer. As soon as I stepped in the office I get yelled about it. Apparently, the shipping department mistakenly marked a material that had yet to be delivered to us as delivered. I spent days looking for the material before realizing it had never arrived (was in process of arriving though). Explained the situation to my boss and he didn't even apologize. 

So as part of this, I started keeping weekly logs of all materials I was handling, sometimes excusing myself out the floor to get updates with suppliers and departments. Twice or thrice per week I'd call/email to verify status of materials.

Late last year, out the blue, my boss sent an email to inform company that I would be moving to 2nd shift. I was only given a 3 day notice. I accepted it, but did bring up our agreement that when I was hired, I was told that eventually I'd be moved to 2nd shift, but only after 2 or more years of experience. I didn't feel completely ready to be on my own, so boss assured me that I could call him if anything comes up.

Till this day, my boss has never really answered any phone calls, except for a few where I call him as he is leaving for home.

4th incident: A few weeks ago, the 2nd shift production manager accused me of leaving the company during my shift, claiming he had recorded me. My boss believed him and as punishment, he increased my daily work hours from 8-9 to 10-12 hours per day. I am salaried btw. I contacted HR and asked them to pull up surveillance videos of me from the night I supposedly abandoned my post. They found no wrong doing on my end and apologized, claiming they talked to the production manager and that it wouldn't happen again.

My boss didn't appear to like that one bit as almost immediately, he took away all my projects without telling me why.

To add insult to injury, I started at the same time as another coworker under my boss's wing (both of us were supposed to be under boss's wing). That guy was kept in 1st shift. During the time I worked with him, he was late almost every single day, 20-40min. He constantly took 1 hour lunches, and would constantly waste hours per day chit chatting with sales department about cars and food. Boss never yelled at him.

Recently when I started bringing my college text books to tackle some work related problems, he told me not to waste my time with that, to just use the simulation software that we have. Thing is, he never taught me how to use it and never requested for a product key for me. Last Friday, I walked in on him teaching my coworker how that software works. 

Edits: Forgot that I also emailed him regarding that. I told him if he had time to teach me, since he appeared to have time to teach coworker. He told me that I shouldn't be concerned with that atm and to just focus on my job. I just read that email today!

Not going to claim my boss is racist, but that coworker is of similar ethnicity/race to boss. They are always going to lunches together and boss even invites him to dinner during weekends. 

I am so depressed... Last year, I had saved our company over half a million dollars from a recycling project I started. I've been punctual to work every day, only missed 2 days since I started. Every project I was given I'd complete them in a week or two. During my down time I am getting certifications from our company's partner. I never like to sit idle or waste time.

My review is about to come up and am afraid my boss will try to paint me bad.

All of the decent paying jobs in my field that are remote seem to do company retreats now. I went through a lengthy hiring process with one that didn't require retreats and of course they didn't hire me at the end. 

As some of you probably know the retreats require travel, are about socializing and meeting co-workers, and have nothing do with the work itself. The problem is I am plenty capable of doing the jobs and probably will be hired somewhere but I am worried about keeping jobs because I cannot do company retreats. I literally just can't. I'm 'normal' when I am home and can control my own space, but I'm allergic to mold, chemicals, random things in the environment &amp; have food sensitivities/restrictions, plus I also have asthma, and I am severely immunocompromised due to a primary immune deficiency disease called common variable immune deficiency. When I am exposed to things I am allergic to I get horrible disabling level brain fog and many other symptoms and it's very hard if not damn near impossible to even accommodate myself traveling. Forget anyone else being able to make it work for me even if they were understanding. As soon as I am in many uncontrolled environments I cannot choose to meet my needs I get violently ill. Also, because of my immune condition I am supposed to be hospitalized with bad infections if I regularly socialize. 

I am also unfortunately the bread winner for my household and I've got two young kids. So am I fucked over these stupid company retreats making remote jobs not disability friendly? There is basically no level of accommodation that would make these retreats possible. I can get notes from multiple of my doctors but no idea if that is good enough. I stress over this a lot."

This probably sounds like a very silly question, but I appreciate any advice you can offer.

I’m 25 y/o and have never been career-driven. My primary goals in life revolve around being a good person, partner, friend, and hopefully mother some day. Any dreams I have related to “work” involve owning a small farm, winery and store where I sell homemade goods, but this is not realistic for me until much later in life.

I accept that having a 9-5 is necessary both in general and to support my “passion” dream if I decide to pursue it, so in college I chose a field that I enjoy well enough. I now work for a corporate company in Los Angeles.

Networking, interviewing, and navigating a job in general have always felt tricky since I lack little passion for a career. I constantly feel like I have to fake my drive to management and work extra hard so my lack of passion isn’t discovered.

I have managed well at this I suppose and just got promoted last week where I will be reporting to a new manager within a new department. He wants to speak about my goals in our next meeting, and I know he expects me to have an extensive list.

Honestly, it sounds so bad, but I really have no professional goals right now. I just do my job and hope for the best and try not to think about work in my free time. I’m freaking out on what I’m going to say.

I have no idea where to begin when it comes to setting professional long-term goals for myself. Can anyone help me?"

His opinion: “they’re a creative company, so they they’ll be able appreciate my creative decision, which requires me to go over the time specification.”

While I say: “no, that’s gonna make you look very bad. If someone gives you a basic spec, you’re expected to stick to it.”

I’m certain he could get it down to 30 seconds if he tried hard enough, and I know that if I were the person hiring, I’d throw out any application that couldn’t at least be bothered to observe the requested specs.

I’m not someone who’s ever been in charge of hiring though, so maybe I’m wrong.

While I was there, one thing went into another and applying for the job became a topic considering I’m 16 and have no work experience. The place said they allow 15+. The manager was incredibly nice but she seemed SUPER strict and it was quite intimidating. I told her I’ll think about it, 2hrs roll by and we meet with her again and spontaneously with much pressure I told her I’ll be there on Tuesday (today)

I’m INCREDIBLY nervous. She was super enthusiastic about it but she still had that intimidating aura I spoke of. With that said I have so many different worries. I’m not a very social person and I’m quite silent when in public, I can speak to others but I often find myself stuttering or saying “uhhh” or “umm” I also find myself misinterpreting people’s words and what not. I recognized some faces from school but we aren’t friends and I’ve only ever seen them in the halls. Not to mention the managers aura. She was awesome but I can tell she does NOT play. Im scared that if I were to mess up I’ll be publicly rebuked. I’m also worried about the interview itself today, I was told to avoid saying “umm” and other filler words of that nature but that just happens while I try to interpret and think about the question. I literally can’t fall asleep rn I need advice pretty badly.

I’m really not sure if this belongs here not I’m sorry to the mods if it isn’t."

Unfortunately, my supressed dysthymia developed into a severe and treatment-resistant form of clinical depression that rendered me completely unable to function, and after three additional years of inadequate treatment and repeated academic failures I was kicked out of the country and my scholarship was canned. This all took place from Fall 2012 to Fall 2017. I returned home with nothing to show for my efforts and had to spend an additional three years or so (until Fall 2021) in treatment and recovery. 

Since then I've been accepted into another university in a nearby country (to my home country; not the US) and I'm basically starting from scratch all over again in the same major. I'm very grateful to have recovered at age 26-27 and I'm currently 28 and have completed my first year, so I have at least another 3 years left. 

Given this, the best-case scenario is that I will be at least 31-32 years old by the time I graduate and I'm genuinely worried that I'm going to be asked why I had taken so long to get a degree and why my employment history is almost nonexistent despite my age. I don't mind being open with them about my illness, despite how traumatic it has all been for me. Rather, what worries me is the stigma against psychiatric conditions and whether they'll be understanding towards such matters or not. After all, this type of stuff isn't understood very well in this part of the world and I'm worried of being overlooked because of this. 

I don't know what I'm hoping to get out of this post, but I would love some perspective as to how other people might see my situation and what I could possibly do to overcome whatever disadvantages I may have as a result of circumstances I had no control over. I mean, my country's ministry of higher education which sponsored my first academic journey in the US still steadfastly refuses to have anything to do with me despite my sending them all the medical documentations I could possibly muster. I suspect they don't lend much veracity to my case and I'm concerned that future potential employers will possess a similar attitude. 

Anyway, I'd appreciate your thoughts and insights into this matter. Thank you in advance and all the best to you."

2,2023-03-14,I was fired from my first corporate job and it has been the worst experience of my life yet the best lesson ever learned.,u/ntsir,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11r2qkm/i_was_fired_from_my_first_corporate_job_and_it/,jobs,"I made this pretty thick note in November 2022 shortly after I was fired from my first corporate job. On top of everything else, even though I never signed an NDA they threatened to sue me when I spoke against them on this on a online comment even though I didn’t name them directly. The manager happens to be of the same background as me, meaning an expatriate from the same country.

“This week I was fired from my first job with a big company after just 1,5 months of employment. The past few days have been some of the worst days I have experienced. I was hired following a thorough double interview process including a character assessment test and a case solving. Having this job meant that for the first time in my adult life I was going to be able to not worry about money and focus on my medium to long term planning as well as being able to focus on developing my skills and interests within a safe environment that appeared to be encouraging this. I was welcomed by everyone else working there and had created pleasant relationships with the majority of the people I got to interact with, all of them willing to let an eager new colleague learn about the processes and subjects of their work. All except for one person, my immediate manager and the person that happened to be the one that hired me. From the very beginning I figured out that she had a special temperament, one that was making it difficult for me to communicate with her. She was aware that this was my first corporate job and that I was entirely new to this field, so she initially assured me that I should only expect to reach the learning curve after a long period of time. In the few weeks that I got to work with her, I was given a handful of mixed signals, from being encouraged to ask questions to being grounded if those questions were not exhibiting knowledge and as said, from being given long timelines to being pushed to showcase structure here and now. That being said, in a broad new environment, it can be quite challenging to communicate a feeling of structure, especially to a person with significantly more experience. After a tough meeting where among else she emphasised on her impression of lack of structure from my side, I reached out to HR to let them know that I find her way a bit excessive and that I am willing to work on dealing with her but I need to know that it’s not going to be a hinderance. HR, assured me that they were aware of her behaviour and advised me to keep going telling me indirectly that they don’t want me to feel bad in my work environment. Trying to do that, I pretty much spent the next period begging for work and guidance, trying to get my grasp on things and trying to deliver results but mostly to let her become aware that I took in what she said. For people not used in corporate work, busy work can be a true nightmare as the days went by extremely unproductively and asking all the time for something to do seemed to cause more annoyance than thinking to her. On our last meeting, after preparing a full list of things I was working on, a subject was brought up regarding misunderstanding about some documents which led to me being accused of lying about seeing them and pretending that I haven’t, despite the fact that such a thing made no sense as they were something I was looking for. Having no way to defend myself, as it’s hard to prove that you didn’t lie when people have already made up their minds that you did, I stood there trying to understand what I have been facing. Following the meeting, I burst into uncontrollable crying thinking that I will not be able to proceed like this unless HR does something to control my manager’s negativity and persistent desire to focus only on things that don’t satisfy her, without remotely providing any guidance or acknowledging the things that were going well. Immediately after, I show up in a group meeting, where she is apologising for her short temper due to some personal issues she was having that were stressing her while encouraging anybody in the team to feel free and safe to express their feelings and things that bother them. Taking the lead, I explain to everyone that I cant go on like this in a team where I cant feel safe to ask questions or where criticism is always negative, where I can’t trust my manager to help me and I am afraid to report to her.  I had identified issues with the way I was being managed by my immediate manager as early as 2 weeks into my employment. I have had a hard time communicating with her in a non awkward way due to the fact that I couldn’t register any of her feelings during our conversations and everyday interaction. The point where I felt that things were not going well came following a meeting with her, in which her tone was in my opinion not in line with what I expected based on a number of different variables such as the company’s room for mistakes policy, the fact that this was merely the first days of me being in a corporate environment and the fact that she could had just been more empathetic about a new member in team with a significant learning curve. I approached HR telling them exactly what happened and assuring them that my desire is to make things work while of course apologising for the fact that I had done mistakes. HR took a meeting with me and we agreed on me taking a better approach to listening to what she has to say, while also registering the fact that she is a new team leader and maybe not at all used to leading people, especially new recruits which objectively requires greater mental capacity to deal with as well as patience and skills. To my knowledge, HR also met with her and I am not aware of what has been discussed. More meetings came, with her tone not necessarily changing, yet her input becoming progressively less and less in quantity resulting in a confusing underutilisation of my working time. The last meeting we had, included me trying to list all the things I had been working on or at least trying to work on given the circumstances and it was followed by her escalation of a miscommunication issue into a full blown accusation of lying from my behalf without at any point giving me the benefit of doubt. Having already gone through a verdict with no chance of defending myself in a way that mattered, I blew out after breaking down emotionally and expressed myself openly within the team, telling them that I don’t at all feel safe to proceed under those circumstances and that it’s not sustainable to feel like that. The next day, I tried to avoid quitting and attempted to meet with HR to tell them that I seriously want things to work out and I don’t plan to waste this chance. Instead, I was made to wait all day being ignored and delayed, only to have them announce to me that I am fired. After that I was thrown out of the building while they gave me a replacement phone with almost no battery meaning I had to go to a nearby cafe to charge and set up payments and train tickets as I live 3 hours away from that place. “"
1,2023-03-14,To act on the offer or not? That is truly the question.,u/goldengooz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11r2vzm/to_act_on_the_offer_or_not_that_is_truly_the/,jobs,"Hi all! I just received an offer letter from a company I’ve had a great interest in. The thing is, they gave me a reaaaaally low offer and a demotion (somewhat). 

For context, 
- I interviewed for a managerial position and they offered me a senior exec role. 
- I have had 3 years of experience within the industry to date. The new company is in the same industry as my previous places.
- The scale of the company is pretty small, but bigger than a lean start up. 
- My last two positions held was a managerial one (total 1.5 years) as well, yet this new company claims that they think my experience in a leadership role is limited.
- I am based in Asia and a citizen of the country im living in. 
- The interviewing team shared that there was another candidate for the role and competition was close. This move seems like they’re trying to offer both parties a position. 

Comparing base salaries for an annual package, they are offering me 27% lower from my last drawn. I am currently in the process of negotiating to see if they can reduce that to 9% (my bottom line). I’m not too optimistic about this though. 

Personally, I’m feeling quite insulted with the big drop in salary despite having shared my expectations in the first round. Coupled with the drop in title, it doesn’t feel like the company values my experiences despite saying that they do. 

Should they accept my proposed amount, would it then be wise to still accept the offer? Also, how would growth look like for this particular position? And how does this accurately reflect on the culture? 

Any advise would be very helpful. Thanks."

I'm worried many have little/no HR staff, and their careers email is rarely looked at, so maybe it's worth bumping myself back to the top of the inbox?

Any advice much appreciated :)"

Ok so I remember when I was applying for internships 2 years ago. A recruiter reached out to me for an interview. This was my first interview ever, and I was so excited. I passed the first round, and it was time for the second round. I finished the 2nd round, and I waited for the results. Sadly, I was rejected. 

But I continued to apply and got another position in the same company. That was a great experience. As the internship was closing, I mentioned to my manager that I was happy I landed their internship after being rejected by others. 

Then, when my manager tells me that it was good that I was rejected. I am confused, so she explains that that role is very bad and unorganized. She continues that interns barely learn or do anything, and I would have had the opposite of the current great experience.

 Wow. That's good to know. I know I would have immediately accepted an offer if I got one. So is it really important to read about the position on glassdoor and other websites before applying?"

I finally received a generous offer in compensation and healthcare. I will also have a more siloed role with this firm which I believe would be easier and less stressful. (Although the people I interviewed with constantly mentioned long hours or constant fires).

COMPANY TWO is smaller company and they interviewed me only
Twice for a more expansive management role before giving verbal
Offer. but the offer was $5k less for more work and their health insurance isn’t as great. So I told them it wouldn’t work, but they almost begged to make it work and asked what I want. 

I told them $10k more and it would work, thinking that would be too much to ask, but they pushed through approvals and got me that offer. However, it is only verbal and the written will be sent in two days. 

WHAT COMPANY WOULD INTEREST YOU?

Company two seems highly interested since they accepted my $10k increase to their original offer. However this position has been open for a year. Is this a bad sign of a desperate company?!?? 

And Company one seems like the work might be as crazy as the interview process?

I’m so torn!!! I have to make decision today because Company One WRITTEN offer expires today!

I have a B.S. in health care management, worked very hard through undergrad, graduated one year early (2020) did two internships, worked PT and full time. 

I live in a small town, and I just seem to have bad luck with jobs. 

In undergrad, got an office assistant job in a practice where the lead dr was absolutely nuts — so nuts that they drove all of the full time employees to quit at the same time. Also took a CNA job where I was absolutely overworked and ended up quitting there shortly after. 

After undergrad, it took me about 7 months to land an office job that required a bachelor’s degree. Paying $35k. But I took it because I couldn’t find anything else. I worked there for about a year, and I obviously needed to make more money. 

While employed, I submitted job apps consistently and was strung along by a regional health care system for 5 months before I learned I got the job. They blamed it on some of their systems being down. I accepted the position because even though the HR/management was a red flag, I wasn’t having any luck anywhere else. The job description looked interesting and it was almost a 70% raise. 

When I started there, the environment at the job was just weird. Cubicles in a basement, one window in the corner away from all employees. All you could hear was the heater/AC running constantly. No one ever talked to each other. Tried to spark convo but all were just very disengaged. I’m an introvert and I don’t care if I make friends with people at work. But I didn’t realize that I really needed to talk to someone every once in a while on the job. This was silence about 8.5-9hrs a day, 5 days a week, in a basement with really no windows, accompanied by a blasting heater/air conditioner. 

Boss at this job was just bad. On the first day, gave me a packet of about 2 pages to read, didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day and then went on vacation the next day. Boss was gone for two weeks and when they came back, they didn’t really give me instruction. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing despite seeking help multiple times. Boss took multiple vacations and then was out for about 1.5 months due to a medical procedure. I just sat confused for about 9 months until I went completely stir crazy and quit. During that job, I went through about 3 phases where I applied for jobs for about a week, realized I wasn’t going to find a new one, then quit searching and settled with the job I had. 

My search has been riddled with mishaps: multiple recruiters not calling me for the phone screening after scheduling it, getting to the 3rd round of interviews and not getting the job or learning that they didn’t have money in the budget for the job so they aren’t filling it, applying for multiple govt jobs that were outdated (they had been already filled or placed on hold and the website wasn’t updated), rejection emails for 100+ jobs before the chance to interview, and not hearing back from the majority of companies where I applied etc

I’m just frustrated. I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining bc I know there have been people who go years without having a job or have jobs with conditions that are much worse. 

I don’t know what the point of this post was other than to vent. If you’re reading this and have gotten this far, thanks. If you resonate with my experiences, you’re not alone."

I have great references, a style I am happy and confident with, and I’m really excited about my new position working at a horse rescue. By NO MEANS do I feel like I am “above feedback” or like I don’t have things I need to learn, learning in this field happens daily and I welcome it. 

Being the new employee I expected and even welcomed the first few weeks being shown how “they” do things, getting the lay of the land and learning everyone’s ranks so to speak. My confidence is growing and I’ve been mostly enjoying the job a lot. 

A couple days a week I have to work with a particular shift leader that I really don’t enjoy; they tend to hover, expect me to work with the animals the exact same way they are doing it (even though our boss has stated, in front of us both, that everyone will have their own way of doing things), and I don’t respect the way they handle the animals. I don’t want to cause any issues as a new employee, but I’m ready to tell this shift leader to back off a little. On the other days I work I feel like I’m making great strides in my handling and training, and on the days I’m working with this person I feel so smothered and annoyed by how they try to make me do things that I feel like I can’t preform and would rather tap out and go do other duties. I should note this shift leader is young, in their early 20’s, and I’m about 10 years older than them. I have no problem with the age gap but they don’t seem to want to acknowledge or accept the level of experience I’m bringing to the table. Not to say I don’t believe they couldn’t have things to teach me, because they seem passionate and like they’ve been working with horses for their entire life, but they are treating me like a person totally new to the field. 

The other shift leader I work with has trust in my abilities, basically asks “do you want to try doing this and are you comfortable” and trusts that I will ask for a demonstration if I need one and then backs off and gives me a chance to do it the way I know how. She only gives necessary feedback, which I always find very helpful, and doesn’t nitpick. We use very similar training styles and get along great. I feel like a whole different person at work on those days. The days I’m with the offending shift leader I feel just checked out, give me the busy work so I can go off on my own and not have to work close with them. But then I’m missing out on my opportunities to do what I came here to do which is handle and train horses. 

I’m going on 3 weeks now and wonder if enough time has gone by for me to say something. Like, “you’re a very skilled trainer and handler; I appreciate all your feedback, but I am feeling smothered and incapable of showing what I’m capable of. I’d appreciate some space in the ring to use the methods and training style I’m happy with, and I’d be happy to hear your feedback at the end of the session”. 

This is a job where variations person to person are expected, we’ve all come here with different types of experience and no two people handle the animals exactly the same way so I’m ready to show them that I know what I’m doing and I’m not an inexperienced person that needs every thing commented on because we simply use two (almost opposite) styles and that’s ok."

1,2023-03-14,How can I safely ask for a salary higher than the advertised maximum?,u/ostracize,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11rb1vx/how_can_i_safely_ask_for_a_salary_higher_than_the/,jobs,"I work for a large organization and I am applying for a different position in a different department.

The job advertised is almost perfectly suited for my skillset (custom tailored?) so I have high confidence that I should be very highly considered for the position.

However, the maximum salary for this position is +30% higher than my current salary. I'm concerned that if offered the position, I will be offered +5% to +10% of my current salary. This is my best opportunity to command a higher salary so I don't want to let it pass. If I let them start anchoring at +5%, it will be very difficult to get +30%. I want to do whatever I can to get that +30% or higher. The position falls in the same employee group I'm already in, so there is definitely no flexibility on benefits/pension/flexible work location/etc. Salary is probably the only negotiating point to work with.

My thought was to try to anchor much higher very early on by requesting +50% and pretend I am ignorant of the advertised maximum salary. It's a number that is a significant jump for me but it's still within the realm of reason for the position. If it turns out there's some flexibility and they want me enough, then great, I get what I asked. However, if there is no flexibility, I don't want to be removed from consideration outright for someone else. I would just want to be offered something somewhere in the +25% to +30% range which I would still gladly accept.

HR people, interviewers, recruiters: How does one safely, but firmly, ""request"" a salary above the maximum?"

Simple question. Recently I requested an unpaid day off. I checked if the request had been approved, and it had, but it was now listed in my schedule as vacation time (paid). I was a little frustrated because I'd rather not have used a good chunk of my limited vacation time on that day, and our HR rep. didn't tell me they were going to switch it from UTO to PTO. Is that a normal thing? I've seen articles/posts about some employers requiring an employee to use PTO before they can use UTO, so maybe it's a normal thing.

The first two interviews I had were great and I also know that they were somewhat desperate for a hire. I’m in the same boat and desperate to get hired since I’ve been looking for 8 months and been unemployed for 1. My last job was toxic beyond comprehension with a manager that would threaten us, was investigated by HR 3 times, had a lawsuit due to some client issues that we took the fall for, mandatory OT with no PTO, etc.. I’m essentially trying to justify how bad could this job be?

The job has a salary range between 50k-60k, not sure if it’s salaried or hourly and I’m not sure how to ask or how to leverage myself to get a higher pay. I’m okay with the range itself because it’s more than what I made at my last job. 

Haven’t talked about the benefits but from reviews online it seems like a toss up. Some say great PTO, 401k match, and insurance, and some say otherwise. I never rly got around to asking because I wasn’t sure what part of the hiring process I was in and I didn’t want to ask too early.

How do I ask about all of this?"

Hey /jobs,

Last year, I landed a six-figure job without any college education. Recently, I've been pondering the idea of going back to school to improve my credentials and education. However, I'm struggling with the cost-benefit analysis.

My current salary falls within the pay band of my line of work, which is between 90k-180k. I'm making 140k, and pursuing a degree like an MBA would cost me at least 100k+ interest. The maximum gain I could get from obtaining this degree would be an additional 40k a year.

So, here's the dilemma - is it worth starting college from scratch at 28 years old, with an established career, and a minor compensation gain? I'd love to hear some thoughts and ideas from /jobs"

- 2 year rotational program, 6 months each rotation in different functions and roles
- High visibility with leaders in the company
- Multinational company, reporting to the global team while I’m based in my home country
- On my first rotation at one of their global plant
- Global team has been great but current placement team has been. . .meh?
- Spent first 2 months doing nothing &amp; had to run around asking people what to do/ where to get info as I was just given a project without any proper handover or guidance
- Don’t feel like I’m getting enough support from placement team, especially from ‘leaders’ who was supposedly assigned to me
- A colleague from a different location had similar issues as well during their rotation (currently on their second), worried that I will be facing the same issues with my next team
- Was told initially that there is a chance for relocation during program but when I asked my lead about this, they told me that there was no concrete plan yet (same colleague from above is now working with global team but remotely . . .so I’m a little bit disappointed 

New job

- 1 year contract (renewable)  for a fixed position
- Will be working with a senior colleague from previous company who I respect and admire
- 30% salary increase
- Relocate to a new city

A week after I handed in my notice, the global team told me that they were willing to match the salary that was offered by my new job which I didn’t expect as I haven’t even been in this program for long (less than 6 months)

Now I’m torn as I still feel like the program would be more beneficial for my career in the long-term, but, I’m not sure if I should spend another 3 months grasping at straws in my current placement &amp; hope for things to improve in the future rotations

Again, another solo gig.

I had some teamwork with the most recent job, but most of the time, I was working alone.

I was at this job for 8+ years. Now, I'm trying to get my foot in the door to get a WFH position with a company.

Hey all, I’m a long time non-profit director and manger that has been looking to transition into sales for a bit. 

My entire career I’ve been selling. Missions, agricultural product, wholesale accounts and program visions. I’m good at it. The problem is my industry often does not pay based on merit. It’s frustrating. I’ve fallen out of love with “passion” work and want something challenging and new. And also with high potential for earning. 

I’ve been applying to a good amount of sales gigs- some interviews, some interest and finally: I received an offer for a BDR role at a digital marketing company. 

The issue is, ironically, I’d be taking a pretty good , 1k less a month, base pay cut. However there is commission potential and it would be my first foot in the door into an industry that I’m intrigued by. 

I see a handful of posts on BDR positions here- can anyone tell me if 40k base with 15% commission and 8% recurring is a worthy entry level spot to be? 

It’s hard to weigh taking a step back in pay but I also know there is more potential in the long run. Anyone else make this jump? Have advice?

I have never seen something that sucked the life out of me like that. funny I did exactly what he asked of me to do and guess what he wasn't satisfied but if the girl does it everybody is like wow. Just words like ""you aren't doing it right, or leave it and go do something else. Apparently he fired me later on (I sent a text saying I won't be available, he saw it and ignored, I also called but he ignored I gave him time I did this multiple times) he gave me times I could call after work I said if he doesn't answer I should continue ringing. I asked twice and he said it was alright. Later on he said he didn't see the text or calls he now told his Servant simp to tell me I'm out. Dude was a fucking idiot whose been pissing me countless times but hey no one cares. It was a 2km walk for 6 days with just 1 day for yourself.

Previously, I have taken time off to travel and do the interviews, and often took calls either before work or during lunch breaks. When I started out I had all of the time in the world to take calls and interviews as it was my first job out of school/university.

My days are usually pretty full apart from lunch breaks so I was wondering how people fit in receiving calls from/making callbacks to recruiters and even at the interview stage without missing opportunities?

For example I would take time off but surely taking odd days raises suspicion with current employers? 

My previous boss was quite understanding when I got to the second stage for my current job and had to take time off in quick succession (I laid it out that I was looking to relocate anyway, regardless of the interview outcome) and I was feeling fairly confident I was going to get the role - and if I didn't then I was leaving anyway to make the job search even easier.

Right now I don't have that option - we're a single-income family so I have to balance looking for work alongside doing my day job. One plus is that I currently work from home for a majority of the time, so perhaps that will help?

TL:DR - How do you look for work alongside a full time job?"

It's for an office position basically directing employees around, day to day resort operations,filing paperwork, etc. The most exciting part is I would no longer be public facing. I have not signed the offer letter yet, as it states that it is contingent on passing a drug test. I live in a legal state and smoke marijuana every night to sleep, so I can not pass a full panel drug test honestly. Is there a polite way to ask if they are testing for it or would it be advised against completely? I don't want to put in my 2 weeks at my current job(it's going to immediately paint a target on my back) only to end up jobless because of a drug test at this new one. I know someone else who works in a way more physical area of the company and he(huge pot head) was never tested, so I'm not sure if it's just a deterrent for people on harder stuff. I'm open to stopping for 2 weeks to try to pass honestly, but it would be nice to know if its necessary.Any advice is appreciated, thank you!"
26,2023-03-14,How to gauge work-life balance in an interview?,u/CautiousMoment,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11rhd2e/how_to_gauge_worklife_balance_in_an_interview/,jobs,"I'm interviewing for a job at a company that, on paper, seems like it could be a really good fit in terms of my interests, job description, and salary/benefits expectations. The only thing I'm worried about is company culture. I read some reviews on Glassdoor that describe the company as ""fast-paced,"" and ""not a good place for lazy people."" I'm not a lazy person, but I do want to work someplace with a decent work-life balance (I don't mind working late every now and then, but generally prefer to work 9-5 and have my weekends/holidays to myself), and I'm worried these reviews could be a red flag, but I'm not sure.

Is there a way to ask about this in an interview without seeming lazy/unmotivated? Are there more subtle signs I should also watch out for?"

It’s a small business (listed as 10 employees on LI), so maybe it’s just that personal touch having the CEO message me. I applied to a posting on LinkedIn a while later. He messaged me again saying I need to submit a cover letter or else I won’t be considered. That’s fine, but I haven’t done one yet. Instead, I’ve been trying to get more info about the company. From some google searching, the only thing I can find are the LinkedIn account with the one job listing, the company’s website, and a profile on a site called SignalHire. As a location all I can find is the town, but no exact address. I also couldn’t find much else on the owner that didn’t sound regurgitated from the website. He’s supposedly has all these accolades, but I couldn’t anything before the founding of the company (2019). What I found was this: one or two mentions of being involved in a court case or two (lending his professional expertise as is required in the field); and an article written by a freelance writer that seems to be painting the CEO in a heroic and compassionate light as he exonerates a convicted man using his expertise. ( and Idk maybe I’m just judging too hard, but the freelance writer’s article felt like it was written like a high schooler’s book report to me.) Also, I tried finding more info on the other three employees listed on the website but again found nothing. No LinkedIn, no Facebook, no nothing. Am I just being paranoid and should just follow through or does this sound like a fake company to anyone else? Seemed like a cool job which drew me in, but I’m getting weird vibes from the lack of information. I am getting really tired of having to do all this research due to all of the scamming out there…"

I'm a young guy, mid 20s. My previous role within my company was a lower position with a HUGE workload. I was working ~70 hours a week for maybe 3-4 years.

Then my company cut all OT across the board and gave me a promotion. It was under the table, I still have the same title I did before, but now my workload is substantially lower and I have more ""responsibilities"". I was making ~$1,500-2,000 a week. Now I'm lucky if I make $1,000.

Let me put it this way; the other people in the same position in my company are making $30+ an hour and I'm not making anywhere near that. Im also the youngest person at my company by a pretty big margin.

We've also had a lot of changes in leadership and newer members above everyone seem a little eager to hand out write ups and move employees around to lower positions. I'm probably the only one they have left completely alone cause I don't fuck anything up. But ive gotten some hollow threats for some real stupid shit, almost like they got nothing else on me and want to flex.

Now I'm in a tough spot.

It seems like they've transitioned everyone's position from a career to a job, essentially making everyone easy to replace.

I get along well with everyone and my superiors often consult me for help.

The thing is, if I'm being honest, my job is extremely easy now compared to before. I get to manage my own small team. The way I run things, while I need to monitor things frequently, its fairly autonomous. I'm not breathing down anyone's back. I'm not micromanaging anyone. As long as my people get their job done and don't fuck anything up, I leave them alone. And they like me for it.

In fact, on average I probably really do like 15 mins of real work an hour. Sometimes I do 2 hours worth of work in 1 hour, but that's maybe one or two days a week.

The rest of the week I kinda just chill. Sit in my phone, talk shit with some of my team. Invent new shit to keep us occupied when it's slow. My superiors leave me a lot of autonomy, and I've done a lot to extend that to my team. The only time they really talk to me is when other teams fuck something up and they remind me not to fuck up the same shit, which I don't.

I'm just worried about losing my job, and I'm worried if I don't lose my job I'll stagnate and stay here forever.

To put it specifically I'll give you an analogy. Let's put this in the context of me working construction. I used to be a union worker, now I'm a foreman.

But internally I'm not recognized as a foreman, still a lower level union worker. Everyone treats me as foreman, even my bosses and my bosses bosses, but I'm not technically one.

So I guess my job is extremely easy, for me at least. And it worries me. Should I stay here? Should I try and use this to my advantage and apply for a real leadership job with much higher pay before I get the axe? If so, what should I actually apply for? I dropped out of college and have experience in a lot of things, but a I'm more of a jack of all trades and a master of none.

Should I just continue to ride the easy train?"

So I’ve been with my employer for almost 2 years. The 6 months of my job, was crazy busy, as I was the only person for my role. After some time they hired 2 more people to provide me assistance. The workload was perfectly balanced. We were all able to stay on top of our tasks &amp; even manage to have a little downtime sometimes. 

I took 6 weeks off; the time off was approved by my manager &amp; my director. After my vacation ended on new years, and I returned to work. Upon my return, I’ve noticed that our department has been slow &amp; I’ve been experiencing more down time at work. The slowdown got worse right when Russia decided to invade Ukraine. 
In fact there are days, where I’ll have for like 15 to 30 mins &amp; then I’m done for the day. 

My coworkers are experiencing the same issue, but they don’t face it as much as I do. 
This has been going on for almost 15 months now. It’s has now gotten to a point where I’m actually bored of my role. 

I do understand, the economy is slow &amp; my employer has been affected by inflation &amp; the economic downturn. But I am wondering, if maybe my managers are not assigning me work on purpose or maybe our department is impacted &amp; they’re not able to assign me any work. 

There is a hiring freeze at our company, so we don’t need to worry about layoffs for now. Should I just start looking for another job? 

Thank you."

- Everyone is paid the same by the hour, despite their positions and work. An assistant manager is paid the same rate as a cashier. But it is just slightly above minimum wage at least.

- the first 2 months working here, they've only been giving me 3-4 hour shifts once a week. I felt happy-go-damn lucky to even get two shifts a week, crazy happy to pick up anyone's shifts (though they won't let me take shifts any longer than 5 hours).

I asked one of my assistant managers about it and they said I apparently have to ""earn"" it, practically prove myself that I deserve more hours by working harder. I honestly don't know if this is what ""full-time"" looks like.

I've started looking for new jobs because of these two characteristics, my family's been telling me to quit too. I've been really busting it hard these past two months, and no results besides just a ton of verbal praise from my managers. I'm now understanding why everyone who started at the same time as me has quit already haha...

I recently received a job offer that I am more than happy with. I am about to graduate college, and the proposed start date was a week after graduation. I have prior planned family commitments in early June, so I negotiated with them, and got my start date pushed back by about 3 weeks. When I discussed this with my potential manager, he was very understanding and it seemed like it wasn’t a big deal. He made a point that he wanted to make sure he hired the right person (made it very clear it was me), as opposed to someone who can start right away. I then received a new offer letter with an updated start date, and signed it.

However, the next day, I received a call from someone higher up in the company I had not spoken to before. He said I was a great candidate, but he wasn’t okay with my later start date due to fast growth of the company. He gave me a counteroffer: start working part time now (during my last semester of college), be brought on full time as soon as I graduate, and then deal with my family commitments on PTO. 

It’s a fair offer if they really do need someone to come on asap, however I am a bit thrown off by the inconsistency of the situation. How was my (to be) boss completely fine with me moving my start date, HR and the HM I talked to also fine with it (to the point of receiving a revised letter), but someone more senior retroactively not okay with it? I understand that at the end of the day, maybe there was simply a miscommunication, but is that a larger indication of how culture and organization play out at this company? Curious and open to hear all thoughts."

So yesterday I have been put on PIP and after reading up on it, it sounds like it's almost definitive that they will get rid of me. I worked at this company for 8 months as a data analyst, before I had an apprenticeship for 3 and half years as a data analyst but it wasn't really an analyst role they just made me churn reports. Because of that when I joined this new company and I was given way more responisbilites than just churning reports I cracked and struggled. Additionally it was a very different industry which was quite complex and not something I was passionate about. I was very determined and always communicated that I wanted more support but me and my manager weren't a good fit.

What should I do? 
I feel terrified, I really wanted to stay in this company to upskill myself. I feel very disappointed and let down and scared for the future. Will this affect me getting a new job? 

I have savings to survive but those savings were a deposit I was saving up for a mortgage and I would hate to eat in to those.

Any advice would be great.
Thank you."

Good Morning Crew. 

LONG LONG POST AND I AM SO VRY SORRY... 

My husband and I both work full time. We bring home OK money. We can survive on the money we bring home, but thats litereally all we can do..   
My husband and I have not been out to dinner, or celebrated anniversary, each others birthdays, even bought each other Christmas presents in quite some time. We make enough to survive, and take care of the kids and their extra curricular activities..  

I have been at my current employer for a little over 5 years. I have been loyal and a strong employee ever since I started. I have an extremely strong work eithic, and sometimes go TO over and beyond (they have even told me this before). However, they just refuse to pay their employees very well. Mcdonalds is almost starting off at what I am making... BUT..... I have the most ""cushy"" job probably EVER... I work from home.. Monday through Friday 730am till 330pm. No weekends and no holidays. I know that people would kill to have a job like mine, and I do not take it for granted... 

with that being said, LIFE is happening to my family right now, we need to replace the roof, repair or replace the AC. Which together is over 20k by its-self. We are looking at adding an addtl. $250-$300 a month for the next 11 years to be able to afford to replace the roof, which I HAVE to do for my homeowners insurance..   
I have recently been looking for second jobs, or a source to make extra m oney and everything falls through. 

Now, to my actual question.. My brothers girlfriend works for Verizon, actually a retail store for Verizon. Its commision based, however you also get an hourly rate... (Which is only a dollar less then what I am making) the hourly rate or commision which ever is higher... However, she brought home almost $8,000 last month alone. She claimed 74k on her taxes last year. This is almost TRIPLE what my husband and I COMBINED bring home..   
I am really good at people, and selling things.. I am very outgoing and bubbly, I know that I would literally ""kill"" it. but, I am trading in my M-F day shift for random shifts.. I can work evenings, weekends, holidays, etc. but I would be able to financially provide for the family. I am honestly stuck... I love my time with my kids, I love my weekends off, BUT.. This isnt saying that I would NEVER get that time.. ya know.. there are plenty of mothers who work random shifts like this and raise their children just fine.. This could be potentially life changing... but thats my issues.. I am comfortable where I am at, but they dont issues raises, and if they do its MAX 3% which is only like .50 cents. So each year, I get MAYBE 20 cent raise after taxes..   
Now, I also live in Florida... where a carton of eggs is like $10! we spend almost $500 ALONE for food each month. Our Mortgage went up because of Insurance.. Everything is going up besides my pay.. 

Does anyone have suggestions that might help me make this decision? I feel like I am having to choose between financially providing for my family or seeing them... 

My thoughts:   
With me making much more money, We could actually take vacations and stuff. I could spend time with them in other ways.   
We could pay off our debt quicker and not live such a strapped life..   
My current job, I am at the max position I can go.. I have literally capped out.. I will only make a few cents more an hour for the rest of my life doing exactly what I am doing.. With the new position I could potentially move up to Management and so on,.. My cousin works for Verizon and he started on the floor, he now oversees multiple things from home.. He works from home.. Now it obviously took him several years to get there.. but its possible. I have spent 5 years already with the company im at and they are so unappreciative.. I have had to FIGHT for every raise I got... and I am one of their top employees ( I am not tooting my own horn) I have been on zoom calls with the CEO because she wanted my opinion.. I have covered as acting director for several months while they found a director to put in that spot.. and I was just the receptionist.. I was not management of any kind... But they recognized my value... but they don't want to pay me for that.. I switched positions to be at home.. no pay raise.. but less wear and tear on my car, less gas ect..

The job was advertised as hybrid. I emailed HR during the application process and enquired what the wfh arrangements were if they were willing to consider a highly skilled candidate whom wants no more than 2 days in the office and 3 days wfh due to disabilty. HR said that was fine, and I proceeded with the application.


Yesterday I had my interview with 3 staff members (direct manager, department head and a HR person) I enquired about wfh with this HR staff member saying I had spoken to name and discussed a hybrid arrangement. I got the feeling they wanted a more in office presence than I had discussed. I explained I'm happy to come in for meetings and training etc but the HR person mentioned the needs of the business and I might be able to ""take it easy wfh"" on less busy days and the role sounds more high pressured than they let on.


So if I get offered the role, or in the future when I do get offered a role how best to negotiate politely and agree to a wfh hybrid arrangement? 


WFH does allow me to work around my disabilty better so how to make sure a job offer includes this?"

What is seriously deterring me from working at the homeless shelter is that there seems to be conflict that I would have to resolve; as in physical fights. \~ "

Good Morning Crew.

LONG LONG POST AND I AM SO VRY SORRY...

My husband and I both work full time. We bring home OK money. We can survive on the money we bring home, but thats litereally all we can do..  
My husband and I have not been out to dinner, or celebrated anniversary, each others birthdays, even bought each other Christmas presents in quite some time. We make enough to survive, and take care of the kids and their extra curricular activities..

I have been at my current employer for a little over 5 years. I have been loyal and a strong employee ever since I started. I have an extremely strong work eithic, and sometimes go TO over and beyond (they have even told me this before). However, they just refuse to pay their employees very well. Mcdonalds is almost starting off at what I am making... BUT..... I have the most ""cushy"" job probably EVER... I work from home.. Monday through Friday 730am till 330pm. No weekends and no holidays. I know that people would kill to have a job like mine, and I do not take it for granted...

with that being said, LIFE is happening to my family right now, we need to replace the roof, repair or replace the AC. Which together is over 20k by its-self. We are looking at adding an addtl. $250-$300 a month for the next 11 years to be able to afford to replace the roof, which I HAVE to do for my homeowners insurance..  
I have recently been looking for second jobs, or a source to make extra m oney and everything falls through.

Now, to my actual question.. My brothers girlfriend works for Verizon, actually a retail store for Verizon. Its commision based, however you also get an hourly rate... (Which is only a dollar less then what I am making) the hourly rate or commision which ever is higher... However, she brought home almost $8,000 last month alone. She claimed 74k on her taxes last year. This is almost TRIPLE what my husband and I COMBINED bring home..  
I am really good at people, and selling things.. I am very outgoing and bubbly, I know that I would literally ""kill"" it. but, I am trading in my M-F day shift for random shifts.. I can work evenings, weekends, holidays, etc. but I would be able to financially provide for the family. I am honestly stuck... I love my time with my kids, I love my weekends off, BUT.. This isnt saying that I would NEVER get that time.. ya know.. there are plenty of mothers who work random shifts like this and raise their children just fine.. This could be potentially life changing... but thats my issues.. I am comfortable where I am at, but they dont issues raises, and if they do its MAX 3% which is only like .50 cents. So each year, I get MAYBE 20 cent raise after taxes..  
Now, I also live in Florida... where a carton of eggs is like $10! we spend almost $500 ALONE for food each month. Our Mortgage went up because of Insurance.. Everything is going up besides my pay..

Does anyone have suggestions that might help me make this decision? I feel like I am having to choose between financially providing for my family or seeing them...

My thoughts:  
With me making much more money, We could actually take vacations and stuff. I could spend time with them in other ways.  
We could pay off our debt quicker and not live such a strapped life..  
My current job, I am at the max position I can go.. I have literally capped out.. I will only make a few cents more an hour for the rest of my life doing exactly what I am doing.. With the new position I could potentially move up to Management and so on,.. My cousin works for Verizon and he started on the floor, he now oversees multiple things from home.. He works from home.. Now it obviously took him several years to get there.. but its possible. I have spent 5 years already with the company im at and they are so unappreciative.. I have had to FIGHT for every raise I got... and I am one of their top employees ( I am not tooting my own horn) I have been on zoom calls with the CEO because she wanted my opinion.. I have covered as acting director for several months while they found a director to put in that spot.. and I was just the receptionist.. I was not management of any kind... But they recognized my value... but they don't want to pay me for that.. I switched positions to be at home.. no pay raise.. but less wear and tear on my car, less gas ect.. These are other things I will be giving up... but its just so hard to say no to that kind of money when were literally doggy paddling ya know??

GTA is an adventure company that has expeditions for students to gain field research experience. I have to pay for my flight there, and then $3000 for the expedition. 

I guess what I’m wondering, is this a legit internship, or am I basically paying to go on a vacation? I’m wondering how serious they are about conducting research, and how well it would actually look on a resume. 

A couple suspicions I have:

1) the google reviews are from other students who did the expedition and said there was a nice work and play balance
2) our work is supposed to be published, but they make no mention of where they’re actually publishing 
3) I can’t even find other internships I have to pay for

I started at a new company about 6 months ago, and at this point it is clear to me that it isn't a good fit. There was no onboarding, I was immediately given huge projects, and there is no clear workflow or communication structure. I get along with my boss and coworkers, but I have only met them once in-person as the job is fully remote and we all live in different parts of the country.

Now, I am looking for new jobs and contracts and am a little worried about having a reference ready for any new positions. I do get along with everyone I work with, but I have only ever worked closely with 1 other person on my team. We're in the middle of a big project, so I am pretty sure they wouldn't love it if I told them I was applying for jobs and needed them as a reference.

Have any of you had success using references from your old employer rather than your current employer when looking for jobs? I worked for my old company for a little over 4 years and had a lot of success there. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!"

I just started this role at a local college ad a career navigator for students. It's grant funded at 44k a year, 401k, medical for my wife and I at 266 a month,  with 4 pto days  and paid time off for school breaks/ closings. I've been there since Feb 6th. With no training and having to go between to different campuses each week.

Potential job is working Hr for the county. I would potentially make 1k less but I feel as if the room for growth is greater there. More pto days and all 401k the works. 

My coworkers at my current job have been there as long as 2 years with no raise but we continually get asked to do more work. For example, I'm responsible for finding internships, for 30+ students and counting. I have a caseload of ,330+ other students who I'm responsible for helping find work or the school loses money. I'm the new guy so I have to be at two campuses 4 days (830-530) a week as well as working from home on Fridays (for now). 

I'm afraid (even though I'm new). That this job could be a dead end unless I'm able to find a new position in the college after my 10 month probation period. 

Biggest downside is we're closing on a house in April which would drop my commute from 2hrs a day to 20 mins. But it could even be as short as 5 mins a day with the new job. 

What would you guys do?"

I told him I'd be interested in working where he works since it more aligns with my skills and there are opportunities for growth. My current position is great for someone starting out in IT or someone holding onto the job at the end of their career- not necessarily for someone trying to grow and learn new skills. Well, the friend put my name in at his place and they contacted me for an interview. I was offered a job 2 days later and accepted. The pay is actually 1k less than I make now but there is growth options at the new place and a  promotion is almost guaranteed after 4-6 months at the service desk position. 

Turned in my resignation letter the day after accepting my offer and my boss scrambled to find out if there was anyway of keeping me. We discussed roles and a potential new IT role getting created that would cover my current duties but also give me some of what they do so that I have projects to grow into and different areas of interest to learn. I'm not entirely sold but I do really enjoy my workplace culture and everyone there. They are offering me 10k more than what I am and will be making at the other job so I'm unsure if I should take the counter offer and new position, or take a chance with the new place and not see that kind of salary for at least a year or two. I'd also be burning the bridge with this new place and wouldn't probably get considered in the future. 

How would you guys handle this?"

I went and interviewed for a job today and landed it at 17/h but will be 18/h after 90 days. This new employer is day shifts, almost always 8 hour days, and very family friendly. It’s a small company and the work to me seems more up my ally.

So for context, I'm going to graduate May 2023 and my friend referred me to this job. The interview went well, and over a phone call, they've offered an internship until I graduate and then a fulltime position after I graduate. The salary was listed as a huge range (33k to 83k) for the full time position, and the internship is paid (though I don't know how much).

Do I negotiate salary after the internship when I receive the written offer or do I ask now?

Someone told me that mentoring junior employees could lead to quick layoffs. –meaning I will be replaced by my mentees. I was unsure if it was true. However, I do not mind hearing the reality of job marketing.

To tell you myself, I am currently looking for a job. I never had mentors, and I learned everything by myself. I took pride in being a self-learner. Whenever I got an interview, some interviewers requested me to teach ~~them~~ some particular skills to the junior developers or analysts in their company. –I felt uncomfortable to hear that.

Once you finish mentoring them, will you get laid off quickly? If not, how could the company keep a mentor or employee longer?

Since then, I've applied to 170 jobs over the last three months, focusing on roles in finance and data analytics. Unfortunately, current circumstances limit me to remote roles as I live in the figurative middle-of-nowhere, which has only increased the competition I face for these positions.

I've networked and built out multiple resumes and I've only gotten one real interview to show for it. I happened to get a call which led to a contract offer in bankruptcy noticing and claims, paperwork and sending emails to the right people. It pays 50k, which is well-above cost of living in my area, but still feels like a slap after my internship hire offer of 95k. More importantly, I feel this is a dead-end job based on what I've learned - talking to current employees there seems to be little-to-no mobility, even if picked up to be a full-time employee. 

My concern is that this role feels very irrelevant to my degree and the work I want to do. By taking the job, I may be taking care of my family right now, but I am concerned it may harm my ability to build a future career in data and finance.

I'm a Freshman in High School, so obviously I have a lot of restrictions on getting jobs and how long I can work. Long story short, theres a grocery store really close to my house that pays amazing ($16 per hour), but they aren't hiring my age right now just because they have enough. But, I'm a goody-two shoes with connections to those who hire (the lady is best friends with my grandma) and I'm the first one they will consider when they start to hire again (I don't really understand the process). However, I really need money, as with everything getting even more expensive, things are becoming difficult at home and I want to help out by being able to by my own things and give my parents what I don't save or use (college!!), and I really cannot wait anymore right now. So I want to apply to another job, however if a spot opens at the grocery store, I wanna jump on that job asap. How bad would it be if I dropped one job for another in less then an year (lets say 4 months because I'm optimistic). I don't want to be rude to the owners because a smaller place might be better for this situation, but I doubt any place I go to will be better than this one for more reasons than I have listed.

TLDR: I'm waiting for this one job to open so I can get it (I have about a 95% change of landing it), but I need to start getting money now and cannot wait. Is it okay to work somewhere for a few months before leaving and going to the other place?"

I also hold people leadership roles in some volunteer work I do, but that involves working with youth, so the dynamics are obviously different compared to leading grown adults.

What are some recommendations to successfully transitioning into this type of role? Supervisor would be the lowest level people leadership role my company has (lower than manager), so it's a good way to get my feet wet in this type of role.

One of them was with a boutique firm, and one was with a massive multinational firm. The position I was interviewing for with the big firm was technically a paid internship ($22 an hour) that translated into a full-time role after two months. The position with the smaller firm was a full-time job. The smaller firm is well-known but arguably less prestigious than the big firm.

I just got two offers today. The big firm offered me the internship at $22 an hour, but the small firm offered a full-time position with a 100k base salary, 10% target bonus, and a 10k signing bonus. I was really not expecting those numbers (and I feel extremely, extremely lucky).

There is somewhat of a catch: the big firm's hours are (purportedly) way better (the small firm apparently works people like crazy), and the work the big firm does is somewhat more high-brow and related to my interests. The big firm has a much larger office, way better PTO, and much better remote work flexibility.

Is there any sense at all in trying to negotiate a full-time offer out of the big firm?  Would that even work? Or am I being crazy here, and should just accept the 100k offer?

I completed 181 credit hours with a 3.4 cumulative GPA. I feel like this ought to count for something because I dedicated so much time and money to it. I know I'm at least somewhat capable of making it in life. The fact that I'm in this stage at 30 years old feels like an even bigger insult to injury.  


I have been freelance writing for almost three years now. So far, it's mostly been blogs related to insurance. I earn about $10K/year doing this. Despite this experience, I'm completely lost when it comes to WordPress, Microsoft Office, and the like. I have an idea of how SEO works, but I can't claim to be proficient in it. I'm also on a site that rhymes with ""lonely cans"", but I worry that I've shot myself in the foot by posting clothing-optional pictures with my face in them. I've posted a lot of dirty pictures of myself on social media, also with my face in them, and now I'm starting to regret it. I make like $20 a week from ""lonely cans"".  


My only other work experience has been retail, which I've done from 2014 to 2022. I worked at a grocery store first, then a retail supplement chain as a salesman (that job shut down before Christmas last year). I don't want to work in retail anymore. I don't want to be embarrassed to tell people what I do for a living. Plus, working retail is extra humiliating when I see people I went to high school and college with come in the store. It's no longer an option for me, and I'm not paying $40,000 in student loans just to make $12 an hour.   


Also - I'm limited to local and remote jobs. I have epilepsy, so I can't drive on the interstate. I can't afford to have another near-death experience, as I'm still paying medical bills to this day (and yes, I have insurance).  


What should I be doing to get a good job with the experience I have and the situation I'm in? I want to be more respected and earn a decent living."

This girl we will call Katie won’t stop telling me what to do when I already know. I try to speak up for myself but I just freeze up then feel it’s to late to say anything. I’m thinking about quitting because this place is hardly professional anyway.

(I work at a doggy daycare and boarding place)

Katie and I are both generally new but I started 2 weeks before she did. She is on her second week and is telling the new girls that started after she did that she’s been here for a month and bossing them around too. 

The manager definitely favors her for some reason and I’m guessing it’s because they have a lot in common. Since Katie and I are generally new we still both make tiny mistakes that the manager would prefer if we did them her way. Every time Katie does something the manager would prefer she do differently, its completely fine. If I do something the manager would prefer I do differently, she sends me outside with the dogs immediately and makes Katie take my place. She also asked Katie to train a new girl on her 3rd day which didn't make sense to me. 

I feel like I do a lot around here. I do lots of things without the manager even asking and when I'm inside, I make sure to keep up with my duties (the dishes, laundry, mopping pee and cleaning poo and making sure the dogs have water).
When Katie is inside she gets nothing done and mainly just talks to the manager which results in us getting out late. Another thing that pisses me off is the fact that Katie never has to go outside with the dogs. All of the other coworkers are forced to stay outside and watch the dogs for our whole shift. Which for me, Ive been working 12 hour shifts the past 3 weeks. When Katie does go outside, its to cover someone so they can go on break. While shes out there, she never picks up any poo which builds up and the sun makes it hard therefore it’s hard to scoop. 

She comes in the same time I do and while I’m trying to do something like feed dogs their breakfast or make breakfast she’s always tasking me with other things that end up making my manager upset because she isn’t aware that Katie is bossing me around so my manager thinks im doing it on my own. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I can’t talk to my manager about it because she dosent like me and snaps on me all the time.

EDIT: I wrote this as i’m sitting watching dogs but I literally just heard Katie tell one of the new girls “If that dog is giving you problems, smack the shit out of it” I went and asked the girl if I heard her right and she said that is definitely what she said. WHAT THE F***"

I have really good relationships with everyone above me, including the Senior VP, due to both my work and personality. Knowing that I had a performance review coming up, I decided to seek out recruiters/headhunters to know my current market value. Despite exceeding expectations, they were going to give me a 2% raise. I mentioned the headhunters' conversations &amp; salaries and countered with a 15% raise, which exceed the pay band by about 9%, in addition to fast-track July promotion (higher title + salary). Took them a week to get SVP and HR approval. Got everything I wanted and more (they offer to give me $10k on top of everything else if I stay until July 2024 and another $10k until July 2025; the contract is not binding, I just don't get it if I leave.) **Everything is documented and on paper.**

I will most likely stay until July 2023 to get the fast-track promotion. I'm just wondering how I should talk about the 15% raise to recruiters/employers. On one hand, it shows that I demonstrated so much values added that I get a lot of bargaining leverage. On the other hand, it shows that I might do this to future employers (looking to jump job and/or ask for raises more often than the norm/review cycle.) Any thought or insight is appreciated."

Not sure if this is appropriate but I was recently searching for remote jobs, I live in the States, and I saw one being advertised from New Zealand. It’s a sizable construction company. So I applied and thought “Oh what the hell” Well they ended up reaching out to me and I ended up having an interview via Signal, which is a discreet messaging app. I felt it was odd but went with it as we are opposite sides of the globe. So it was all through text message via the Signal app. No video or anything. The interview was at 8am central standard time in the states and NZ is 18+ hours ahead. So the HR person I was speaking with was up at 1-2 am. So it’s giving me red flags all over. 
Well I ended up getting a job offer but I haven’t met face to face with anyone yet. It’s strictly remote. They mentioned that I’ll meet with the team during training. 
So does this seem normal? It seems too good to be true, but this company is real and is located in NZ.

I don't have great social skills outside work either, to be honest, but it was definitely hard for me, especially at the beginning. I mean, I did improve as time went by, and I learned how to communicate better with my coworkers- if I needed help, or if I made a mistake somewhere or whatever, but I don't think my communication skills improved to the point it should be. 

I don't know if I should say this in the interview, I'm worried this is one of those answers that makes them reject me, but I can't think of a better one"

I got a job offer for one and am waiting to see if I’ll be selected for a second interview for the other one. Either way, I feel really good about my chances and the value I bring to both teams. 

I’m a marketing major and haven’t had too much experience in the field other than volunteering positions, for reference. I would like to pursue the career out of college. 

However, I’m at a crossroads between these two companies and would like some guidance.

This first company is larger and more well known, so that’s a pro, it also pays more and they pride themselves on a low attrition rate and would most likely invite me back for a second internship if I do well in the position. However, the internship would be a field I have no experience in (Merchandising Control) and I’m not sure how applicable it would be if I wanted to pivot to Marketing in the future. 

The second company is smaller, but still impressive. It’s a company I truly use in my day to day life and overall I’m more excited about this opportunity. This internship is in my desired field (Marketing). However, I’m unsure if there would be any opportunities for growth outside of the internship or if I would be invited back for a second internship - assuming I do a good job and am offered a position. Also, it pays a good amount less than the first internship.

This is my first real career kickstarting summer internship, so I’m really thinking about this decision. My biggest dilemma: Should I go for an internship pertaining to my degree? Any guidance on this situation is greatly appreciated."

She doesn't know I've applied prior to us speaking and told me to apply on company website instead; I withdrew my Indeed application shortly after.

I'm sure my information is still in the ATS but hoping that I'll get by via technicalities since I'm reapplying on a different medium/website this time around. I want to address why I'm reapplying to the hiring manager, so I was wondering if a) I should ask for permission to resubmit via email then reapply on the site OR b) resubmit first then explain in the email?

Also, should I reapply with the same email as my first application or utilize another?

Any advice would help because I'm not too sure what angle to pursue this at so thank you in advance!"

I used to work in a chiropractic office that was very, very busy. There were three doctors on staff, oftentimes all three were there, and each appointment slot could hold 3 or 4 appointments for different people for the same doctor. So we were literally always behind because they obviously can’t see 3-4 people at the same time. Just… very busy. 

When I first hired on, I worked in the back with the patients, starting them on their therapies, etc. It was, again, utter chaos, but I loved being able to connect with the patients. After a few months, they wanted to train me on front desk so I could be cross trained. I’d worked reception before, and I work it now, but it was a different system. The one person in the front who was supposed to train me wasn’t able to as she was always busy with a patient in front of her, or busy with one on the phone. I did not receive ANY training on the system. I was fumbling through trying to figure out how to book appointments while checking out multiple patients at a time. 

The same week my position was changed, I was let go for not catching on to the new position fast enough.

Now, I’d really like to be in a position with hands on patient care again. And I don’t mind the admin. Ideally, I’m looking for medical assistant positions, patient care tech/associate positions, etc. I know I’m good at these things. I know that I am passionate about patient care, and I know that I can learn new EHR systems and whatnot as long as I’m given the opportunity to actually see it and learn how it works. I have a few interviews coming up and I’d like to prepare. So my question is… how do I address being let go of a job, when it’s the one that’s most related to other jobs that I’m currently applying for? And without slandering the other company?

TLDR: I used to work as a chiropractic assistant but they moved me to front desk. They didn’t train me *at all* and fired me at the end of the week for not catching on to the new EHR. I am now applying for patient care/medical assistant positions, and I have a couple interviews lined up. How do I address being fired from the one job on my resume that is most similar to the jobs I’m applying to?"

I've applied to almost 40 different retail positions during this time and I keep getting rejection after rejection. I've worked in retail for 3 years throughout my time in college, but left my last job due to poor management (it was way too stressful compared to where I was used to working). I landed one interview and made it three rounds in to only be faced with an incredibly unprofessional and rude hiring manager. Mid Interview, he kept texting while I was talking and wouldn't make eye contact with me. Safe to say I don't think I landed the job despite the associate managers liking me. 

I've hopped around in between jobs due to moving and I can only imagine this could be a reason I keep getting rejected. In the past, I've had no issues with landing a job but this time around it has become extremely discouraging because i'm getting rejections from places like Ross and Starbucks. If I could gain any insight or tips on how to make myself seem more appealing in the system, I'd greatly appreciate it."

Does it need a diagnosis and symptoms/effects or just ""mental health"" or whatever?) but I'd rather keep quiet as much as possible. How do you start an email? What do you say? I'm assuming I can just send it to HR and they'll take care of informing other people? My job is all physical and doesn't have any sort of projects or work to transfer or hand over to other people.

And what do you say if you don't have a set date of return, more of a ""wait and see"" type of plan?

I don't know what I'm doing. Help? (I live in Canada.)"

I have a friend who is autistic and homeless. Although she has no qualifications or work experience at all (barely finished highschool), she's wanting to get an online/remote job so she can get back on her feet again. I support her decision fully! Everytime I see her in the public library we chat and I perceive her to be really educated and well informed, I listened to her speaking english, spanish, she's learning finnish by using the public library computers(\*) and even speaks japanese. She's super smart, there's no doubt about. And also she's very good with computers and technology. I understand that autism can be a reason why she's not accepted in local jobs, and also a reason why she can't cope with normal work environments. I understand she has a lot of potential, and I wish that she finds a remote job and starts earning money soon, she deserves it because she's most loving and super smart.I have no idea how to help her, so I ask everyone on this subreddit, I need advice, so she can find a job, earn some money and rent a room before winter comes.Do you know about remote job opportunities that require no experience and no qualifications? Would you share information or a link?

Thank you so much for helping me help her.

(\*) EDIT: She has access to laptops, computers, internet, headsets, webcams and everything needed to access an online job and perform efficiently. The University public library gives that access. So she just needs the job opportunity, and I'm going to help her find that opportunity, somehow. I just need your advice or useful information and links to job opportunities, please abstain from prejudging her as a common homeless person. She's homeless, but she's resourceful. She's not a junkie, not a hobo, not a beggar. She's the most educated homeless woman I've ever seen in my life. She's also looking online for remote job opportunities as of now, but she only stumbles with job offers that require prior experience. She's not your average homeless woman, and I know she will find the right job for her online, somehow.

EDIT 2: We are from Uruguay, a country which does not care about homeless people and which has a very corrupt government, full of crooks and thieves draining taxpayer money to keep their high society standards.... So as you can see, no government support available, unfortunately. We gotta find her a job on our own! And we'll do so! 

EDIT 3: She's currently spending a couple of hours each day to find an online job opportunity, so she'll eventually find it, but because all the job offers require prior experience, I thought it would be smart if I also search for remote job opportunities in my spare time,  and also I decided to post here so the optimistic, positive and resourceful users can also help me find her a job."

I applied for a job last week and got an email within a couple of days from the recruiter who scheduled me with who is being replaced.

She informed me who the next interview would be with and let me know HR would tell me if I was moving on in the process.

The recruiter got back to me the same day and let me know that my first interviewer ""really enjoyed"" our conversation and would like to schedule me for the next interview (this coming Friday). She also listed out who else I would be interviewing with in advance (there's two more interviews after my second that's scheduled this coming Friday). Assuming my interviews go well, should I take these as good signs? I've never had a recruiter give me the entire interview schedule in advance."

* It's terrible for privacy
* The website is always slow and laggy
* Job recommendations are often not relevant
* Many jobs are spam/scams
* Unless you spend time optimizing a profile, it won't get many views
* Lots of recruiters waste time
* The main feed is full of posts that are not worth reading
* Companies don't even hire the people that use easy apply

My background is a mix of business and higher education administration.  I've had a few interviews, but haven't been offered anything yet -- I think because I don't have a lot of direct student-facing experience.  The other problem is, there's very few colleges that pay well enough to make it even worth applying for (I'm in California btw).  Most jobs in education pay terrible, and I need a bare minimum of 60K to just get by so adjunct positions are out of the question.

Any ideas for how I could use this degree and experience in other fields? Keep in mind that I am NOT a licensed counselor, but do have specialized training in trauma-informed care.  I like working one-on-one with people and I've been a student mentor for a while in a volunteer role.  I want to do something I love, but still need to make a reasonable living and pay my mortgage.

I had an interview for a server and a very nice pub in the city on Friday. It went really well and the interviewer was full of jokes. I got excited but tried not to get my hopes up. He told me I was one of the strongest candidates but didn’t want to get me too hyped. I did have serving experience of about a year and a half, but that was five years ago.

About 200 people applied to the job. He called me last night, but I missed the call, called back 10 minutes later and he wasn’t in, so I left a message with another server. 

Didn’t hear from him in the morning so I called him around 3:30. He said oh hey, we tried to find your resume and couldn’t it. We’d love to have you in about a week or two for a shift and see how it goes. They’re busy right now because of St Patrick’s Day.

He also texted me afterwards to make sure we had each others number.

Does this seem fine? I told absolutely no one about this job because I didn’t want to deal if I got rejected. But I’ve started telling people now. Is this normal? Am I overthinking?"

Now the people at this place are sending messages like ""Where are you?"" (It's a remote part-time position.. unpaid once again....) Overall, this supervisor's tone has been offputting. Especially considering there was no guarantee I would receive a 9-5 after working on this project. Should I talk to the CEO before leaving and be honest with them, or would you tell them I no longer have the time?

What do?

I have only been here for about two months. 

I recently heard that my company is hiring more people for our team, and I was shocked because things have been slowing down in the office and with the state of the economy, there's always a risk it could get much worse. Even though there's not many projects to pass around at the moment, this has led to believe that possibly my company might start laying people off. 

In my past experience, when my companies ran out of work people usually get let go or get replaced to do a two or three person job. I am worried that it might start with me, because I am the newest person here and also the youngest and earliest in my career. I am dreading that perhaps I am going to get replaced or laid off again like my previous jobs."

I have been interviewing for new positions and have a few companies interested, all hours away…but I feel like no matter what I do I’m making the wrong decision.

Just under a year ago, I landed a job at a multi-billion dollar company. This is my first corporate position. My job requires an extensive education/background in STEM. (Again, I need to be relatively vague - for the purpose of this post, please assume that I’m qualified for the role and have consistently met or exceeded expectations since being hired.) 

I’m the only woman and the only person under age 30 in my office. This industry is notoriously male-dominated. I’ve heard a few remarks about how I was probably just hired because I’m “young and pretty” among other comments implying that hiring me was a “strategic” move by the company due to my appearance. As annoying as they are, I know these comments are baseless, and at this point I’m thinking that the consequences of reporting them outweigh the benefits. The vast majority of people in my office are very helpful, supportive, respectful, *good* people, and I very much enjoy working with them. 

I really value the transparency between the “good ones” and I. The “formal training” provided by the company is essentially useless, so everything I’ve learned on the job so far has come from these guys. I think that reporting comments from the irritating few would rock the boat and result in the others feeling distrustful of me and/or like they need to be on their toes when they talk to me, which I absolutely do not want. 

I guess I’m looking for advice or wondering if anyone else here has experienced something similar. I have thick skin, I can take a joke, and I’ve dealt with much worse, but I’ve worked *so* hard to get here and for whatever reason it’s affecting me more than I thought it would. I don’t know.

I have Azure, Comptia, Cisco CCNA, Microsoft system admin expert, and Linux LPIC certs. I've worked in 2 help desk roles, and 2 system admin roles. I've been in IT field 3 years, so some say I don't need a degree, but others say I'll have a cap on my earnings if I don't get a degree.

The reason I'm considering a degree is because my previous degree was in kinesiology. Sometimes in interviews I keep getting asked why I switched from kinesiology to IT and it gets annoying. That and I'm also debating how to move into systems engineer, architect, cloud admin, or devops type role long term.

I feel like the MBT the equivalent of a masters in IT will help me in getting more IT type jobs. But, since that program is online I'm worried I won't get much networking effect as the in person MBA. The classes include 2 programming classes, a database management class, user experience, project management, and object oriented systems analysis. This program is also all online, so idk if that would be bad for networking for finding jobs/meeting people.

The MBA has more accounting, finance, marketing, operations, management, leadership, strategy, and analytics courses. However, the MBA seems more theoretical and has only 1 or 2 tech classes. But, I also think the MBA will open me up to more roles and some said that the MBA doesn't outdate itself as much as an MS does and that it's more broad. At the same time, I've never really seen an MBA listed on IT job postings.

The MBA could also be useful for a a backup plan to work as a regional gas station manager, retail store manager, or walmart manager. If I were to forget things in tech or got tired of it. I've also heard the saying that you shouldn't have a plan B and you should just focus on 1 goal if you want to be less scatter brained too.

WIth that said, in my current situation would you recommend the MBT(equivalent of MS IT) or the MBA?"

Trouble started immediately with no onboarding, incorrect new hire paperwork, a late paycheck that was $400 short.

Since then, the paperwork situation has been resolved and the paychecks are now accurate and on time. Now other more complicated problems have presented themselves.

Among the incidents are:  


1. Excluding me from meetings, then leaving me as the point person for the other staff. I've had to apologize so many times for not knowing/having what information/forms my colleagues need. It's truly embarrassing.

2. Refusing to create a written stylebook and only offering direction after I've completed the work. This leads to hours of wasted time and thrice redone work. It also kills morale.

3. Sending emails demanding that I have vendors complete work immediately, then complaining and sending over multiple changes once the rush job is completed. Our vendors don't mind because they are paid by time spent, not individual projects (three separate additions really adds to the bill).

4. Texting and emailing outside of business hours and on weekends about non-urgent matters. I've responded with the limited information I have, but it's annoying and boundary-crossing.

The issue at hand is that my boss is on leave with a family issue, but I am ready to begin transitioning out of my role. It feels peevish and unfeeling to announce my unhappiness and desire to leave as soon as she returns to the office next week. 

So, would I be a heartless jerk to make my dissatisfaction with my role known shortly after my supervisor comes back from a personal issue? If I decide to move forward with this, what would you recommend in terms of setting the tone and being honest without being rude?

Several months ago I received a promotion that was supposed to replace my previous role but now my work is wanting me to do it in ADDITION to it. When I've requested time to complete the additional assigned tasks while doing my normal tasks the response I've gotten is that I'm to be doing that as overtime. When I asked if I could do that as my mandatory OT then (we have a certain amount of hours of OT we have to complete each week) I was told that I have to do it as OT in ADDITION to the mandatory OT so I'm being expected to work way more than I had expected when I took the promotion. I'm also not being paid extra for the 2nd role like I was told I would be which has also been frustrating. Does anyone have any advice on how to *professionally* convey that while I'm happy to help out, I need to either be compensated better and have a better work-life balance or I'll find a different job that can provide those things?

I'm looking for a job. Any job - as long as it doesn't involve answering phones or dealing with a lot of people. I've been out of work since 2018 due to relentless depression. I still have it, but being unemployed and financially dependent is AWFUL. I am so afraid to fix up any kind of resume, because the gaps between work are huge and really my only explanation is poor mental health. 

I've been in treatment for years, been in hospitals, had brain stimulation treatments, been on over 20 kinds of meds, supplements, tried diet, exercise, meditation, and tried different therapists. I simply have to live with debilitating illness. I never sought disability because I was always told by anyone I ever asked I would never get it. I was always advised to not get on welfare - it would be like throwing in the towel.

I have a bachelors in psychology. I have plenty of art talent and I'm excellent with computers. I'm very friendly and I can speak very well and eloquently. I've got a good array of soft skills, but practically no experience. I'm nearly 30. 

I was a case manager working for a nonprofit, utilizing my degree. My ultimate goal was to get into a graduate program (which I still very much want to do). I have always been extremely passionate with the subject, and I actually do fairly well with people. I do have crippling social anxiety, though.

If I get an interview anywhere, what should I say if they ask about my gaps in my work history? If I carry myself with confidence,  can I win over a position in my preferred field of mental health?"

I said no since I prefer investing in the stock market on my own, November comes and my paychecks are slightly smaller, I asked HR, i dowloaded the work app that they suggested, saw that I had been investing in the 401k, I told HR to stop, they made me download another app to make it stop but no one took accountability or anything, by this time its February and i have given 500 dollars to this 401k. But finally it has ended.

Is it possible to get the money back? Should I take legal action or is this totally allowed? I would like to keep my job but also fight for this money… 

I haven’t mentioned anything about wanting the money back, just that this happened without my permission.

I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit I just need some help from people who have had this happened or know what this is all about."

How should I interpret this mail? This kind of answer is disappointing, their answer should be passed/not passed and maybe a feedback to improve my game. I am a bit confused.

Is this a sign of mismanagement? Is it possible they are still searching but they prefer holding my card in hand (in the meanwhile the Linkedin job position disappeared) ? Did I watch too many GoT episodes and am I looking for shady schemes everywhere? Did they took time to evaluate their budget? I am open to your opinions, even those more imaginative.

The recruiter asked me if I was given an offer how likely I would accept and if I accept would I back out after accepting, which I've never had anyone ask me before so I thought that was especially weird. The hiring manager and other interviewer didn't ask technical questions, just asked about projects I've worked on and what fields I am interested in. I get that for an intern position, they probably aren't expecting much, but I feel a little uncomfortable not getting asked even basic technical questions. Like what if I was an expert liar and lied about all the projects I worked on (which I obviously didn't but there probably are people like that), and they just take my word for it? 

I also checked on LinkedIn for this job and it says the posting was open for 6 months about 50 people applied, and the internship starts May, so it seems they had trouble finding someone they liked or people are turning the job down for some reason and now they are trying to find someone as fast as possible. I asked a lot of questions and the job seems legit and I think I could learn a lot, not too concerned about pay because it's just a summer internship. But was just wondering if anyone else had similar experiences like this or if this seems like a red flag I should stay away from?"

It requires a high level of financial and social investment. It is not for everyone.

A ‘job’ is more short term, focused around making money, and doesn’t usually require high levels of investment.

People are often told to focus on a ‘career’ when they should be focusing on ‘jobs’ that provide them flexibility, good incomes and lower levels of stress.

A good example is the skills shortages we have now. We need people to take up ‘jobs’ as delivery drivers, care workers, cleaners etc.

If people lowered their expectations and stopped chasing a ‘career’ and focused on ‘jobs’ we would be a much better society"

I'm trying to put together some evidence to present to management of my company to justify a higher pay increase. I'm working on modeling out a comparison of my wages vs CPI/ECI over the past few years. 

Over the past few years I have a slightly positive wage increase on an ECI adjusted basis (I just did a simple cumulative comparison/adjustment). I'm wondering if I might be inadvertently shooting myself in the foot by comparing against ECI and actually proving their point that I am paid above average. **What I think it comes down to is in the details of how ECI is calculated -- does it effectively represent wage increase for workers doing the same role, or does it also reflect promotions, job changers, etc?** 

Ie: if bob gets a promotion and a raise (effectively starting a new role) is ECI taking that into account or is it just capturing when Jane gets some marginal (usually 3%) cost of living bump? 

Thanks!"

I have a feeling my lack of drive for working had something to do with his loss of interest in me. I was already having trouble and getting down on myself for not having a “passion” or plan or being able to just pick a damn path. Now I’m too depressed to care so I’m worried bc I know the clocks ticking and I need to pick myself up. I just don’t know where to start I don’t know what I should do..it’s sad I think bc I have a good education, the rest of my family is on their own tracks, I seem to be wasting away…
Does anyone have experience w this..?and please, I know a lot of you are wanting to just say snap out of it just go get a job bc it’s a job, but not helpful rn I’ve tried that angle🫣"

I’ve got on with them and always done what I need to. 

I’ve noticed that every job/task I do comes under scrutiny from my line manager, she is always asking me probing questions like “have you done this” despite me carrying out the task to a good standard, there will always be something more I haven’t done. Things that I wouldn’t even know I had to do, she always pulls me up. She also contradicts herself and asks me to do a certain thing but then a few days later will ask me if I’ve done something else regarding this? 

For example, she told me to email 1 person specifically regarding a job and so I did. The next day she asks me if I emailed anyone else about it, why would I when she only told me to speak to that 1 person? I’m unsure if it’s my unhealed issues projecting on a normal working relationship, but I feel that it’s too much and I don’t appreciate how it makes me feel. I have also noticed that when we have meetings about certain tasks, she doesn’t listen to what I say and more often than not talks over me…

This is a pretty broad statement so I know this needs to be narrowed down...so I have to consider 2 things: my current experience and what jobs are already available in the sector. 

I have about 7 years of Customer Service, Sales and complaints case management (throughout a few different jobs), some elements i know are integral to tech, such as a strong will to help people and a mind geared towards problem solving. Naturally there are some jobs i won't be qualified for and some that I don't even know exist at this point just because of my lack of experience, but I need to figure out what jobs will be available to me with the skills I have.

My plan is to currently study the basics of IT and get to grips with some terms. I understand some basic terms but I still need to get to grips with knowing the terminology. Things like VMware, MSP,  sophos, DHCP etc. These are just some of the things I've written down from studying that I'll do further research on, and just try and take it from there. 

What I also want to do in the meantime is start applying for some of these realistic jobs where I don't require these qualifications. Something where I can be taught the troubleshooting as a basic process, and can be escalated from there. From what I have seen, something like helpdesk support or entry level IT. What I'm hoping is that I study the requirements in the job description (like being proficient with desktop support) and have a good enough understanding to get that basic IT job and use all my previous skills to bolster that. Does this seem like a good idea? If not are there any other good ways to break into tech? Basically any advice would be appreciated thank you.

Tldr; Whats the best way to break into tech with 7 years of Customer Service, Sales and complaints case management experience?"

2,2023-03-16,Deciding on Major - Stuck,u/SwissCheeseSandwich5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11sv958/deciding_on_major_stuck/,jobs,"I am currently stuck. I just transferred my associate degree from a community college to a university. I originally believed I would be majoring in BA in French Secondary Education; however, I realized that this may not be the way to go. Languages are my main passion and my main hobby, and I love learning them - but it may be unwise to turn it into a job, especially a job that has very low pay and very long working hours. I spent a year as a student teacher, and my experience had its pros and cons.

**Class registration begins in a few days, but I will not be able to actually register for classes until mid-April. I have a meeting with an advisor via Zoom on the 20th of March.**

I've since been looking at other majors and jobs associated with those majors that I am interested in, but I should be searching for a major that brings in a decent salary and has ease in finding a job out of university - but there is a problem with that, I am terrible at upper-level mathematics like algebra and chemistry, so that cuts out a lot of really stable and needed majors. I am also wanting a major that has me on my feet a lot, as I do not like to sit down all day.

With all of these majors, I am okay with starting at the bottom and working my way to the top in whichever field.

I've narrowed it down to:

**BS in Environmental and Sustainability Studies:** This is the one that is most interesting to me. But, I also recognize that the word ""studies"" may be a term that is not associated with prestige, and it does not seem like a major that would make it easy to get a job. I am thinking of getting a minor in GIS alongside this major.

**BS in Anthropology:** One that is also very interesting to me. But, again, I also recognize that the field is very competitive and has very low chances. But, I am also very interested in the various areas of study associated with  Anthropology. I am thinking of getting a minor in GIS, as well as a  minor in French alongside this major.

**BA in International Relations:** This degree is interesting to me because of a few classes I took in political science, and one of those classes included an international relations course which I found myself becoming very interested in and one of the only classes in which I actually read through the entire textbook. With this job, I recognize there are a lot of government jobs available that include various benefits, but I also feel that this job may be very niche. I am thinking of getting a minor in French alongside this major.

**BS in Wildlife Biology:** This degree is a lot like the Environmental and Sustainability Studies degree and is probably more useful and more likely to land me a good-paying job out of university, and it is also a specialized biology degree, but it also contains six chemistry/physics/algebra courses that I  really do not think I'd be able to do well in - as I got a grade of 61% in Chemistry and a grade of 75% in Algebra II in high school. I am thinking of getting a minor in GIS alongside this major.

**BS in Information Technology:** This degree is sort of interesting to me, but I also do not see myself doing this on a day-to-day basis. I understand computers and know how to build them and diagnose problems, but I really am not sure if I would want to do this degree. I would be able to do it, and likely pass, but I  am just not sure. For this degree, I also need to apply to a separate program within the university.

**BBA of Business Administration in Accounting:** This degree is interesting to me, but my girlfriend thinks that I would get bored of being an accountant. I failed one class in high school,  and that class was accounting - in which I got a 14%. It was just very uninteresting to me at the time. But, now that I've actually looked into it, it does not seem that bad. My friend is an accountant at a large online retailer, and he has been giving me various examples of what he does at his job and a lot of it seems pretty easy enough - a lot of repetitive work. My friend also mentioned that what they teach you in accounting classes in university is often a lot harder than what you actually do as an accountant. This degree is also one that is has a very high chance of landing me a job out of university, and it has good pay  and benefits. For this degree, I would need to apply to the business school of the university - which happens to be next to my university apartment. But, as I mentioned, I do hate sitting around all day and my math skills are not the greatest. I am thinking of getting a minor in  French alongside this major.

They did forward my resume to the same department to see if they had other positions coming up that I'd be a good fit for, and I got a generalized phone interview in January with a department manager that went well. 

On Valentine's Day they said they were considering creating an entirely new position within the department they thought I might be a good fit for and had me come in for an in-person interview, which went extremely well. I followed up with thank you emails to each person I interviewed with, and the talent acquisition rep followed-up to tell me that they ""had to work on a few things"", but have unanimously decided that I was a perfect fit for the role &amp; want to move forward with me. They said they anticipated having a final answer / offer letter by that Friday. 

I didn't hear anything until the following Monday, where they told me that they still didn't have the green-light to proceed, but that they had spoken with the VP of the department who had said they hoped to have an answer by the end of that week. They also instructed me to keep in touch and check in with them on Friday, which I did. Their response was two weeks ago, where they said:

&gt;""Unfortunately, we still don’t have the go-ahead to proceed just yet.  I have just finished up a meeting with (The VP of the department) and he spoke with (The President of the organization), and he said we are getting close to finally being able to move forward, doesn’t have a timeline for the decision. This will work out, it will just take a little more time. I will be in touch. 

I responded by letting him know I'd keep my eye on my email / phone, and it's been radio silence since then. Some of my friends and family are saying I should reach out again to let them know that I'm still very interested since it's been a couple weeks, but I don't want it to seem like I'm pestering them about it; it seems like that would be a detriment considering there's still no offer (and that making a new position can take some time to get through HR, legal, finance, etc.

We also really do make a huge difference, it’s a relatively new charity and so things are changing quick and I have no doubt it will be a lucrative company in the near future. The problem is, do I wait it out or move elsewhere for the immediate enhancement?

I have not handed my notice in but I know they’re contacting my manager for a reference. So, I went to warn my manager and she was very supportive, said she understands their current pay isn’t good and she will support me to leave if it’s what I want. However she then told me the plans from higher up to raise our salary to around £24000 (but unsure from when) and she told me that if it keeps me there, they will create a role to promote me in to for even more money. She said that if they were to promote anyone it would be me, she doesn’t want to let me go and I will leave a huge hole in the team that can’t be filled. She kept insisting that she wasn’t just saying this because I have another offer, that it’s something she and my manager have discussed recently and that any opportunity for development would be expected to be filled by me. She talked about our charity expanding and how big we are getting (it really is quite amazing) and how much good I do in my role. 
The DWP is problematic and I’d be less fulfilled and she knows that and played on that. We have ex DWP workers here who took the pay cut to escape. But that’s not everyone’s experience, some have positive stories. 

She said she will do the reference but to think about it and consider that they’d do anything within reason to keep me there. I have not said what I will do, just that I need time to think and that I want to know that if I stay, I do so because it’s what I want and not because I was too afraid to consider this other option. 

Now I’m torn because I do love my job. I’m respected here and maybe it’s better to stay somewhere where you’re valued and seen as an important part of a growing team. But then also, I can’t take back this chat and what if I stay and non of these promises are fulfilled? 
I feel like I’ve had my head spun and I can’t think straight so now don’t know the best way to move. 

Opinions would be hugely appreciated."

I don’t really understand why because I pride myself on coming across well in interviews and being confident.  Only one of them has offered to provide feedback which I’m still waiting on.

They pay me 48K/yr and reasoning was lack of experience. I was desperate for a job at the time and decided to take it anyways to gain experience. 

I’ve been working here for about 6 months now and feel like i am getting underpaid for what i’m doing. Other people on my team gets paid more with a higher position but i’m practically doing their job because boss thinks they are incapable but has trouble firing people.

I asked my dad for advice and he told me i should stick with the job for at least a year. I have just been looking at other positions and their salary range according to their post is 65K. This isn’t just one company, this was multiple. 

Should i try staying for an extra 6 months while getting underpaid or should I just start applying? If i do start apply, would other companies think it’s odd for me to apply while already having a job? 

Like I said, i’m still new to this industry and a lot of things my parents have told me in the past was to stay committed to your company and you’ll get higher than job hopping. Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: I would just apply and interview but will not leave my current position until i get an offer."

Hi. Ok so my internship was remote. For a few random days, we were required to work in our local office. My problem was that it was very difficult. Transportation would cost hundreds of dollars in Uber and hours to go to the office and home. Also, $10 for lunch. The cost was too high just to work in the office and interact better with other employees.

Maybe I would have gone if the company paid for everything but it was still taking up so much of my mine. Do you think not going to those company events stopped me from getting a return offer? I still did all my work."

It wasn’t my first choice to work in food as I wanted to work as a ride operator, but they asked me if I would be interested in a food service job instead. At the time I thought “well, I need money. It can’t be that bad.” Especially after their warning and my mother’s reaction that I shouldn’t have taken the job because food is the worse to work in. I guess I let myself settle even though I did swear to not go for food jobs again. I’ve worked in the food industry plenty of times and haven’t enjoyed it.

From 2015 - 2021, I was working as a Branch Manager over a large geographical area. In 2021 the company decided to divide the larger offices into smaller offices and changed our title to Area Manager. There was no change in pay for me at this point, everything was business as usual.

Several weeks ago, the company announced there would be a new structural change. They would be killing off the Area Manager role, and creating an Operations Manager role, the catch, we did not roll into the position like before, everyone was forced to apply and re interview with the hope of preserving employment. With this change, the structure returned to the larger geographical locations, which naturally minimized the headcount of management.

When my job was changed from Branch Manager to Area Manager, there was no change in pay. However, they now have decided to restructure the salary bands so that each manager is paid based on the revenue the office brings in. I am in a smaller location and was just told that were I to earn the new Operations Manager position, based on my location, my pay would be reduced by 30%. Meanwhile, there are managers without my experience receiving a larger wage based only on the revenue that particular area produces. I either take the lower pay, or look for a new job.

I didn't think much to negotiate because I thought this process happens after you get a written offer, so I didn't say much. I was told that I can let them sweat for a few days and then call to say that I have an offer for 5k more from another company (which I don't), give them my reasons why I prefer this company instead and if they can match the salary. The alternative would be to just accept the offer.

I have been with my current company for just over 2 years. During those 2 years, I gained three promotions and currently make $30 an hour as a supervisor. However, I have been through so much at this place to the point I have had panic attacks at work, been put on medication, and am in therapy for the trauma. I have put a ton of effort into this start-up to see it grow. I've worked 13-hour shifts, handled swarms of angry patients, dealt with gossip from toxic co-workers, and seen many employees come and go due to bad management. 

The director of the company throws temper tantrums, yells and breaks down crying in front of the team, and even cussed out other executives. The director's family owns the company, so I doubt they'll step down from their role anytime soon. One of the sales execs is also being investigated for sexual harassment that I've witnessed firsthand. My only saving grace at this job is my direct manager and my team. My manager is the only reason I got raises and promotions and he tries his best to keep morale up. My team is lovely and honestly could handle themselves without me.

With that being said, I have been looking for a new job and finally landed a job offer today. It will be a steep pay cut (~$18 an hour) but my finances will be OK and the hours are more manageable for me while I work on my Computer Science degree. I am just worried about leaving my colleagues with more work. 80% of our workforce was laid off in January and several execs took paycuts, so the workload is being handled by a few stressed and disgruntled employees.

 I feel like my leave would devastate everyone, but I can't stand to stay another day here faking being nice and happy to people I don't like. I guess I am looking for advice or encouragement to take this leap. I plan to put in my resignation tomorrow and am shaking nervously at the thought."

TLDR:
I’m from the US. Will have a PhD in biochemistry and microbiology. Needing to know how to find companies and jobs for my qualifications that pay well so I can make sure I learn marketable skills. 


Long:
So I’m from the US and have recently been admitted into my PhD and will be focusing primarily on the biochemistry of microbes and their interactions with certain plants. I’ll also be doing all of my own data work to gain experience as a bioinformatician. 

Ideally I’d like to find a job that will enable me to be remote, hence why I’ve been putting so much emphasis on learning bioinformatics stuff during my PhD. However, regardless of my wants, I’ve barely begun my PhD journey and need to know how to find job postings and companies that I would apply for. That way I can see the sorts of skills they are looking for and cater my learning during my PhD to try and match the market as closely as possible. 
I’ve tried searching through listings on Glassdoor and indeed but failed to see listings for several biotech startups in my area that I know are hiring (as I heard from colleagues). This indicates to me that there are a significant amount of jobs and companies I’m not able to find through these conventional methods. 

How do I go about finding these positions or at least staying up to date on what skills will be relevant in industry positions?"

I then left that job and started a job as a medical claims adjuster for workers comp. Last June I was promoted to Indemnity claims specialist. I still want to pursue a career with HR, but at this point I’m 6 years removed and am not sure which positions I’m qualified for.

Hi, I'm a 19 year-old college student living in FL and I'm feeling really pathetic for already wanting to quit my job. I've just started working at Mcdonald's, and already I want to quit. Not because of the amount of work, I can handle that, but because I'm in constant pain, and it's only been a few days of working there. I can't fully open or close my right hand and I'm in pain typing this right now. My shoulders and back are screaming at me whenever I move and I need to be completely hunched over for it to not hurt, and even then my lower back starts hurting from that, too. My hand has also swelled up, and it hasn't gone down in the past few days. Not to mention my arm is killing me, and no amount of Tylenol/Aleve is helping. I feel incredibly pathetic about wanting to quit. 

I quit my last job within the first week because everything seemed incredibly sketchy (they paid me in cash and didn't have me sign any kind of form ensuring that I worked there/would be getting paid/etc, they didn't even put my name into the system that logged the number of hours I worked) and now I feel like I'm just creating an excuse for me to leave this one. I really don't mind the work, but after talking to the other workers about it, they all seem to be in pain, too. Call me entitled, but I don't want to be in constant pain to the point where I'm crying my eyes out during breaks for $12/hr. It's just that I'd really like to have some form of income so I can save up for a car/place to live. Again, the actual work is not the problem, since I don't actually mind the repetitiveness of it all. It's simply the amount of pain I'm in, and the fact that it isn't going away in the slightest.

I just don't know where else I would go. Maybe working in fast food just isn't for me. But Mcdonald's was the only place that would even take me. I applied to 25 different sites (including other fast food joints and restaurants) and it's either them lying about needing more people to work there, or my apparently abhorrent resume. I don't have that much experience working though, so I don't even know where else I would apply. I was so excited about finally finding a place that would take me and I feel awful for wanting to leave already. I've tried every medicine there is to stop the swelling/aches, but nothing has worked, and now my schoolwork is being jeopardized since I can't write as fast as I usually do. I just don't know where to go from here. My shift is in a few hours, so I guess I can see what happens."

Please don’t judge. 

I used to be extremely intelligent, and clear minded - held great positions in the past. But, after leaving my last job (about 7 months ago) - I let myself go completely and slipped into a deep dark depression where my health (physical + mental) has severely deteriorated 

I have been sleeping 15 hours/ day, and eating junk the rest of the day. While talking very meanly/ rudely to family members. All this made me lose my mental clarity, or memories of how I used to be professionally. Plus, I stopped showering/ brushing too. I started fearing people, and feeling like I have forgotten how to talk completely. (Lucky enough to have parents take care of me 100%)

I seriously thought I would do whatever tf till I kms (seriously had a plan). I realize that I really need to get a job because this is not at all sustainable and I am slipping to a dark place quickly.

My mom called me and said my stepdad had gotten a new job at a shipping company called Atirolls. She said it was work from home and the salary is $3,500 a month and they would only work 10-20 hours a week. This raised a major red flag because that offer is already too good to be true. I tried googling and found nothing, i kept having to scroll and I finally found a website. The site has bad spelling and grammar. 

The about us section has no information on where the company is based (just says chicago Illinois), who works there, nothing. I kept googling and found the site on scamadvisor. Apparently this website has only been up a month and there is a phone number that when I googled is actually an icelandic number. I’m really concerned now because I think my parents are being duped

UPDATE: So a user on r/scams said this was a clear parcel mule scam. I alerted my parents, my mom gave them all her bank info and ssn so she is currently calling her bank and freezing her credit. 

My stepdad has already received and sent out a few packages. I told them both to cut off communication. I called the sheriff and they advised that I call the attorney general for next steps. I’m going to call them tomorrow. Hopefully my parents can come out of this unscathed. They agreed they will come to me first about things.

UPDATE 2: I called the attorney general and they reiterated for me to have my parents lock down all their info. My mom said the packages weren’t big ticket items and nothing has been stolen from their accounts. They haven’t been “working” long at all so I think we caught this before they could do some real damage. I will be reporting to the FTC and IC3 as well"

I make layouts for our production team, sort of like a blue print for them to use when making the labels, that goes as far as setting up the colors through InDesign and following the planning that is attached to the job. 

I get through a ton of jobs a day and love the place I'm working at but when speaking to my other coworkers, we seem to have the same problem's - our pay. Turns out, one of my coworkers is buddy buddy with one of the old owners who now resents the company for buying him out of his contract at such a low price right before company take off. The company uses about 43% of it's budget to pay for the employees, which, to be honest I have no idea if that is bad or not, some places could be a lot worse, but she insists it's horrible especially for the work we are all doing. 

The title of my position is called Output Specialist and nothing comes up on Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor or anything else. What would be the best way about finding the same position in a different company when I'm not even sure of the position title?

Applying today, after submitting my resume, it asks me how many years of experience I have using React. I hate this question because React is one of many frameworks and though I've worked with it since 2014, my *actual* experience is closer to 4 years (since 70% of my work *doesn't* use React). In the job listing they wanted 6 years experience (10 of JS, of which I'm 10+). 

So did I get auto-excluded by Glassdoor by putting fewer than 6? Or does it go to a separate pile or something. 

Hoping to find someone that has posted/hired employees from this site to share their knowledge!"

 I recently started a new job that is in office job Monday - Friday 8-5pm. I have a diagnosis of ADHD and take medication. However, I take the lowest dose I can (I don't really like taking it), but I am really really struggling to find focus in the office. 

**TL;DR Looking for advice on convincing my boss to allow hybrid and/or remote work because of ADHD. More background below** 

I work in a cubicle, with no natural light, and I cannot focus! People are always trying to talk to me, or always walking past me. The woman who works in the back of my cubicle section has people coming to see her regarding work ALL DAY LONG. 

 I have tried some solutions. I have noise-canceling headphones. I try to set focus timers for two hours and take a walk outside when it goes off. I have a standing desk and switch positions. However, nothing seems to help. I struggle with motivation and focus in an office with no natural light.  And at the end of the day, you can't wear headphones all day. 

My boss seems fairly resistant to the idea of remote or hybrid work, although he has let me go home a couple of times in the afternoon when I say I can focus. It's frustrating because he talks about how distracting the office is. (Facepalm). He \*also\* goes home to work often, because ""he can't concentrate at the office."" I know this because my close friend is his sister-in-law. 

 I have done freelance work for 10 years and this is my first time in the office, and I am really really struggling. My job can totally be done remotely. I am a copywriter, that mostly just works alone all day. I hardly ever have to talk to people in this role. I seriously would be happy to with a hybrid situation. 

I am also losing my mind because I am in a creative role and my mind isn't always moving in the middle of the day. I work best in the mornings and evenings and I hate that I am suddenly confined to a specific schedule, for what is creative work! 

That being said, I have been reading about ADA compliance and reasonable accommodation. I know that legally reasonable accommodations need to be made for employees with ADHD. I have only been here for two months though, so not sure of a proper timeline to talk to my boss? 

I am just looking for any insight/advice. Thanks for reading."

I love designing (designing architecturally) and being in the field. I contemplated doing exhibition designing like structural part of it or lighting architecture. I’m really interested in the connection between designing, art, and people who use the space. Or even like art curator seems fun but i have no experience in this field.

I have my associates in business administration and absolutely no experience in healthcare or medical terminology.

However it made me doubt if I can be a good medical assistant without experience or degree as I’ve know someone who went to school to become a medical assistant.

I had a conversation with a HR person recently regarding a role. The role was advertised as a Sr. Manager and part of the requirements was 8 years of experience in “industry”. So the HR person led with “the hiring manager likes your resume and experience but since you don’t have the full 8 years of experience in the industry if everything goes well we may have to downgrade (?) the position to a level below Sr. Manager”. This led to a back and forth between us etc etc. 

Now from my personal experience I don’t have the full 8 years experience in the “industry” but have close to 2 decades of professional experience most of which is in an adjacent industry (essentially the same thing but the industry are a bit stuck up, it’s notoriously difficult to transition into and I just transitioned about 4 years ago). When I transitioned, the positioned required 6+ years in the “industry”, I had zero on paper and was hired. A few weeks ago, I got an offer for a role that required 7+ years in “industry”- I had a little under 4 and it wasn’t even flagged. 

The reason I brought this up is out of curiosity- in practical terms how much experience do you think is enough experience to be able to do a job? I am not referring to entry level or new graduate jobs. I am also not talking about folks who are changing careers etc. Also ATS systems may be filtering out some applicants by years of experience (I’d this feasible?) 

Can a project manager with 3 years of experience take on a senior role where 7 years of experience are is required? Just an example 

For those wondering - industry is biotech (non-technical role)."

It pays 8k more than I make now, it is 100% in office and has great benefits. However, I have spent the last few days dwelling on it. My dilemma is that while I do love in person connections, I also know how easy I have it right now in terms of flexibility and work life balance. For some reason, the idea of giving up my easy job and flexibility has scared me into sending the HR lady of this new job, an email of how I am rescinding my acceptance. She called and left a VM and wanted to discuss. 

I am literally so torn. My fiancé had encouraged me to take the new job because he knows how much I value in person connection. I am now sick to my stomach with the idea that I might have messed up by rescinding. But I don’t know if I actually messed up. I’m just struggling greatly with the idea that I work in an industry I don’t care for but have flexibility, but could work in an industry I love and not have as much flexibility. I have never worked hybrid before but now that I have, I’m not sure if I want to give it up. Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR: I currently work in an industry I don’t love, but get to have remote flexibility. I accepted and then rescinded an offer for an industry I love for an additional 8k but wouldn’t be able to work remote. Not sure if I screwed up by rescinding my acceptance and what to do."

*There is a lot to unpack here but I'm going to try to bullet-point it to make it easier.*

I started a new job in August of 2022 and at first, it was great! I also genuinely loved working with patients at the small office I was at. That was...until a series of events made it to where I could no longer mentally or emotionally take what was going on anymore and I broke. Before this, I'd never had an issue with coworkers or the work environment I was in.

**Editing to try to shorten this to bullet points &amp; hopefully less to read!**

* This job has two office locations, I started in the main office, and ended in 2nd office. The offices had 3 technicians/receptionists total, 2 for the main office, and 1 for the 2nd office.
* The 1st receptionist/technician was increasingly getting on me about things they portrayed as issues; started noticing those issues I was getting in trouble for were the same things she &amp; supervisor/office manager also weren't following through on.
* 4+ complaints a day &amp; sarcastic/passive-aggressive remarks from Technician 1 &amp; Office Manager.
* overheard technician 1 making awful comments about me to my office manager &amp; fellow coworkers when she thought I was too far away to hear.  The office manager didn't do anything to stop it. Instead, she seemed to help egg it on and agree with the comments and/or tack on her own commentary.
* Started to become stressed and increasingly uncomfortable &amp; depressed. Reached out to a therapist to seek help.
* I started recording all interactions as of December in a small journal &amp; then started writing them down to my friends so that I had another record of what was happening in case I forgot a detail.
* Started getting iced out (no one would say good morning to me, greet me, or even ask how was my weekend or interact with me unless they wanted/needed something from me)
* I retreated and barely spoke unless I needed to.  Eventually, I reached out to my therapist trying to see if we could start sessions again because I was becoming extremely depressed.

**Conclusion:**

* Early February - 3rd receptionist/technician quit 2nd office due to treatment. Walked out of the job.
* Mid-February - pregnant coworker in 2nd office went out on maternity leave. Before she left I was told I needed to learn all of her job duties and was training with her to take over those on top of my own. Eventually, the office manager &amp; another coworker from the main office started rotating in &amp; out due to 2 people not being able to hold down the office &amp; care for patients.
* 2 weeks ago, overheard my office manager speaking with my coworker at 2nd location in hushed tones ""Has she gotten on your nerves yet? She annoys me so much!"" &amp; proceeded a full vent about me even though I hadn't spoken to her other than about work-related issues all that morning. Decided I couldn't take it anymore and put in my notice.
* Left job that offered no medical, vision, or dental benefits that was full-time.

Someone mentioned I might qualify for EDD but I don't really know if I do, however, I did want to find out other people's possible similar experiences and how long it took you to find your new job."

0,2023-03-16,Looking For Job Suggestions,u/Plus-End7656,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ted5a/looking_for_job_suggestions/,jobs,"Hi there, I'm trying to figure out what kind of work would be best for me to do. Something that is stable to move out with and live on my own.

I graduated from a university with a Bachelors Degree in Cinema if that helps, but I only really learned story writing stuff. Not video editing, art, or animation (never learned things like that).

&amp;#x200B;

**Preferences:**

**Retail Work**

I don't mind doing something like cashier, but I don't want to have to do Janitor type work like cleaning restrooms (nothing against janitors, it's just not for me). Putting stuff on shelves all day is okay too, but handling super heavy products 5 days a week for about 40 hours is something I can't handle.

&amp;#x200B;

**Repetitive Work**

Shutting off your brain and Doing the same thing over and over mindlessly that you don't have to think about is okay with me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Work From Home/Working in an office**

A job that let's your work from home would be great for me as long as I don't have to deal with something too complicated. Putting information into a chart like data entry is fine, but having like 20 different types of responsibilities will be too overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

**Screen Writing**

Writing stories is something I love to do, but I'm not willing to do something like writing articles, reviews or news reports.

&amp;#x200B;

**Something Video Game Related**

Something to do with video games would be cool. No coding though. I'll save you the story and say it's not happening.

&amp;#x200B;

**Last Notes**

I worked at jobs a where you need to do everything perfectly and as silly as it might sound I couldn't meet expectations. My boss stressed me out, managers gave me contradictory tasks (one person would say to do something another told me not to) and I would get in trouble. If it is a job that involves little direct contact with people then it sounds good to me."

I’ve been with a company for 7 months so far. I’m a manager level, but I don’t have people reporting to me. I went from an extremely stressful and fast paced job to a much slower paced job.

Most days, I’m trying to find something to do. Like create my own tasks to keep myself busy.

My boss (and the person who hired me) has suddenly left with only a week notice and her role will not be refilled. With that person gone, I’m terrified that my position will be eliminated since 80% of the time, I’m just trying to find something to do. I’m supposed to start meeting with the company owner twice a week and talk about my “goals for the day” and I’m afraid they will decide my position is not needed. The person leaving was responsible for fleshing out my daily duties more, but it never happened, though I’m not sure why.

What would you do? Jump ship before it sinks? Be honest with the owner and tell them some days you’re just scrambling to find something to do?"

35,2023-03-16,Advice for an almost 50 year old being put out to pasture.,u/rwarrenr00,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11teh7f/advice_for_an_almost_50_year_old_being_put_out_to/,jobs,"So my position is phasing out - to some extent I put myself in this position - I got layered at work with a terrible boss who likely wanted me gone so I decided to proactively announce that I planned to 'retire' from the company in two years (essentially turning 50 at that point). I worked with my manager to break up my team and to create new functional groups. 

So then the boss I couldn't stand gets canned for incompetence/bad behavior - likely both (have to admit it felt really good). At this point my team is dismantled so there really isn't going back - keep in mind that I also hold a senior position and have been with the company for 20 years - so they aren't going to want to keep my salary in tact. 

They are being fairly generous - letting me work until this summer to get my bonus and then paying me outright for an entire year. I had indicated I wanted to keep contracting, but they said they can't give me a severance if I switch to contracting. The contracting would also pay a cheaper rate. Part of me was hoping I'd have the option to contract for 2-3 years. 

I suppose ultimately though it makes the most sense to take the severance and start working to find something else. I'm in a situation, that on a budget I may not have to work again, but I'm only closing in on 49 and I'm healthy and still look and feel young. I am a bit burned out though and have wanted a break for some time. The thought of starting something of my own is also appealing. 

Just really curious how other people my age or in my position are handling this transition. I have to say the last 4 years since I got layered were very tough. To some extent I want to crawl in a hole and not come out... but I know I'll keep fighting. Need to avoid a self-pity party and start drinking destructively lol."

I currently work for a media company.  I have been in this position for roughly half a year, and when I was hired, the pay was non-negotiable.  I was hired for $50,200 with a 35-hour work week, + benefits, and it is a remote position.  

However, this year our company began posting job pay ranges.  Currently, the pay range for my position is 50 - 55k. Should I ask for a match on the higher pay scale? It would only amount to a 5% - 7% pay bump, but I would like to know whether it is worth bringing to HR.  

I did ask my boss, and they asked me to email HR.  Given that the pay scale difference is slight, and the pay bump would amount to a single-digit rise in percentage terms, is it worth speaking to HR about it? 

&amp;#x200B;

If so, how do you think I should approach HR about this? Unfortunately, I am clueless and don't know what argument to make.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my job did provide a 3% pay bump recently, along with a small bonus six months into the job, so my actual pay is closer to 52.5 once the bonus is included.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any pay bump would help, along with any advice.

I just started a new job at a small company as an entry level IT consultant/IT engineer. There are less than a handful of people working in this office (3-4 people including the owner) when talking about taking on this job I did let them know I was finishing up school this May and was still fairly new to the field with some experience. I am salaried and asked for the lowest entry level salary I could (dumb I know) and feel as the company had no onboarding process, no culture view, all I know was my salary and start date (also dumb I know I was just excited to finally have a big boy job) I left another job for this but they left out a lot of important details such as traveling a good chunk to clients, I was never really taught how things are supposed to be done and it hasn’t been 2 weeks yet and I get talked to by my boss like a child when I ask for some guidance on small projects, I only have one co worker who I think is supposed to be guiding me on the ways of the company schedule, tools they use and etc. my boss got mad at me for not seeing a email when they haven’t set up my email correctly where I get spammed with a lot of non essential things plus being out of the office a lot. They also didn’t set it up correctly on my phone so it was easy to miss when I’m looking for more important dilemmas. My boss asked me to get some certs in that email because he didn’t think my skill set / trouble shooting abilities were up to par but I thought I would be learning that here at an entry level position with almost being a fresh undergraduate in network engineering. I feel as I am more of a errand boy in most situations. I feel as the only things I learn are from my coworker who has stayed at this job for 3 years. (PSA the first day he told me there was a high turn over rate) my boss was asking me to complete comp tia and a few others in the next two months. With this job full time and school full time I am not sure what to do. His wife is HR for me basically, so not sure who to go too. Let me know if anyone has any suggestions or has been through this"

Every option sucks to try to work in my field(environmental). My only real options is to ether work a job that pays horribly. Or do entry level jobs that aren't even related to my school(gardening, cleaning parks washrooms) in hopes that I could climb up to higher jobs eventually. 

It's a dog show to even get a entry level job. With every entry level job wanting 2 years of experience or is just highly competitive to get the job itself. 

I currently am at a temp job that's ending soon. I thought it was going to open doors as I was hired back twice as a contracted worker with so many signs that an upcoming job would be mine. They did a horrible move and hired a complete outsider. 

So kinda wanting to move on to something else. I don't wanna do more then two years of schooling because I lost my faith with education. And I want to be paid decently with lots of options for work."

I'm being trained on the job by a senior. They keep sending what are, to me, vague instructions. I am often left with 2 choices:

1) Try to intuit the missing info and make as educated a guess as I can as to what I should do (So far this has like a 40/60 chance of me getting it right)

2) Ask them for clarification. So far this has a roughly 65/35 chance of them mildly reprimanding me for ""not thinking"" or ""asking obvious questions"". They often phrase it as ""This is for your own good, you need to try to figure it out yourself to learn and get better"", which I really don't get sometimes as the consequences of me ""figuring it out"" wrongly tend to be quite awkward/embarrassing (Requesting the wrong thing from others, emailing the wrong people etc.) or amazingly time wasting (Inspend like 30 minutes to an hour looking through various files trying to figure it out).

They gave me closely supervised training initially but once that ended we got into this pattern that has been going on for months. I find it frustrating because frankly, if I was in charge of someone else, I'd think all I want is for them to learn the ropes ASAP so I can get on with the rest of my job, so I'd rather just rather they ask and I quickly tell them what they SHOULD do and hope they memorize/get used to the various processes sooner or later and then once they fall into a rhythm they'll know what to do. I don't see why I would bother having them get it wrong and spend time figuring it out/cleaning up the mess and explaining why they did what they did. 

This ""figure it out yourself"" method my manager is using results in tons of back and forth, a lot of ""So why did you do X, how does that make sense"" which then leads to a whole conversation with me telling them what my train of thought was and them explaining why that was wrong etc., which leads to countless revisions of my work and strikes me as massively inefficient, frustrating (Lots of ""Oh yeah obviously you knew that, but how TF was I supposed to know, I'm new here"" feelings on my end) and unnecessary.

Does my manager just have a really impractical way of training people, or is this actually the best way people learn new skills and I'm just struggling due to my autism/ADHD?"

This week, I applied for a data science job at my dream company.

From what I can see on LinkedIn, the data team lead has the same academic background as I do. He completed his PhD the year I was born, became a professor, and then transitioned to DS around the 2008 recession. I completed my PhD a few years ago, and got my first data science position shortly after. For additional information, the field of academia we share is tiny - a subfield of physics with about 2,000 people worldwide.

**Should I write a cold email to the team lead?** My goal is to boost my chances for an interview.

I'll add that the job posting did not have the team lead's email. I ended up finding his email on RocketReach. It does not look like he's very active on LinkedIn, otherwise I'd send him a message there. Unfortunately, it also doesn't look like he's kept up with anyone in our field of academia, otherwise I'd wrangle an intro.

- updating and maintaining a veritable mess that is our website, intranet (ok)
- checking my supervisors work for completeness and error (???)
- community event planning and organization - e.g awards ceremonies (this is where it becomes too much)
- drafting letters for mayor and council (weird, but ok, I can handle it)
- anything my supervisor or her deputy deem beneath them, like picking up snacks for council 
- writing town newsletter
- running everyone’s mail thru postage machine
- about 50 other things I can’t recall currently 


working under corp. officer who is 3 months into her position. has 0 education, minimal training &amp; has, over the past two weeks seemingly come to the conclusion that she does not personally like me and has devoted significant amounts of time to overloading me with additional tasks, nitpicking all of my work, gaslighting, blaming me for her mistakes etc. my first performance review was stellar and now it seems I can do no right.

I’m mentally / physically exhausted and miserable. I feel like I’m going to have a serious mental breakdown if I continue down this road.

I put my uni studies on pause for this and I just want to go back to school &amp; just work somewhere low-stress part time.
I have 7k savings, minimal expenses, live quite frugally.

have already started applying at other jobs &amp; registered for summer semester. 
Is there any point trying to stick this out? the pay is decent and I’ll have access to benefits if I pass probation but I am so incredibly mentally unwell right now. am I just being a coddled student? I had a receptionist job for 5 yrs previously and the scope of my job was nothing like this.

advice greatly appreciated"

1,2023-03-17,Am I overreacting?,u/anothersadlieutenant,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11tl2ey/am_i_overreacting/,jobs,"So I've been working in my current job as a medical receptionist for just over two years, the longest I've stayed in any job. I really like the work and the organisation as a whole, despite being here for two disease outbreaks and a doctor shortage. They've also been flexible around illness stuff (two different surgeries and an unrelated three months in hospital).

The problem is that one of the people I've been working with since I started does fuck all. Like, he spends most of his shift fucking around on his computer or on hour long ""15 minute"" breaks. Some days it gets so bad that people from other areas ask me if I need help on the desk. I don't mind working hard (I like to be busy) but whenever I work with him I just feel taken advantage of, and I hate it. It makes me feel used and angry and just generally like shit. I feel really hopeless because I don't see it changing any time soon.

Last year it got to a point where I raised it with my manager, but he told me that it was my word against his and there was nothing he could do, and that if I came up with any suggestions to let him know. 

It's gotten to the point that when I know we'll be working together I can barely make myself go to work. I'll have anxiety attacks or have to dissociate to stop myself from shaking or crying on the desk. So I decided I needed to leave.

I asked my manager today if I could use him as a reference, and that I hadn't found anything yet but I didn't think I could keep working with this coworker and needed to leave. He told me that he thought I was overreacting, and kind of implied that it was because I wasn't well, and that if I'd been more reliable he could have actually addressed the problem years ago when it started. He said that he'd give me a reference but I should think carefully about what the problem actually was.

It's made me doubt whether this is actually a shitty scenario and I should leave or if I'm just going to be crap at doing any job, no matter where I am. I don't know if I am overreacting or not, and if I should just suck it up. Any thoughts?

EDIT: I think part of the reason this gets to me so much is that we have nowhere near the number of doctors we need and the health system is completely fucked. 50% of my day is just apologising to people and telling them we can't help and good luck. And when I'm working with the rest of the team it feels like it's us against it all. When I'm with him I just need to work harder so the patients we do see at least get some level of care. He's an extra obstacle to their care, and I just want my patients to be safe."

What time of day should I give notice? We start the day with team meetings before my boss has a list of other meetings with outside interests. 

A technical issue prevents me from seeing her calendar, which means I don't know when she is available. Should I give notice first thing in the morning? Wait to see if she has time? Send it the next day via email (tacky)?

I kept thinking, I was gonna make almost double I was and ended up working about 55 hours my first week, no lunches, no breaks.. just work and being micro managed by the owner constantly. Then I put in over 40 this week so far when my pre-deposit posted on Wed night. Thursday I asked him why my check was light and he flips out, saying he paid me more than he should have, if anything.  I asked how I could see my paystub and he once again get mad, prints me out this handwritten schedule and gives it to me, while saying, I also took out 30 mins a day for lunch. Which is the first time I've even heard this.  


Needless to say, he's running an illegal operation with non plate registered vans. No one has a DCJS. The vans are on their last leg. (owner said he was going to turn them in at the end of the month)   
I spent the week installing used parts, having to Frankenstein old and new parts to make things work.

Others however seem to hold the view that essentially your employer owns you from 9-5 and that your job role, responsibility and workload can change and that's just how it is.

I think ultimately it comes down to how valuable are you ie if you're valuable you can push back or demand more, if your not that valuable you suck it up and take on the new tasks or responsibilties, but I was just curious what is your guys take on this? If you're given additional tasks, more responsibilities or the scope of your job changes would you ask for a raise or just say that's how jobs work?"

Companies will usually ask you to write some code to solve a problem in 30-45 minutes while they're visually critiquing your code through their body language. And that's just the first interview. There's sometimes one or two more after that before you see an offer. Companies seem to only want someone who can code the fastest rather than someone who would take time to understand exactly how the system works. It's also infuriating that they usually refuse to give any feedback afterwards every time I ask as well. It's impossible to understand what I need to work on if I'm never told.

But I want out of this field for several solid reasons (among which is the culture, which is not changing any time soon) but the pay is about 30% or more higher than comparable jobs elsewhere. 

As an example, a recruiter called me yesterday about Job A, pays just over 6 figures. Problem is it's the same job I've struggled with and had to leave twice in 18 months now. Same field. I'm honestly not sure I can ever succeed in that role--I was working my tail off in those other two roles and still flamed out.

My other interview leads are offering rigid W-2 contract work for just over half that salary, and often require M-F in office. And no benefits. 

Any other *women* in this position? I'd specifically like to hear from you. Either tips on navigating a heavily male dominated ""heritage"" field (meaning not emerging tech) and/or how to leverage the experience into a more friendly field."

The job is a understaffed, has no training, and is leaving me seriously stressed. Therefore, I decided to give notice.

The issue is that my boss is returning to work Wednesday from dealing with a family issue. I don't want to give her the inconvenient news of my departure so soon after she comes back, but I don't have much choice.

What time of day should I give notice? We start the day with team meetings before my boss has a list of other meetings with outside interests.

A technical issue prevents me from seeing her calendar, which means I don't know when she is available. Should I give notice first thing in the morning? Wait to see if she has time? Send it the next day via email (tacky)?

Also, I am planning on giving the standard two-week notice, so I am taking some work samples, creating some how-to guides, and drafting a list of ongoing projects. How much of this should be done before I give notice?

I would appreciate any thoughts on being gracious and preparing effectively. Thanks!"

I have a job interview coming up for a position in accounts payable, which I was surprised to have been contacted about since I'm afraid my financial abilities aren't on par with others in the field. I'm not too concerned with being able to do the job, what I'm more concerned about is the technical questions that might come my way during the interview. I haven't picked up a finance book in a long time. 

I do have office administration experience and I've worked in a variety of tasks including pulling up department budgets, answering questions when someone has inquiries about their funds, creating and editing Excel budget sheets to keep track of when funds are used and what they're used for.

I also have interactions with vendors for things related to purchasing (e.g. obtaining quotes, making sure the quote doesn't contain taxes since the institution I worked for is tax-exempt, getting invoices/receipts, etc.), entering line items one by one from the quotes into the company database to start a purchase order (including item descriptions, quantity, price), making sure the items will go to the correct person and address, and uploading the necessary documents for the purchase order before sending it off for approval. Once the order comes in, I check the items that have arrived with the shipping papers to make sure the correct items and the right number of items have been sent in. Then I go into the database and mark off which items have been received so the vendors can get their payment.

I also make purchases using the company's purchasing cards. Then I upload the receipts to the company's database and make sure the dollar amount is correct before sending the receipts off to finalize payment to the vendors.

I also have some experience handling a type of document that's used to pay guest speakers who want to come visit and lecture or perform for a short period of time.

In addition, I have experience with time-keeping when it comes to the employee payroll.

With all that said, what should I quickly review when it comes to specific duties for accounts payable?"

Is this not unreasonable? I mentioned to my boss originally that my goal was to have it done by Monday end of day but he said no, let’s get it done for Friday. How do I respond to this?

I saw another long rant saying the same. Thing is tho, I'm in Canada, that review was posted in the US, and the job description doesn't even mentioning going door to door selling stuff. 

And it says the pay is 20 an hour (through Indeed) so I'm confused. 

The job description says ""Our Customer Sales Representative are tasked with connecting with clients to understand their unique goals and challenges while marketing and selling their products/memberships or services to the public. Sales methods include in-person, B2B, phone and virtual sales. This is an in-office role coupled with B2B and/or field sales.""

Within 2 minutes of applying to one, I received a call from someone whom I could hardly understand, offering me a position, and asking me to sign paperwork via Adobe.

Upon further investigation it appears this posting is for an “organization” of some sort that is not actually affiliated with the position listed on Indeed. 

Rather a competing company amongst other like companies that create these listings and “recommend” me to the ACTUAL employer. 

What I have is the ACTUAL employer that is hiring, and a handful of these organizations and the paperwork I signed stated that I won’t allow any other organization represent me to the ACTUAL employer including myself. 

I recently have been contacted by the actual employer because I applied directly to them. 

Are these organizations scams?  Can someone educate me how they work, and why they do this?

I've had 4 separate jobs since then (and many more job offers) and this is the first time I've ever gotten asked for a transcript. Note that I've already produced a copy of my degree and sent it to them, but they recently called me telling me I'm their ""first choice"" and that it would be an easier pitch to the executives at the company if they had my grades. This tells me that it really is the *grades* they're after, not the proof of graduation. They said it would help assess my ""learning capacity"".

Full disclosure, I was not a model student. I barely passed simply through lack of effort/care. Fortunately, this is *not* a reflection of how I work, and I excel in my field and work very hard. I just find it unnerving that they would ask for my grades and not even mention professional references, something I'd be much more comfortable providing.

Coupled with the recession looming over our heads which makes switching jobs a little scary right now, this is an employer that I was on the fence about to begin with, so I have half a mind to simply drop out of the application process. Is it irrational that I'm taken aback by the request for my grades, in a major that isn't even related to my field, 7 years into my career?

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: So I decided to oblige, out of sheer curiosity if nothing else. Also, I didn't have to pay a fee for my official transcript as I initially thought, and ended up finding it archived somewhere in my old email inbox.

I actually ended up getting a very generous offer despite my 2.7 GPA, which means either they really liked me or they simply wanted the transcript as proof of graduation. In any case, I've got some thinking to do... "

1,2023-03-17,Was it a bad idea to send a thank you email?,u/Many_Leading,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11tydcw/was_it_a_bad_idea_to_send_a_thank_you_email/,jobs,"TLDR: Sent personalized thank you email for position I really want to 3 interviewers but worried it will look desperate and hurt my chances because the first interview went very poorly.



I did three interviews yesterday, all in the same day. The first interview was TERRIBLE. The guy spent the whole time telling me that he thought I didn't care about the position, and that he doesn't see me staying in the position if I were to get it. That was just one of many things wrong. 

The second interview was WAY better. The guy was genuinely nice and interested in my background and work history. I felt like I blew this one out of the water. 

The third was average. I felt like I answered the questions correctly but I didn't feel like I stood out compared to the previous. 


I really wanted this position, so I decided to write three personalized thank you emails. Each had a different reason why I enjoyed learning about the position and why I'd be qualified. As well as a highlight from each convo that I enjoyed. Each email was 3 paragraphs about 2-3 sentences long. 

After sending these, I've seen conflicting opinions across the whole internet about how ""thank you emails are a great idea"" vs ""they can make you look desperate and cheap and hurt your chances"". 

Can sending these emails really be that bad and ruin the chance for someone who would've gotten hired?"

26 YO in the Power Distribution Engineering realm. Work on a lot of transmission projects and substation projects. My current company is subcontracted by the main utility company who I now have a contract offer from. The work would differ slightly, but a lot of it would boil down to the same thing. The new offer position would likely have 15%ish more of ""field or site visits"".

I am on very good terms with my current company and nothing is essentially ""wrong"", but this new opportunity found me at a much higher compensation rate. What would you do?

**Current Position:**

* ""Supervisor"" title, manage a team of 6 and on very, very good terms with my management team and have made a good name for myself as far up as VP in a Fortune 500 company. I even accepted an award from our CEO as a ""Excellent Young Talent"" recently in a 30,000+ person company.
* $95.5K Base, no bonus, 6% 401K match, get about $3,000 in other ""perks"" I would say
* Relaxed work environment, remote 4 days a week and in the office 1. I am about an hour away from the office with traffic, but still not bad.
* Pretty good opportunity for growth
* 3 Weeks PT

**New Position CONTRACT Offer:**

* Individual contributor role, normal ""Engineer"" (i.e., somewhat a step down from my current title)
* $150K Base
* OT is 1.5x, so around $104/hr
* No 401K match
* I think the company will not be as structured, and I definitely will have to start over a create a good name for myself. The office here would be 5-10 minutes from me, but I would have to go in likely 2-3 times a week and/or have customer/site visits.
* 2 YR CONTRACT W2 Employee role from recruiting firm, opportunity to go direct hire with actual company as early as 6 months
* 2.5 weeks of ""vacation hours"" (accrues at 1hr per 20 hours worked). Not sure if this is paid time off or unpaid time off...

How would you approach this? Should I try to get more money from my current employer and perhaps tarnish that relationship (i.e., it might look bad if they see me looking for other roles). I am not sure what to do."

Now they want to do a 90 minute panel interview with the entire team from one dept. 

I’m still interested but this feels like major overkill. Is this a red flag? The recruiter told me all of my feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and that this is the final step so that I get a 360 degree view of what the stakeholder’s thoughts are and gain their input.

I have changed industries and am now  actively seeking IT positions.  I have had a side gig in IT for the past 15 years and am now looking for full time IT positions.

I have been informally offered two positions.  Job A, I want for the money and experience.  Job B I want for just the experience (i.e pay is subpar).

Anyways at the end of the second interview for Job A, They offered me the position, and said that HR had to finalize everything and to expect an offer in the near future.  This is most definitely the job I want.

Job B will give me good experience, but will pay almost 15k less per year.  They called me and informally made the job offer to me.

The informal offer from Job A and the informal offer from Job B was only 30 minutes apart.  They will both be contacting next week.

&amp;#x200B;

I fully intend to decline Job B if Job A follows through.   If Job B calls first, how should I handle that phone call?  


Edit: Job A called at 8am on Monday.  Office staff arrives at 8am.  So like 2 working hours had passed from the time they informally offered me the job and the time I got the formal offer.

Everyone I’ve met has been very nice and helpful. My problem is that I have very little to do most of the day, and any tasks I’m given take no more than 10-15 mins to complete. I pretty much sit at my desk all day scrolling the news/listening to podcasts/music and light work here and there with little to no interaction with other people.

I received a job offer and with it a background check form from a company called universal background screening. 

The form sent to me only asks for my identifying info like my name, social security number places I’ve lived etc. they ask nothing about education and prior employment. It’s a professional office job so it’s surprising that they aren’t asking about these things. 

My concern is that I don’t have the option for them to not contact my current employer. Not that I have anything to hide, but my HR contact is also my senior manager, having seen this not go well for prior coworkers leaving - I would like to provide pay stubs W2’s etc instead of having the company reach out to the manager.  I want to leave on good terms. 

Is the company going to verify my prior employment/education? What’s going on here lol"

So I’ve been at my new job for about 7 months now. It’s a manager position in IT. I’m coming from an IT Director prior but this position got me to a different state that I was trying to move to and it paid a lot more with great experience potential. 


Now my team is awesome, these guys are some IT veterans who know their stuff. The problem here is upper management and the way the company is run. I was told how to rate my team and was forced to mark everyone as below average. I was also told how to do their compensation. Which was just done a few days ago. The decisions upper management is mind boggling. They don’t listen to the IT experts and just go with what’s convenient for me. It comes back to bite them later. The company has had such bad IT planning that now everything is becoming emergency fixes and everything is high priority. My team is forced to rush their job and are being told to do things that don’t make sense. I try to support them the best I can but even I have little say at this company.

What really frustrates me is how demanding this job is. My days are starting earlier and earlier but ending later. There is now a daily meeting that starts 7:30 am and my days often end after 5. Actually recently I pulled a 12 hour 7:30 - 7:30 day with half hour for lunch and my boss gave me a hard time for giving him a project update at 9:30pm instead of sooner. I’m sorry I needed to eat dinner and decompress. It’s also worth noting my days are FULL of meetings. I’m talking minimum 10 meetings a day. There’s no time to get actual work done. Plus some weekend work.

So I’m starting to regret taking my job. So I guess my question is, when do I start looking for another job so it doesn’t look bad on my resume? I was thinking 1 year. I hope I can make that, this job is burning me out."

The company came under new ownership and management 4 years ago, and while they CAN confirm I was an employee there, they have no records kept past 2019. So they can't verify my dates, why I left, etc. They had trouble reaching my old employer at first so 2 days before they spoke to them they asked me to supply their contact info and w2's/paystubs. Unfortunately I only have w2's for 2012, 2013, and 2014. I worked there from 2010-2014 so I am missing 2010 and 2011.

I've done everything I can. I have flipped my house upside down to try and find the old w2's, but I truly don't think I have them. I went to the IRS website and they only have my info as far back as 2013. Social Security has a copy of my earnings but it's not specific. To get a specific copy that states my employers name it costs $100 and takes up to 120 days to process. I switched banks in 2017 so I do not have access to bank statements. They do not accept Turbo Tax Filings either. I have gone through emails, messages, etc. hoping somewhere along the way I sent a picture of a sad paystub to someone but nothing. 

My question is.. am I panicking for no reason? Has ANYONE been in this situation and found an alternative I haven't mentioned already? Or did they end up being OK? Should I contact my recruiter? HireRight has submitted the info they have to them. I need this job and idk what I will do if I have an offer rescinded due to not having a w2 from 12-13 years ago. 🙃"

Definitely looking more into it if they don’t give me those extra four though.

…………..

I work in Southern California and have been at this McDonald’s for almost three years. I had to take a couple days off this past week because I was sick and thought I would use 15 of the accrued hours I have saved up. My boss mentioned it would be smart to be more mindful as I only get 20 hours a year, which did not make sense to me.

I began this year with 48 hours. My grandma ended up passing in February so I had to use my sick pay for my own mental health and to deal with family stuff in between. That left me with the current 30ish hours I have now. This meant that I would basically only be allowed 4 more hours for the whole year, despite having many more on my pay stub balance. I know McDonald’s franchises have different policies for sick pay, but I assumed that I would be able to use what it tells me I have.

Why do they bother telling me how many sick hours I saved if I won’t be able to use them at all? Are there any laws that prevent me from seeing this money? I know the response I’ll probably get from this would be to contact HR, but I’m wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar to this."

Once I have a signed offer letter I intend to gtfo of my current *extremely* toxic job, like that day. I’m in a director level role at the most unorganized, chaotic company with the absolute most toxic, hostile, all around terrible executive administration I have encountered in my nearly 15 years working in my industry. Really, words can’t describe. Just to give a sense of how bad it is, the director above me quit without notice 3 months after *she* started (she was a fantastic leader). I have witnessed 4 additional resignations in my very short time there - more than in the entire 3 years I was at my last job (a similar organization in size and scope). Upper management are so hostile that I truly do not feel comfortable resigning in person, let alone working out a notice period. I’m accustomed to giving 4 weeks notice, so this is a first for me.

I’m thinking I will leave my equipment and ID on my desk at the end of the day and send an email stating essentially that I won’t be back the next day - that I’m resigning effective immediately. Thoughts? Has anyone left a toxic job without giving notice? Tell me your stories"

Is it wrong to feel guilty?,u/Dazedf,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ue1mx/am_i_moving_to_a_new_job_too_quickly_is_it_wrong/,jobs,"So I (22M) just graduated college last May and started working remote for a pretty standard engineering firm. It has amazing PTO (5 weeks) and ok insurance. But the actual job is more entry level engineering and not at all in my field of interest nor is the pay anything special. It’s honestly taking a toll mentally not bc it’s difficult - rather I feel like I’m not contributing to anything useful from the same spot at home. I find myself struggling to stay motivated. It’s a nice job for entry level but just not engaging enough for me. So I updated my resume and reached out to a few companies. 

Today I learned one of the companies I found interesting wanted to interview me a week from now. I said yes but now feel a little hesitant as I’m leaving a comfortable reliable job for one in a nearby city. I haven’t worked the current company a full year (about 9 months to date) and don’t have too much experience as I couldn’t land an engineering internship during college. Also moving away from home but not too far. 

Would it look bad leaving before a year? And what would you do in my situation? I still will do the interview to ask further questions but wanted to get some feedback."

Instead of wasting my time arguing with them I started applying internally in a different department. I have an interview scheduled on Monday that I will prepare for this weekend. 

I feel good about this new position and will be making at least 10-15k more dollars annually compared to my current position and will be offered a 5 percent signing bonus if I get the position.

I don’t want to get ahead of myself but assuming I do get the position, do I still need to give my supervisor a two week notice if I am transferring departments? I wasn’t even planning on telling my supervisor I was leaving but the internal recruiter requested that I let them know that I was applying to other positions on March 7th. 

Long story short my supervisor has claimed that the reason people are leaving our company is because I am sharing negative information to them and the customers we work with. My supervisor’s boss is on their side, but my supervisor is making a risky move because after I leave, they won’t be able to use that as an excuse for their bad management skills. I personally believe they will be fired by the end of this year but I will not be there to see it happen. Part of me feels like telling my supervisor’s boss “if my supervisor’s position opens up later this year, give me a call and I will consider it.” 

Anyways sorry for the long rant but I just have never worked under such a poorly organized supervisor that lacks the skills required to do their job."

I finally received an offer that I've been waiting for for a while.  But it wasn't as much as I was hoping.

Here's the situation.

**Current job:** $90,000 with possible 6% bonus (last year we got 2%).  Also, I'm expecting my yearly raise in June or July. That's usually 2 to 3%.  I’m also “up” for a promotion, but they’ve been stringing me along for awhile with that.  3 promotions away from “manager title”

The job is super boring. I don't love the work but it's easy. It's 100% remote and I find myself working 2, maybe 3 hours a day. Some days I jump in a meeting and then that's the end of my day.

The problem is there's really no upward mobility. If I got a promotion I would be doing the same exact work with a 10% pay bump.  I also do not care at all about this company's business.  My eyes glaze over during team calls.



**New job** offer at a company I love and worked for for 12 years (ended due to COVID): $90,000 with a possible 10% bonus (I have a query in to find out what the metrics are for success on that).  Manager title and leader of a team of 10.

Hybrid 3 days a week (very close to home).

The job was posted $70k - 90k and when I said that was too low, the hiring manager agreed (HR set it not them) and said that everyone agreed it should be higher and not to worry.

During my final interview (with HR) they asked how much I was looking for and I said 110k.

After they told me the offer over the phone I told them I was really looking for more.  They said they had heard I wanted more but this is as high as the compensation team would go but I could try.

I told them 100k and I'd sign.  Hoping to hear back on Monday.


I think I’m looking for a confirmation bias here.  Even if it stayed at $90,000, it would be amiss for me not to take a job with a better title and a better career path - even if it was more work right?"

Hey all, so I have a dilemma since at the moment I’m searching for a job.

Now some background is I initially interviewed for another role with company 2 - unfortunately didn’t get it however the recruiter really took a liking to me and has put me forward for another position, only thing is it’s a part time role. 

In this time I also received another job offer from company 1. I feel inclined to take the company 2 offer since this is really a great place to be able to get into, but feel as though maybe it’s not the best since I’ll have to supplement with another part time job.

So I guess I’d like to ask, what would you do? I know you can just say whatever feels ‘right’ but I do want to gain some other perspectives. 

PS I’m based in AUS so super is our employer retirement contribution. 


Company 1 offer:
- 64k + 10.5% super
- full-time perm 38 hours 
-not much room to grow 
-standard admin job, nothing too exciting  but nothing horrible 


Company 2 offer:

- 83k + 17% super (pro-rata)
- part-time perm (20 hours)
- really reputable institution doing interesting work and highly rated for workplace culture
- not much view to go full-time in the near future however a lot of internal opportunities"

**Company A  |  Salary: $52.5k + SOB  |  Setting: In Office**


**Pros:** likely to offer fast upward mobility, longevity, great household name clients, great culture, and these people both respect and desire my work

**Cons:** limited to a single industry that may have a large impact on choices later in life (is not directly aligned with future goals, but *does* offer the management exp I will need for later)

**Company B  |  Salary: $65k  |  Setting: hybrid**

**Pros:** I'd be working directly with SME, great household name clients, works with many different industries and products (some of which align perfectly with my future goals), hybrid setting would help me with handing courses starting fall

**Cons:** This company was acquired by a big name 3 months ago (could this mean layoffs in near future?), the culture seems pretty disingenuous, unlikely to promote, I am unsure of their turnover rate, will not offer me management exp I'll eventually need

Bottom line:  I desperately need a job rn.  Context: each offer is definitely a jump up from anything I've previously had.  Reality of my dilemma: The next position will need to be kept min 2 yrs, time I need to treat like an investment if I want to feasibly achieve certaint career goals

The executive chef of my department left his role after 10 years, and the company is now hiring a successor. I happened to get the job posting on Glassdoor via email, and I clicked on it just to read it. I am very underqualified for that role and would never actually apply at this point in my career (there's an entire role in the middle of sous chef). In fact, it would be kind of embarrassing to apply.

I got an email from Glassdoor titled ""saelr, have you heard back from \[name of restaurant\]?"". In the email there is an area with the job posting, and underneath it says ""Days Open: 65 / You applied: 12 days ago"". I freaked out thinking I applied on accident, thinking I didn't even have a Glassdoor account. The email is from my Google email, so I'm assuming it logged in via Google.

I logged into Glassdoor with my Google account, but on the account it has nothing under ""recent searches"" and nothing under ""application"". This gave me some relief, but I'm still worried a bit about this. My current theory is that I somehow *began* the application process as in I clicked ""apply"", but then didn't fill out any of the forms. Which triggers the automatic emails thinking I applied.

Anybody have any ideas on what's going on?"

The employer I'm working with hired mt about 3 months ago as a graphic designer with a salary of about 165 us dollars a month roughly
Everything was going okay until this month he said that they don't really require the work of a graphic designer any more and that he was willing to offer me a job as a moderator instead, and the moderator's salary in their company is about 67 us dollars.. I was desperate for any money because I have no other source of income so I said okay..
Then I realized a moderator at their page is someone who replies to all messages 24 hours and exports Excel sheets with clients whenever they ask, and basically manages their wordpress orders too..
I feel like shit all the time and I constantly can't thing of or do anything because it's literally a 24 hour job and even though orders don't come that often messages do and I have to reply to every single one and take account of whom I've placed the order for and whom I haven't and that is nowhere near my specialty at all so it's placing a great mental load on me..

But at the same time if I leave I have no source of income at all and I know this sounds crazy but I wanted to stay so that one day I might get my graphic designer original job back..

What should I do?"

Last week, I’ve had an interview for a full-time role in Digital Transformation. 

The interview, with HR and Hiring Manager, was supposed to last 45 minutes. Their interview questions and my questions ended after 40 minutes, leaving 5 minutes left. Nonetheless, after the HR already wrapped the interview up by telling me that they would share the outcome in the coming days, the Hiring Manager intervened. He said: “I know that we have few minutes left, so I would like to ask you a final question myself (which was about my future aspirations in the long-run).”

Do you think that it’s a good signal? In my mind, if they didn’t like me, the Hiring Manager would have simply let the meeting end 5 minutes earlier than planned."

Recently a company approached to hire me for a managerial level with a salary of 72k + undetermined bonus ranging from (6-20k). However, the market salary for the job would be closer to 96k, and the reason why they offered me 72k was because of my last pay, despite meeting all their requirements.

Am i passing on a good deal? I know taking on this role will at least bump my status to a manager and perhaps get me to a better position in the future, but the pay is disappointing.

EDIT: i have been contacted by a few headhunters, all of whom asked my last drawn salary. Is it wishful thinking to have an expected salary that is 50% more of your current salary?"

I have a final interview with hiring manager and their manager in a week.   I currently have a short 5 day vacation planned in July, which would require 2-3 working days off.   Depending on if and when I get an offer this might fall within the first 90 days or not, hard to say until there’s an offer.   

So far in interviews potential start dates haven’t come up, I just noted on the app that i am available immediately pending 2 weeks notice to current employer.   In my past experience start dates were always discussed with recruiter at offer time.  

So unless the recruiter or manager asks me about availability before or during the final interview, am I okay mentioning this at the time of potential offer?   I know I’ve always been asked if I had any planned time off, this just happens to be the first case in which I do.   I also don’t need any time off for the foreseeable future beyond that.   Am I over thinking this?  Is mentioning it a potential dealbreaker?   Is a company likely to say no to such a request?   And lastly if they say it’s fine do I lose any leverage with other potential negotiating points?"

It was for a remote job and the interview seemed legit. The recruiter is located in the same region as me, but the employer would be overseas. I haven't had an interview with the employer as of yet. She gave me the name of the employer during the interview and when I tried to look them up  afterwards, I found a ""broken"" website where I couldn't see any info. Maybe it was because of my IP address. However, I tried to access it with a VPN, but I still got the same interface. My friend who lives in EU tried to open it and came across the same problem as me. I tried to search about the company on LinkedIn, but I could only find one profile of a person who allegedly works there, and it's hidden. I asked the recruiter via mail to provide me with a source, anything, where I can find about them myself, but got no response. I have an excel assessment to take, but don't know if I should. Is this a major red flag?

Update: thank you all for your insights. I later found where they were registered at. It looks like a one man company, and that man has many other companies as well. Apart from that empty website, they had no social media presence whatsoever. And their core value is transparency, lol. I withdrew my application."

I’m currently in a sales job and have been here for about 3 years post grad. It’s uncapped commission and i’ve done well, however in recent months i’ve underperformed a bit and i’m making less. Still decent money though. 

I went through several months of absolutely hating my job and feeling so much anxiety about it. I started applying and got rejected so many times but was focusing on jobs that were AM or CS rather than AE or BDR roles. 

I ended up applying to a job that would be remote outside sales and received an offer. The company seems great and the salary is higher than my base but there is no commission and i’d still be making less money than I currently make even underperforming.

I am unsure of what to do here. In recent weeks my current job has been less miserable and I have the security and familiarly. I’m scared if I take this new role that’s less money I’ll regret leaving and be in a worse position.

Any advise is appreciated!"

I started out with a very low salary with no internships. About a year ago I got an offer from another company and accepted a counter-offer to stay for a salary in the low six figures. I’m happy with my job and the company is still doing well despite the economic downturn with no signs of slowing down.

I worked remotely out of state for a couple months last year and have been looking to move there since. My job required a return to office 3 days a week 6 months ago and almost no one including upper management shows up more than once a week. We also have a bunch of employees out of state that will work remotely indefinitely, but HR is not allowing “remote conversions” at this time.

I’m in a weird situation in that I’m well respected at my current job, but I can’t find a new job that will pay close to what I make with the market downturn. I’ve had around 10 interviews over the past 6 months and received a couple offers below my current salary so far, but I wasn’t really interested in these companies anyways.

One thing I have to my advantage is that I have a good rapport with my boss and the tech VP and they have struggled with attrition over the past year, so I don‘t think they are willing to just let more people go. My boss said he personally won’t enforce any office mandates and won’t be complying with RTO. The company can clearly accommodate remote despite HR policy, as they have remote employees around the country. 

I feel like it would be foolish to leave a solid job in this current market as it puts me on the top list for layoffs, but at the same time it has been rough for my mental health living here and looking to move asap.

Any advice for pushing to be allowed to relocate and work remotely at my current job? I’m trying to make a case in a way that I don’t risk losing my job, while also conveying that relocating is something that’s really important to me."

Not because I have been making errors in my job, but for email etiquette and time management.

On February 9th, my bosses took away my promotion and ever since then everything has been gone downhill. 

It was the most ridculous thing i was called in for that i felt like saying Id like the CEO to be in here too to see how much time is being wasted and the nitpicking my boss is doing.

Time managemt case was im unexpectly away from my cubicle, and its funny because the boss and i agreed that i would let them know and text them where ill be away from my desk.  Usally not to socialize.. What i forgot to add in my counter arguemtn was, am i not completing all my tasks? Lets bring in my job details and see that all of which are being done on a timely manner including the added tasks after being hired.

Email Ettiquete, which was soo completely bullshit for my bosses to list that considering they fucked up in one, one of email etteique listed were contacting a client that is longer with us, at the time, my bosses said why did i send the email to this client and how multiple emails were sent to me. Funny part was that there were no emails that stated this, and i wrote that in my retraction arguement on the back of the paper. 

Other was not adding notes on our newly system of transitioning over to and any interactions made are not being added which was told to me 3 weeks ago and ever since then ive been following their commands. But why did that get to HR when clearly that has been being done and wrote in my retraction argument to the HR to sit down with me and show you all my notes added to the system and not one being missed anytime a interacition is made.

Because this is clearly all were nitpicked and all really had nothing to do with my actual job whether Im making actual errors or not with reports.

Its getting to the point where I feel like I am being harrased and the bosses are trying to pad up my files. The day after neglecting everything my boss nitpikced me on, she continued to do the same yesterday with emails being sent to me why was there this grammar mistake and that grammar mistake.

I understand getting an offer is in no way a sure thing and I know there are some external candidates already being looked at, but I think I would at least be considered. I want to formally apply and “throw my hat in ring,” but my company’s policy is making me apprehensive about applying.  They require you to inform your current manager before applying for another role. 

My current manager is very intense and treats our department and office like it is HIS company. He is fine as long as you are working for him, but the second I tell him I’m looking into another role, I know he will be hurt and it will be awkward. It’s just not worth it if I don’t end up getting the job, but I obviously won’t know that unless I apply.

I’m starting a new position (remote) and I’m currently just working out the on-boarding portion. I start this Monday, and I have yet to receive my company email. 

I emailed my manger about this yesterday (Friday) and she replied today (Saturday) stating she sent my temp password to my company email. To which I don’t have access too. 

We’re going to have a meeting at 10:30 this coming Monday and she says she will send the link. But didn’t clarify if it was through my personal email or company email. 


She also stated she’s away from her computer so she cannot send the link till the weekday, which I completely respect and I plan to send a message to her on Monday. 

So my question is what do I do now? I don’t want to seem like a nuisance with all these questions. But I really don’t have the password to my company email. Should I just wait till Monday morning and see what happens?"

I've been in my job for a year now and recently was offered a job elsewhere which I've accepted. I resigned last week and my boss didn't ask me anything other than when my last day would be.

My team has 3 managers, and while we all each have our own direct manager, it more or less feels like all 3 of them are our joint boss. I do a ridiculous amount of work for these people and decided to move on as I was sick of carrying the weight of the team and the lack of development opportunities. I've made my frustrations known over the last few months, nothing crazy but loud enough that they do know I've been frustrated. 

I know it's only been a year, but I'm surprised that absolutely zero questions were asked about why I was leaving from any of them. Am I being silly?"

Please help.,u/itsokiloveu,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11v37v4/my_manager_is_so_awful_to_me_im_thinking_of/,jobs,"I work as a server at a restaurant and one of the four managers we have is so abusive towards me it’s driving me to quit entirely. 

She is always so rude. She condescends to me, makes an effort to point out when I don’t know something or are unaware of a specific fact. 

She has criticized every.single.outfit. I wear to work, saying thinks like “isn’t that top a little fancy?” “Isn’t that dress a little tight?” “Aren’t those pants a little loose?” “Why would you wear that to work?” And “really…? You chose white sneakers for a dirty floor?”

I literally cannot clothe myself without her finding a flaw in what I’m wearing. Next, she denies me a break more than 15 minutes when I’m working a double (10-12 hour shift). 

She ignores me completely when I say hello, while engaging with all of the male servers. When the restaurant is completely dead and I’m having a brief conversation with a colleague, she snaps her fingers at me to “get back to work” only for me to watch her walk off and gossip for a half hour with other male co-workers. 

She 100% chooses to pick on me specifically, as I don’t see her treating any of the men the same way she treats myself and other young women I work with. 

While I was setting a table (which obviously I know how to do) she came over, slammed the cutlery down and said “FASTER.” 

Today, one of my favorite female co-workers was crying her eyes out in the break room. I walked past said manager who asked “where is Sarah?” (let’s call the co-worker Sarah). I said “she’s having her break, and is a little upset right now”. I was hoping my manager would give her some extra time and leniency seeing as she was clearly in emotional distress to which she looked me dead in the eyes and said “Don’t. You. Dare. I don’t care, and I don’t wanna hear it. Just don’t”. 

I was honestly in complete and utter shock at her lack of empathy I almost immediately started to cry, and my manager turns back and goes “I don’t wanna hear about anyone crying ever again”. 

I’m thinking she’s either a narcissist or a sociopath. I cannot stand her. Her very presence induces major anxiety and panic in my bones. She becomes angry and irritated at my very existence. 

The other 3 managers are alright, tolerable, or very nice but she goes out of her way to make my life a living hell. I have 0 clue as to why she hates me so much. I have never done anything to her and have been nothing but cordial. 

Should I quit because she’s affecting my mental health? My heart skips a beat when I see her name on the schedule because I already know I’ll be yelled at or condescended to before the shift even begins."

It wasn't too bad because my job was easy and I never had to go into the office. Now we're being tracked and my manager has become a raging asshole since the end of last year. I just felt like I wouldn't mind working harder if I could get paid more. So I started applying hoping to practice and not expecting any offers because I hadn't done any interviews since I was still a student.

I got an interview and it went relatively well. The hiring manager called and I thought it was to offer me the job. He asked what salary I was looking for and I didn't expect the question so I said I was open. He then asked what I made now. I make just over $72k but I said $75k and immediately regretted it because I'm trying to increase my base by switching companies of course. I just wasn't prepared for that question.

He called later to make a verbal offer for $80k which was disappointing. For reference I have friends with the same degree and experience and field as me and the lowest paid one makes $85k so I was really hoping to get to $85k. I've never negotiated but my friends said to always counter. I just feel I'm not in a great position to negotiate since I already told him what I make now. Then again switching companies for a $5k increase feels kinda low (from his perspective that I'm at $75k now).

I got some advice to say I have another offer but I prefer to work with them and can they make a higher offer but I was given contradictory advice that it'd be a bad idea and just to ask for more (say I was hoping to get in the range of $85-90k and can they get to that). What's the best way to negotiate this? I don't want to ruin my chance but I don't want to accept less than I think I'm worth because I feel I'm undervalued currently. Thank you for the help."

My concern is that I most likely won't be able to attend on this date because I will be visiting my home country for the entire month of April.

I didn’t even want to show up anymore. It’s a well paid but terrible environment, so I gave my two weeks. I was happy and excited about my new job which seems like a big upgrade.

But now I’ve had to deal with very dense conversations, people acting like I have betrayed the business and that I’m a terrible person, people trying to bully me to keep my line (phone) open after I quit when the reason I’m quiting is can’t stand their calls and texts 24/7 at 7 am 9 pm, saturdays, etc. It has been a nightmare. 

How to handle the last two weeks? It’s come to the point where they have killed my excitement and have managed to guilt trip me and not only that but pushing me to work like a dog in last two weeks.

Honestly I get where ppl come from when they quit with no notice.

Boss is trying to bully to ask my new employer to give them two extra weeks. 

It’s just a tense environment and supposedly we are even going to go eat out w a bunch of people for a farewell. I know there will be more guilt tripping. I have been treated like garbage for years.

How to deal w this and not let them burn me out to the point where they affect my motivation on the new job?"

0,2023-03-18,Am I in the wrong,u/Background-Low-3166,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11v8qta/am_i_in_the_wrong/,jobs,"So I left my old retail job in Feb after 2 years &amp; applied to target thinking I wasn’t gonna be hired but I did. I applied for the general merchandise position but got style. I was slightly disappointed since I didn’t want to be folding clothes for the next year of my life again but I figured since the pay is good and i only have to work 5-10:30 pm it shouldn’t be that bad. I was wrong. 

The first week of working there the person training me told me they’d expect me to recover half of their clothing departments by myself (folding &amp; organizing them by size, making sure everything’s off the floor and put on hangers also arranged by size) while having to organize shoes + run clothes from fitting rooms. It just wasn’t physically possible. I thought maybe it will get better but having to be there 30 hours a week while in school when I applied part time was miserable. I was there almost every night w/ no time outside of work for other things and they knew I didn’t need that amount of hours WEEKLY bc I have no kids or rent. 

So I felt the excess amount of hours was unnecessary. I started getting back pain having to bend down 100 times to pick up things from the floor bc the store was a MESS 24/7. And when I say a mess I mean Idek how people walked thru the aisles bc there would just be shit all over the floor and the shoes would be all out of their boxes mismatched and no matter how many times you fixed it it would end up looking like it did a few mins later and I know that’s retail but this was on a whole another level. 

Two women literally left a few weeks after me being hired. So it was just me and one other woman having to do most of the work. The morning people who were responsible for putting away the go backs in the morning barely did their job and then it would be left for the closing team which one of the style leads even confessed to me being a issue they were trying to work on. Clearly to no success though. 

I truly felt like it wasn’t worth $15. I started thinking to myself I’ve been here for a month and I don’t like anyone here so far, I’m being overworked, I end up leaving the store past 10:30 pm &amp; get home at 12, and I just didn’t even want to work in style in the first place. I decided to apply to other places w/ the same pay but closed earlier and wasn’t retail. I found a acai place where you get tips and could help give me food industry experience so I went for a interview and got hired. 

But then I was stuck at a crossroad. How do I leave target if I basically just started working there and they are already understaffed as it is without being a douchebag. I can’t. So I made the decision to stop going in &amp; they terminated me today :) The email was very straight forward and harsh. They basically gave me a ultimatum. I do feel some guilt for leaving so abruptly the way I did but I’m sure they have tons of other ppl to hire &amp; replace me. Now I’m worried ab someone there coming to eat where I work now but I don’t think any of them would."

Been at the organization for 5 years, started as an intern,had a few promotions, and  I’ve been at the director level for a little over a year. I’m looking to find a new opportunity, but most director level job announcements ask you to have 10-20 years of experience. Although I’ve only been at the company for 5 years, the workload and amount of hats I’ve had to wear (as well as my portfolio and skillset) can easily be comparable to 10 years of experience.

During grad school, I was an investigator on a couple of research projects, but that was so long ago and the duties I performed then, have nothing to do with the roles I’m applying for.

My question is, is it a bad look to only have had one job? Throughout my adult life (last 10 years) I’ve consistently held side gigs as a bartender (which is the complete opposite of my current field) because I love having the extra cash. 

Will having only one relevant professional experience hinder my search? What do y’all think?"

My director and most of my co-workers are based in another location in a different city so I don't get the chance to interact with them that much. I feel so lonely and lost at my job.

Long story short, they want me to fill in a form, like an e-test. The first page was my identification etc, 2nd page was a personality test, 3rd page an IQ test, and then into the 4th &amp; 5th page when it asked about whats my father and mother's name, how old they are, where do they work, where are they from/birthplace. It also asked me about my family tree in details like how many brothers or sisters I have right now, their age, and what theyre doing currently. They added stuff like whats your education history, like school or college ive been to and in what year I graduate for each, and also if I got history with any kind of organizations(I feel like the last two is okay, but just in case). 

The rest of the questionaire are pretty understandable imo like how do you manage your financial, my vision and mission, where do you last apply for a job before applying our place, do you have any credits/loans that you still need to pay, basically stuff like that. So yeah that last page was pretty understandable but to know my whole my family that are pretty much confidential (that imo) made me scared.

I really need a job and they want me to submit this as soon as possible. Today is the last day to for me to submit it. Please do let me know if this is normal because from my experience, Ive never been asked questions like this before when applying to the same company but in a different place while also worked in a similar jobs like this previously.

I switched careers from firefighting and my first degree was in kinesiology. Sometimes, in interviews I keep getting asked why I switched from kinesiology to IT. I have CCNA, Microsoft, Azure, and Comptia certifications. So, I was looking for a degree that would give me higher paying roles and keep employers from asking that question.

I'm currently making around 55k and get interview for roles that pay around 50 to 70k, and was looking for a degree to increase my pay. The only thing is I don't really see MBAs required for IT roles. But, some people recommend the MBA for greater career progression. I'm looking at moving to a higher level system admin, infosec, system architect, or cloud admin.

However, the MBT masters in business and technology is online and the MBA is full time in person. With the online, it would be more convenient with work, but idk if it would be a bad option because I wouldn't be able to meet people. The MBA is in person but the classes are only from 8-5, and I'm currently working.

The MBA classes are mainly finance, accounting, strategy, operations, or leadership type classes. Whereas, the MBT has 2 programming, a database, and project management classes."

2,2023-03-19,I'm afraid of the future,u/FiachMney,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11vg72m/im_afraid_of_the_future/,jobs,"I am an 18-year-old engineering student enrolled in the highly competitive ""classes preparatoires"" program, specializing in mathematics and physics. With an exceptional academic record full of A+ grades, I had several options to choose from when deciding my academic path. However, my profound passion for mathematics and problem-solving led me to pursue CPGE, and I am currently relishing my studies and managing the program's demands with ease. I am confident I will secure a place at a prestigious institution once I complete this program (think of it like getting a master's degree from an ivy league). However, I am concerned about employment opportunities after graduation, given that the skills I am learning may not be highly sought after in the future. As the only child of a financially challenged family, I have always prioritized education to ensure financial stability. CPGE has always been renowned as ""l'ascenseur social,"" a means of social mobility for many, and it was the ideal path for me, given my love for math and physics and the need for financial security.

Despite feeling fulfilled in my current academic pursuits, I cannot help but feel a sense of uncertainty about my future in the face of rapid advancements in AI capabilities. While my decision to pursue CPGE over accepting scholarships to attend prestigious medical schools was based on my passions and desire for financial stability, I am now questioning whether it was the right decision. As society becomes increasingly reliant on AI technology, I worry that the skills I am learning may become less valuable in the job market. On the other hand, being a physician is a highly respected profession and is less likely to be automated in the coming years.

Although I still have the opportunity to attend medical school and potentially secure a stable job (but I would have to repeat a year), I fear that relinquishing my passion for math and physics would leave me unfulfilled. While CPGE is typically seen as the best academic path after high school, I am grappling with the uncertainty of my decision and the potential consequences for my future."

My manager is a bit of an overachiever, and sets “store goals” that are over the goals given to us by the actual company (Ie, the company computer tells us to aim for $2,000 in sales, she will say to aim for $2,900).
I always meet the goals given to me by the COMPANY because I am payed minimum wage, and therefore, do what I am supposed to do. It’s worth noting that I’m not actively ignoring her goals, but I keep the company number in mind when making sales, and anything else is a bonus. We more often than not meet the manager’s goals anyways.


And I do my job extremely well. I’m only an associate, but I build amazing relationships with customers, I’ve even been given a gift by one of them (an album of a band we both adore)


Anyways, I meet the company given goals regularly, but my manager sat me down around a month ago, my manager has been cutting my hours, saying that statistically, while I am there, we are not “making sales” (which is not true, I worked a large shift on international women’s day and we made over $6,000 while I was there alone, I also ring up large purchases often because again, I build really good relationships with customers)
Also worth mentioning that the stats are from the average of all my shifts, just looking at the hours I am physically clocked in, including ones where I may be doing stock or am just not on the sales floor at all, so even if one of my coworkers doesn’t try hard to get sales, that affects my stats.


It’s also worth mentioning that the stats came from november, which was a horrible month for retail and the economy in general, so that’s just beyond my control, especially when one shirt in our store is $30.
At this point, I’m working four hours a week, and I’m not even motivated to actively try and work better anymore.


I’m only keeping this job as a means to get money but the entire thing is bothering me and my parents even said that they’ll start giving me allowance again (which is basically even more than what my checks are right now)
What should I do?"

She asked if I am open to nego again, and I said yes. 

She said they have Annual wage supplement and attractive performance bonus. after that she went on saying ""so your expected salary is 78K and divided by 15 will be 5.2K per month"". So I wondered where the hell '15' came from so I asked ""can I find out where the 15 came from?"". 

And this rude-ass person said ""**is there language barrier**?"". 

I was very shocked to hear this as I'm not local so  I felt discriminated. plus this is such a bullshit cos   
 been working in this country for 6 yrs and how else i could pass my interview if I hv language barrier. but just tried to continue the convo so asked again what my question was. then she did not give clear answer and just repeated that attractive bonus shit. I still fucking didn't get where the 15 came from but I alr lost hope with comm with her and thot that I can just check from formal offer if I get soon, so I just answered in lower tone, ""yup ok.."". 

then this person said she tries to make everything sure to now low-ball bla bla but sounded like bull-shit already. 

&amp;#x200B;

that was few days ago and I haven't gotten the offer yet but not sure if I should just eliminate this company totally in my mind or can still put on my list thinking that anyway I'm not going to work with her when I join. 

I hate current irresponsible manager and wanted to switch job asap and this looks ok choice for me but this rude-ass person made me lose spirit. T\_T.."

So I moved to a bigger city 1 hour away to study to be a Dental Technician (making dentures, implants, crowns, veneers for dentists), fast forward during Uni I was really depressed/very high social anxiety so I could not make any friends from my class or keep up with school work due to depression and laziness.

I managed to get a few internships, interned at like 4 dental labs during the 3 year period from which I was either fired or left due to not liking the job itself and not pushing myself hard enough to learn the trade from the people there.  


After finishing Dental Tech Uni, I found a place to work, at the start I was working for free for 4 months, then I got paid lower than minimum wage for 2 months before quitting due to not advancing or learning anything there, because the people there were too busy to teach me anything, so at this point I would have interned at 6 labs so far and nothing fucking sticked, so I decided to leave Dental Tech altogether.

At this point I was 22 and bought into the whole ""just learn to code bro"", so I decided to pursue that. I told my mom I was going to try to pursue coding, she told me only if I enrolled into Uni again (Uni was paid for by the government since I had good grades in highschool).

So I went to Uni for IT and my first day there I met the biggest shithead 18 year old dude which I became friends with to not be suicidal and lonely for 3 years again, this guy wanted to do alcohol and drugs every single day while his parents drove his ass to Uni and back everyday and paid for everything.  


So I skipped most classes because they were way over my head (Uni level math, which I had never done in Highschool) and went drinking with that guy most days.

During my first year I tried teaching myself web development through courses and tutorials hoping for the best. Last year I finished IT Uni and got my degree and realised I barely know any programming since following courses and doing tutorial projects did not solidify barely any coding information in my brain.

Now I'm almost 26, have some very basic web dev projects on my GitHub that I can barely explain and failed my first 3 interviews that I got during the span of 6 months of applying for jobs.

I guess my question really is, should I quit programming and go back to being a Dental Technician even if I wasn't successful in that field for so long? (I would have to go back and take a couple of exams and finish my thesis since I didn't get my Dental degree).  


I live with my mom and am depressed to the point where I can barely study coding for 2 hours, there are barely any jobs in the small town that I currently live in and if I did get a minimum wage job here I would be the laughing stock of everyone, since most ppl here know I went to Uni for so long."

Let's start with now. I have had my current job for almost 5 years. I recently took FMLA. I was told that my mom was dying. After a few months, my mom improved somewhat to the point I felt it was time to go back to work. I was going to lose my job if I didn't return.I didn't want to exhaust my savings. Went back to work part-time. Things feel different since returning to work. I do not feel like I am an intergral part of the team. I have basically been in the same role for 5 years. Limited skills. I make pretty good money. 

With my mom being ill, it is difficult to find a job that fits the situation. I cannot be far away from home or work long hours outside the home. It is hard to find a remote/hybrid job. I am not willing to work hard for peanuts anymore. 

I recently thought about selling insurance. I decided not to. Long hours with no guarantee of pay. I am dabbling in being a travel agent. Even that is more difficult than I realized. A lot of training. I am not being paid for my time either. I only get paid when I sell. I wonder if I am going to make anything from it. I have to get my own business. There is marketing and advertising involved. I have to pay a fee every month to be a part of this travel group. I am working on a time frame. If I am not making at least a little money in x amount of time, I need to give it up. It is an extra expense.

I also signed up for gig sites in the event I need a little extra. I find that I really don't want to do that either. The pay isn't that great for what you have to do. In a pinch, I would do it.

I have a degree in communications. I was not ever able to really utilize it. 

I just feel like I am hitting a bunch of dead ends."

And to put simply, I am exhausted. Balancing studies and work has been challenging but okay for the most part but this last month has had a serious impact on my health - particularly my sleep. I barely have time to do anything else and it's stressing me out. 

This is my very first job and I've been here for 5-6 months now. I've gained skills and experiences that I'm grateful for, I'm just not sure if it's worth it anymore. It pays minimum wage and barely cover my bills and groceries but it's been okay for the most part. 

I am thinking of looking for another part-time job that better fits my studies schedule. Out of curiosity, I looked a little and there seem to be positions opening up near me (nearer than my current job) that pays better and overall seems to fits what I'm looking for. 

Because I've never done this before, I don't really know how to go about it. Am I allowed to apply for other part-time jobs while working? I don't really want my current employer to know about this. I also do not want to hand my notice without securing at least another job offer. But what if they ask for references/recommendation from my current employer?

I got a verbal offer from a company nine days ago and I'm still waiting on my background check to go through. I have nothing that would cause any issues as afar as I'm aware. I've never had a background check disqualify me from a job.

Should I be worried about this and is there a tactful way to reach out to see what's going on? I've got bills and rent coming up and this is a little nerve wracking.

Would I have any legal recourse if I have hard evidence of the offer along the lines of promissory estoppel?

I have seen a lot, a person who speak well and shoutout and market themselves well get selected even though they are not dedicated as they claim to be or even have a proper skill set for that job, all they have is a big mouth and confidentiality defend themself in interview and make the interviewer to believe that they are. I really feel sorry for all people who doesn't know to express then well in interview , even though they have a proper legit skill set. To all interviewers what is a point of assumption to select a person who speak well will be good at work. Also to know what is to do with my personality for  a job ( catogery management role) unless if it's a modelling or front end retail job.

I don't consider myself ""really"" recovered, I'm generally unclean and don't do any physical activity still, I quit after 1 day.

After many years (9) of unemployment, I signed a contract for a job I'm going to start in 2 weeks.  
During these 9 years I followed hobbies, changed ideas, and I've been self-taught in several things and in the last year I made a portfolio out of that, which is how I actually got this job.

It is a VERY well paid job (more than the double than my initial expectation and much higher than the average in my coutry), with flexible schedule, full remote from home and no need to relocate in their country, employees are treated very well and it's a VERY good entry to add on my CV/resume. Also, I live in a property house of my parents so I have no rent costs.  
So this opportunity is completely perfect, nobody could ask more than this.

It looks like they believed in my potential, and I tried to not look depressed during the interview process, but very attentive and participative.

Now I signed, and I'm very afraid that I won't be able to endure the job and that I will leave, disappointing any of their expectations. I know by fact I'm able to put a lot of energy in 1 task and finish it without even pauses but those are like quick bursts of efficiency that last for a couple of days and then I'm back doing random unproductive stuff, to ""recover"", so I have a quite hardcoded cycle of effort/reward. And some years ago I did some freelance commissions which I stopped out of depression as well, and I refused a job (not remote) after a couple of weeks of trial, because of depression (that would have been paid 4 times less than my current one anyway). So I'm afraid I won't be able to work everyday for 8 hours / day for long, and that I will just collapse earlier than the end of the contract.

I won't get another opportunity like this one so easily, other than the fact I need money urgently from now on, to support my family and a situation of caregiving. So it's very important I manage.

I'd feel devastated if it turns out I can't do it, just the idea gives me instant input to cry. While I'm in fact excited for the job because I like their project as well and it's in the field I wanted to work in from ages, other than being so well paid it would fix a lot of things in my life in just one year."

I’m of course nervous bc not making it in the job would mean a big paycut back to my current type of roles.

I’m leaving a place where I was the only one in my department so I’m leaving them in a very bad position. They will need at least two people but may need way more. I was putting long hours and working like a dog.

I have given my notice and a lot of these important managers in different areas are reaching out to me to get all the scoop and try to make friends w me.

They want to know where I’m going how much I’ll be making and all this stuff. None of these people are my friends or have treated me as one and all of a sudden they’re acting like we’re so close.

These are very smart social people that are very good at looking out for their own benefit. I don’t trust them.

I have started lying to them about the new company I’m going to.

Am I doing the right thing? I don’t think I’m close to them to even use them as references in the future. Most of them are very self serving and didn’t give two cents about me. 

What is their motive behind all of this? My best guess is 1) they want too keep close to keep bugging me about work questions and or 2) have the info to serve them in some way.

I may be paranoid right now but I’m even scared one of them ending knowing anyone at my new place and affecting my career and/or reaching to my new workplace when they need help.

Am I doing the right thing?"

I will say that my boss is a good manager as far as the store is run, he's very efficient. The problem is that he tends to value the good of the store over the good of the employees. It's not that he doesn't care about us, he's just used to work being his life and seems to expect the same from us.

Last year I was promoted to assistant manager and there are 4 of us on the management team. At the beginning I was a little nervous as I had never held a management position before, but I was still confident in my abilities. I've now become more comfortable in the role and thought I'd settled into a good routine. 

On Friday as I was about to leave my boss sat me down and asked me if something was wrong. He said I didn't seem like myself lately, that I seemed preoccupied and not as gung-ho as I once was. I'll admit I'm jaded from years of working in retail and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to get out. But I've still been doing my duties and trying to stay motivated and keep my team motivated as well. I thought I was still doing a good job despite my feelings. 

Our conversation has just left me feeling so dejected and lost. On one hand I do want to try harder and prove myself but on the other, I just wanna say fuck it and leave. Every time I've busted my ass there has not been any praise. I only get a reaction when he's unhappy. 

Anyway, I might be rambling at this point but I just wanted to get this off my chest and see if anyone else has felt this way before. Like all of your hard work is for nothing. I don't know what to do. Don't know what I'd do if I quit. 

Any job/life advice appreciated, thanks for reading.

Edit: My bad, the point of the post isn't just to whine. I just feel stuck because I don't like being in a position where I'm told I'm doing a bad job but don't know what else to do, so I'm looking for advice. To either stay and try to improve or move on."

My core MBA will be finished in July. I added an additional concentration on that’ll be finished in December. I was working in a family owned restaurant due to flexible hours and minimal stress while in school. The family (whom I’m friends with and worked with for years) ended up selling their business to a hospitality group in December. 

This hospitality group has an executive chef who I can’t stand. I coexisted with him and just avoided at all costs. Earlier this month, I told him about an upcoming order and was cussed out. I resigned immediately later that day. I’ve never in my life have been spoken to in that way and I’m not going to allow it at work. 

The CFO of the company called me 930 that night apologizing to no end, asking me to not quit, talked about how much he valued me, and offering to move me anywhere in the company I wanted. He knows I’m just about done my MBA. The following day, HR called me. I never spoke to this man a day in my life but he echoed what my CFO said and asked if I had any interest in moving to HR if a position were made available for recruiting/staffing. 

The day after speaking with HR (two days after the incident) the director of marketing called me. Echoing what the CFO and HR said, told me that she raves about me all the time, doesn’t want to see me leave etc etc. She mentioned offering me a part time position in marketing and asked me what I wanted hour wise and how much money I wanted if they could make it work. 

She then sat down with CFO, HR, CEO and they presented me an offer - exactly what I asked for with the potential of it becoming full time in the future. When I spoke with her again, she said there wasn’t a time line of how long they expected me to stay on but if I happened to get a full time offer elsewhere, no hard feelings. 

I begin my new position this upcoming week. Does this sound like it’s a definite path to full time or should I actively be looking elsewhere? I’ve been telling myself if they didn’t want me, they wouldn’t have chased me down. However there’s a little voice in my head saying they’re only doing this because of the situation someone in their company created. I don’t want to sell myself short with this company nor do I want to be blind sided if this doesn’t turn into full time. Thoughts?"

Within our yearly review, I was rated as one of the best performers and my salary will now increase to only 73k.

Because it’s a non promotion raise, I don’t feel inclined to necessarily argue for more. Maybe? Previously I was making 40k at the same company, and they adjusted my salary to market price. I’ve never heard of that ever happening before so I am grateful for where I work. I don’t want to come across as ungrateful. 

For the most part, I’m slightly behind market value at the moment. I think most employers are giving salaries up to 80-90k, most around 80. My plan is to argue for more when I do have a promotion (most likely next year), but I’d like a different opinion on whether I should argue for the 80k right now or whether I should wait until next year."

I’m a cashier/FOH worker and I like it pretty well, it can be stressful but every job is lol. 

The most pressing issue is that my register has been imbalanced after many of my shifts. Not cash that was paid actually being missing from the register, but different transactions that were never completed/paid needing to be voided, or someone saying they were paying with cash and switching to card which messes things up a bit. 

Yesterday during a rush a man tried to pay with cash, but my register had an issue where it wouldn’t open (just a glitch that happens sometimes). I directed him to my coworker who helps him on her register, but the “transaction” still went through on mine, meaning it seemed like he had given me cash and I gave him change although he never did and I never took anything out of the drawer. I let my manager know about this and she voided it later, but the register number still ended up being messed up, with that transaction being the cause.

I’m very careful with counting out change and receiving bills now bc I want to avoid any mistakes. My managers watch me and know I give correct change/don’t take anything unauthorized from the drawer. 

I was also a cashier at my last job and my register was always fine. it was a smaller and less busy restaurant with less room for error i guess, i always found handling cash easy and not stressful. Now every shift I’m so nervous and constantly anticipating issues. If anything it’s made me more alert and hyper aware lol.

I just don’t know. My managers know there’s no theft going on but it’s still company policy to have registers not be over/under certain amounts, which makes sense ofc. I’m new still, but i worry about how many more times this can happen before it’s too big of an issue to accept.

195,2023-03-19,Former employer I quit working for to take a new job told a background check investigator I was “terminated” due to a policy violation when I was never told I was fired at any point in time before or after leaving.,u/Tixxter,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11vxkav/former_employer_i_quit_working_for_to_take_a_new/,jobs,"During a new job security clearance, a former employer that I did Independent Contracting for for 1 week told the investigator I was “terminated” with the reason “violation of company policy”. I had quit the job already and told them ahead of time when I would have to quit before accepting any work, and did exactly as I said. 

I agreed to work a labor job under a 1099 until I was offered an engineering job (due to recently graduating with an engineering degree). I told them this before ever accepting any work. I signed 0 documents, it was all verbal. 1 week in I got an unexpected job offer and took it. I told them when I got the offer and that I was leaving, just as I said originally. Fast forward several weeks, and I get a notice that my background check showed I was “terminated”. They never said I was fired at any point in time. They have my info to contact me. Then they listed the reason: “Violation of company policy”. I was never told or shown any company policies, but I always did my job right and never once was told I was breaking or had broken any policies. 

This now contradicts the information I submitted saying I have never been fired from a job due to breaking any rules, etc. Is this a clear case of Defamation if it is provable that none of the above ever happened and that the false/misleading information has hurt my chances at securing my next job?

It seems to me the middle man who hired me on gave misleading information to the boss to make himself look better. The guy was a friend of mine, and has since been irresponsive to any texts or me reaching out. I then find this out today and it seems like it all adds up.

Any advice?"

I feel like I could thrive and be much happier if I could find a way to make money and work for myself at the same time.

It’s about 10k more than I’m currently making, which I do need… but I don’t want the position. It’ll be more of the responsibilities that I don’t enjoy, less of the responsibilities I do enjoy, no managerial/supervisory duties (which is what I need to actually start progressing to more mid level positions), potentially more hours, and I’m likely to start a job search in the summer/early fall.

3,2023-03-19,Do I really need to stay at my current job before I get a written offer for a potential job? My current job wants me to relocate soon...,u/Winningdays,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11vyat4/do_i_really_need_to_stay_at_my_current_job_before/,jobs,"I graduated from a masters program a year and a half ago and had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field. I was close to giving up and going back to school in a different field, but my supervisor sent me a job posting in another city he recommended applying to. I applied to the job and was offered it. The problem was that the job is in a city in the Midwest that isn’t particularly nice and nowhere near my family or friends. I asked about remote work but they said they wanted me to work in-office. I talked to my wife about it for a few days, and then decided to accept the offer. 

My wife was apprehensive about moving but was willing to make the sacrifice given how hard it had been for me to find a job. 

I took this job just a few months ago promising to move at the start of June. They flew me out to meet everyone and to help me look for places. They are a family company that was recently acquired. They are trying to make a case to their parent company to pay for my relocation. They keep asking me if I’ve found a place and if I liked my visit. 

The dilemma is that 2 months into this potion I was contacted for a job I applied to a long time ago. It is basically my dream job. It’s a government job and I have gotten an unofficial offer, but because of the bureaucracy and security clearance, they won’t be able to make a written offer until less than a month before I would need to move for my current job. So because of this my company will keep asking about whether I have a place and how the moving preparations are going. The other element is that they are coming into a very busy time of the year and so I would be quitting when things are getting very hectic for the team. The job is highly specialized and they’ve invested a lot into my training and so it’s only recently that I’ve been able to start contributing to projects.

So what I want to do is quit as soon as I hear I passed my reference check for this new job (in a week or two) because I’m very stressed out about being dishonest and I don’t want to screw them over any more than I have to. Given everything that’s happened, I also on’t want to move to this city anyways, even if everything falls through. My wife has looked into job opportunities in the city and she hasn’t been able to find anything. She also just got a promotion at her own job. But that said, before this I didn’t really have any career prospects in the city where we currently live and so I’d be back to square one if everything fell through. 

TL;DR Started a job that is requiring me to relocate. After I started, my dream job got back to me. The dream job isn’t able to provide a written offer until right before I’m supposed to move for the current job. I know the conventional wisdom is to wait until you have a written offer, but I hate the deception and stress.

2,2023-03-19,Feedback on an insane interview process - what else should I say?,u/Icy_Choice_5709,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11w0uif/feedback_on_an_insane_interview_process_what_else/,jobs,"I was offered a second-round interview for a small charity in the UK.  The communications from their end have been a bit chaotic throughout - sending through 3 different Google Calendar invites for the meeting, each with a different time, extremely short lead times for interviews.  That sort of thing.  I decided to go with it initially because it's a good cause, and I need a new job.

After the first round interview they said they'd like to offer me a second round interview, but it wouldn't be for a few weeks.  Fine by me.  In the meantime, I've actually found something else and am hopefully going to be signing the contract this week, so I no longer need or want this role.

On Friday, after a few weeks of silence, the charity emailed on Thursday afternoon and asked if I would be available on Monday for an interview.  I said yes, because I believe in keeping my options open until papers have been signed.  The charity replied on Friday ""I just you let know that will be an assessment before the interview. I will send you an email on Sunday."".  I wrote back to confirm that they would be sending me a task on Sunday (today) with the expectation that it be completed ahead of the interview on Monday (tomorrow).  I did not receive a reply.

Today, I had a task fired into my inbox with one line of copy - ""Please see attached assessment, you have two hours to complete the document."".  The attached assessment would require a good amount of research and thought.

Obviously this is bonkers.  Do I have 2 hours from when they sent the assignment?  Any 2 hours between now and tomorrow?  Why are they emailing me on a Sunday?  Anyway.  I have no intention of doing any sort of assessment, but this has kind of gotten under my skin and I'd like to send them some feedback.

Is this about right?

""I have to say, this phase of your recruitment process threw up some concerns for me.  I was advised on Friday that a task would be sent across on Sunday, and understood it would be due on Monday.  When I wrote back to confirm this was the case, I didn't receive a reply.  I was then emailed a task on Sunday, which stated I had 2h to complete this process.  This was obviously a bit confusing, as I was not advised of what time to expect the task to be emailed across, not that I would have a very limited time to complete it.  If I were in this role I would expect to spend considerably more than two hours pulling together a communications plan for such a serious and important topic and event.  I also did not advise that I would be able to set the time aside today in order to complete this task, as I (and I'm sure many other candidates) have many responsibilities and commitments.  I would be concerned that if I were to be successful and accept this role, important pieces of work would be regularly rushed, perhaps at the expense of completing the tasks to a high standard.  I would also be concerned about my work-life balance, and my ability to switch off outside of working hours (obviously emergencies do happen, but this is not an emergency).  The need to strike a healthy work-life balance is especially important in a role dealing with such a sensitive topic, as being on 24/7 leads to burnout.  For these reasons, I will withdraw from the interview process.  I wish you the best of luck in finding a suitable candidate.""  


Edit - Before 9 am this morning they emailed, and just after 9 they called and texted.  As expected, there's been radio silence from them since I sent the email.  I figured this would be the case, but I kind of hoped for more."

 “A” would get back to me. Unfortunately, I never heard back from them and decided to accept the offer from “B”.

Three weeks went by and “A” informed me that they will be extending an offer. Now, I’m placed in this awkward position and need some advice from my fellow Redditors. When I began my interview process with both firms, I preferred “A” significantly more than “B”. The role, the team, and the company at “A” is much better than “B”. “A” is also in the industry that I hope to work in, while “B” is not so much. Pay is roughly the same, so money is not a factor in this equation. My university has an anti-reneging policy in place and I could get a temporary ban from using certain resources - some of which that I plan on using in the near future - if I renege an offer. What are your thoughts?"

I work at a franchise, and there are 3 teams working at this office. I'm on team 1, and I'm the only member of my team frequently in the office due to the specific nature of my role. Even my manager is frequently working out of office.

Team 2 is also regularly at the office and the manager of 2 is a mega bully to his team. He screamed at one of his direct reports until she cried, for example. 

However, because of where my cubicle is and when I come in to the office, he usually doesn't know when I'm in the office. So I regularly hear him abuse and demean his team - he yells and swears at them. We don't have an HR at our franchise so we are all at the mercy of our managers. I have no idea who to even contact at corporate or how to get that info discreetly.

 He recently became aware I am at the office most of the time and has started walking over to my section of the office to see if I'm at my cubicle. I've caught him trying to read my monitor a number of times.

I did a project related to my team and when he became aware of the project he mocked my project results for a solid 15 minutes and highlighted everything he thought was wrong with it in front of OUR ENTIRE OFFICE. So part of my team, all of 2, and all of 3. I was humiliated and he was completely out of line - his role has nothing to do with my team. He called my final product cheap. Later he asked me if I was mad at him and I just shrugged him off. My manager took leave and is not aware of this yet so she has no idea this has happened.

He tried to start an argument between me and my team member at a company party on Friday. My team member and I were joking around and he made a funny face at me so I made one back. Rude Manager asked ""why did you look at Coworker that way?"" (Implying I was rude). I said we had been joking and there was nothing to it.

I am nervous because he clearly doesn't like me and I think is trying to fabricate BS to get me in trouble or something.

What should I do and what should I say to HR? I have only been in this role for 6 months and don't want to leave until my 1 year mark.

I'm almost done with my associates program and in the meantime am working an accounting associate job that I hate and that doesn't pay well enough. I was checking my current company's site for job postings and found a graphic design job that they listed that makes double what I make now. I'm good at my job, have a good relationship with my supervisor and management, just am not a numbers guy so it's not a long-term position for me. I've been working for the company for almost a year and a half total, though some of that was as a temp at the beginning. I know not all companies are the same so no one can say for sure, I just don't have anyone I'm really close with that has professional experience in things like this to ask for advice. 

The other thing I'm worried about other than my lack of actual graphic design experience is that when the company started shifting everyone back into the office a few months ago, I got an exemption from HR to work from home because my fiance has the only car in the household and also works and goes to school full time so there's no way for me to even get to the office. I don't know if that would cause a problem with me transferring departments. 

So, what do you guys think are the odds I would actually get it since I'm still in school and don't really have any professional experience in the field yet?

My surgery is April 11th. I’m not really concerned with losing the job itself; they don’t pay me enough ($11/hr).

I recently just filed for short-term disability and the hospital I’m going to has already taken my insurance. Some may say “just focus on keeping your numbers up” but the issue is that this role is commission based, and there are times where hardly anyone comes into the store, meaning I’m not selling anything, meaning my numbers are going to be low. This is why I say they do not pay me enough and I’d rather just look someplace else. My main issue is making sure my surgery is covered.

Web dev, 15 years of experience, got into a bad financial situation and now about to be homeless if I don't get hired this week.  
In desperate need for someone to give me a chance, and I will give it my all and beyond!

Hi everyone.

I'm a Web dev and have been doing pretty okay for most of my life financially.  
I've created many different projects, and businesses, some succeeded, some not so much.

My mission in life is always to help others, no matter how, and when it comes to money, I've always always shared my wealth with anyone that crossed paths with me. I don't even think twice when someone is in need. I've given so much of my money, be it to charities, to gofundme, to friends who needed money, to people who are homeless.  
Since Covid hit, everything fell like dominos for me, extremely fast. I kept trying to pick myself back up, but things just kept getting worse.

For the 4 months I've been applying for jobs as I am was not seeing much improvements on making it out of the situation on my own, but it seems the job market is even harder to get into than I anticipated.

I am writing this with tears in my eyes, because I have never thought I'd get to this stage - I am now at a situation in my life that if I don't get hired this week, I will be homeless.

I am in desperate need for someone to tell me that they are willing to believe in me, because I will give any opportunity my all and beyond, especially to the person who would be helping me out of this situation.

I'm not asking for any money, just a job that I would be able to pick myself back up.

I have 15 years of web dev experience, full stack, experience with many different languages and frameworks, I can learn and adapt extremely fast.  
You can comment or send me a private message if you have a position for me.

If you read until here, thank you so much, I truly appreciate it!"

Last fall, an old coworker insisted i come work with her and get back in the serving game (I had been working at home for a year prior). She told me what she was making, and it was enough to convince me. After about a month of having to message HR everyday to follow up on my interview (they kept giving me times to expect a call and the call would never come due to their lack of communication), i finally had my first day. Halfway through my first day i was practically on my own because my trainer was the only server on that day. It was her second week on the job, so she was truly as lost as i was. Day two, i get my server card and get put on the floor to take orders and started to earn tips. It was great money and i was overall happy. 
Before i go further i would like to go into a little detail of how this place works. For starters, it is a skybar above the nicest hotel in my city. It is affiliated with said hotel, but it was also open to the public. The chain of management went in this order lowest to highest; shift supervisor, manager, general manager of restaurant, general manager of hotel. When i was hired, there were practically no rules as the hotel (not the restaurant) was going through management changes and our new GM did not start until about a month after I did. To clarify, we had a restaurant GM too who hired me, but the hotel itself did not have one, so our GM for the restaurant (lets call her Terry) was not held accountable for anything she did. It was a free for all. 
Fast fwd three weeks and we lost a dear coworker due to complications from the flu. Around this time our new GM for the hotel started (lets call him Rick). Morale at work was considerably low and it was hurting my soul so i brought a bunch of stickers with uplifting quotes to work one night and all of the servers decorated their books and some of our server station with them. It was a hit. I also got everyone arm bands for our server cards to honor our coworker who had passed as he had a similar one for his card. Another hit. Things were going great and the staff became very close. 

In the meantime, Rick was implementing rules left and right. Multiple staff were fired, our employee meals were cut entirely because the entire hotel staff had been eating them too and it cost the restaurant a lot of money. We had to buy food full price or eat whatever cold mystery meat they provided us on our newly required 30 min break (this rule really hurt my income because you would have to get cut in the middle of dinner rush to get your break) on the second floor (we were on the eighth floor). We then had to stop using the bathroom in our restaurant and were required to go to the second floor breakroom. This was very time consuming because only one elevator took you to the break room and sometimes it would take 10 mins to get the right elevator. The breakroom was locked so if you didnt have a fob to get in, elevator was the only option. Countless times i was in tears trying to get to the bathroom because they never gave me a fob and the elevator took so long. As the months went by, this became miserable. 

Then the attendance policy was implemented where we would be pointed for missed time and they wanted us to sign a document saying that we understood this policy started a month before we were informed of it. Fine. 

Morale was getting very low again and a lot of times i would leave work questioning myself as a person,  questioning if my job was more draining than it was worth. Many coworkers felt the same so much so that we would all stay over an hour after we were done with our closing duties talking about how miserable we were. We even got to go to the award ceremony and the laziest worker there was nominated for employee of the year, and then Rick boasted about how many millions the hotel had made, the owner casually joked about how when covid hit he was in florida (im in Ky) and when he got home he laughed at everyone freaking out until it hurt his profits. I was appalled as were the rest of my coworkers. 


A few weeks later, a supervisor came to me crying because Terry had accused her of voiding over 1k in cash sales and letting employees pocket the cash. She went on the system, checked the dates and there were no voids. She was at court for her daughters murder trial that day. Couldnt of been her. Days after, Terrys son comes in and orders an $80 meal &amp; tipped me $3. I told Terry her son was a bad tipper and she said she would take care of it. She voided his ticket (didnt say she did but i saw it with my own eyes) and told me to keep the cash. She did this with four other servers that night. I have never felt so dirty at a job. 

I say all of this to set the tone for why i left.  

The fallout: I was a hard worker. I worked Every holiday (missing christmas eve with my kids, in fact only the people who had kids were the ones who worked holidays it was sad). I never had complaints (which is saying a lot considering some servers had entire $500 meals comped due to poor service), I frequently did all of the closing work and then helped the bar close because i loved my coworkers and didnt mind. The phrase at work was ""if allie (fake name) doesnt like you that is saying something because she loves everyone"". But because of the events above, I had told management a few times i was on the verge of quitting due to the unfair treatment of staff (the lazy ones were highly favored) and they begged me to stay. I decided to stick it out until one night, Terry (who i had only worked with a few times prior to this after about 6 months of employment) was ripped a new one by Rick. She decided i was going to be her punching bag. They had fired all of the hosts with no back up, so that night the servers were seating tables and taking to go orders. While i was helping my customers, the phone rang so i answered it. I did this three times back to back answering right away everytime.  Terry had the audacity to call the restaurant sitting right next to my table with her group of friends and said (rudely) ""I just wanted to see how long it would take you to answer the phone.""  I immediately rolled my eyes and hung up as she had sat there and made eye contact with me every time i had answered prior. It came to head when she called a meeting and directed the entire thing at me discreetly. I walked out to check on my table and when i did i heard her openly bashing me. I walked back to the kitchen and told her if i was doing such a horrible job then she can find someone else and left.  If she was pinning theft on a supervisor who knows what she was planning to do with me. 

My friend that i grew up with is moving out of state, the restaurant he works at is in the same hotel, but is in no way affiliated with it. Its rAn by family. He wants me to take his place. This is fine dining so its a good opportunity for me. I very easily landed an interview and while i was there, i clicked with the staff well. My official interview is wednesday and i am not sure how to explain to the Gm why i left upstairs so abruptly. Do i lie? Do i tell the truth? WWYD?"

I received a quick reply letting me know that I had made it past their pre-selection of candidates and was invited to take a 3-hour skill assessment test.

I aced the test and was invited to a video interview where I was told that I had (by far!) the best score in the skills test. I was invited to a follow-up interview at the office which I thought went really well. I was told that that was the last interview and that I could expect an answer within the week.

At the end of the week, instead of an answer I got an email with further questions. I answered them thoroughly.

Next week radio silence. No emails and no replies to my email.

A whole week after the radio-silence week, when I had given up, they suddenly send me an email inviting me to a third interview (when they said that the previous interview was the last one) - and with ""homework"". They want me to outline the procedures and stages for a project. What the??!!???

Even though I really want \*a\* job, this just sends out all sorts of red flags. I was already not enthused with them after my last interview (they came across as controlling) and the lack of communication is appalling. If they treat me so dismissively when I am not even working for them, how would it be if I became an employee?

&amp;#x200B;

My husband wants me to go to the interview and just use it as a stepping stone for something better. 

I think that I run the risk of quitting within the week. I strongly suspect that they hired someone else and kept the rest of the applicants floating in limbo to see how the new person would work out. Or maybe they just want me to spend a few hours of my time working on a project that they want the other person to do anyway.

I really should send them some sort of answer today. Any ideas/suggestions?"

I was referred to this position by a former coworker from the airport I was working at.  I’ve been here 9 months and honestly hate the company and management.  The culture is toxic and I am not proud or satisfied with the work we perform.  I wish I was because the money is great but it’s a good experience and has really got me set on some career goals.  

I would like to work with an engineering company in a position that would allow growth to some sort or project management.  Only problem is entry level starting position for which I am qualified for are starting at $17-24/hr.   I can take a pay cut but not anywhere near that big, my girlfriend and I just bought a house and I make significantly more than her.  

At this point I feel like submitting online applications doesn’t make me seem anymore qualified than average however my actual experience in working with contractors and engineers while short still gives me an advantage.

Help!,u/Fangirl4DrNow,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11wgdu6/6_months_in_new_position_and_the_anxiety_is/,jobs,"I’ve been with my current company for 7 years. For 6 of those years, I was doing a job that I could quite literally do with my eyes closed. I had grown so accustomed to the work that I was no longer challenged and needed a change. 

Applied to a more technical leadership position (my first leadership position) and was hired. I had no prior experience with this type of work, but same company and department, just different team.

They have trained me from the ground up, which I am so thankful for. But 6 months in, I still don’t know what I’m doing on a daily basis, need help from people, and do things wrong. Granted, I’m doing a lot right. But in the same respect, I went from a creative job to a technical job and I’m not sure if my brain is completely hardwired for that type of change. 

I’m starting to doubt my abilities and in turn, the anxiety is becoming a lot to handle. I suppose I should give myself some grace and chill out, but part of me feels like I should be further along than I really am. 

Any advice for someone who is 6 months into a new position and struggling? Honestly, the anxiety didn’t hit until about two weeks ago! I feel like I’ve been in constant fight or flight since then. 

I’m also feeling like I should apply to positions in my old field but at a different company - but then worry about the onboarding process THERE. I feel like there is a lot to learn with this new role and I could make a lot of money in the future. While it doesn’t pay great, it is fully remote and I will probably have to go back into an office if I want something in my old field (I would for decent money, but am really liking remote work). I don’t know, a lot of conflicted feelings right now."

Im looking for advice with finding a job and potentially negotiating with all the parties, while currently still having a job BUT knowing that there are substantial layofffs about to happen.

Basically, I like my job enough to want to stay in it, in case I am not fired, however I also want to be prepared for the scenario of me being fired so I want to start looking for new opportunities now.

However, Im confused/scared about the possibility of me being offered a job I like, but still not knowing if Im about to be fired in my current job. Because then, if I go to my current manager and ask him if the company can give me a raise to match (or come close to) what was offered to me elsewhere, it can just be used as a reason to fire me outright. So yeah basically the problem originates from me wanting to keep my current job if possible and the chance that finding a new job will cause me getting fired.

He was very friendly but can tell he's someone that has certain expectations. He mentioned something about not believing in work-life balance, he says in this field there's never a 'im finished with my work' there's always opportunity to come up with more ideas etc. He did emphasize that he wants his employees to mix work and life together, in a sense that you are free to relax, grab a coffee, or even go for a quick jog to clear your mind during work hours, and it's okay to take a break and scroll on your phone when you feel you needed a break. BUT that he wants us to still be sorta ON after work hours, like if in your day to day you see or come across something that gives you an idea, he'd want you to communicate that instead of waiting until work hours to discuss the ideas with the team (there's a WhatsApp chat group for the team).

My red flag alarm was going off a little, I'm not sure if I'm overreacting?? I agree that in this field  if you suddenly came up with an idea, you wouldn't exactly want to wait til the next day to share it, but idk!!!😭😭😭

I’m currently transitioning from dog walking to serving/bartending while in grad school. I was offered the beerhall position on Friday and told them I need to give the dog walking job a notice before I can start. They told me they were going to send the hiring paper work either Saturday or Sunday and never did. They are closed today, but I was wondering if I should still give my notice today or wait until I at least start with the paperwork? 

Thank you!"

I got an offer for a manufacturing intern position for ford in Dearborn Michigan a while back. Since then I haven’t really received a lot of details about the internship. I was told that I would receive more information 30 days before the start date, but what I’m most worried about is the housing logistics.

I tried messaging my intern coordinator about corporate ford housing. I got a message back saying that interns outside of 50 miles from the location “usually are remote and aren’t offered any housing”. I’m based in Chicago so I’m outside 50 miles. During my interview process I was told that the internship will be hands on and in person and housing would be provided. I tried messaging the coordinator back and they just said that I will receive more info once my supervisor is identified. 

I’m really worried that I was given false info about the internship this whole time. It would really suck if I was given a remote internship with no housing when I was told otherwise during my interview"

This family member is super short tempered and I am afraid to bring up the fact that I don't want to do this anymore. I have an interview this week at my dream job. I didn't want to tell my family member, I don't want him to explode on me and then I not get this new job.

I just don't know how to even bring this up in the current office.

They have tried not to pay me twice! Both times the Federal Department of Labor had to get involved. Even though they hired me to work 40 hours a week, they claim me as part time to avoid giving me benefits. They are almost always behind on payment (they are again).

Today, I found out I got hired into my first cybersecurity job. New job is salaried and offers great benefits and remote! 

I'm wondering if I should quit my current job tomorrow and have a mini-vacation? Or I should work right up until my start date and not show and again maybe fight them, if they are again behind on payment?

Either way, I'm not giving a two weeks and they don't deserve one. My only worry about taking a 2 weeks vacation is a rescinded job offer."

I have a disability that does not impede me from doing anything in any of these job descriptions, but it does impede my ability to drive.

How do I disclose that no, I don't have a driver's license and no, I don't need a parking reservation etc... without making it seem like I'm incompetent or super broke or got a DUI or something, and without disclosing a disability?

I have been in the workforce for a little over 2 years now, and I am realizing that my “soft skills” (I.e. communication, listening, friendliness etc) are pretty much the only things I bring to the table as far as a successful salesman go. I hate selling. More specifically, I hate selling in conjunction with my companies guidelines, which requires me to spam my leads with an insane number of calls over a short period in order to “strike while the irons hot”. Look, I wouldn’t want to talk to me either. “Leads” is a very subjective term in my world as well, as I’m sure some of you who have downloaded tools from websites would attest to. I’m very middle of the pack as far as outputs go, and I’m sure my numbers would be better if I sucked it up and put my morality to the side. 

Anyways, I am sick of feeling underutilized within my corporation and like a nuisance to prospective customers. I have finally realized that those “soft skills” I mentioned doesn’t destine me to a career in sales, and for sure not in the current capacity in which I’m selling. 

My first question is personal: I have become interested in exploring a career in Event Services (where I can be relationship based and not sit behind a desk all day) and was wondering what tips/tricks I can use to find relevant opportunities. 

Secondly, has anyone else in this sub come to the same conclusion about entry level sales (more specifically SaaS sales)? Where did you pivot to and what advice could you give me?

Thanks in advance to anyone who reaches out with guidance. I hate feeling the way I feel day in and day out and know deep down that I can find something where I feel like I matter and can make a positive impact in other peoples lives"

0,2023-03-20,What is the real reason behind age discrimination? It seems counter-intuitive to me...!,u/factsnotfeelings,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11wuza0/what_is_the_real_reason_behind_age_discrimination/,jobs,"I don't think the cause is within the job market itself, or else it would already be obvious.

Maybe it's to do with the process for approving mortgages (bear with me).

If you receive a bonus that varies significantly from year to year, your mortgage lender may not include it as income. This is because they fear the bonus might not last for the entire term of the mortgage (which is a reasonable fear).

So we have a reason for employers to pay a large portion of compensation as base, since this is what workers will demand.

This sets the stage for age discrimination. Higher salary workers are more likely to be older. Companies would like to reduce their pay, but they can't because 90% of their compensation is base salary...

Allowing banks to treat bonuses as income could help alleviate age discrimination. We already have mortgage protection insurance, so why not let it do its job?"

I’m a veterinary assistant, currently in school to become a Registered Vet Tech. I was previously working at an ER as a vet assistant, where I was terminated after 18 months for tardies. Despite my tardies, I was still a hard worker and extremely efficient. I started at the front desk and worked my way to the back, until I was trained in every duty I was legally allowed to perform. I have references from multiple coworkers and a referral letter from a doctor that I worked under. My direct supervisor has declined to provide me a reference and has said that any potential employers will need to reach out to HR (this is a large company, and no one working in HR can speak on behalf of me and what kind of worker I was, as I never even met them). My question is, when interviewing with potential employers, what should I say when they ask why I’m looking for a new job. I’ve had a lot of interviews, but have not heard back from any and I’m assuming it’s because I’m telling them I was terminated for tardies. It IS something I’m working on continually but I don’t know how to tell potential employers this without giving too much info (such as the reasoning was anxiety induced insomnia). I want to be honest and upfront, but it feels like it’s tarnishing the possibility of finding a job in my field."

So let me start from the beginning. I am a college student and I was doing a remote job for spring break. My job requires calling others and surveying them. It was my first time home in a while but I was scheduled to work throughout the week. So when I was working, I did an extremely unethical decision. I said I called them and that they didn't answer when actually I never called anyone. I only called sometimes. Of course my actions came and now I'm facing the consequences. 

They messaged me and said they were gonna investigate this. When I got this, I thought about and concluded that I would rather be honest than hide. So I called my boss and I told him the complete truth. I pleaded for a second chance for I have never done something like this before and I've always been a good worker. Of course, I had no excuse for what I did. He told me he was gonna make the effort to fire me, yet he told HR might prevent him. 

After thinking about it, I emailed him later and offered my resignation. That I am absolutely willing to do my two weeks but I understood if he just wanted me gone. He's yet to respond.

That's the story, and I'm a freshmen college student and now looking for a job. Can I really come back from this? It was a part time job and nothing to do with my career but what I did was unethical. I know I don't deserve it. But I was hoping for advice for the future. How can I come out of this?"

2,2023-03-20,Nightmare interview process,u/Liz_Fotos,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11wvr6d/nightmare_interview_process/,jobs,"I'm relatively new to posting (mostly just come on here to read posts) but felt like I really needed to share this odd experience and get some opinions. I apologize for the length! For context, I'm a professional product photographer with about 7 years of experience in my industry, having worked in-house for some large studios and prestigious brands. I'm currently working as a product photographer 3 days/week but looking for a full-time role, so when I saw one come up on LinkedIn in my city (which is rare) I applied, and soon had an initial phone interview with their HR person/recruiter. 

The interview lasted almost an hour, and they were asking me extremely in-depth and technical questions right off the bat about their branding and marketing, etc. but I did well in the interview and they quickly moved me on to a video interview with the hiring manager (the Photo department manager). That interview lasted an hour and also went very technically in-depth (more than I'm typically used to for these types of roles). But it went well and the Photo manager expressed that he thought I was a great candidate with impressive experience and that it seemed like I was very qualified and would be a great fit, and asked me to come in that same week for a ""working interview"" that might take 3-4 hours, where I would be shooting and editing photos in their studio so they could get a better idea of my work. I've been asked to do working interviews before, but in my experience have always been paid for them. I'll admit it was my mistake that I did not clarify if this would be paid (I assumed a 4 hour working interview would be) and the interviewer was ending the call right as we were scheduling when I would come in, so I didn't have a good opportunity to bring it up.

The working interview ended up taking a little under 2 hours. I got positive feedback on the work I did there, and asked to come in for a FOURTH interview, which I was informed would be a group interview including the other members of the creative team, which would total NINE people interviewing me. At this point, the interview process had been dragging on for weeks, and I considered withdrawing because the idea of being interviewed by nine people for what I would barely consider a mid-level position at best was so over the top and made me so uncomfortable. At the same time, I received a reference request from the HR person with very specific instructions about who I could use as a reference, and from how far back, etc. and I heard from one of my references that they WERE contacted with an extremely lengthy and in-depth questionnaire.

I ended up going through with the group interview despite my reservations, and then spoke with the photo manager privately afterwards where he I felt that he alluded that he expected to offer me the position (without literally saying so) and was essentially asking if I felt I would be accepting it. I let him know that I had some reservations at this point, as the pay for this position was actually about 12-20% lower per hour than my current position (based on the range they had given me early on) and that I would be interested to see if there was room for negotiation, but didn't want that to change my candidacy. He told me it would not effect my candidacy, and that he believes ""you should always negotiate"". He told me he would talk to HR and follow up with me about it, and that I would hear back from him next week with their hiring decision. 

I did not hear back from the photo manager, and at the end of the next week, I received a call from the HR person quite literally berating me for trying to negotiate, and telling me that in her ""professional experience, when a job posting has a pay range listed, THAT'S what it pays and it's not going to pay more."" She was so rude and aggressive to me about it I was kind of shocked. She told me they were continuing to interview more people (even though they already did a reference check for me?) and would make a hiring decision in the next TWO weeks (pretty different than what the photo manger had told me the week before). 

Of course, I never heard from the photo manager again, and two weeks later I received a form rejection email saying they ""went with someone whose skills and experience more fit the position"" despite the multiple interviews, including the working interview, in which the feedback I received was that my skills and experience perfectly fit the position... I feel pretty certain that my request to negotiate the pay (which was pretty low for this position), is what took me out of the running immediately and cost me the offer. I emailed the photo manager with a polite request for feedback, and got another form email from the HR person again, saying it's ""against company policy to give feedback"". I replied and told her that I expected to be paid for the time I spent on the working interview, and of course have been ghosted. 

I'm sure it's not worth pursuing, but I feel so insulted and frustrated at the amount of my time they deliberately wasted. This is the longest and most in-depth interview process I've ever been through, and having it amount to nothing after the amount of time and work I put in is a real bummer even though I'm relieved I won't be working there at this point. But I do feel that taking the time to give me some honest feedback (and a direct reply) would be the least they owe me after about 5 hours of interviewing for this position. I would love any thoughts and welcome feedback or advice to help avoid situations like this in the future."

My roommate works in the tech industry and I’ve shadowed her twice. It’s very relaxed and not super stressful, which I like. They pay good as well. I’d just need to do more learning and research on my own. However I need more time because this job might not be a match for me. 

I need money as well but I don’t think it would be good to work at a retail job or in the food industry because I wouldn’t get any valuable experience from it or for my resume. I looked at good entry level marketing positions and they’re looking for full time. Marketing seems interesting to me as well, apart from tech. However, If I do full time then I won’t have time to shadow my roommate….

Advice?? What should I do?? Thank you"

Had a couple interviews with a company that went really well, last one was in office and I followed up day after, got the email described in the title a few days later and now it's been a few business days since then.

Is this normal or at least not unexpected with hiring for it to take longer than initially estimated to get back to you or do I assume I've been ghosted?

I mean I have to assume I've been ghosted in the sense that I'm not stopping applying until I sign an offer, it's just frustrating looking like I was going to leave a position I really wanted only to be in this anxiety of both not knowing if I got the job and not knowing if the lack of follow up is a coincidence or because they went with someone else.

They seemed nice and communicative enough that they'd let me know if I didn't get the job but never know, the waiting game sucks."

I currently work for a place that is 30 miles each way from my house. In the mornings, that is around 40-45 minutes of driving. In the afternoons, it can also be about 45 minutes if I choose to work out after work near my office, or closer to an hour, sometimes up to 1:15 if I decide to head straight home (I have a gym membership in both parts of town).

Currently, I work from home one day per week, but we are migrating to 2 days per week work from home next week. I recently got a verbal offer from a similar place that is about 8 miles away from my house, rather than 30. However, there are no work from home days. The new place has given me a verbal offer, but I am waiting for the written offer.

Based on salary range, it could pay anywhere between 4-20k more than my current job. They mentioned when they offered me the job verbally that there will be room for negotiation most likely once I get an offer from HR. I do like where I currently work and I've had multiple jobs before with bad environments, so I am anxious about leaving a good situation. I do enjoy working from home when I get to do it, but I also hate the 30 mile major city commutes and more pay is always nice.

My mindset right now is if they offer me close to the top of the range, it's a no brainer and I do it. But, for a closer salary (which would still be an increase), I am not sure. My current employer also mentioned ""possible"" pay bumps in October in the order of 20% but said they wouldn't know until May if that's happening.

Both jobs are in government fyi so benefits/security is similar (current job is state, potential new job is local)

3,2023-03-20,Escalation of Negative Feedback from Boss,u/SmilingGengar,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11wxwh8/escalation_of_negative_feedback_from_boss/,jobs,"I need some insight navigating a tough situation at work involving the way my manager is suddenly spotlighting my performance. To set the context:

In June 2022, I started working as a Program Manager for a new company.  Around the 5 month mark, there were layoffs, and my manager lost his job. My Manager +1, who just returned from parental leave at the time, then became my direct manager. For eight months into my role, I received positive feedback from my peers and cross-functional partners and that I was hitting the benchmarks of my role. Then, I received my performance review and was told by new manager that I was only meeting most expectations. Considering how positively by old manager thought I was doing, and the silence from my new manager for 3 months, I was shocked at my rating but I paid attention to the areas of improvement we discussed and came away feeling positive. All the while,  it had been announced that another round of layoffs were coming, but our manager had assured my peers and I that we were likely not going to be targeted, so I felt somewhat reassured despite my performance rating.

Then, 2 weeks later in my 1:1 with my manager, there was a tone shift. My manager shared that there were ""signifcant concerns"" about my performance and that I needed to improve in the areas we discussed. I expressed confusion and came away from the discussion not really understanding the path forward. Next day; I get an email from my manager summing up the discussion, which is highly unusual, as most of our interactions occur via ping or videocall. Realizing this might be a way for her to get my performance concerns in writing for possible termination purposes, I am replied back expressing my confusionn that I felt like I was being set up to fail, and suggested in my next 1:1 meeting that we focus on setting more concrete ways I can address focus concerns. I got a reply today (again via email) from my manager that she did not believe it would be a good use of time, since she thought we aligned on areas of focus in my performance review. She then proceeded to refer me to the career expectations portal and to an Employee Relations contact for additional support. 

It just seems so odd that I can go eight months without negative feedback only to suddenly be considered underperforming. I am going to be starting parental leave in less than a month, and I am absolutely terrified I am being set up to be let go before my parental leave begins and lose health coverage for my family. How should I handle this situation with my boss, or would it be better to accept I am doomed and begin looking for work elsewhere?"

1,2023-03-20,Work is 'updating my job description' without giving me a promotion (yet.) Meeting with HR rep this week.,u/zevelaceade,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11wy90f/work_is_updating_my_job_description_without/,jobs,"Long story short I've been at my company nearly 5 years. I was hired to do a more junior role with the intent to work my way up by taking opportunities to show my value. Slowly my work shifted completely to the senior 'opportunity' work I was doing as my competency was clear.    
     
Now, I've been exclusively doing this senior work for the past two and a half years. I've also been heavily advocating for myself, being plain that I would like a promotion based on the successes of my senior work with data to back it up, and that it's confusing to not have role clarity.     
      
My org has also been super messy. But recently, we got new leadership. I voiced my concerns to the new leadership and they have thankfully moved to take immediate action.  
     
The first step is that they are superficially, finally, changing my job title. They said the next step, but not guaranteed, is considering an official promotion in 5 months (when performance reviews take place.)  
     
It's still unsettling. They get senior output without paying the senior rate. I'm doing the exact work of my now-peers, while in the system at a lower level.    
    
The other factors are, I need this job and I love this work. My base salary has also increased 18% over these five years for COL increases, etc. So, it's not nothing.  
     
My question is, how do I approach my upcoming conversation with the HR rep? Do I talk about promotion opportunities in this conversation? Or save that and wait 5 months? Is it a ""thing,"" to have your job description updated without an immediate promotion?      
        
I really don't want to rock the boat, because I am grateful to have my job. But I also feel like I want to advocate for what's fair.    
      
I'm also accustomed to the corporate carrot of unfulfilled promises being dangled so I want to take conversation opportunities like this one while I can."

Turns out this position is a non-technical QA role. Hybrid position with full benefits, and the potential to work fully remotely in the future. Managers seem cool. The prospect of working a stable job seems really exciting, but the nature of the work doesn't. The managers admitted to me that the work can seem really repetitive and it can be hard to always see the ""bigger picture"". But the company likes to do internal recruiting, so it seems like there is potential to move around.

I don't know if I should just suck it up and take the offer, or keep trying my chances at finding something that immediately clicks with me on paper (I always say I don't need to **love** a job, I just want something I can feel excited about). I've never worked full-time before, and don't know if this would hurt my career (iow: I like helping people, tech, and being creative. Should I keep practicing my skills and keep looking for other opportunities instead? Would I needlessly be taking time away from that if I accepted?). I still live at home, so if I decline the worst that can happen is that my plans of moving out are pushed back a little bit, but I've never made a major decision like this before."

I was looking for advice on how to approach this. My coworker (70F) is known to stir the pot at work and now my (23F) name is being brought up by her. She has gotten into it with a lot of coworkers and LOVES to talk behind others backs. She was always very nice to me and the other day she gave me cookies. Well I just heard from multiple people that she keeps bringing my name up. Asking everyone why I was in my supervisors office (for personal matters) and saying that I’m always on my phone which is completely untrue as I go on my phone on my breaks only. She seems to be an issue in this office but is only because of seniority. It is well known in the office that she is not liked and she was put away in her own room because of how much beef she started with other coworkers. She won’t mind her own business. I’ve never had someone be so nice to me/compliment me and then have them turn around and talk about me behind my back. I want to confront her about it but I am at the point where is it even worth it? It doesn’t affect my work but it’s more of an annoyance because she constantly watches everything I do then runs to tell someone about it it seems like. But also she is very well hated around the office and karma will catch up to her. Is it worth it?

I am in my early 20’s and I recently finished my Bachelors degree. I just left my job at a retail store and started at a financial institution. The changes in work/life balance has been a dilemma for me for a few different reasons:

This job at the bank pays 5$ more dollars an hour, I however cannot say I would be in much financial trouble if I just work a certain amount of hours at my past job

The hours at my old job are much MUCH more enjoyable than the hours I am currently getting scheduled, with me getting a ton more free time at my last job, plus the schedule is so flexible, and despite some people who say working 40 hours a week until you die is a good thing, I am just not of that opinion. 

The people at my past job were so much more fun and casual than they are now, literally as one of my past coworkers put it today “Do you want a fun and casual work environment or do you want that money?” 

I also have plans to try to continue my education and I’m really struggling with the decision to stay where I am and try to grind it out or return to the place that I honestly enjoyed working at. 

I can’t help but struggle with an inner voice calling me lazy or irresponsible, but is it worth it if i’m kinda miserable? or should I stick it out for a bit and see how I end up feeling? Thank you for any advice."

31,2023-03-20,An Employers Perspective,u/ghostoutlaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11x0k7q/an_employers_perspective/,jobs,"I see a lot of people here talking about how they aren't getting the jobs they want or the jobs they think they're qualified for.  I run a growing business.  It's in person only and at one physical location.  This isn't to shame anyone who's looking for work or anything but I think when you realize what's going on outside of your bubble, you might start to make some changes.  And you should.  That's called gaining perspective.

I recently posted a receptionist job.  Pretty straight forward position, answering the phone, greeting clients nothing that cannot be trained in 1 hour.  There's a script to follow and everything, and we're chill about the script.  Make it your own, just make sure you hit these 4 specific bullet points!  But whatever feels natural is best!  Relaxed work environment, flexible hours, and realistically, you probably spend 60% of a shift doing nothing as there is no work to do.  Realize, the job is to handle the clients as they come.  There's not clients moving at light speed here.

For that role I got 350 applications upon posting it on ONE job site.  That's a free posting, no sponsorships, no promotions.  The free listing got 350 applications.  

Personally, I try to call every single applicant unless there is a clear and obvious reason to no at the start.  Still in highschool?  The schedule will be a conflict, sorry.  But that's maybe the only real one.  That removes **MAYBE 10%** of the field.  So we're still talking about 300+ applications to sift through.

So why didn't you get the job?  

1) When I called you, you didn't answer, and your voicemail is full or non-functional.  **10% of the field.**

2) When I left a voicemail, you never returned my call.  Ever.  It wasn't something that needed to be returned in 24 hours, but if you didn't return it at all, how do you expect to move forward?  **30% of the field**

3) When I called you, did you answer the phone politely?  Did you say anything at all?  This is maybe 1/3 of the calls I make.  Proper introduction made, obviously not a robo call ""Hi, this is X, from Y, looking for Z""  If your response is 'Who Dis?!?"" ""WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME?"" or silence, well, for a receptionist position that's probably not going to be a good fit.  Is this for a sales role or any client facing role?  Guess what, probably not going to be a good fit.  Hint: Almost 100% of jobs in America require you to interact with either clients or coworkers.  You just demonstrated your aptitude in those skills to the person capable of giving you the job you applied for.

4) When you returned my call, you did one of the above. Between steps 3 and 4 here, this probably eliminates the rest of the field.  Did you call me back and then ask me why you're calling me?  Really?  Think about that for a second.  I'm hiring a receptionist to do the work I do not have time to do.  And now you're making me do the work that I already do not have time to do.  You know what would have saved you?  A proper introduction, a statement of the reason you're now calling me.  Calling someone and saying ""Hello."" and then sitting in silence doesn't move the conversation forward.  Remember, I left you the voicemail, if you're calling me, you SHOULD have all the context you need to do the above.  And honestly, when you're calling me, I'm probably busy with something else, but if you did the above 2 steps, guess what, while I shift gears quickly and go find your resume, I can prompt you about the job for the stuff I do know off hand and can relate to your resume.  But 90% of the calls I get from the job seekers who applied open with hello and cold silence.

So at this point probably 95% of the field has been eliminated.  That's a lot.  And we haven't even had the first conversation yet!

Now here's some other real rookie mistakes:

Do not ask a question that was already answered in the job description, on the main page of the companies website, or that was already answered in a previous part of the conversation.  This might include 'what company is this?' or 'what job is this for.'  If we've had a conversation already and you don't know the answers, your shot at a job died right there.  It tells me you're not paying attention.  If you're not paying attention now, your probably not going to pay attention in training or on the job.

You can ask for expansion on any of the above.  Can you explain your warranty of XYZ, if it's not plainly covered on said website, for example, is a fine question.  If you ask me if we do offer a warranty, which is on our website home page, again, it tells me you don't care enough to lift a finger.  This is an important difference.  

Here's another one: You will most likely be asked to talk about yourself briefly and you will most likely be asked what you're looking for in a job.  Generally, this should be a no-wrong-answer question.  I'll ask this question if you caught me mid-task so I can buy some time to find your resume!  But alas, I have been proven wrong, it seems like a lot of people have found the wrong answers.

""I'm just looking for a job.""  - I know that, you applied.  

""I'm just looking for a job until school starts.""  - I know that, you applied.  And now I know when your last day is. Is it worth the time and effort to train you, (a few hours) plus the time for you to really find your groove and work out all your rookie mistakes (3-5 months).  

""I just need something part-time to help me pay bills.""  - So not only are you bad at budgeting, this isn't really important to you either.  Also this wasn't posted for part time, so you can't read either.

....silence....  I never realized there were so few people who couldn't even string together a sentence about themselves!  Like, is this that earth shattering?

Some examples of right answers?  Talk about literally anything.  Demonstrate you're an adult human being and not a robot.  

Like I said, this job is easy as shit.  Show up, smile, answer the phone.  

The bar?  It's really low.  But you're not supposed to use it for limbo.  Step over it. 

But I think a lot of people aren't realizing how jaded they are and how often the littlest thing does ruin your shot at a job that you did want. And this is for a simple hourly job.  I've worked $300k/yr jobs where there are 5 rounds of interviews involving technical tests, personality tests, IQ tests and meet the entire c-suite where you have to impress them all.  This is for a job that will pay 50-70k/yr if you just show up and smile. 

Moral of the story?  You're up against 350 people, probably more in even more densely populated areas.  Anything that is even slightly off, I have 349 others to move onto."

So what I did was texting the recruiter asking her if Im still getting called or what.

I accepted a position in November as an entry level engineer at a massive company starting this summer. 

During this last school semester many of my colleagues have received pay bumps from their companies anywhere from $3-8k, pushing most of them above my starting pay when I accepted the position not even 6 months ago. 

I’m wondering what the best way to negotiate a better salary would be without jeopardizing my future with the company. It’s a large company, so offending an HR person probably wouldn’t be the make or break it, but I don’t want to chance it. It’s frustrating seeing everyone around me get “market adjustment” increases and my company is giving crickets."

(I work in IT). I put in a JIRA service request for a maintenance task.  I specifically requested that the task be done 1 week from now, when all the necessary data is available to fulfill the request. I just entered the request early so coworkers aren’t scrambling at the last minute to get it done Note: All the dates were in the request and in the email I sent.   


The coworker who normally fulfills the request is on PTO. Fine, no problem. I already knew that. Well, the coworker filling in for them didn‘t  know how to do said task, but fulfilled it anyway and way earlier than I requested (today). I say “I requested this be done one week from now because the data has to be there first. Will the task get done again on the day I requested?“ They don’t respond.   


Then I respond in the ticket, attached my original email which specifies the day one week from now along with my comments. Another coworker sticks up for them and replies “Coworker who normally does this task is out on vacation. We don’t know how to do this task, but we did it anyway. Here are the results. If you can’t work with it, then you’ll have to wait until experienced coworker is back from PTO.” And has the nerve to attach the email showing the request has been fulfilled today.    


BRO. That’s all you had to say from the beginning. You both knew when I requested it and WHY I requested for that date. No one asked you to do it. I was simply alerting the appropriate team so it can be scheduled for when it needs to be done. Whats worse than an idiot? Two idiots who cover for each other.

TLDR: I requested a task be fulfilled on a specific date and coworker who doesn’t know how to do it did it incorrectly and way earlier than I requested so it’s gonna have to be done again in a week. Second coworker got snarky when I simply reminded them of the request timeline."

Within that time, supervisor got promoted to manager 6 months ago and has proven to be the worst manager I have ever had. Micromanging, disorganized and constantly gaslighting and intimidating our department don't do it justice. 

I'm the 3rd one to leave in 1 month due to this new manager. VP doesn't ask questions, so hes obviously not concerned. 

I put in my notice last Thursday and said I would like to use my accrued vacation, but I would help the team transition this week and then use my PTO. 

The kicker is that today he calls me into his office and says ""I thought this would be better discussed in person than email"" and then proceeded to tell me that HR wants me to ""finish my work out before I can take my PTO"". Keep in mind this is non-contract, at will state and accrued PTO is paid out in the final paycheck. My former co-worker found this out when HR asked if they wanted to use it but was unaware of the balance they had because its not tracked well. 

When he asked my thoughts, I told him my previous employers had always let me take my PTO as my 2 weeks, to which he snapped ""Is your work done?!"". (The work won't be done in 2 weeks as its a 6 week project)

I have NEVER left an employer on bad terms and always finished out my 2 weeks but I'm burnt out and being lied to and manipulated has pushed me to the brink.

For context, I'm a sophomore and in the environmental field. 

Internship A is with the government doing GIS work. It would be remote 4 days a week and I would have to commute 1 hour for 1 day a week. I want to work in government so I think that it would be a good experience. The cons are that it is unpaid (I know. This should be illegal or something but I'm going to college on a full scholarship so money isn't a necessity to me right now and I can work a part-time remote job that I'm already doing at school now), my current computer doesn't support the software so I'd need to get a cheap one that does, and doing GIS makes me anxious sometimes especially when I'm doing it in my own.

Internship B is with a private engineering company doing environmental assessments. It would be good money and I would be helping with interesting projects. The cons are that it would be a 2-hour commute round trip 5 days a week. So that's like 10 hours where I'm losing money on gas and car mileage. 

I just want a good experience doing fun projects and making good connections. On one hand, I want to be able to stay home and get some sun and hang with my cat (my last summer was spent cooped up in a lab 3 hours away from my family), but on the other hand, I want to make money and do work that I know i would 100% enjoy.

There are only 7 employees including the doctor and her husband, who is the billing manager.

For some context, I just graduated two months ago with a bachelor's in Neuroscience and am planning to apply to PA school in the near future, and I took this job as a way to increase my PCE hours. We initially decided that I will work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays because I have a class at a community college on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However as time went on, my boss asked if I can come after classes on T/TH because they need employees, I felt bad so I said okay. He also said that he would be looking for new employees in the meantime, but has just hired one employee who he complains about all the time. 

Now the issue is I feel extremely overworked. Out of all the employees, I work the most hours with barely any breaks. When I have the time, I take a lunch break for 20-25 minutes once every two weeks, while all the other medical staff has a proper lunch break almost every day. My other coworker who works with me in the front comes on Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 9 to 3, but we close at 5. I open on M/W/F and come around 11 to 11:30 on T/TH and close every day at 5. On days, when the official MA is not here, then I have to take her role, meaning am I doing twice as much.

I just feel extremely overwhelmed and exhausted at my job and I feel like Im barely being appreciated for my efforts. The doctor and manager just get mad when I ask a question or missed something when I have a bunch of other stuff to do. And most days, I'm alone in the front with no one to talk to while all the others are having so much fun. I was wondering if I should ask for a raise, reduce my hours, or just quit. 

Im writing because it seems like Im being selfish for doing this, but I am extremely exhausted and upset, does anyone have any good advice? And btw my hourly wage is $15 an hour."

I just don’t learn well this way, as far as “go and figure it out” type of thing. I get that you should learn on the job, but not even having a normal starting point has put me behind the 8-ball.

Aside from the culture, work-life balance is tough. I basically can’t make social plans on weekdays, even Friday, given the unpredictable nature of the work. 

At times, even now, I’ve felt behind where I should be. Has made me doubt my competence, and whether I’m just being lazy to not go the extra mile to catch up.

I guess in a way, I have become more resilient and learned to be more collaborative, but I’m just not happy at this job right now. The people are great, it’s just I don’t feel like I fit the expectations of this role.

Anyone with a similar experience willing to share what they decided to do? Stay and see what happens? Bide your time for another job? I need to make it a year to keep signing bonus, so that’s kind of my benchmark right now."

I am now being asked to manage a new team (in addition to the old one) of several individuals in a separate department. Should I ask for another raise?

I am conflicted because I have already received a raise relatively recently. That said, this new set of responsibilities is quite daunting, which makes a raise seem natural. Additionally, I am paid slightly more than the people I am supposed to manage - but only around 7% more. I am unsure if this is standard, or if I should shoot for higher. Opinions appreciated!"

The way it works is it accrues piecemeal weekly. I don't get the full 23 at the start of the year so between me taking 3 vacation days, leaving early for a doctor's appointment, being out sick 1.5 days, and calling out 1 day bc I couldn't make it in due to snow... I am out of PTO and my paycheck was short a few hours last week. I've got to wait for roughly 3.5 hours to accrue each week before taking any time off.

So, it got me thinking... how much PTO do you get? And what do you consider a fair amount?

While the money is good, and I'm good at my job, I'm absolutely miserable in sales, and I hate the constant quota pressure and the element of luck inherent to this role.

I keep hearing advice that all jobs suck, and that one should just go for the highest paying role, and that people who stick to one thing, specialize, and get really good at it reap the most rewards. So I feel guilty for considering other career paths. However I feel so miserable in sales... I kinda want out despite the high pay.

Alternatively, accounting seems actually interesting to me (yeah I'm weird lol)\_ after taking some courses, so I'm thinking of that as an alternate route and getting a CPA one day. However, my friends are telling me that Data Analysis might be a better route than accounting, and that it's closer to the tech world that I'm familiar with, so that its going to be more lucrative and open more doors for me.

At the same time, the Data/Business Analyst role seems saturated in the market right now? And accounting has a shortage (so may be easier to get jobs in?). So I'm unsure what to do, and where to pivot to.

Should I stick it out in sales and specialize in it while miserable for the next 7+ years to make a lot of money, or make the jump now to either accounting or data analysis?"

The 3rd job sucks. My boss are a mega micromanager. No proper turn over and expects that I can do everything after she tried teaching me all tasks in just first 2 weeks. She already knew I was super overwhelmed but doesn't do anything about it.
Going back, is it okay to take it out on my resume and stretch the date of my previous job?

My coworkers told me that it’s hard to get any day off due to the amount of kids I see. 

Then yesterday an old job reached out. It was the best job I ever had. I had to move to had to quit. Well they started doing teletherapy and said I can work from my new state and they’d like to rehire. They truly let you make your own schedule. Only requirement is seeing 20 kids a WEEK. I get paid more and can take pto whenever I want.

Interview process consists of a telephone and video interview, and potentially an additional final team interview. I had a first telephone interview with HR, where we discussed ‘qualifying’ questions - resume, experience, willingness to travel/relocate. The next day I received a callback to a video interview. 

I had the interview with the team lead. After presenting my background, they asked about my experience with a particular software system (was not explicitly listed in the job description) and said for this specific role, it was necessary, and I do not have the background for it. However, they said liked my profile and would like to find if there is a role for me at the organization. They gave a description of potential roles (they would fit my background), stated it met my salary expectations, and said they could get back to me in a week. 

On one hand, I appreciate that they were transparent with the role fit and still would like to find an opportunity. On the other hand, it threw me off to be told in the interview that I would not be interviewing for the role I had applied to - especially after the first interview?

I was called into the office yesterday, and was told that this coworker will be staying with the company and that I will need to learn to get along with this coworker and forget that any this ever happened. I said I would get over it and move on. I believe that the main manager is friends with this employee outside of the workplace, who is the one who told me to move on. 

I could barely sleep last night, as I feel guilty about not doing anything more about this. I know the next step would be to contact human resources, but then the managers (who I want to stay on good terms with) would know it was me who called. The other coworkers that are the victims want to call human resources, but they are afraid of consequences. I will only be here for a few more weeks, so I have a lot less fear regarding this.

My current company helped me get through a really tough time when my house burned down and i couldnt work for 2 weeks, and i feel that if i leave i would backstab them. I love my current company and i really appreciate them so this is really hard for me. 

The new company is great as i have a couple of friends there and they have really positive comments about it, they have a great stack and are working in some amazing projects, they have a 6 months raise policy and have done everything to try to get me to go to them, they have a 9 to 6,  4 days a week schedule.

Should i leave my company even though i have spend not too much time there, or stay and miss a good opportunity?

Edit: I think i need to make a clarification about the salary, what i get now is up to standard with the country i live in, the new company is a foreign one and has entered the market in the past 3 years so they pay basically the standard for the European market for my experience"

I have a few questions about applying for a job, but I wouldn't be available to start until September.

I am currently working a temporary position at a Land Trust and I will be done in Mid-August. I keep an eye on several job boards pertaining to my line of work, because I like to see what is out there, but also September is getting closer. Generally, I feel it is too far out for me to be applying to jobs, but today I saw a posting for a dream job in my dream location. As, I said I work in Land Conservation. The job they are hiring for requires a bachelors degree and a few years of experience. There are some prerequisites, but the job doesn't require a highly specialized skill set.

Leaving my current position is not an option. I care deeply about this organization and the people I work with. Leaving early would put them all in a very difficult position. Additionally, I believe their recommendations and connections in the field will be very valuable to me. I will not burn this bridge.

So, my question is, should I apply for this job when I can't start till September? If so, what is the most tactful way to do this? I am not exaggerating when I say dream job in my dream location. Pay and benefits are good. In terms of years of experience, it may be a bit of a reach for me, but I think I would be a great fit for the position. 

Thanks all for your help and opinions!"

Rather new to the office environment, came from a toxic customer service environment so I have no frame of reference here. Communication was more or less drilled into your head, so this is completely new to me. 

At my current job, most of us are hybrid and don’t see each other very often. Communication is basically non existent unless it’s as needed and even then you might get ignored. At my assessment, I was told not to ask questions and to find answers myself. It’s not often I even need to ask anything so this shocked me.

My job uses a lot of stuff you can’t just Google, they mean to search our database wherein most of the information is outdated and this has been pointed out to them. Alas no updates or changes have been made.

There’s no sense of teamwork and I feel like I’m on eggshells. I wouldn’t mind a job where no one really spoke to each other if the silence didn’t feel hostile. Does that make sense? No one even says hello or bye. Is this normal in an office setting?"

Place opens in about 1 week. I'll be training new employees with no extra pay. I'll have to climb the ladder. Pressure is high on me and I have no other choice but to work under them. Unless I disappear. I just want to be a normal employee at a normal job. Never went to college, spent most of it raising my sister(14F). Sister is the favorite, already gets 10% of the business' funds w/o having to manage the restaurant, she lives an easy life, private school, college paid for. Good for her. It's my cue to leave now. I've worked under my parents for years &amp; this is the first time they are paying me (only lord knows). Last few years were of fake checks, including a very abusive &amp; hostile environment. Every job I got hired for to get away from them, they got me fired. I've done all of their license exams for them. When I was a falsely-claimed certified nail technician, I was forced to paint people's nails w/o training, had to rub &amp; massage old women's feet when I was a minor, I had to talk sweet to them for an hour &amp; I'd get $0. Whatever they wanted me to do, I did &amp; I got paid with trauma &amp; a prayer every night to die early. Now that I'm older, I realized how messed up that is. I did that for months until, you guessed it, a mental hospital is where I landed. I don't have the mental capacity to go through all that again. I understand how broke they are, but I literally have no future because of their decisions. They bought this big $700k house knowing very well they only make $30k/year each including taxes. Thanks to Reddit, I found out being a hotel receptionist is something I'd like to work full-time as. Reddit saved my life. My last straw was when my parents said they don't need me for afternoon shifts on weekdays because they don't have enough to pay me. I told them I'll find a 2nd job, and they immediately refused and told me I could work afternoon shifts. I have to leave my parents and my sister. My parents don't really want me to do well on my own, and my sister is too young to care about this. So, no car, no shelter, only $1,500. What should I do? Working at the restaurant to save up a few more grand would mean I'd have to put in double the amount of work for the same pay. Should I just say F it and find a roommate? An apartment that is near 3-star hotels? Some hotels are very close to where I live and the pay's $5000 extra annually than if I worked with my parents, not including taxes. Is my first step getting an interview and being hired? How would I even explain the situation to my interviewer?"

(3month probation).I’ve been a STAHM for 8 years and prior to this worked in a similar role but for a small company slightly higher level before my career break. I may be overthinking feedback (but I listen and take it all on board) but can’t help think some of it is quite petty but willing to stand corrected. My colleague who has been training me (it was her role previously for 6 years) and it grew and evolved and now she’s been promoted. She has been highlighting every single minor mistake to my boss. I know I will learn and grow etc but it seems it’s the only communication I get from her. She is so quick to point it out, within minutes via email and clearly feeds back to my boss. I’m starting to get anxiety around simple tasks and dread seeing an email from her. She is quite blunt with her responses and won’t say hi in the office unless I approach her. I was told not to be afraid to ask questions but in my last 1-1 I was told I asked too many and should seek information from elsewhere. But until I knew who did what and where information could be found it was hard to know where to seek this advice. It’s mainly to do with their internal processes (and there is a lot). Otherwise I would happily Google it. I like to clarify information if I’ve not understood, and try to not make the same mistakes over again. But I’m also new to their processes and I’m human and how things work here are so different (almost stifling) than where I previously worked. Sometimes I find out I’ve missed a step (not been told a step) until it’s highlighted it’s wrong. Then the feedback was I ask too many questions. Then, the other day I’m now not asking enough questions again. The overall job is easy, it’s their internal processes and filling in repetitive forms that sometimes I struggle with. Things highlighted: I put some content in an (internal) form in the wrong box the other day. A letter had 2 spaces between paragraphs not one- even though I had used their template. Things like this that get highlighted. I had used the wrong Job title taken from another form someone else had filled in incorrectly. And everything is such a huge problem if I do make a mistake. I can’t laugh with her. She has handed the whole role over to me and thinks I should immediately pick up where she has left off. The role is so busy I don’t know how my colleague has time to pick up on anything I do. Unless she is no longer busy. I feel a little like I’m about to sink. It’s getting me down and I’m so worried I won’t pass my probation. Any advice? Please be kind."

I have a degree in MIS - and I have a decent corporate history of 5 years or so in IT working with PM grounds/backend dev work and so on.

I never received direction and yes - I asked. I did the reviews every year - I asked my leadership repeatedly - the company eventually sold out for a merge and fired 90% of the staff despite telling us it was all ok.

Prior to this I was in the military (2010-2013) as a reservist/mechanic. To pay through college I essentially hustled (buying/selling off craigslist cars/bikes/computers) in the metro detroit area. I still do that to supplement as it can be very lucrative but the consistency and danger are factors. I graduated college later and worked doing Legal SOW IT bids in the gov ed sector, as a project manager in the financial reporting for a large commercial insurance firm, as a production support analyst and as a operations cloud engineer for a bit. 

That being said I'm working all sorts of jobs in the meantime - but I would like to find a remote role as a base in any sort of operations/financial/logistics IT sector. I have applied to over 200 jobs and gotten no callbacks/notes back/anything (ziprecruiter/monster/linkedin etc).

What should she do?,u/adilra,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11xk6rz/a_friend_who_resigned_due_to_burnout_is_being/,jobs,"Hi, recently a friend of mine who was severely burnt out decided to resign from her job. Now as she was doing her notice period, her boss decided to ask her if she wants to think about a change of position? Basically, he says that the position would be less stressful and tiring compared to her current job. Now her boss is actually the only good guy left at the company. She says that he’s the only one who does really care about how much work she’s been handling recently. The problem has been that whenever her boss leaves (vacation or any other reason), it becomes chaotic again. Also, one thing to mention, is that her boss is fully aware of the amount of work she does and really thinks that without her, him alone handling the work would also be pretty difficult so basically finding someone who replaces her would also be almost impossible.

She has been having second thoughts now. While this change of job might be good, it can still go worse again. But on the other hand, she gets to keep the job and there’s also a good chance it is not stressful anymore.

What are everyone’s thought about this? Has anyone here gone through a similar phase? I want to mention that she has been extremely burnt out the last few days. To the point that she wouldn’t be able to think properly and forget obvious things while doing day to day activities. It is extremely sad to see her like this. I really want to advise her the best I can and so here I am…

So far my answer to her is that she should leave the job. She’s very capable and skilled and I’m confident she can find another job which would be much less stressful for her."

This is the third manager I’ve had who’s yelled at me for the dumbest shit, creating a hostile environment for something so small and an issue they should be able to debug as a leader. 

I need this job until I can find a new one but am checked out. At this point I’m just hoping I get fired. I was excited for this role, eager to grow and learn but not anymore.

The issue: Manager doesn’t understand CI/CD nor Git, couldn’t merge a branch I recommended they create since they refused to pull changes made to master to their local machine. Apparently, I’m to blame because they can’t merge their branch. I’ve never worked for a company that doesn’t know version control.

Manager proceeded to say I don’t retain information, which must be a joke because my colleagues have all said I ramp up quickly and have been of great use having only been here for 1 month.🤷🏽‍♀️"

In the past, other people have said that knowing Canva isn't a graphic design skill, so now I'm wondering if the recruiter thinks I lack proper skills to be further considered for the job.

Only that my coworker (we both run the check in counter at a very busy medical office) has called out for the last two days and left me alone to deal with it all. We've had past problems where she would leave work for me or ignore patients while she is busy with her phone. So I don't doubt that this is some kind of fucked up punishment. 

Management is now ignoring me. One of our medical assistants asked me about some emails that were sent to our department. I didn't get any of them. But for some reason I'm getting a huge flow of requests to call patient and send forms in our scheduling system.

Everything is all set up for my new job. I have my start date and all I have left is to attend orientation .

I wanted to be good and do the right thing but it really pisses me off that I'm being treated like this. Another week just isn't worth it. I don't think I can make it past this Friday."

They are both, ""sit in the office and take calls from people who know what they want, sorta""  In other words, learn the software to input orders, learn the product line, build relationships, try to sell/upsell if appropriate.  


The company that let me go, lets call them 'C', complimented me on my phone skills and how quickly I learned the product line and the software but said I was too stressed and they didn't think I would be able to keep up with their busy period.  But, there was no training, I had access to all of the files from the previous person and would copy their work, and was told it was wrong.  Nothing was printed out, nothing was written down.  It was all head knowledge and with only a few months, I was asking questions or making wild guesses.  And yes, that stress (and other stressors) piled up.  One thing that stood out was when I asked for a job description, it was too complicated.  


Interviewed last week for a similar position, got along great with the owner, but it was the same thing 'the job is too involved to have a job description'.  This feels like a red flag.  Didn't I write one in my opening paragraph??  On the other hand, in both places, there was so little turnover in the past 15+ years that the people doing the job knew what it was.  And HR, as a dept, is non-existant, so there isn't a drive for standardized descriptions and goals.    


I need to email her today, how can I approach this lack of info?  How can I structure questions to use it for a positive???"

I moved to Canada (Whistler specifically) because the lifestyle was awesome.
I'm very outdoorsy and adventurous, I love sport and lots of people around here do too.

Recently my SO (25F) and I (25M) moved to Vancouver in search of more job satisfaction / careers. I loved Whistler but that was the only thing missing from my life.
Since moving here 6 months ago, I have felt isolated and bored in the job I picked up. I'm working as a front desk supervisor for a community centre; although day to day the job isn't shitty, I feel there is no progression or learning that I do.
I try to fill my time by looking for other jobs, searching for interesting courses or chatting to clients about sociological topics.

I've thought about going back to school to either pursue Counselling or Engineering as I think both of these buy into my inquisitive nature and will give me the day to day variance that I would value.
Is there an easy way for me to find out if I would be suitable for either of these roles? Does anyone have advice on finding ways into new careers? How have you increased your career satisfaction in a job you don't like?"

A promotion has been offered to me 2 years earlier than expected at work, where I have been for 20 years.

It would be for the head of a department role, which is great. 

I will be having a discussion next week, and the director has said it is to discuss terms, wage rise, role responsibilities etc

This is quite short notice for me, as I wasn’t expecting it.

They have asked me to fulfill the role, I haven’t applied, but I am over the moon that I have been offered it.

The awkward part for me, is the wage. I know I want £10-15k more than I am on now, due to the accountability I will have.

Also, I know, although shouldn’t, that other heads of departments are on this sort of money. Plus the have a company car.

The current Head of department who I am replacing has never been bothered to ask about cars etc.

What is the best way to ensure I get a fair deal, and not undersell myself? 

I was thinking of telling the Director to make me the best offer he thinks I am worth. But will this backfire? What if it is far too low? 

I could turn the role down if I’m not happy with the proposal, but I don’t know how long I may last at the company if I do? 

I’m in the UK by the way. 



Thanks"

I would’ve stayed on if I could as it was mostly WFH, a four day week, very flexible and I loved the people and the work. 

Anyway, I then took a month’s break before getting a new job, where I’ve been for about 6 weeks now. It’s a totally different sector and I’m enjoying it, but the commute, longer working week, and lack of flexibility are a bit jarring given my previous employer’s policies. 

Now, my previous employer has a vacancy for my ex-supervisor’s role as they’ve left the charity. I’m honestly in two minds about applying to go back. On one hand I feel like I’ve not given the new job a proper chance, but the job I’m considering offers the flexibility/shorter week/good people and both jobs offer about the same take-home pay. 

Just looking for some thoughts/advice while I mull it over!

Edited to add: the vacancy isn’t interviewing until late May so it’ll be about 6 months before in post"

1. Flexible schedule, nights and weekends only are a must, even for training. 20 hours a week is the max I’d be willing to accept.

2. Fairly brainless - data entry or call center most likely, though I have advanced excel experience.

3. Remote - non-negotiable on this. I’ve been remote at my full time for 8 years, I’m not going in somewhere for 15/hr.

I’ve had several interviews and even offers but everyone around me seems to want day shift during the training period."

To start, I have had some short term jobs. I am a server now and have been for a while at different places, I have been at my current place for 8 months. One thing that throws me off is I left the service industry and got a job in a furniture warehouse. How this happened is I saw a post on FB about a job through a temp agency that they were hiring for a customer service work from home job. That is what I want to transition to, atleast to start. A technical customer service job, helpdesk, or just customer service and go from there. Back to the warehouse job, they didn't seem to think I'd be a good fit for the job I guess because they just kept pushing warehouse jobs on me. I decided to go for an interview at the furniture plant and went ahead and took the job. I ended up hating it but I needed a job so I took it. I  lasted about 7 months there and couldn't take it anymore. I didn't enjoy the work and it was not a match for my skills either. I went back to serving. 

Before the warehouse job I was working for a local company that is similar to Doordash. I had to leave that job because it was becoming too much wear and tear on my car and was not making enough for a new car or for expensive repairs. The driving job was close enough to serving that I'm not really worried. Before that I was at different serving jobs, not lasting at some due to not making enough money or toxic work environments. This industry is very well known for the toxic work environments lol. 

I did have work from home jobs before. I worked for a company that outsourced for Apple support and it was work from home. That was back in 2016 though. I also had jobs I did through Upwork. One of the jobs through Upwork was tech support for a small software company but it was only a 3 month job. I am currently studying for the A+ exam, I think that may help some. 

This is getting way too long now. I have no clue how to make a resume that will help me look hirable. I am great with people, I have great soft skills. I can highlight those but I don't know where to start with everything else. Could paying someone to help be worth it possibly? Am I screwed basically? Oh I forgot to mention that I will be 40 this year which doesn't help my case."

It's a long story in and of itself so I'll just detail the ramifications I've have from it: I've had to drop out of university due to medical complications which prevent me from attending class and I now am getting out of my lease on an apartment which means I'm moving back to my parents in another state where I grew up in. 

The job problem is I got offered to be a Piano instructor at the USD in my area and well it sounds like the perfect job for me. I can't do physically intensive work anymore and I can't stand on my feet for longer than say 30 minutes so any job that let's me sit down and work is already gonna get my attention. Furthermore, I'd be teaching music (my passion in life) at schools to elementary and middle schools which would be perfect experience for the occupation I want to go into. I'm looking at child psychiatry/psychology and it would honestly be perfect job experience for me since my career desire is to work with kids. I plan on returning to university once I get my medical stuff cleared up and going into post-grad education (either med school or graduate program) so I think this job would be great. 

I'm stuck on staying here while taking a break from school since my grades have slipped after my medical episodes occurred on campus before and I've missed attendance OR just going back home and packing it all up. I'm in the process of getting my lease here taken over and I obviously won't be at university for the time being but this job seems like the perfect fit. What would you do if you were me?"

If anyhing is missing my boss is going to take charge of that and complete everything despite extra hours of work for him... because it's just the way he's used to work. Asking for new stuff to do or helping him to get rid of some workload is only up to me. Plus nobody cares if Im 5 or 10 minutes late, I can have a break whenever I want and often Im in my office alone so nobody really check if Im working or not. Basically an almost completly stress-free placement...This might sound fantastic right? Wrong. All of this is counterbalanced by a low salary and very precarious type of contract (basically a cooperation in wich I just ""sell"" my service) with no insurances, no paid vacation, nothing... Another thing that is coming up and I didn't take in account is how lazy I became lately because of this situation. I feel as if I'm not used anymore to ""work"" and  work hard. Also I feel that Im ruining my career becasue Im still somehow young and this is the time where I should inetensively build up skills, but I have no triggers to actually doing that. Overall Im very demotivated becasue of my university and the toxic job enviroments I experienced so far, but this might not be the right sub for that... Fact is that I want to move forward and it's been a while Im searching for new jobs... But whenever i go to the job interview I get scared, like scared that Im not able to handle stress anymore. Im well aware that new jobs would challenge me especially at the beginning, surely Im going to face uncomfortable situations, maybe some scoldings... It can happen to be fired if Im going to mistake too much, it's not pleasant but it's normal after all. But Im freaked out from all of this... During job interviews they're asking for motivation, enthusiasm, reliability, but I feel that just can't give anything of that... I just want a decent ""job"" that makes me work hard for a good salary/warranties in exchanges.

I also thought I could take advantage of this extra-comfortable situation for learning new stuff on my own... start working free-lance and stuff but instead I find myself super lazy and demotivated. Has anyone else been there? Should I accept any new job just to move from where I am now?"

It's for the position of a sales director for a new hotel being built and opening soon. The company is having a hard time finding any suitable candidates for the role and the hiring manager told me I fit the criteria well (local, knows the market and the accounts). I am the only applicant that has the credentials they're looking for. 

Then came the question of the salary expectations. I mentioned an annual salary of $86k-$100k and he did say it's bit beyond their range but with my experience he can talk to the owners.

Do you think they'll give in?"

6,2023-03-21,Am I allowed a break?,u/New-Noise-6486,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11xodo1/am_i_allowed_a_break/,jobs,"I work as a dishwasher at a very busy restaurant/bar. On average I work 10-12 hour shifts with lots of unpaid overtime that makes our shifts last 14-15 hours. The job is extremely busy on Friday to Sunday, originally we had a decent number of staff but most quit and on average lasts less than two weeks due to people feeling overworked and barley able to have a break. 

I worked yesterday and came in at 12pm and the job was busy the entire shift, tons of dishes stacked so high and I was scheduled to work alone. There was at least 3000 dishes or more as more and more started to pile up as the shift progressed. I’m working alone and it’s now 6pm. I’ve had zero bathroom breaks, haven’t drank anything the entire day and was very dehydrated and tired from having to do all of this alone. I continue working for about another hour as it approaches 7:30. My shift ends at ten and I’ve hadn’t had any kind of break. I decide to take my half hour break at 7:30 to get some fresh air, not even five minutes later I get called by a manager freaking out asking where I am. I said “I’ve been working since 12pm I need to sit and eat”. My manager tells me I’m not allowed to have a break when it’s busy and that I need to come back to work immediately. I was exposed to Covid last week and called out for a shift so I went back because I felt like I owed them but as soon as I come back I’m getting so much attitude from my employers and co-workers for having a break. My manager then says that “once you get all these dishes done we can consider a break”. My shift ends at 10pm and finally around 9 another dishwasher finally shows up to help but it was already too late as my shift was basically over. I worked the whole shift without a break and I usually work shifts without a break but a month ago I was put in the hospital after a shift due to dehydration and was told by doctors to not overwork myself so it’s very important I allow myself to have a break. I’m not sure if they’re allowed to not give us a break."

I have 3 years of hospitality/customer service experience as well as 2 internships with a tax and insurance company. I am not sure what the problem is.

I hear companies are laying off workers left and right, so maybe a recession is coming soon. Is it worth it to apply for jobs now - or should I hold off and wait for this tsunami to pass?

What kind of questions should I prepare for? Those who have had or have given informal interviews is it truly more of a conversation? I am treating this very seriously because I very much want to work at this company, just want some advice on how to leave a good impression. 

The interview is blocked off for a full hour."

I have no problem paying taxes after studying  and beginning in my career path since then I could afford the costs of my insurance and such but currently while in school it's not ideal. 

Today randomly my employer sent me a message asking for my info to put me on payroll which I asked if it was nesesesary but have yet to hear from them. 

However since this is the first job I've ever worked off the books I'm wondering if my employer can force me to go on payroll or not."

As the title explains, I’m currently a contracted customer support assistant helping a small company with their orders. Recently, an influx of complaints have come in and long story short some of the very expensive orders ($XX,XXX) are simply not being shipped. Some items have been promised a ship time of a month but are coming up on a year. Others are having their refund requests ignored and resorting to chargebacks. The owner has encouraged us to mislead customers and they themselves will lie to them by making up fake customer support names to continue running inquiries in circles. 

From this collection of responses from the owner, manufacturers, and customers, I have been lead to believe the company as a retailer may not be paying the manufacturers for the orders and thus the customers not getting their order. 

I intend to quit soon, but I wanted to know if there’s anything I should do? 

I thought of filing a complaint with the BBB but i am not sure if they even do anything. 

Can i warn customers when they call? Or is that a risk of getting sued? 

Any advice?"

I didn't think anything of it, as they made me take an assessment for the job position, but maybe I missed something? I was asked to start on the 23rd and I quit the job I was working, but they wanted me to get some things for the job because it's WFH and we are not in the same state (company is in Massachusetts and I am in California). They sent me a check to purchase things, but my bank rejected the check and it didn't go through.

The last time the person contacted me was over the weekend (which she had said not to do because they don't work over weekends) to see if the check had cleared and I told her that my bank had not cleared it and it would be available on a different date. That was the last I heard of her.

I've been trying to contact her again, and even emailed her but her email is no longer available. I'm looking through LinkedIn and even their website to see what's going on and there's been a note added that their emails end in "".com"" and I received an email from her ending in "".net"" and "".org"".

I'm starting to fear that I was scammed, and I want to do one last attempt at reaching out directly to the ""company.""

I'm thinking of reporting the company as fraudulent and making sure it's removed before anyone else gets scammed like I was.

Do you think I should reach out today or on the day I'm supposed to ""start""?

(Not sure what to flair this, so please let me know if I need to change it)

Edit:

I forgot to mention, they even added a password to the fake checks. Man, they are thorough.

Edit 2:

I already filed a complaint through the FBI page and tried doing one with LinkedIn but it wouldn't let me, so I'll try again tomorrow.

Edit 3:

I just went looking for them on LinkedIn and their page is gone! I'm still debating if I should contact the company through the website to see if it's legitimate, but at the moment, I'm completely unsure and don't want to."

I’ve been working at a company that sells medical devices B to C for 4 years now, and I’m realizing as I try to do some wage research that my job title doesn’t really describe what I do. So I’m wondering what my duties might be called and/or what similar roles at other companies would be. 

My department basically handles all of the back end work on customers accounts. If a customer wants to add or remove a service or change the kind of device they have we adjust the account, bill or refund them as needed, and create the order for fulfillment. We will go in and do things like change how frequently a customer’s billing cycles, or add or remove them from paper invoicing. We also handle account cancellations and billing for/creating new orders. However we don’t have any interface with the clients themselves (we didn’t even have phones when we worked in the office), we don’t handle any incoming checks, and we don’t do any kind of overall AP/AR reporting. Also because we’re B to C we don’t deal with insurance companies or medical coding. My job calls this a Billing Specialist. 

Unfortunately I don’t remember what my official job description was when I got hired, and even then iirc it wasn’t a very accurate description. Thanks in advance for any help!"

I am a receptionist at a medical practice. There are only two receptionists, including me. I currently work 4 days a week from 8am to 5pm.

I’m currently going through a lot of health problems, but the major one is functional neurological disorder. Late last year I ended up in the hospital because I suddenly just had no feeling in the right side of my body. The numbness is still there but eased up somewhat. I’ve now had another flare up that has given me a tremor in one arm. A couple of weeks ago I had to go home from work two days in a row because the tremor was so bad I couldn’t write or use the computer. I was just useless. On top of the tremor, I’m also constantly fatigued, achy, get random pains, dizziness and constant headaches. It has made me miserable and slower at work. I’m also more prone to making mistakes. I’m so exhausted and miserable that I have frequent crying spells and breakdowns, even at work which is super embarrassing and probably really annoying/stressful for my coworkers, but I just can’t get it under control. 

There is really no magic fix for it, other than physio to rewire my brain and reducing stress. There are no medications to take. It is a waiting game. I feel the stress of work is making recovery borderline impossible. I know I only work 4 days a week, but even that is so difficult right now. I feel I need some time off, but I don’t want to leave the other receptionist high and dry or further hurt my relationship with my manager. She is already quite fed up with all my health problems and how it’s impacting my job. 

Has anyone taken medical leave before and if so, how did you go about it? How can I do this without hurting my job security and my work relationships? Do I need a letter from my doctor? If it helps at all, I live in New Zealand. Any advice is welcome."

Am I overreacting? She needs to recognize I can’t mind read and give clearer directions. I just can’t stand being blamed all the time. Like yes I do mess up, but if and when I do, be professional and take the time to organize your thoughts into a constructive email. Ugh"

My direct superior told me I did incredibly well and she wanted to give me an A and promote me. However our company works on a bell curve and after she put up her recommendation to her superior (VP), I got rejected. Basically she tried to promote myself and another colleague but her superior told her that he can only promote one person and he chose my colleague. 

My superior told me its an issue of visibility. The vp chose my colleague because he works more closely with him as my colleague is involved in a project that the vp is personally leading. My portfolios on the other hand are just as important and heavy, but the vp is not as involved.

The more I think about it the more unfair I felt it is. If that's the case wouldn't everyone just choose to only pick up projects that the VP is overseeing and not other projects no matter how important it is?

I'm not picky about what projects I get assigned. My manager knows this. I usually let my other colleagues also have a choice because someone has to do the work any way. But apparently thats called ""not fighting for myself"" according to my manager. Its a little disappointing honestly because putting the teams needs above my own has apparently bit me in the ass.

My manager tried to fight for me and has a verbal agreement with the VP that if I prove myself within the next 6 months, they will give me an off cycle promotion. However I highly doubt that's going to be happen because off cycle promotions are very rare and if he already doesn't see my efforts in the past 2 years I don't think he will in the next 6 months. But my manager said she will give me more projects to handle and exposure in front of the vp in the coming 6 months.

I'm not optimistic about this but I also don't want to be dismissive about my manager's efforts. How would you move forward in my case? I love the job and the people it's just the system is a little disappointing to me. Or is that a common reality and I should only blame myself? It's not in my personality to be aggressive or think of myself as more deserving of that promotion than my colleague. I have no issue with him being picked and he is more than deserving,  but it could have been both of us.

There's also another newer colleague in our team that I'm real tight with. If I'm gonna wait for next year, I'm gonna be competing with her. Which I don't want to because neither outcome is gonna be great. Either she has to wait one more year after me, or she's gonna be ahead of me which leaves me more disappointed"

After months, I created a program that cut down the time it takes cleansing hundreds of thousands of lines from 7 months with 8 people working on it to only 1 week with only 1 person working on it. I made this program proactively and on the side from my other projects. I was never tasked to do it. 

I am leaving company A in 2 weeks and now the company is freaking out because I am the ONLY ONE who knows how to run the program and maintain it. My current manager at company A is asking me to train her on how to use it or train the new kid who just got done with his internship.

Should I train them out of the goodness of my heart or seek compensation for my work and the training? I have nothing, but good things to say about company A except for the higher management, but an old memory of one of my management professors popped into my head regarding this scenario where he explained how he was in a similar situation and got a bonus before he left.

Is this a thing and should I attempt it? Or should I just train them a bit before I go and not sour the waters? I could potentially be looking for a position within company A once I receive my MBA and look for a manager role.

31,2023-03-21,My boss wants to suddenly start monitoring me,u/CaraquenianCapybara,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11y0g7h/my_boss_wants_to_suddenly_start_monitoring_me/,jobs,"I work since 3 years ago on a remote position with a business in the US from Latin America. During that time, my relationship with my bosses has been relatively well, and even though we had up-and-downs due to working with business owners, we have worked well together and they have praised my work.

I also know I am massively underpaid. My job requires technical knowledge which I have acquired through the years, both because of what I have done on my job and because I have spent my leisure time on learning more about how to improve things. But since I am outsourced, I know I can't ask for the same salary as someone who is in the US and that's the attractive factor for them: they get someone who gets the job done well at even a third of the price. I am not a programmer, but I am heavily motivated to learn about technology and I created the database architecture of the system we use everyday at work.

Last month, I had an argument with my boss regarding my salary. He promised to raise it, but wanted to stick to the lower end of what he promised. After a light discussion, he agreed to keep his word. But there was a catch.

A week later after we talked about my raise, he pushed the idea of us installing screen monitoring software. The one which takes a screenshot every couple of minutes and tracks the motion of your mouse and the strokes of your keyboard to see if you are being ""productive"".

The thing is, I feel really offended by this. The main advantage of this work is the flexibility that we have when dealing with the problems we face, the past sensation that there is nobody looking over the shoulder what we do (I experienced this on the past and it was horrible) and the fact that the team I lead and I have Google Meet chats every once in a while, which have made us bond together while we deal with difficult situations.

Also, it's like a way of saying to my face that the management doesn't trust us, while all of this time, we have delivered good results and worked our best to do so. If this was something implemented from the very beginning, I could understand it: you don't know me, you don't know if I will do the job well, therefore, you have to monitor a new employee to check they are doing well their tasks. But if we have worked together all this time and you have praised the quality of my work, why trying to impose such a demoralizing strategy?

I have really felt bad about this over the course of the last weeks, since I am currently doing a master degree and I have to keep paying back the tuition fees, but I don't feel well knowing that I could be potentially micromanaged. Besides, this is my personal computer, the one I bought with my money and which I use for personal reasons and for university stuff.

The final point is that, while I really know how much I work and I am really eager to show accountability for all the results I provide for this business, regardless of whether they are good or bad, I would not like to lose my privacy, specially after being promoted to team leader and being praised all of this time. This measure only seems to me as some kind of retaliation to me since I gave extremely convincing arguments while negotiating my last raise. ""You are now earning more, but we are totally going to control you, to check you are not slacking"".

Am I being totally irrational, guys?

What do you think is the best course of actions I could take on this situation?

Thanks.

PS: I don't work in a contract basis, so there is no legal point to argue about this. I am just a freelancer who perform duties per hour in a marketing agency."

Been a few years since my graduation and I’ve been holding a job as an assistant manager at a dominos. Not really the potential I think I have, but I don’t know otherwise.

If what I want matters, I’d like to get into retail, but after a terrible experience at Walmart, my best plan is to go to an employer with a better reputation and hope. This would be Costco or HEB here in Texas, but I can safely assume that they have very low turnover. Especially Costco compounded by the fact that there is only one within 200 miles of where I live.

Overall, where am I supposed to go? Get to the lower level and work my way up? I don’t mind it, but I’m certain I can do better than nearly minimum wage with a bachelors degree, or working at a job with a cap as part of the dress code. Does it even help? How so? So that I can take advantage of it.

I can understand asking generic questions for an entry level position, but as someone who has more than 5 years of experience in the field, what gives?

A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a table with a 2nd grade girl on my lap. My (white) coworker, sitting across from us, used the n-word with a hard r in casual conversation - a foot away from us!

I’ve brought up the issues with my site manager, but she’s kind of a pushover &amp; hasn’t made any significant changes. Because they’re so lazy, I’m usually stuck doing two or three times as much work as anyone else.

1. I live in Canada.
2. I applied to an internship with the provincial government and got it. I am currently completing the onboarding process. The job starts in May and pays $15.50 an hour.

4. Compared to the provincial internship, where I'll just be doing basic office tasks and administrative work, the CRA position will allow me to work in four different departments over the course of four summers and give me a wider range of experience.

Dilemma:

1. I just accepted the offer from the provincial internship a few days before the offer from the CRA came in. We're finishing the onboarding process.
2. Is it okay if I say that I'm going to accept another offer this late into the hiring process? Wouldn't that be considered very rude and make their life harder?"

So im an undergrad student whos graduating in May, and I really dont know what to do with my life. Im kinda in a rut, feeling uninspired and not too happy. All my life feels like its leading up to a boring and stressful job in corporate America with little chance of adventure and genuine human connection. Everyone around me keeps saying ""life aint sunshine and rainbows"" and that ""you need a job to do the things you love"" ... and they are right, but i see videos of people on tiktok and in movies and crap that seem to be so happy and doing ""what they love"", and I want to feel that happy as well and i dont feel like my life is moving in that direction atm. Problem is i have really bad anxiety and i also romanticize everything ... not a good combo.

I eventually broke down and ended up reaching out to the company that I interned with the year before. They have offered me a contract position for 6 months to a year and with a wage of around 60k that comes with no benefits except payed holidays and payed time off. This job is near my parents house, so costs would be low for me personally. Its a safe option. The internship was a little bit stressful and boring at times, and i got a bit depressed while working there because i was so dedicated to making a good impression. Im assuming this contract position will mean more difficult tasks and probably more stress as well. Im not really excited by the prospect and imnot really interested in potentially being awarded a salary position there.

So yeah ... thats really all i got. Im young, and i feel like if i spend my youth slaving away, i will never be able to appreciate and explore life later on. I have a good amount of savings, but dont really know what to do with it nor how to spend my spare time if i ever had some. I just feel so conflicted, i dont want to miss out on this opportunity but it also doesn't excite me at all. What do yall think? Should i take the job, or decline and take some time off to do whatever (i dont even know what)

Most of the time, I can tell it's people struggling to get a deal on something, they know what they're doing and want to just waste time or they're on the phone half listening when you're trying to be helpful. I just got this current job in February but my mental self is already sick of the nonsense. I want to move on as quickly as I can but in a smart way with a new job as a safety meter net. Working with my hobby again would be great, but I know the customer service part would make me frustrated easily. Does anyone have suggestions? I know not all jobs are perfect, but I want a job that doesn't make me angry thinking about what's coming each day.
The ""perfect"" job for me would be a form of teaching DIYs and money saving tips for future projects."

Recently, I was invited to interview for a Start Internship at PwC. I have two behavioral interviews scheduled and I just completed one today. My interviewer asked me really open ended questions like ""Tell me about your resume"" and ""Tell me about your past work experiences"" and I put out really long but detailed answers using the STAR method. I had some but little repetition and all the information shared were necessary to understanding me as a candidate. However, the interviewer did not get to all of the behavioral questions, and I am worried that I am screwed for the job. The interviewer was nice, left their contact information, and told me that I had indirectly answered the other behavioral questions and I should not be concerned. Do I still have a shot or am I just overthinking?"

I'd say I did a pretty decent job. However upon submitting it, I realized there was a small visible error on the page.

Lets just say if this was something that was being published, you'd remove that tiny error and it would be ready to publish. That was the status of the assignment.

I'm just wondering do companies make a big deal out of stuff like this? Or do they just consider the whole package and choose to overlook the error?

The error could literally be corrected in a matter of 1 second. But I'm wondering if the company will form their own judgements of me based on this. Like "" How could he submit this without fixing that error?  Can he not see it? ""

What do I tell them? Obviously if this was a real life publishing situation, I'm guessing there will be someone who'll say "" Hey man there's an error! "" and I'll be like "" Oh you're right, sorry about that. Let me take it out "", "" Here you go "". And the situation will be resolved like pie. 

What do I tell them? I feel like a moron for working so hard on an assignment and then being rejected for one small error. This actually happened because I was rushing myself to submit it."

Earlier this week while in the office, I realized that a teammate and my manager had a meeting with the BDs to chat about an event happening in May (amongst other things) which I found out over lunch.

Due to the internal secondment, my manager has also hired someone part time to help. My teammate was involved in interviewing this person and told that we were hiring her, but I was only told a week or so later. 

My manager always seems to involve this teammate but not me. 

My question is: is it normal be to left out in these conversations? I’m feeling very left out as it isn’t the first time it’s happened. (These are very vague examples, but happy to share more if you private message me.) TIA!"

4,2023-03-22,Constant write-ups for documentation of possible termination,u/annndiOop,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11yj6jz/constant_writeups_for_documentation_of_possible/,jobs,"I got written up yesterday for harassment. I’m on a 2 week probation, where I’m being monitored at work and if my behavior does not improve I will be fired. The write up did not have details. Just the definition of harassment. It throws me through a loop because I’ve been degraded and humiliated the last 2 years for being ”too nice” from my superior. My superior is a bully, they do their job well, but they’re a constant critique so I’m constantly put under the most pressure and I can understand job performance write-ups (which I got one last week). Job performance can decline when your consistently being told your wrong, and not good enough in front of your entire team. I did what I needed to improve, started staying later. Killed it this past week. No performance write-ups or humiliation. But harassment write up? I asked what did I do? Since I was still in shock, HR and my manager were quick to say they cannot disclose who said what or what was said, I know that of course. I didn’t ask that, but it was a vague question. I had no choice but to sign the write up or I would’ve been fired on the spot. We have a zero tolerance policy and I should’ve been terminated if that was the case, but instead I’m on a 2 week probation where I’m being watched. So now I have 15 days to improve my behavior that I don’t have the slightest clue about, I am probably the nicest person there. I keep my hands to myself, I only go to work, do my job and go home and I truly feel like my superior is out to get me, making a proper paper trail in order to me fired. 

I need advice, this is my first corporate job I’ve had and HR is unfortunately not helpful as she likes to gossip to other employees about what people come to her about in HR. I truly think this is all stemming from a personal issue my superior has with me that is now leaking into the workplace. Apparently this write up had others that agreed as well, which is still mind blowing to me because, I hate that I made anyone feel that way, but I truly feel like my superior is punishing me because I am no longer their puppet because I realized how toxic, manipulative and awful they were as a person and boss, and since this company has no intention on doing anything because multiple people within the last 2 years have either switched departments, quit or got fired because of them. All were bogus and I knew it. I guess my question is can I be written up for harassment like this, with no explanation at all of what I did? I feel as if I’m going to be fired anyways. I also do not have the copy of the write up. I’m going to get it at work today. This is also a smallish company that’s been open for 6 years. I need advice, I’m not well versed in corporate politics."

Instead, it feels like they like to rub salt into the wound. It's like they want to make a point that so many people want this position. If anything, all it does is make me want to work for the competitors out of spite.

I don't really click with the team (although that could be just because i'm new), and i now have to work very long days (10 hours, sometimes even without a break) which just leaves me exhausted all week which results in not having a lot of energy to work on school.

 *if you aren’t getting interviews, it’s an issue with your resume. If you aren’t getting offers after interviews, it’s an issue with your interviewing skills*

I agree with this to an extent but at what point is it just not true?  I've been out of work for 4 months.  I'm mid-career in a specific industry and I currently don't live in a geographic hot spot for the work I do.  So...I'm trying to transition to something that is related but not quite so industry or location dependent.  The jobs I'm applying to are tangential to my experience, so my work should be at least somewhat relevant,  but I can't even get a phone screen.  I even recently finished a masters degree doing coursework in the new field I'm trying to get into.  

I've reworked my resume a number of times but at what point is it just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic?  If what they want isn't there what difference does the format make?! 

&amp;#x200B;

I lost a job 15 years ago and it took me about 6 months to find another one.  During that search, I was also trying to make a transition (within the industry but also to a tangential role).  I had a few years of experience on my resume but I was still junior. I was getting a ton of interviews but no offers.  Now I have a ton of experience and can't even get an HR phone screen.  It can't be that just my resume is holding me back.    Do hiring managers see experienced people and think they're too expensive?  too un-coachable?"

I need a new job, but I'm really not even sure how to sell myself anymore or actually know it's a place I can fathom staying at for at least a year (best I've done in a long time is 9 months).

There I would like to work for an airport or airline as ground staff/service staff since I really love to interact with customers and want to make sure I get use out of being bilingual.

I have 2 job offers in my home country, Germany, and am struggling to decide which would built me better credit for the future in the US. I was hoping perhaps some people from the US can help me with some judgement. Maybe even someone who works the job I want to aim for in the US myself.

One is as a train attendant with DB, a train attendant is basically a flight attendant for long distance passenger trains with a few more/different tasks due to the difference in vehicle. DB is one of Germanies biggest companies and they have branches in cargo shipping as well as air cargo and of course cargo trains. They are internationally  well known for mostly cargo transportation. I would go through 2 months of fully paid training before taking an exam and becoming a certified train attendant, which would basically be a proof of education in customer service. They do offer me better vacation times and payment which is why at first glance I would lean towards this job.

The second offer I just got came from Fraport Care, which is the Frankfurt Airport, one of Germanies biggest international airports. The position offered is called Service Agent and work entails assisting disabled passengers as well as overall customer service within the airport (leading people to their gates, providing information about the airport layout, bringing materials from one place to the other). For this job there's no school to be passed first and no official certification. It pays a bit less and gives me less vacation, also just has generally less benefits for me privately.

It is an airport job and obviously Fraport is an internationally well known name, however I wonder if this job would give me better credit since it already is at the ""same"" workplace just in a different country, or if other factors might actually proof the other choice to be better, such as having proof of an education in customer service on top of just work experience.

I am having a hard time making a decision so I would be grateful for any and all input."

I applied to a very well known company through LinkedIn. A few days letter, I got a text saying that they are interested in an interview. The interview was done through message via Microsoft Teams. That sounds strange in a way, but I remembered I had a similar “interview” with a well known hospital in my area through chat. (I currently work at this hospital, but just a diff position). 

I then received an “offer letter” today through my email. I am having a REALLY hard time deciding if this is all a scam. They haven’t asked for personal info (yet), like card numbers, bank info, SSN, etc. The offer, at first glance, looks legit. There are some small errors that stand out though, like formatting. The name attached to the email is a legit person. However, I’m not sure if someone is trying to be them or not. It’s a .club domain which is sus to me at least since I never heard of it. The amount they’re offering for such little experience I have is shocking as well. On one hand, I could be “”the chosen one”” (kidding), or of course, it could all be bait. They want me to sign the dotted line, and I’m not too sure about that. Any advice?"

She told me the panel I'll be meeting with is US based and they have a strong preference for MBAs and management consulting experience. Do you have any tips on how to present myself? It'll be a case study presentation.

10 years of experience total. 6 months of private consulting with one startup and an MBA is on my radar. Went to the lowest ranked high school in my province, moved away from some very rough influences. Pushed shopping carts and worked my way into a grocery store management position while studying full time. I've consistently progressed through different roles and most recently I've managed 2 provinces with 3 locations which I launched with no on the ground support.

I feel I'm qualified and I know this would be a great step for me. I haven't had much exposure on the US side of things so I'm hoping for some guidance on the sell here.

2,2023-03-22,Flex Jobs isn't worth it,u/Casually_Carson,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11yql1z/flex_jobs_isnt_worth_it/,jobs,"For a lot of people on here this will probably be quite obvious. But, I was getting pretty desperate and had a little bit left in my bank account after months of being jobless so I figured I had nothing to lose. Well...I guess I had at least that much to lose. 

A bit of backstory before I continue. I'm a recent MBA graduate with 5+ years of financial experience working in a variety of fields. After graduation, all the jobs I was going for fell through rather rapidly and quite humorously. 

The first job I was interviewing for was a consultant position of which my classmate ended up helping me get into the interview with a recommendation. After 4 interviews I was informed that the company was experiencing a merger and that my position was no longer available. 

The second job required 5 interviews including a project to which I was told I didn't get the bit months after I finished the final round. 

The third position I was passed over for the interviewer's nephew which man nepotism is a hell of a drug. 

Then I started rage applying after 6 months of almost nothing and landed on a remote premium auditing position that ""paid $32 an hour."" That in fact was not true, you could work a full 40 hours a week but only get paid for whenever the billing department got around to regarding completing your contracts. For example, you spent 10 hours on 5 different contracts, they'd only fill out 2 of those audits and leave the rest to sit for 2 weeks. Thus, you'd get around $144 for 10 hours of work IF they actually filed the paperwork. I'd sometimes have to wait the better part of a month to get even a few bucks even though I was working diligently. Eventual I got all the pay I earned but by that point I was basically making less than minimum wage. 

Needless to say, it didn't even cover food at that point and my boss said in my exit interview ""hey man this job is tough, I was on government assistance for the first 2 years! It just requires consistency and belief in the company."" Terrible experience. 

At that point I was pretty tired so I tossed in what cash I had left to a Flex Jobs account and wouldn't you know it....nothing happened. After weeks of applying, not a single company has even contacted me regarding interviews. It has been a straight and immediate ""NO"" each time. I contacted my buddy who's an HR lead to help me with my resume, I called my CPA buddy to help me practice interviews. But all of that was useless as it's been well over a month and not a single company has offered me an interview. 

I apologize if my grammar is off but I haven't been sleeping with this stress. 

I've customized my resume each and every time to the position, I've used words from the job description to alter the verbiage in the ""duties conducted"" portion under each line in the employment section, I've done just about everything. It's been embarrassing where they don't even want to interview you ya know? 

Sadly I'll have to get back into an old job I had 5 years ago as an ESL teacher and kinda ruin my career prospects but I've got nothing in the bank. I'll take out a loan to snag a flight to east Asia and start the next chapter in my life. Thanks for reading guys, Goodluck out there. 

TL:DR - Save your money, it's a waste of time."

My current job is working within local government (UK based) and I don’t hate it, but I speak with members of the public a fair bit and I’m just fed up with that. 

A few weeks ago , I interviewed for a position within Head Office, not customer facing and in my opinion, it has more perks. An hour for lunch, flexible hours (due to not being ‘customer’ facing) and just generally a more chilled out role. I would be getting a pay rise from my current position, but a pay cut from my promoted position. I ultimately was offered the job to start on April 11th 2023.

My current manager doesn’t know I interviewed for this and approached me today to see if I would be happy to be promoted to also working within the Housing Benefits department, she needed an answer there and then, as she needed to prepare my training pack ready on Monday and she is on PTO tomorrow and Friday. I panicked and said yes, as I wouldn’t have been handing in my notice until a week tomorrow and it was just an awkward situation for me.

I spoke with my partner regarding this, he feels as though accepting the offer is a good thing as it is more money, and although he knows I’m not 100% happy with my role, it is something I’m also happy to do if there wasn’t something better lined up. Money isn’t everything for me, we get by pretty comfortably at the moment with our dual income and no children.

I could use some advice about a potential career move. Sorry in advance for the long post.

I graduated from college last year and got my current position, which I've been in for \~8 months. The company is not great. The pay and benefits are good, and my schedule is very flexible. My boss is wonderful. My coworkers on my immediate team are fine, but I've had some weirdness with the broader firm. People treat me differently because I'm young, and I've had several men make sexist remarks about my intelligence. I've been told by HR not to ask for raises and that I'm not guaranteed any. I have felt lonely and alienated in this role, but the benefits, work-from-home, and flexibility have made me stay. However, my passion is animal welfare, and I want to eventually work in an animal welfare/advocacy role. 

A few weeks ago, I had a mental breakdown after a rough project and some nasty coworkers. So I decided I'd apply to animal welfare positions and see what happens. Well, a well-known animal shelter reached out to me and asked me to apply for a Director of Development position, which is a more senior role than I applied for and at least $10k more than my current salary.

I interviewed with them. The people were friendly and seemed to like me. But there were a couple of red flags.

* When I asked about how many hours I'd be expected to work per week, they said 40, but then said that some of them work more than that though they said 40 is fine for me.
* There are 6 job openings (almost all of them are for manager or executive leadership roles). One is a new position. They mentioned that something happened behind the scenes that other people were unaware of and caused several people to leave. I asked for further clarification and was told they couldn't speak about it because it was an HR issue. They also said they are restructuring and in a period of growth. The current executive director has been there for 5+ years and seems like she'll stick around.
* They said that work-life balance is important. The team tries to respect people's time off though there may be after-hours work if they take in an extreme case (i.e., hoarding). In the same breath, the executive director and one of the other managers joked about texting after hours.
* Multiple people said the culture is family-like. Some people seemed very sincere and had wonderful things to say about the team, but idk if this is cause for concern.
* The role is in person with the option to work remotely one day per week. :/
* They did not give information about leave (beyond PTO). My husband and I have talked about having kids, and I worry I wouldn't even be able to take 3 months off since this org has fewer than 100 people.

What do y'all think of these red flags? Are any of them reasons to forego the opportunity? Is there anything I should ask in a follow-up interview or conversation? Thanks!

Tl;dr: I have a comfy remote job that I've been in for 8 months. I don't love my company and the way I've been treated. I interviewed for a leadership position at a well-known animal rescue, but I'm concerned about potential red flags."

I am seeking advice on a difficult situation I am facing with my current employer, a school where I have been teaching for several years. The school has asked me to write a letter stating that I will not be returning to work next year due to the birth of my child in June. The contract would start in August, and my baby would only be six weeks old at the time.

I have been trying to start a family for the past two years, and the school has been informed of this. During this time, I have frequently expressed my desire to transition into an administrative role so that I can maintain a part of the community. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the school has made positions for other people and found ways to maintain certain members of the staff when they were unable to return to their previous position in the classroom, the school has not found a way to make this work for me.

Even though I was recently informed that the school is expanding, I do not see any opportunity or space for me at the school after the conclusion of this year, unless something has changed that administration has not made me aware of.

The school is aware of my plans and desires for next year, yet it doesn't seem like they have made an effort to find a way to keep me, aside from using me as a classroom teacher. Unfortunately, this leaves me with no reasonable choice but to consider other options. They do not offer any maternity leave benefits other than those required by the state and do not offer childcare for children under 2 years old. It was also explained to me that I could not bring my child to work with me, even though others have done so in the recent past.

I am seeking advice on how best to handle this situation, particularly regarding whether or not I should send them written notice of my plans for next year.

Thank you!"

I have been out of work for a year and can’t find a single job. Heck, I even tried for an interview at my old daycare job, but they are over staffed. I’m overwhelmed and I’m not sure what to do. 

Upon this break there are some positives. I went back to college (dropped out a while back) and currently hold a 4.0 and will graduate next spring! I’ve taken free courses online to in the desired field I want and earned 2 certifications.  And completed a bootcamp (though it was only fundamentals). I learned a lot and am still learning. 

I thought maybe my school could help, but they only offer handshake. It hasn’t gone well for me as there isn’t many internships available. Though I found one and it’s actually at my aunt’s job for the specific field I would like to work in. Would it be okay to ask her if she could help me? Is it morally okay? I’m struggling so much atm…idk what to do. I understand that if she could it’s up to me to do my best for the interview process (that’s if I can get that far 😂). Thank you.

The MBA I would have to go in person part time. Classes are only between 8-5 so any hours I miss I would have to make up by staying over at work. However, the building the classes the MBA are in is only a 15 minute walk away from where I work. I work from 8-5 Monday through Friday, so idk if its even realistic to do this?

I still don't know if it would be too stressful trying to fit those classes in while working though. The MBT is online, but I worry with that that I'll he isolated and won't be able to meet people or get the college experience.

 I also don't know if the MBA would have a better brand recognition than getting an MBT which would have classes similar to a masters in IT (programming, database admin, user experience design). Whereas, the MBA is more focused on accounting, finance, leadership, and strategy courses.

My previous degree was in kinesiology and I've currently been working in IT for 3 years doin help desk or system admin positions. I'm looking to move up to system/cloud engineer or IT manager roles.

My dad suggested the MBA because he said tech degrees have a lifespan to them because technology is always changing. But, he also said the MBT may be more flexible due to me working full time. And that the MBA will get me more into leadership roles that pay more. However, idk if it will really help with getting tech roles? Or to get recruiters to stop asking why I majored in kinesiology?"

We created my role about 3 years ago running a small division of the company. Total revenues about 700k. Myself and one other are full time. Two part time employees. 

The job revolves around heavy recruitment for off season programs. When I started the role we did not even have a facility and I had to recruit based on what might be. Went very well first year and then again in the second year I just over doubled our revenue and number of athletes. Starting this year the bosses wanted the same growth which I advised against as I wanted to focus on our current athletes and continue to build the brand name over chasing profits. As usual didn’t listen to me and those numbers will not be obtainable. They are grinding me hard last few weeks over it and the dynamic with my bosses has drastically changed. To the point where I don’t enjoy work anymore. I’ve seen this dance with another employee too and how it went down. 

I am considering leaving as I see the writing on the wall and just don’t wanna be around for the crashing wave that will come when we do not hit their ridiculous goal. It is also eating in my weekends and time off now with outside of my contractual obligations to attend new games etc. 

Higher management was shuffled this year and the new COO is purely numbers focused and his vision is not really aligned with how I’ve been doing my role the last two plus years. I’ve had nothing but glowing reviews and pats on the back until this year. 

Just looking to vent and to get others views on this.  I’ve been casually browsing other jobs on and out of my field and there is a lot of options. Mostly out which I’m ok with.

After receiving the results of my background check I noticed that they were unable to verify two of my past employments. They were both unpaid and only lasted a couple of weeks with one of them being a volunteer position and the other being a work placement as part of a program with my high school so it wasn’t entirely unexpected that I wouldn’t be in their systems, but now I’m worried that my offer might be rescinded because of it. I have documentation from both places proving that I worked there but as the positions were unpaid it’s nothing official like an offer letter, more so an email from the organizer confirming my volunteer start date, which the background check company wouldn’t accept. I have already called the background check company again and they basically stated that they couldn’t do anything unless the employer wanted to run another background check. Normally I wouldn’t be stressed about this as I have more current job experience and both positions were over three years ago but during the interview the hiring manager asked me one question regarding one of the positions related to the excel work I performed there.

What should I do next? Should I just wait and see if HR contacts me or should I take initiative and contact HR myself in order to explain the discrepancy?"

If someone relates or have any advice, please share :) If this is not wanted here on this subreddit, mod, delete. 

I recently quit my position as a teacher since I was getting regular panic attacks at work. So I figured I might need to change some things.. I have since been applying to a lot of different jobs. I dont know if I know what I want. I have a masters in science and a teachers certificate and recently I took a course to learn the basics in accounting. I like math and problem solving. I like programming also. My head is all over the place lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Jobs where I live are rare in science. I am scared to do a job as an accountant as I have no experience with that job. I am so frustrated. I had an interview recently where I think I did everything right. However, I dont exactly feel hopeful, since these positions are rare and there are a lot of applicants. I figure if I dont get an offer, I will completely change gears and go all in, in accounting, or I do some job that requires no education and I will just save money to go to school again or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you share your stories with me? Did you ever fell stuck at a crossroads and then figure something out?

TLDR: Science teacher changing careers. Been going to interviews for science jobs and general office jobs, getting no offers. Not sure if I am pursuing the right career path, going forward."

I missed this meeting to see my brother for his surgery. This surgery has been schedule for about 1 month+ change. I didn’t feel the need to them cause it was outside work hours.

I got the notice for todays mandatory meeting yesterday and told them as soon as I could that I had family engagements and would not make it and offered an alternative date for a one on one with the trainer.  The trainer was okay with it and offered another which worked well for both us. 

However, I got an email from my manager a couple of minutes ago that told me I should have informed them asap, that mandatory means mandatory, and to make efforts to get these training sessions. 

While I understand some of her points, I can’t help but feel like I did not partially do anything .

Why do people hate corporate America? I get hate all the time for being apart of it. I feel like I’m at community college if anything. I just know my time is worth a lot of money and corporate America can compensate me for that. 

Great benefits, great pay, I’m around smart people all day. Sure it can get mundane…. But not really. 

Everyone says is soul sucking but it sounds soul sucking to do free lance, unstable income, bad health benefits.

What is the stigma around corporate America?

They had lost six people over the past year, and the reason people keep leaving is the boss. He doesn’t pay for training, yells at us for having the thermostat over 68, micromanages our lunches (if lunch ends at 1, that doesn’t mean get back to the office at 1, it means you should already be logged in and working at 1.) He takes minutes late off of our PTO. He doesn’t pay overtime, he gives overtime back as PTO. (If I work 2 hours of overtime then I get 2 PTO hours instead of overtime pay.) He doesn’t pay any benefits like insurance. He also only hires women, because he says it is a female friendly office, but has made several condescending comments since I’ve worked there, like “it’s time to put on your big girl pants” and telling us we need to wear more makeup. It’s been a month and I couldn’t take it anymore, and I’m interviewing now with a company and things are going well, seems like they’re going to hire me. 

I’m worried about putting in my notice because without me, I don’t think the office can remain open. It is a small office of four people including me. I’ll refer to the others as A, B, C and The Boss. 

A just started maternity leave and will be gone for 6 weeks. B lives in another state so is remote. That leaves C and me as the only two in office. It’s been really hard to handle with just two people. C just put in her two weeks notice, and she admitted to me it was partially from the stress of being expected to train me while running the business on her own. For example, she got chewed out for leaving me alone during her lunch, even though we are the only two there. She is not allowed to leave the office during her lunch now. The Boss reacted to her notice in an extremely hostile way - she showed me the nasty email he sent when she emailed her notice, and he also removed her access from some of our systems already so she can’t effectively do her job, there’s more on me. When she leaves, it will just be Boss and I in the office. 

He’s already mad about her leaving and about having to come in every day until he hires her replacement, which he doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to do, as he’d rather put it on me. He’s already telling me stuff like “it’s time for you to be a leader and a team player.” 

I don’t know exactly how to do this tactfully. I know if I leave now he will be in a tight spot, and furious. I’m afraid working two weeks alone with him in this environment will be absolutely miserable and he will find some way to screw me over if my new job calls for employment verification or something. 

How should I tell him I’m leaving, and how honest should I be about my reasons for it? Should I even work a two weeks or just be the a-hole here and go when I get my job offer?"

I am incredibly excited about this new position! However, there are a lot of new hires being onboarded and we have not been trained for the tasks at hand. Our HR Lead and Administrative Lead is phasing out as he is retiring and the person taking his place is also new (they just started on Monday). My bosses are going to be abroad until April (they're in Australia and there is a 15-hour time difference). 

I feel like I don't have access to all of the information that I need to get my job done (I just started last week on Monday) and I find myself overwhelmed with the new tasks. My predecessor left the job before they could impart any info so I only have the handbook and while I am encouraged to ask questions, my boss's responses are delayed because of the time difference and they are the founders of the organization so they are probably flooded with needy people asking for their attention. I feel like I keep making mistakes because I don't know everything and people are getting upset with me for this lack of knowledge/my lack of being able to micromanage the Administrative Lead (who has been out of the office since Wednesday last week and only returned today) who is supposed to be the supervisor of the admins like me. I got yelled at because he didn't set up an email address in a timely fashion, but I don't have the access to usurp him through IT and get these tasks done without his approval. 

TLDR; I'm new to my job and everyone is MIA. I feel like I'm making so many mistakes, but I desperately want to keep my job. Any advice, words of wisdom, or words of encouragement?"

I updated my resume and shotgunned applications on Indeed with cover letters generated by ChatGPT. 

I applied for a HR Generalist that required at least 5 years of experience and a Bachelors degree in a related field. Guess what I got? 3 years of experience and no degree. After I applied I found the company on LinkedIn and looked up the HR Director and sent them another ChatGPT generated message about how I was really interested and would love the opportunity to interview. 

I received an email to setup an interview that was just over the phone. Then a few days later I received invitation for a second round interview via Zoom. 

Not even two hours after my second interview I received a call from recruitment who offered me the position. Now the pay they offered was on the low end of the salary range, but it's still about 20% more than what I'm making now! Best part it's 3 days at home and 2 days in the office.

Edit: For those unfamiliar with ChatGPT, I want to clarify that I didn't use it to create a false representation of myself. Think of it as creating a good template and afterwards you go in and make edits to make it personal to you. I was honest about my experience and education."

How should I prepare?,u/CuriousTriceratops,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11z2zjz/first_zoom_interview_tomorrow_how_should_i_prepare/,jobs,"I’ve recently been applying to jobs. After sending many applications and having employers view my resume and everything, I finally have an interview coming up. They reached out today and I ending up booking it for tomorrow so I don’t have them waiting too long and losing interest.

The thing is: I have no idea what to expect or what to say. I’ve only ever had one job and it’s the one that I’m trying to leave. The thing is I didn’t have to interview for that job because I was training there and ended up just becoming a worker there. 

So with that said, I even though I have job experience I don’t have interview experience.
I have the interview scheduled after work because I’m the only one there after everyone else leave so I’ll take advantage of that to be in a quiet area with no interruptions.

My questions are:
• Is there anything I should know in advance?

• What kind of questions should I expect and how should I answer them?

• How should I make myself stand out if I don’t have much to say?

• Is it ok to have water or something on hand to ease my nerves?

•What kind of questions should I ask the employer at the end?

• Should I have some notes or anything on hand to guide me?

• Should I reschedule for another day or should I just get it over with and continue with the interview?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I also apologize in advance if I don’t respond because I have to get ready for work tomorrow.

P.S. Just in case I’m already have a presentable attire ready and a laptop with a headset to communicate more easily."

TL;DR I need help finding a part-time, entry-level job where I sit on my butt and don't talk to people.

I haven't worked since 2021. My last job was so perfect: merchandising for a dollar store through a third-party company. Not dealing with customers, flexible part-time hours, and doing simple tasks like organizing the gift cards and sliding in new price strips. Then, out of nowhere, the job became full-time and grueling, ruining my body and mind. I had to lift heavy things over my head, work with new people all the time, and keep building new stores and resetting old ones. Management was bad and I was ghosted, gaslit and downright abused by them and my co-workers. I had a mental breakdown, quit, and developed a condition called polyarthralgia, which is like fibromyalgia but different.

I've worked retail for ten years and I can't do it anymore, both physically and mentally. I've tried getting diagnosed for autism so that I could maybe get disability, but that was a bust. Those ten years, especially that last job, have given me PTSD and physical pain that I'll never recover from, and I know my state would never give me disability because I'm ""not really autistic"" and can still walk.

I live with my parents, but I still need money for my car insurance and other needs, especially to buy kratom for my chronic pain. I want a part-time desk job that I don't need outside training for that has a routine and is preferably remote. I love doing tasks that other people might find tedious.

I know I'm probably asking for a miracle, here. But I don't need any snarky, ahole reddit comments telling me that. I'm asking for genuine help, here. Don't waste your time commenting if you're going to be a meanie."

The company's small size means I'm doing the jobs of about three people with very little oversight or institutional support. It doesn't help that my two other primary co-workers are in a clique and my boss hired one of them because of a friendship with her mother.

Despite my unhappiness with both the workload and my colleagues, I am reluctant to put in my notice because of the impending recession. I also worry that it will be difficult for my boss to get approval to replace me. The position was vacant for nearly a year before I was hired.

I still want to quit. The disorganization, lack of resources, and culture clash make my workdays long and anxious. What suggestions do you have?

Thanks!"

3,2023-03-22,I am a team of one besides my direct manager and I am feeling increasing uncomfortable with the way my manager responds (I am still new at the job) - does anyone have tips on how to handle this situation or how to ask her who else can I colloborate with?,u/aangita,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11z52ct/i_am_a_team_of_one_besides_my_direct_manager_and/,jobs,"Hello everyone,

I just started a position 7 months ago. It's a compliance position for an employee beneift brokerage firm. It is completely a new industry to me and I was chosen for the position because I am a recent law school graduate. Going to law school was a career change for me as I worked in the healthcare industry prior, so I am not an inexperienced worker (in fact, I was the RevCycle Manager for a healthcare facility.)

My personal management and training style is very hands on until the new employee really has a firm grasp on the job. And I honestly did not expect most new employees to truly understand what they are doing until almost a year after they were hired.

My manager hired me two months after I graduated law school, knowing full well I was inexperienced with the industry but capable of parsing through legal text because of my degree. She was speceficially seeking JD students. 

The world of employee benefits is vast!! There are so many laws that apply and they can intersect in different ways. One of my tasks is answering client questions. Very little about employee benefits is up to interpretation: either the law states an employer can or cannot do something. I am the kind of person who likes to know the answer, why it's the answer and the citation to the law that answers it.

We have a database we use to parse through the pertinent federal and state employee benefit laws. Sometimes it could take me over two hours to answer a client question. My manager has assured me that it's ok to take as much time as I need to answer the question thoroughly-- still it bothers me that it takes so long. (Plus, it eats into the time I need to complete other tasks.)

I received no formal training. Everything I learn is ad hoc. This is not the how I like to learn, I would much rather there be some general training guideline in place but that's neither here nor there. 

I've asked my manager if I can run my answe by her when I am unsure (for confirmation if I am correct) or if I can't find the answer because the question is too new for me and she's stated mutiple times that it was okay and that I can use her as a resource. However, when I've done this over the past 7 months (especially when I am asked a client question new to me) her responses comes off a bit derogatory to me. 

Today, a client asked me a question about FMLA and qualifying events and after two hours I came up with two potential answers. I asked my manager for confirmation on which one was correct and her response was: ""the client is asking about qualifying events. **I need you to be able to research and find the answer**."" 

I took a lot of offense to that sentence. I have since calmed down and am looking for solutions to move forward. 

I have no one to collaborate with but my manager. This dynamic is becoming frustrating for me. Sometimes I just need to collaborate with someone who is experienced and knows the answers and can help me make sense of what I've researched. 

I've been told by a friend that the way the email was written my manager wants me to just respond to clients with my best judgement and CC her and if I am wrong she can dicuss that with me. But that is not my working style. I do not like replying to clients unless I know the answer is correct. (Again, employee benefits is pretty black and white.)

**In an effort of self-improvement I am seeking advice on what next steps should be. How should I talk to my manager on our next Zoom call? Should I even mention what she said in the email? How do I approach her about asking if there is someone else to collaborate with when the question I am researching is technically more difficult than my current skill level or understanding?** 

I really like the work I am doing. My company is a bit haphazard in terms of procedures and systems (which I was shocked by because they are a large national employer) but it's not bad enough to make me want to look somewhere else. Instead, I would like to find pragmatic solutions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

P.S.I've already asked my manager if the company can provide resources for me to become certified (in the hopes that will provide more formalized training.) and she said there are some. 

P.S.S.If there are experienced employee benefits folks here, I would not say no to collaborating or receiving any formalized guidebooks you can share. :) "

At first, I thought I should obviously include them, as this would make me look more qualified, and increase my chances of landing the job. But on second thought, wouldn't it make me look like someone who's overqualified, and who'll jump ship the moment a ""better"" opportunity arises? I've heard stories of well-educated folks struggling to find min-wage jobs until they removed their education from their resume.

One last thing I'd like to add: while rereading what I wrote before hitting ""Submit"", it occurred to me that this sounds like a troll post. Like why tf is an experienced and educated employee applying for min-wage jobs?!

It is a small company developing a new product that will be a game changer in its industry if they can succeed in making it manufacturable at a mass scale. They brought me out for an on-site interview and looking at what they are doing I immediately knew why they were having problems and how to fix them. For the next week my head buzzed with a plan that could get them on track with a process that could be scaled up for mass production and address the quality issues on a much faster timeline than they are working on now. A difference between life and death for a start-up. 

Then the recruiter called and said they had decided not to go forward with me for the position at this time. I was stunned. 

Admittedly I have stayed too long with my current job. My skills aren’t well used and the work environment is on a long downward slide as management gets progressively worse every year. But the pay is good and my family is comfortably situated so I just endured it. This is the first job I have interviewed for in several years so I am out of practice. 

Unconventional as is to me, I am very tempted to contact them and ask why. To find out what swayed the decision. Hopefully to learn what I could improve on as I have found new motivation to escape my current rut. 

Has anyone here ever reached out to a company to find out why they were turned down and received answers beyond the stock, pro forma reasons? If so, is there any advice on a tactful approach?"

The MBT is online, but I worry with that that I'll he isolated and won't be able to meet people or get the college experience. My dad also said that an MBA would lead to better paying jobs, and that tech degrees have a lifespan to them. However, he also said to take the route of least resistance especially with working full time, and that the MBT online may be more flexible.

 I'm worried if I do the online one that I won't meet anybody and miss out on the college experience/networking as well though. Or is this not as big a deal as I'm making it out to be? 

The MBT has classes similar to a masters in IT (programming, database admin, user experience design). Whereas, the MBA is more focused on accounting, finance, leadership, and strategy courses.

My previous degree was in kinesiology and I've currently been working in IT for 3 years doin help desk or system admin positions. I'm looking to move up to system/cloud engineer or IT manager roles.

Looking for advice/reassurance. I got a job offer I'm really excited about! They're running a background check and informed me they require a physical. 

They have not once mentioned a drug test or even a drug policy. Not on the job posting or in the interview, and of course I didn't ask, that's suspicious. My sister works in staffing and she told me the company doesn't drug test for the factory floor. I wouldn't be working on the floor, I would be working in development. I would have to use power tools, band saw, grinder, bondo, epoxy etc. though. 

Questions on Indeed about drug testing return all ""no"" answers except for one ""yes"". There are about seven answers from 2017-2022. 

I'm worried, I don't want to waste anyone's time, and I also don't understand why they wouldn't mention a drug test required. I have no hope of passing in the timeframe they want to hire within if they do. 

What are y'alls thoughts? Has anyone ever been surprised by a drug test at one of these physicals, or is that something companies are usually more upfront about?"

Asking to work less hours from full time?,u/honeyoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11zbbq6/please_help_asking_to_work_less_hours_from_full/,jobs,"Its been exactly a year since working for my current employer. Its a very small team of creatives. Yesterday, I checked indeed and a dream internship popped up. I want to apply, but I don't want to lose my full time job, and this internship is mon-fri as well, so it clashes. Theres no info on the pay or exactly work hours yet, but it says 8hrs per week.

Is it reasonable to ask my boss to reduce my work hours? When I accepted the job offer and did a week of work, I actually asked if theres any chance of reducing my hours and they said no. Most likely because they could have hired someone else for the role, so I understand that. Even without the internship, ive wanted to reduce my hours anyway. I dont have much time at all to do anything.

If I can ask to reduce my hours, how would I phrase it? I think saying I want to take an internship is probably not good because it implies im thinking of leaving my current job after the internship is over? Is it acceptable to simply have my reasons as wanting to have more time to work on my artwork/side hustle?

Thanks everyone, advice is super appreciated, im really new to this all and don't want to hinder my relationship at my current workplace, but this new internship would be so educational for me right now. They do however want someone to start mid next month, so I'm not even sure if I'd get the internship. I want to apply anyway and see if I can even travel there after my full time job for a couple hours for a couple days of the week. sounds exhausting though."

I'm really tired of feeling that I am in a position, which didn't deserve, and even when management praises me for my achievement or progress done, it feels totaly weird and undeserved.
I'm currently working in a big worldwide retail company, as an IT manager, I'm working in IT since i finished university, about 9 years ago, I started from service desk support, and never asked for friends to help me with work, but even after so many promotions, and lots of people actually telling me I'm good and professional (at some aspects), I cant get rid of haunting feeling that I am no match for real pros around.

Even though I'm an IT guy, I studied in University of Humanities, and never enjoyed hardware work, all this infrastructure thing made me feel useless and inadequate, but I've earned respect through communicating with people, leading projects and I guess for my ability to find approach for every person at work, specially for management.
And here I am, currently proceeding with intercompany relocation, with series of interviews, to a country I could never dream of, on a position of Senior IT spec., And IT director deputy, and every time I explain my experience and strong sides, I can feel how cool it sounds, and how people react with admiration, but deep inside always same question to myself: are you really this good? Are you good at all, or you tricked everyone, as always? 

This impostor syndrom is really messing with me a lot, I guess.

Looking at the benefits, the pay than I am on now, and there is extra holiday.

I am moreso leaving my current job out of anger/annoyance.

The reason why I am annoyed at my current role, is I have been there for 3 years this May, my workload has increased, sales have certainly increased, but my pay has not. The only thing they do is raise the wage (For everyone) to April's minimum wage in Nov/Dec. As soon as April arrives, i'm back on minimum wage again.

My workload is about to get to the point where I am now a consistant 48-72hrs behind. My manager knows this, but shows no interest in resolving the issue. I am the only one who processes the orders, answer customer enquires and I am the first to pick up the phone.

The real kick in teeth here is my colleague has nothing to do 75% which again my manager seems to be completely oblivious to.

Other than that, the current job is quite relaxed, everyone is nice etc.

I am worried I am moving jobs out of spite, but at the same time, the benefits are better, and my workload is only going to increase.

Please advise if I may be making a wrong decision."

This week, I started a construction job I wasn't 100% sure about. Also, this is my first non-agency job. My coworkers and supervisors are nice people but the job isn't what I expected.

Some tasks were understated when I applied for the job and in the interview but the tasks actually require a significant amount of my daily effort. 

But I'm underpaid relative to what I was paid in my previous job as well as no paid break. However, the job is 30 minutes from my house so cheaper public transportation. 

So because they're nice to me, patient, and welcoming I feel very uncomfortable telling them I'll quit even though the job contract says neither party has to give notice within the first month.

Also, I've always been an agency worker and the idea of having to give 2-3 weeks notice provides endless anxiety. In an agency job I could just phone or text and say I won't return the next day. 

I have no experience telling my supervisor I'm leaving a job either. Do I just verbally say I'm resigning? Do I write and print a literal resignation letter?"

I interviewed with a manufacturing company while I was interviewing for the environmental one. The environmental company got back to me first with a really good offer that I accepted and have been doing the job for a week now. 

However, I got offered the job at the manufacturing company (thought I got ghosted) for $14k more. I like what I'm learning to do now and have the potential to make the same amount as the manufacturing company offered in a year or two.

Manufacturing company is all on site even though it can definitely be done remote or even hybrid. They're paying more but I saw a handful of red flags in the interview process and really value WFH sometimes. They were late for my interview, took like a month to get back to me, used some buzzwords, and could not give me a good idea of what the job entails. The company is based in Europe and they have my position over there so they said I would learn it by traveling to Europe for a tiny bit but otherwise they had nothing to really tell me. This is fairly common in my field (sustainability) but it def caught me. Also did not discuss growth opportunities. Salary positioned but get off early on Friday. 

Environmental consulting firm gave me a higher offer than I expected in the first place and I can grow into that $14k growth pretty soon with this company. It's a unicorn firm for sure. I get to work in areas of interest that I didn't get to in college and really like my boss and co workers so far. It is hybrid with some field work. I like the variation of both! All green flags in the interview and in the work culture. It is salary but I get paid overtime still! Also has ESOP. Can also pivot into other areas of interest in environmental work here. Good growth in company 

TLDR: offered $14k more at a company that showed some red flags in the interview process but could make that much more at my current job I just started in a year or two that has good culture.

I had been drawing since I was 4 and took AP classes for it in high school so I figured like it would be the best choice. I majored in illustration and had plans to either work in character design or in products / toy design. It’s something that I was and am super passionate about, but it seems to be a pipe dream. 

It’s been almost a year and I can’t land anything. Living with your parents is cute and all until it’s been a year and you’re still unemployed.

I told myself that if May came around (parents are hinting that they want me out of the house by then), I would think of a plan B.

Now I have had my heart set on art my entire life and I always had plans to pursue it in some way. I naively thought I’m doing everything right, I got the degree with a great GPA and a portfolio that’s on mark with everyone else’s.

Things aren’t really turning out that way. Jobs themselves are very few and far between, at least ones that pertain to my skills. I’ll probably get one interview a month and typically end up as one of the finalists, a long process. Then I get rejected.

This was okay for a while but I’m really itching to move out. I’m questioning if I should just get my own place and a minimum wage job but am afraid of money draining out for rent. I definitely can’t afford to go back to school and don’t even know what I would go back for. I’ve been considering going to trade school, again not passionate about it but I think I’ll have to make something work.

Anyone have any tips for what someone with an art degree / only art related skills could get into that isn’t art related? I have some experience in fast food and retail if that helps. 

This is really tough and I honestly have no idea where to go from here. I was stupid enough to think I could be one of the people that gets outside of the “starving artist” stereotype. I’m kicking myself for wasting the one chance I had at college and I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life."

I make $19 an hour. I dislike it since it's boring and a kid could do this job with a few weeks of training, maybe even less. I don't want a promotion because the higher positions require 50-60 hours a week ,nights, and weekends, so I'm definitely not going for that. I just want to work 9-5 M-F (or less, if it's feasible financially.)

I have a string of entry level jobs on my resume from front desk at a hotel to stocking shelves. With inflation, $19 an hour isn't going to cut it. My parents are getting older and will need help with medical bills, and I can't take a decent vacation on this salary and maintain the cost of my hobbies with the cost of living rising so much.

I also notice my workload is gradually increasing, but the good part is I can just work 9-5 and I'm not expected to do any OT.  However, it still bothers me that my boss is letting my coworkers dump their tasks on me.

I could just apply to a higher-paying remote job but I'm afraid if I get hired I could get laid off since the economy isn't so good. I have it in my head that I'm fortunate to have a WFH job, but I also know I can't work here forever since I have 0 interest in moving up.

But my line manager has a weekly, 30 minute meeting with me to discuss how things are going and he seems to genuinely expect me to have an agenda and discuss my goals / plans for growth in the company every week. Discussing current projects or how my week is going does not satisfy him. 

How do I even go about filling this time? What do I say? 

The truth is that I enjoy the job so far but 1) I’ve barely started, I’m still learning the role and 2) I don’t really know where I want to go next, yet, other than generically “promoted to the role above me”. Even if I DID have specific plans, I have no clue how to fill that time EVERY week without getting very redundant. 

Any suggestions/resources on how to prepare for these meetings? Is there a secret trick to this every industry person knows? I’m worried that if I don’t show a “growth mindset” he’s going to decide I’m not a good fit for the company."

2,2023-03-23,Case Study: Won bereavement leave...uh 12 months later! [Fist Pump],u/Apprehensive_Look869,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11zljlx/case_study_won_bereavement_leaveuh_12_months/,jobs,"**Issue 1:** *Shall the grievant be permitted to take ""additional"" bereavement leave after the grievant's relative has died?* **Issue 2:** *Shall the grievant be permitted to take bereavement leave following the grievant's relative's death, beyond 30 days?""*

**Note:** While I was responding to a different post it got my memory jogging of a case I did not think I'd win but unexpectedly did! I totally wanted to share it with you guys!

**Background:** When I was a Labor Relations Rep one of my most surprising wins was a curious case of bereavement leave. The employee background was clean.... he never had any issues before,  and no record of filing any previous grievances. The site had about 600 people with 300 being in my bargaining unit (aka the people I represented) and I had never heard of the guy before. Little secret: When you are a Labor Rep or a Union Steward, about 50% of your bullshit is from the same people, over and over again, lol. So when you get a brand new case thats from a first timer, you are like, woah. This employee was upset because he requested to take a bereavement leave and was denied. In my experience that is super rare and is commonly because they employee is abusing leave (just different types of leave in general) or has taken bereavement times more than once in the last 12 months. But upon investigating, I found that none of that had occurred EXCEPT for a two day bereavement 12 months prior for his mother. Apparently, the employee had brought it up to the manager himself a week later to complain starting the tick tok of the clock, so I filed a grievance to protect the timelines.

# Contract Language

(It's been a minute, a long minute so bear with me as I am paraphrasing from memory)

**Definition of the word Relative:** ""For the purposes of this bereavement article, the term “relative” means an individual who is related to you as your father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, great uncle, great aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister, or who is the grandfather or grandmother of your spouse.  “Relative” also includes a person who resides with you domestically."" **&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Copied from a similar source, as you can see, the union language was exceptionally strong.**

**Allotment of time given for Bereavement:** ""The bereaved shall be permitted to take **up to** five days of bereavement upon the death of the relative"" **&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They totally changed this a couple of years later to the typical 3 days if in state 5 days if out of state. bahaha**

**Timeframe of the Bereavement Request:** ""The bereaved shall take bereavement leave no less than 30 days from the death of the relative"" **&lt;&lt;&lt; Notice it says nothing about death certificate. Also note that the language is silent on the concept of taking the days consecutively, a big problem for both union and management.**

# Analysis &amp; Results

* I filed a grievance, honestly I did not think I would win, but I have a duty to represent the employee and fight hard for them. When I filed the grievance, The manager basically told me to fuck off. I lost step 1 as expected. When I escalated it to Grievance Step 2., the HR director literally laughed and was like cmon man. You know you arent gonna win this right?
* But I argued passionately. I had done my investigation and background research. The employee was a devout form of a buddhist. In his culture, while the physical body ""dies"" the spirit lives on until an interim period in the physical world is over. Then the spirit goes to heaven (or hell) after a ceremony is conducted. (Management basically said that is a bullshit argument... I honestly didn't have a strong opinion about it... I was doin my job!) I also argued that the word consecutive was not in the contract and that if they let me win they could add the language in there to prevent the issue from rearing up again. My final argument was that he only took two days off, not five and the language says UP TO five.  lol. Even I barely got by with my reasoning.  Now that I am on the other side, I would have been pissed, but a bit impressed if the union brought me this. I lost step 2 as expected.
* I escalated it to the highest level at step 3 and lost unexpectedly. It was unexpected because nobody wanted to go to arbitration and I thought the Executive would give him 1.5 days off as a settlement. But surprisingly management was stubbornly resistant, despite my concession to 1.5 days and adding in favorable management contract language. So we moved to arbitrate.
* When the costs came in and it was estimated both sides were gonna spend thousands of dollars, it became obvious that it was a lose lose situation for management. This dude, getting like 18 dollars an hour would have cost them $432 now was potentially costing them more than 5k. And its not like they were fighting to stop precedent cause like, cmon, how many times in say the last freaking decade have they gotten a similar complaint. At this point they were just pissed and wanted to dig in. They accepted the costs ... initially.
* Finally we were at the point of striking the judges name out of the contract to pick the judge for the arbitration and finally the top dog of the org called me and said look, lets end this. HAHA. they gave the guy the full three days and we withdrew the complaint. I was like a fucking legend at that worksite for the longest time."

So since then I have been working as front desk in medical spas which makes me okay-ish money ($20 an hour) but I am in massachusetts so that is on the higher end of what I could get for this job. My BF and I want to move somewhere with warmer weather (florida, texas or california are our top 3) but besides California the pay in other states is considerably lower. My job is with a large company and for the same job I do here for $20 I would get $14 there in FL or TX. 

I luckily have a lot of downtime at my work, so I would have time to do homework or work on online certifications while I pursue something else while still working full time. My question is, what is a good option for me that would take 2 years or less to complete? I don’t want to preform services up-close &amp; personal on people’s faces (like dental hygienist) and I would prefer a desk job but am not the best when it comes to math and i’m
terrible at sales. I have 0 college experience since i went to esthetician school so I would be starting from the basics. I don’t need to be making big bucks (6 figures or more) as nice as it would be but i would like to be able to get a job making atleast 60k in any part of the country.

I have an interesting question, and wondering if anyone either has experience with or can advise on. I am currently employed but on the hunt for a new job. I work in advertising, which I consider a ‘who you know’ type industry. 

Anyway, I am about 8 years into my career and feel I have a reasonable network of people. I’ve created an excel sheet narrowing down colleagues who I’ve had a good experience with and feel confident they’d be happy to hear from me. 

I’ve found reaching out to former bosses/mentors easier because you can be formal without it being weird… so I don’t have an issue there. However, most of my connections are peers. So, coming up with messages to these folks that balances the bound we had while also being professional is tricky. I’m talking about the type of people I could talk shit/get drinks with. Who are closer to being friends rather than just coworkers. It’s a weird predicament because while we had fun working together, naturally these people get new jobs and we don’t speak for a while. 

Do you guys find just picking up where you left off/maybe slipping in a few jokes about not staying in touch to be effective? Or starting off more professional? Should I text, email or LinkedIn message them? Obviously every relationship and person is different, but generally speaking. What is the general mindset you carry into this situation to avoid it being awkward? Thanks for any advice."

He constantly compares me to his old assistant and in our last two one-on-one meetings he has threatened to a) cut me to part-time or b) start looking for someone else to fill the role. I had already been applying to jobs for some time but recently got called about interviews for a few that excited me! i don't want to leave him in a huge rut despite his being rude to me because he and his team have a big report due in may that I may resign before the deadline. **should i tell him I'm applying to other jobs?** it took several weeks for him to hire me and i would like to give him as much time as possible to find a new person and help them settle in if I am able because he is a very difficult man to work with.

So I got another verbal offer from a company halfway across the country, and everything looks good. Pay is good, benefits are good, and it would be good with my career. It's in a big city, but it's not the safest and might not have a lot of options for other jobs.

I'm afraid to accept it because I'm comfortable where I am for now. My boss is toxic, but the rest of my coworkers are wonderful, and I'm really close with a lot of them. I know I need to leave, but I'm not sure if I'm ready.

I've been living with my parents for 3 years now, and this would be my first move. I know it's all good for my career but the whole thing has me really nervous. If it doesn't work out and I end up unemployed in a unfamiliar city my life will be ruined.

Do you think I should stay at my current place where I'm completely safe from being laid off, or should I take the risk and do the job? I know logically the best option is to take the job, but I'm not sure I can handle the mental anguish of giving everything here up."

Don’t get me wrong I like his help when needed but don’t step on my toes when I’m here trying to do my job.

I need some advice. I left my old job over a year ago, it was on paper my ""dream job"" but I realized quickly that the toxic work environment, low pay and lack of growth opportunities made it not worth it. But, I stayed there for five years because I desperately wanted it to be the job I had for the rest of my life. But after too many nights up crying because of challenging personalities and feeling like I was at a dead end, I jumped.

Overall, I've been much happier in my new gig. A $15k pay raise, a wonderful manager, great coworkers. The pace is much slower, which is better for my mental health, but I wish it would pick up a bit. I like being busy and I often feel like I'm making work for myself just to stay occupied. It's not the ""perfect"" job, but what is? I still feel like I could be making more money, but it works for now.

My old manager reached out to me once before about returning to my old company, but the $$ offer was low so I turned him down. Yesterday, he reached out to me offering me $15k more than what I'm currently making. That's a huge jump, and I almost want to go back, but I can't forget the terrible life I had while I was there. And the people who made me miserable still work there, as well.

Also worth noting—I haven't gotten a raise at my current job that I've been at over a year. Wondering if it's worth taking the jump and returning to my old workplace, or advice for using this as leverage to get more money at my current role? Would love insight and if anyone has been in a similar situation."

8,2023-03-23,$10k retention bonus to stay for 2 years. Advice needed.,u/HeyItsRed,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11zseel/10k_retention_bonus_to_stay_for_2_years_advice/,jobs,"I casually mentioned in a team huddle a month or so ago that I had turned down an offer of $100k to work in a contract position nearby. The team was discussing the amount of recruitment messages we receive on LinkedIn because another org just adopted this software we use. 

With that, my boss decided to reach out to HR to get me a retention bonus. HR approved it for $10k, but I have to agree to stay for 2 years. I asked my boss, if HR will negotiate the time frame and she said no. 

Independently of the bonus, I was looking for a promotion next year to Senior Analyst. My boss told me she will write it into our departments budget this year (for next year). But otherwise no guarantees in writing and she does not get final say-so as she answers to the VPF and CFO. 

Now what I need feedback on or your own personal anecdotes:

2 years feels like a long time to be locked down in the event I do not get promoted next year. If I do not get promoted, my plan was to leave. My boss has already said that I am qualified to be promoted, but she doesn't have a budgeted position in which to promote me. 

I could try and negotiate a higher bonus like $15k. Which would effectively be an increase of $7500 per year - a decent middle ground to a promotion. I do enjoy my job. It's remote, pay is good for the area, and insurance is top tier, and days are super flexible in case I ever need to grab my daughter from daycare or have an appt. Also I have been here 2 years if that's important. 

Or am I being too greedy? Would you have jumped at this or turned it away?"

They posted the schedule last nighr/early this morning for next week and I am scheduled for Sunday. Will they be able to give me a bad reference for up and quitting tonight or Saturday? I originally left them and put my 2 weeks in but they have been treating me like a dog and I already have an interview today, which I was going to put my 2 weeks in for but now I do not even want to do that because I physically cannot work on Sunday!!

He barely checks in with us anymore and we had a team meeting this week that was very tense as he and a colleague don’t see eye to eye. There’s been a high attrition rate and to be honest I’ve not been enjoying my own work. I’m terrible for staying in jobs until past burn out.

I am trying to create an app for a class project that aims to help individuals in the data/tech field to find jobs. My ideas so far is to include multiple companies, their locations, the specific job, the salary, median household income in the area, crime rating of the area, and company ratings.

Can anyone tell me about their experience with other job searching apps/sites (what you liked, what you wished to see, what you didn't like, etc.)

That said, their biggest and likely only concern is that I would be moving from 500+ miles away and would be unfamiliar with the territory. Citing that he has never had someone relocate for an IC role.

He went on to say that I may want to hold out for an opening in my current city. I addressed this objection pretty well during our conversation and we scheduled a f/u so that he had time to think about it.

I know that I want the role as it offers MAJOR advancement and I love the city where the job is located — I’ll probably move there soon regardless.

I would like to send him an email with more information to overcome his objection and ease his mind about the decision. Does anyone have any recommendations for what to say and/or any articles that I can direct him towards?

I make it past the initial stage with the recruiter, then the first interview with a hiring manager (usually in the same office). For two, I got an interview directly with the hiring company manager and after that either get ghosted or given a generic ""We filled the position"" email. OR (a new one for me), ""We've discontinued this job listing.""

Just want to vent a bit. I tried and applied for jobs for more than 3 months and suddenly have a job now, its been 3 weeks. Yesterday and today are the worst day i have, have to wake up at 4am and be there at 5am, work til 2pm, my legs gaveup, i need sleep and almost at the edge of crying.
 Im on my own the whole morning, i have to put out portion cups, cutting breads, making eggs and restock at the same time, i only got trained to make sandwich, and theres only 2 other people and me there, i have to do the QC (untrained), do sandwich, do barrisa(untrained) and the customers keep coming and coming, sauces is labeled wrong, no ingredients in fridge, i burned a finger by an oven, customers looking angry at me expect me to give them what they want with only me doing it, i dont even know how to brew to-go coffee and i asked one of the person there and they thought i already know???
I can clearly see them managers just hired 3 new people, why the f im alone in the morning like that? Other workers say dont overwork myself but they arrive at 9am and pretty much enough people there to help each other out. To be honest the salary 12.5/hrs aint worth shit compare to what im dealting with, the sandwichs i make in 10 mins worth more than the salary. And who the f thinks worker standing 8h and 30 mins only need 30 mins break? And others have breaks earlier than me consider they arriving late than me and no break after 11 is absurd.
Only a handful people there being nice to be, and one of them disliked the managers alot, she then one day being mistreated by this manager and say that she will report to his boss, i didnt see her after that day, assume she got fired. The same manager also occasionally give out the vibe saying he wont hesitate firing people and mumble to other manager saying ""have to put them on the line"", i understand now why she hated that place so much. This is hell, I want to quit and i need some sleep"

Unfortunately there aren’t a lot of opportunities for younger people outside of the intern program to get together and   socialize. 

I know other people who have decided to throw happy hours for their department just by their own decision, and they’ve worked out well. The only concern I have is it being a happy hour for “young” people specifically. I feel like that could fall under some kind of age discrimination. I would just call it like a “young professionals happy hour”.  I guess “young” would just be ambiguous.

Am I breaking any rules there?"

So i have been feeling anguish lately since I can't figure out what job that i really want to do. A little details about me, I'm 25 and have a degree in engineering. I have hop on 3 different jobs already, (administrative, engineering(manufacturing) and QA) 

Out of all this job the admin one feel comfortable but the pay isn't good so i can't stay on that. The other 2 doesn't give me any sense of rewards as the job was really hectic and i felt just like a tool. 

It's really stressing me out everyday thinking the fact that if i jump on to the next company and didn't like it i have to resign again and waste my time.

But there are jobs that my friends do that seems to bw fun in my eyes like event planner and business development. So how do i know if that job suits me? What are the criteria one need to know? 

Appreciate all the help i can get."

I got promoted to a senior manager role last summer with overperforming rating. The first year of this rank is considered a transition.

Now the company is not performing well and is firing people. Instead of communicating a layoff, they are saying they fire based on performance. I'm meeting all my objectives but got an underperforming with stupid reasons like not participating in some meetings or having a monotonous voice.

I'm done with this company and willing to leave, but what could be the reason to try to report that I'm underperforming? Could this affect me in the future in other companies?"

I received an offer today for a company I'm honestly not excited about and its for $20k less than what I was making at my previous role before I was laid off. When I originally interviewed for this new position back in January, they told me the range, which I mentioned at the time was low. They told me that they'd get back to me with an updated amount based on where I live but never did.  Today, the top end of the range they originally shared is what they offered to me, plus an extra thousand.

Sure, while any salary is better than being unemployed, this feels like I'm taking a step backwards. What would you do if you were in my shoes?"

I have held 3 different roles, each with increasing responsibility. However, because each job change happened during a reorg, it was considered a lateral move in terms of pay and seniority.

I’m seeing people with much less experience being hired at my level.

I raised it with my manager, laid out a business case, and in my annual review he recommended that I be promoted to align wirh my peers, and because I was operating at that level already. 

Slam dunk, yes? 
2020: sorry, we can’t promote anyone because we’re in the midst of a merger
2021: recommended again. Denied because head of my division said I was l leveled appropriately
2022: new manager submitted paperwork. I didn’t ask because I’ve lost trust. Of course it didn’t happen 
2023: I’m finally promoted. I don’t care. I’ve already been offered another job, I’m just waiting for my bonus until resign 

My manager thinks I should be ecstatic for finally having been promoted. I’m resentful at so many dangled promises with no clear understanding of why these were repeatedly denied. It didn’t feel like I achieved a goal because it never felt like it was in my control.

It’s a moot point now. How can i prevent a similar situation from happening again? Each time I asked I was told it was never a performance issue, it was all circumstantial."

Anyways, I am currently 23 year olds from the EU. I was planning on moving to the US, so I did my GED in order to be able to study there. Long story short, that fell through, so I will start my last year of High School ( late, I know) this coming September in the EU.

I would like to have a job beforehand though and also while I’m at school. I am currently always going back and forth between the EU and USA for private reasons.
Due to the frequent travels, I would prefer a remote job. Again, I don’t have a fully completed education as already stated above, but I do have that GED ( which sadly becomes useless as a European citizen…). I’ve wanted a job for a long time now, just I felt like a complete failure and I felt like nobody wanted me, as you always need a bunch of experience.

I speak and write 4 languages ( English, German, French, Luxembourgish) fluently. I would work well if I had the chance to get a job. If anyone can help me out, and drop some recommendations, that would be grand!

There was a lot of paperwork, and but being a personal assistant gave me experience.

Right before the pandemic, I applied at my local school cafeteria. I got the job, but then the pandemix happened two weeks later. In mid 2020, I got hired at FedEx. It was the first place I'd applied, and I got hired immediately and started working. It was busy season.

After busy season, they started laying off the temporary hires, and I was cut. A few months later, I went to applied to a temp agency, and they immediately got me a job at a bumper factory. They lied about the start time, saying it was 7 to 3, when it was actually 3am to 3pm. This led to a health crisis, heartrate of 190 caused by dehydration, and I quit.

I've been pursuing other projects for the past two years, but finally decided I wanted to get a job some time in late 2022. Since then I've been sending applications to *every business* nearby. Probably close to 20 or 30 applications. I fucking hate writing those things, filling out forms. It's the type of thing I hate doing, but knowing that it's pointless and will only result in disappointment likely affects the submission.

A couple months ago, I sat down with a friend and she filed out 10 applications with me. None of them have gone through.

Meanwhile, my brother went to our local Chipotle, and got hired immediately.

I'm so angry, not at anyone in particular, just at the situation. Why is it so hard to get a job? Why was it so easy? Is there a secret list of people who quit jobs that I'm on, and if you quit two then you get bumped down? The jobs were easy, it was the commute that made me quit. 2 hours for both of them, and I don't have a car. I was fucking insane to think I could consistently make it to work on time with a 2 hour commute, and every day that 2 hours ground away ay my soul.

I don't know, I just need some perspective. Or maybe I'm right, and everything sucks. 

any advice?"

I've worked at the knitting wholesale job for about three weeks and I like it well enough but the pet care job reached out and I'm being extremely indecisive about this. If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it."

I wanted to leave from day 1 but it was a foot in the door of the right role and industry I wanted to try and it has backfired on me. Myself and all other 8 recent hires were fired before reaching 6 month mark.

I’m super conscious of how bad the economy is right now and I do not want to go back into a position of taking the wrong job. I am worried my resume will begin to look like a job hopper if I take an upcoming offer that I am not excited about 

Job 1 - May 17 - April 18
Job 2 - April 18- May 20
Travel break May 20 - May 21
Job 3 - May 21 - July 22
Job 4 - July 22 - March 23

As I’m relatively early in my career I’m nervous to make the wrong move. If an offer arises should I take it while I continue to search? Hoped something else arises and I could maybe exclude the temp position off my resume going forward? Or is it best to stay on unemployment until an offer I’m genuinely excited about comes through?"

I haven't excelled and have been stuck. A lot is expected from me now since I am older. I have never been fired and many jobs have complimented me on being punctual and having a lot of work ethic.

My first job ever was a golf course job I did for four seasons since I was young, not much was expected of me, and it was great.

I was a stocker at a grocery store and again no complaints I was young and not a lot was expected from me.

I then did a home health aide job for a year out of college and liked it but stressful and didn't pay well.

Then it starts to go downhill. I start working as a nursing assistant and I was bullied for about 2 years before breaking down at work when my mother passed away and couldn't take being tortured anymore.

I got a job at amazon and overall it was ok but soul-crushing.

Finished a coding BootCamp and landed a job and my consulting company was terrible. Boss always told me how he wanted to punch stupid people in the face and nod toward me. I don't know why they hired me if they knew I only had 11 weeks of coding experience but I quit the best chance at a good-paying career.

Went back to Amazon soul crushed again.

Did a lot of different work but pretty much manual labor.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got another warehouse job and again it's just terrible. I'm already a week in and managers are scolding and sneering at me when I say good morning to them. I hate it here. I don't know what I'm asking for here but I don't know how to keep going for another 30 years with no hope of a good job. With managers bullying me with just dead-end job after dead-end job."

Current job: admin staff(clerical work)
Pros: easy work, a lot of free time
Cons: no career growth, no benefits, minimum pay, no promotions(deadend job)

New job offer: credit analyst (bank)
Pros: better pay, with benefits, bonuses, allowance
Cons: different career path than what i want

Possible work: QA (tech company)
Pros: career growth, better pay, with benefits, bonuses, can wfh from time to time
Cons: only con i can think rn is long commute or renting a place to be closer

Current work is ok if you think about the present but really shitty in the long term. 

New offer is really good compared to the current job (i just really wanna get out of my current work) but it's not the career path i wanna take.

Possible work is really good for career growth but the thing is i don't know if they will call me or if i can even get the job. They already emailed me saying ""If your skill set matches the position, our Recruitment team will reach out to discuss next steps in the process."" 6 days ago.
 

If i take the new job (bank) will it affect me in pursuing a career in tech in the long run? Is it ok to take the new job and wait for tech opportunities or stay in my current and then wait for tech opportunities?

Ps. I don't know what flair to use"

When I got the rejection call I asked about another position that was open to see if I could apply, she said they were in final round interviews for that as well. 

My hesitation: I’m debating on applying for another position within a different department of the company. I reached out to the person who let me know about not offering me the job and asked how to stay on their radar for future positions. It’s been a week and I haven’t received a response. She did respond in a timely manner when I was an active candidate. Did they really not like me? Am I over thinking the lack of response? Should I try to apply to a different position for this company again?

2,2023-03-24,"I'm struggling to find a job in my field, and am now desperate to find any employment because I am on the verge of losing everything. Need advice on what to do next.",u/Far_Emergency_262,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/120dye3/im_struggling_to_find_a_job_in_my_field_and_am/,jobs,"I haven't posted in probably over a decade, and haven't been a regular reader in years, but I come because I need help in the form of real actionable advice. I have exhausted my ""irl"" resources (the few I have), and I don't know where else to go.

**The Problem**  
I'm having a very hard time finding a job in my field (computer programming). I've been unemployed for nearly a year and my savings have completely dried up. I'm at the point now where I **must** have some form of income or I will be unable to pay any bill (let alone have food) after this month.

I need to get a job - any job - and besides the obvious act of filling out applications, I'm not sure how to go about it.  I'm afraid that Bigbox Store manager is going to see 15+ years of programming experience in my job history and (rightly) assume that I will jump ship as soon as I can get back in the field. I don't know what I could say to a hiring manager to convince them that wouldn't happen - I'm a terrible liar.

At the end of the day, the longer I'm away from being a professional coder, the harder it will be to find a job as one, something that is already becoming a stumbling block. If I see an opportunity - ANY opportunity - I have to take it.

If I do manage to find a temp job(s), depending on the pay, I will likely have to work a lot of hours in order to get by, leaving little time to continue looking for programming jobs, working on my skills, and learning new technologies. I'm worried I'll become ""stuck"".

Please don't mistake my reticence to be driven by pride or shame; I will literally do any job in my capability and strongly believe that I am not ""above"" any work or worker. I'd be happy doing anything that could afford my relatively modest lifestyle, but I'm afraid that isn't sustainable for my family. Working as a software developer typically comes with a much higher salary and nicer benefits than an ""unskilled"" job. My partner has a disability preventing them from finding regular employment, and their quality of life would greatly benefit from premium medical care and having things that the extra cash can afford (more therapy, accommodations for the home, not having to work the few free hours in the week they have left after doctor and hospital visits). In short, I need to make cheddar so my partner can have a healthier and longer life and coding is the only skill I have that can ""maximize my earning potential"".

There are several issues, internal and external, contributing to my circumstances that should be included for context. I also think I need to vent a little...

**Why I'm Unemployed**  
I was fired from my last position.

When I first joined the company, I hit the ground running as a top performer. Within a year, I had made a significant impact at the company and was recognized for it by top brass. I enjoyed going to the office and was proud of the work I did. I continued to have glowing performance reviews until some changes in the office environment adversely affected my ability to consistently produce good work.

About a year and a half into my tenure, due to headcount growth in the IT department, the company hired a new CIO (IT was previously under the CFO). Almost immediately, the office and the org chart came under construction. For the next two years, we lived as office vagabonds, wheeling around our new portable sit-to-stand desks in a completely gutted floor looking for space and working power outlets. The IT department was literally working at construction site, replete with piles of demolition garbage and materials littering the bare concrete floor, searing blasts of power saws biting into metal, and the oppressive wash of non-diffused fluorescent light. It wasn't until several people complained directly to the CIO did management consider allowing some of us to work from home. I jumped at the opportunity because i was just not getting work done in the office. For a few months, my productivity picked back up.

The construction finally concluded and we were all made to return to the office. Our reward for enduring two years of working out of our laptop bags and paper ream boxes? An open office space just big enough to cram the entire teams' shitty little portable desks into. One wall was taken up by a giant window to the *interior*, facing a large common area and the main elevators. It felt like we were turned into the ""Code Monkey Exhibit"" at the office zoo. AND, due to a failure in floor plan design, our cramped room turned into a major thoroughfare to the new and constantly booked conference room! No effort was made toward sound dampening despite promises there would be. We had no control over lighting which management insisted remain at 100% despite many (including myself) preferring lower light for headaches/eyestrain/concentration reasons.

Between the noise, lights, and regular parade of meeting goers loudly milling about just two feet behind me, I got next to nothing done. Performance and reviews plummeted throughout the department. All signs pointed to the new office situation, but management chose to remain blind to personnel complaints. Six months of this, then the pandemic hit.

During the initial lockdown and throughout the year, the company employed a robust policy concerning the virus and work flexibility. In the meantime, despite the world falling apart, I felt I had bounced back. Then in late 2021 I was moved under a new supervisor on a new project. Then my mother nearly died of covid. I took time under FMLA to help care for her as she was nearly helpless during recovery. I returned from leave in early 2022 to find a radical shift in  management's attitude toward working from home. There was no more covid policy, no mask or vaccine mandate, and everyone was to return to the office. This was alarming; not only was I still spending most evenings with my mom, but my partner's chronic health issues leave them at high risk too, not to mention the abject chaos in the office itself that renders me unproductive. I tried explaining this to my new supervisor, the IT manager, and the CIO. I was dismissed with ""it'll be taken under consideration, now back to work at your desk here in the office"".

So I did. I continued wearing a mask in the office even though most people chose not to. Because there was no vaccine policy, I had to ask everyone personally if they were vaccinated and embarrassingly explain why I felt compelled to invade their privacy, Turns out most people were and understood my concern. My new supervisor on the other hand was not and responded to my inquiry with some fantasy conspiracy nonsense that I swear included references to the movie*12 Monkeys*. I just kept my mouth shut and mask on. The fucker sat *right* next to me.

First quarter reviews come around and I am absolutely raked over the coals by my supervisor. Some of criticism was fair, I did rather poorly that quarter. Some of it wasn't, I literally wasn't there for the first three weeks, and was assigned to a brand new project. I had asked for *any* accommodation that would help improve my productivity and received none. Finally I asked to be put on a performance plan. My supervisor said he'd develop one for me.

That night, on the drive home from my mom's house, I was hit by a speeding semi. Technically twice - the first was a clip to my rear that sent me spinning, the second was a full-on t-bone to the driver's side. The cops and paramedics say I'm pretty lucky to have sustained only minor injuries. The second hit was so hard that part of my rear door was bent around the truck's bumper, preventing my car from flipping.

The next day, I call in to explain the situation and take a couple of days off. Because of being dicked around by the trucker's insurance company on a rental, I'm not able to physically return to the office for another week, so in the meantime I work from home and start to feel like I'm doing better.

Less than a week back in the office, however, and I can see how the office environment directly impedes my work. Again I talk to my supervisor and the IT manager, literally begging for any accommodation. I'm told that I am not permitted to work from home because I'm on a performance plan, and despite several empty cubicles throughout the building, that there was no available space elsewhere in the office. I asked about the status of my performance plan...he's working on it.

That next Friday I am called into the IT managers office and fired citing under-performance and insubordination by willfully ignoring my supervisor's performance plan (that I never received). Any attempts to speak in my defense were quickly dismissed as the manager just continued talking over me. Eventually I gave up and shut down, saving all my mental energy to fight off breaking down into tears or succumbing to the panic I felt emerging in my gut. I was escorted from the building and that was that.

Two weeks later, my dog passed away. I spiraled hard for a few months, having neither the energy or desire to do anything more ambitious than laying on the couch, watching the series *Wilfred* for the n-teeth time while softly crying into my pillow. With support from my partner and strategies built from years of my life spent in treatment for ADHD, severe depression, and anxiety, I began to right the ship.

Then my cat passed away. I felt like I was starting to crack. With little choice, I used a huge chunk of my savings to get back to regular therapy. By October last year, I finally felt ready to get back to work.

I was pretty optimistic at first. My resume was getting a lot of hits on the various job sites and my inbox and voicemail were filling up with messages from recruiters. Even as the rejections began to mount, there were so many jobs available I was bound to be hired soon. So I thought.

**I'm Bombing Interviews**   
Probably my biggest obstacle in finding a job is not interviewing well. As mentioned before, I have long struggled with severe anxiety. Regular therapy and Rx have done wonders for my quality of life, but there are some situations that always put me on the edge of panic. Job interviews are chief among them. Over the years, I have developed strategies to keep my brain in check, but even if I'm able to stave off a panic attack and manage to get through the interview, it is impossible to mask the physiological evidence of my anxiety.

I sweat...a lot. I have [primary generalized hyperhydrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis) and as with many who deal with the condition, it is exacerbated in times of high anxiety. While the Rx I take has made a significant dent in my usual daily over-sweating, it does little to help during the anxiety-provoking stress of a job interview. This isn't just a moist brow and clammy hands. It is full-body, clothes-soaking, dripping sweat, as if I were roofing with hot tar in the blazing sun. It is uncontrollable and impossible to hide.

Next, at my most anxious, I am wracked with tremors. Parts of my body, particularly my hands, shake uncontrollably. My voice trembles making me sound timid and weak, no matter how much bass or confidence I try to put behind it.

I have been on 8 interviews so far (out of 70+ applications and recruiter leads). Two were cut short as I reached full panic and had to excuse myself (neither client wanted to reschedule). Three were outright failures as my brain ""froze"" and I floundered on technical questions. One of them I felt went really well, but then I froze up later, totally blowing their coding challenge. Two went *okay*, but I can't help but think that, in a large field of candidates, the one shaking and dripping sweat onto the conference room table *might* get moved to the end of the list.

I probably leave many interviewers thinking ""This poor, terrified goblin can barely form a coherent sentence and it thinks it can code? How quaint. I would keep it around for amusement were it not so disgusting and pathetic.""

I can get pretty dark when it comes to self-reflection. It oddly helps me cope.

&gt;Important note, if you have actually read this far, thanks! Even if you don't have advice, you are probably a person with sympathy for the plight of the human condition and I find that worthy of respect. However, if what you read so far has inspired you to reply with advice on how to ""cure"" the the physiological side-effects of my anxiety, or ""one great trick"" to pass the interview...please don't. It is something that exists that I just have to cope with, and I have medical professionals helping with that. I'm only including this information because its related to my current situation. I am not seeking health advice, I'm seeking career advice.

That brings us to today. I'm still frantically scrambling to find any job in my field, spending any spare time running though coding drills and studying interview questions (preparation helps with recall during interviews when I'm spending most of my mental energy trying not to panic), but I have to face the very likely reality I won't be able to secure said job by the time I have nothing left.

I need to begin looking for any job that will hire me just so I don't lose everything, but I don't have a strategy for finding that job, or how I get back to a coding job if I do."

Don’t know where to turn for good advice.

  
Hey all,

This is a *long* post, if you have the time to skim/ read it and offer your take I’d be more grateful than you could imagine. I don’t know where else to turn.

Welcoming practical advice but please, nothing unkind, I’m already killing myself with anxiety.

I (34F) left a low-paid design career in London 5 years ago due to mental health and personal issues. Severely burnt out, I spent the next two years getting the help I needed and then doing some much-longed-for travelling.

I retrained as a massage therapist and moved down to the south coast of the UK in the hope of a more chilled and balanced life. I love living here and would not move back to London unless there was a gun to my head.

After successive lockdowns and bit-work to get me through the pandemic, I began working as a self-employed massage therapist and love it. However, after a couple of years, I’m realising that it’s a crappy business model (unscalable) and I don’t want to rely on its capricious nature for my full-time income.

Finding a flexible PT job to do alongside has proved a nightmare. I’ve tried online English tutoring, doing freelance design projects for past employers, working at a local nursery, and recently as a remote PA for a wonderful but incredibly chaotic individual.

Every job is unreliable and each month I’m spinning plates from \~3-4 PT jobs, scrabbling to get enough money together to live on. I’m exhausted. I’ve found myself *craving* the structure and reliability of a 9-5. I also feel incredibly lonely and isolated after working at home, for and by myself for the majority of my weeks. I want colleagues and mentorship again! To feel a part of an organisation and work within a team toward shared goals.

So, I find myself at 34, with experience in disparate areas and a CV that lacks any cohesive narrative, trying to get back into the workplace and absolutely no clue how to go about this.

I don’t have it in myself or my finances to go back to university to re-train. But if there were training I could take (ideally online) that is circa £3k or less and would genuinely improve my employment prospects I would consider borrowing that amount.

Currently, the only option that feels available to me is to get some office experience as a temp and hopefully get a permanent admin position or similar, perhaps work up to the role of being a PA or EA in a nice company that doesn’t treat employees like 💩?

I’m incredibly organised, able to communicate professionally and build relationships well. I do not want to return to London in any way, so I'd ideally like to work in the city I live in (Brighton).

The trouble is I have no idea what options are available to me and have no idea who to ask. I went back to my old university career guidance and she was *useless,* on the *“you just need to follow your dreams!”* level of incompetence. Like, lady, my dreams withered to compost years ago.

I need someone with an overview perspective on the current job market and who can tell me what I could strive for currently, and also with some (not degree level) training.

So, dear people of Reddit, any advice? What could an intelligent person with a weird CV shoot for? Where could I go for decent advice about this - if it isn't here 🙂 ? 

Some facts that might help:

**Qualifications**  
Bachelor's degree in Interior Architecture (2:1)

I’m not particularly a fan of my coworkers, they are from the Midwest and I am from California and there’s just a huge culture difference. I’m nice and open, they’re more cliquey and shut off. I have better relationships with some employees outside of my team, than within my team.  

I’m stronger at a lot of things than my colleagues, and weaker at other things. They reach out to me a lot when they need help, but whenever I need help with things it feels like It gets noticed a lot more and management feels like I can’t do my job. It’s annoying because I’m stuck doing menial tasks when I’m obviously capable of much more. I’ve brought up things that we can easily develop further that I’m willing to step up and do, just need to go ahead but it falls on deaf ears. 


I’m frustrated because I know I bring a lot more value than doing the 30 min tasks as busy work. I’ve brought it up to my manager and it was kinda brushed off. I’ve asked the coworkers who are working on the higher level things to be introduced to it and it seems they are taking it as competition.

Yesterday, my previous boss called me up. We talk from time to time and I also used him as a reference for this position.

My first job was really toxic. The boss was a textbook workplace bully, the hours were crazy, I was grossly underpaid, and the turnover was ridiculous. Classic bad workplace. I stuck it out for about a year and then left because I was so  unhappy.

My second job is with a small company that I've been with for a little over 1.5 years. It's not perfect, definitely has its flaws, but overall a decent job. I found out a couple weeks ago that the company is going out of business, so I've had to go back on the job market sooner than expected.

Job hunting overall has gone pretty well, I've gotten some interviews, positive feedback, and I feel reasonably confident that I could get some offers soon. But one thing that's bothering me is something that came up during one of those  interviews. One member of the leadership team basically told me ""you only graduated a few years ago and you've already had 2 jobs. What's going on there?"" I explained (I spin the first job transition as a change in career goals, and tell the truth about the 2nd company closing) and it seemed like that was a fine answer. 

Does it look like I'm job hopping? Does it matter? Should I be worried about potential employers seeing it as a red flag?"

A recruiter reached out to me regarding a hybrid position. Based on what she told me. It's starts off as a contract at $18/hr and if decided to join the the team the salary goes to $20/hr. I looked on the website of said company and job and the salary range was $39k-$60k and I have an interview with the Operations Supervisor later today. 

My experience matches the required requirements and about half of the preferred requirements. As the title states I want negotiate the salary. Since I don't have a car yet spending money to get an Uber will start to be costly. Purchasing a car I'd love to do but if I do the payments myself then that would start to be costly too. In negotiating the salary is ask to go to $21 or higher if I was taken into the team. While on contract I'd understand the $18 an hr. What do you think and what should I say.

Nowhere on the job listing did it say a drug test was required. However, it did mention “must undergo and pass a physical, including a lift test”. They never mentioned it in the three interviews I had either. Additionally, they had already sent an offer letter which I signed last week. The offer letter said nothing about it being contingent on the physical. 

I smoked marijuana at a friend’s less than a week ago, not knowing that a drug test was required (since it wasn’t mentioned at all during the hiring process). I’m pretty sure the results will be positive because of it. 

All of that said, how worried should I be about losing the job offer? I take personal blame surely, but should the company have been more straightforward about the drug test? Readying myself for the offer to be rescinded, but curious to know if anyone has experience in this type of situation. 

Thank you in advance!

Edit to add: the exact wording is “Must undergo and pass a physical, including a lift test, and background check before employment.”"

This is with a major private company in the financial services industry so admittedly possible this person being a high-ranked person in the org is just super busy and needed to get somewhere. Or I just answered all the questions as needed, she doesn't like small talk, and there was no need for fluff, idk. 

 The first round was a half-hour chat with the recruiter, which went great. The second round was two individual 30-minute interviews that took up their full-time slots, both went great, they would be people I'd work with and seemed excited about moving forward, I got an email request for the third round interview maybe an hour after I concluded the second round. During the second interview of the second round, once we finished, I was basically told I'd get to the next round and that the final round would be a culture-fit interview and to prep for that accordingly. 

For that interview, she asked me no personal questions, didn't do any small talk, and just jumped straight to the interview but she was kind and didn't seem upset or irked at anything. She simply asked the same questions the previous round did, but no discussion of my answers or anything. I had good answers given they were the same as the last round's. I asked questions at the end, but it all wrapped up in ten\~ minutes. I can't imagine I set off a red flag that quickly lol. The big question I've been asking that's been working in interviews is ""what kind of person do they envision working in the role?""

 for the sake of explanation, this is a data analysis role with a legal background needed &amp; being open to learning technical skills. I had already covered wanting to learn more technical skills like learning XML and Python, and did a callback to talking to the previous interviewer about it, she commented that it was great that I had years of background in litigation in different fields. I touched on teamwork and the shared workload environment that the last interviewer spoke about and she noted that as well. Basically when she answered the question b/c it was identical to the last round, I had covered all the things that she said she'd be looking for in the role. 

Am I SOL on this one or this was a formality cause they covered so much ground in the previous rounds?  I genuinely feel like I was on my A-game for this even with the rapid-fire round, I got nervous but I don't think it showed."

I like working there, but there are some problems. One of the main problems is that I feel like they are misclassifying me as a self-employed contract worker instead of an employee. I don’t buy any of the supplies, I don’t get to schedule my hours, I have direct supervisors, and I get told how things should be organized. I’ve heard rumors that they’re planning to change us to actual employees at some point, which is why I’m not leaving just yet. When I didn’t know that they were thinking about changing us to employees, I was looking to change jobs because I don’t know how to do my taxes as self-employed and because my employers aren’t paying their share of the taxes. I thought about going to my old job where I had a couple of friends who work there. When I talked to the employer about that job she said that she wouldn’t mind rehiring me as I was a good employee and I put in a two-week notice before I left. Then after that is when I heard that my job at the trading card place is planning on changing us to actual employees. I thought about it and asked both jobs if I can work two jobs. They both said yes, but the job with my friends is being very picky with my scheduling making it so I work on my days of, I work 5-6 days a week, and asking me to change the days I have off at the trading card place. I feel like I won’t have any time to myself if I work both jobs, but I don’t want to leave either one because I love trading cards, and the people there are nice, and I don’t want to leave the other job because there are people that I know who work there that will be happy if I start working there again. Any advice on what I should do?"

Not sure if I am getting the onsite... All of the interviews have been virtual so far.

I just had the ""final interview"" with the CEO through Zoom on Wednesday. Not too sure how it went. I'm always 50/50 and never get my hopes up. It is between me and another person.

At the end of the interview, the CEO told me I did good and that I should be coordinating to come in person and meet. He said I would be moving forward. But like I said, those are just words and I don't get my hopes up ever in these interviews after having gone through many. The recruiter did tell me before going in the interview that he may want to meet again but in person.

In any event though, what do you all think? My interview was two days ago and I have heard nothing yet. I know it's been two days, but it was pretty much the final interview so I am a little worried I didn't make the cut for the onsite. Should I wait it out until next week before thinking I got the axe? Or is this a normal timeline in the event they WERE coordinating an onsite?"

About 3-4 months ago I was offered the option to resign or get fired. I didn't want to have to explain the gap in employment so I offered them an alternative - to make me a part time/as needed employee and just not give me any hours if they didn't want to. My manager at the time agreed to this. 

Since then, I've gotten maybe 3 hours of work from the company. Since there has been a lot of turnover/reorg/an acquisition they seem more open to bringing me on for certain tasks. For example, the old manager who wanted me to leave the company has gone off to a different company and my previous manager (with whom I didn't have a great relationship either, honestly) is now officially my manager again. 

I have been trying to gain new skills during this period of unemployment. I'm learning programming to make a career change within the next year or so, but for now I also wanted to work on getting my PMP to give me leverage in the job search since I haven't had luck. 

But part of the requirements for the PMP is that my manager needs to sign off on my taking the exam. I'm afraid to interact with him at this point because we have had contentious conversations before I got ""fired"", and I am just uncomfortable approaching him about this. I think he will sign off if I ask, because I don't think his goal is to ruin my prospects of finding another job or hinder my career, but I just need some encouragement to go ask."

I have been contacted by 2 “management” agencies this week for a “role” I’ve applied to. I’m super organized and have a log of all the jobs I apply to and not one of these companies were on it. Both claimed to have gotten my information from Linkedin but when I spoke with Linkedin, they denied giving my information out. When I researched the companies further it appears they could be a gimmicky sales job (which, if they have my resume, would not fit me at all). I was just curious if anyone had been contacted by:

Elite Management in Texas
Tidal Management in Southern California 

If you were, did they contact you without you truly applying? Did they disclose how they received your info? Did they disclose the “role” you applied for or was it super vague? I’m just trying to figure out how these companies are getting my information. Thanks in advance."

I am looking for some advice. This is a long one - sorry. 

I was laid off in January and have been interviewing and applying for entry-level opportunities since then. The market hasn't been great, but I finally got a verbal offer from my first choice company (company A) on the 15th of this month. I also got a written offer from my second choice (company B) on that day. 

I thought everything was great at that point and was waiting on the written offer from company A so that I could formally accept it and get everything in writing before declining company B's offer. On the 16th, I got a really strange call from the recruitment agency that company A works with saying that the offer was coming but that an ""urgent and competing priority"" had come up and that this meant that onboarding had to be delayed by two weeks. When I pressed the recruiter on the written offer letter, he said that he didn't expect it to come soon but that I shouldn't have to wait longer than two weeks.

I slept on this and got back in touch the next day. I let them know that they were my first choice but I had another offer on the table and that I needed something more concrete to go on and that I needed it in writing. He promptly got back to me via email saying that he'd spoken with my interviewers and they confirmed that I was their star candidate and that there was no chance of the job going to anyone else if I wanted it. They asked me to give them two weeks maximum before I accepted another offer. 

I felt really reassured by this and declined the offer from company B. I feel that it's just a waiting game now and as they asked for two weeks, that I should take them at their word and give them two weeks. They assured me that I would hear back by the 31st max. However, I can't help feeling a bit uneasy about this whole thing. They are a startup so I understand, having worked in a similar environment before, that these delays can happen. I'm just wondering why they haven't even been in touch to ask me for my details so that they can process the written offer when they are freed up to do so. I'm worried that this job might not materialise.

I also let them know (when they asked me a month ago) that I was available to start immediately, but my family is all meeting up abroad from the 1st to the 15th of April and I would like to go. The company works entirely remotely, so I would ideally prefer to work remotely while I'm out with my family, but I'm having trouble navigating this whole situation. I'm worried that I would antagonise them by getting in touch and letting them know that I may be out of the country in the first two weeks of April. I feel like they might either rescind the offer or think it's strange that I'm waiting for their sign-off when I don't yet have a contractual relationship with them. I honestly don't know what to do and I feel like I've given them a lot of grace at this point with not much clarity in return. I would definitely not be contemplating a trip if I had a written offer and a start date set in stone, but this hasn't come about. Any advice?"

Well apparently the CFO (who I directly report to) had enough and resigned. That would be disruptive enough as it is, but he was also my biggest supporter. The other higher ups don't like me because of political differences (they are all conservatives) and because I have a few medical conditions that require reasonable accommodations.

Since he announced his resignation the focus on my role has intensified. I fear they are planning on replacing me soon. So I guess my question is, is this a valid concern?

Out of the 6 of us, I think I am the worst or second worst performing one. Because of the economic downturn, I'm pretty sure I won't be retained by the firm when our contract ends. But because our firm's business has not been that good in the past few years, I also feel like I have not learnt as much as I should have during my training contract.  

I'm now applying for other firms as well as my own firm, but I can't help but feel like I have no chance in comparison to my competitors, who are all extremely smart and capable. 

I feel like I'm shit at my job and am afraid I'll continue to be shit if I stay in it. I suffer from severe imposter syndrome, but that's because I actually am an imposter. At the same time, there's nothing else I'm remotely as interested in, and there are also no other viable options that will offer me a comparable salary.

This is as a machine learning engineer. He has suggested we start with a contract position so we can feel out if it's a good fit, and then mutually re-assess about a full time position. He asked me to propose a timeframe and compensation structure to him. The initial project he suggested struck me as likely to take several months to fully execute, but I'm willing to commit 1-2 months of full time work as a contractor before mutually assessing whether it's a good fit for full time. (I had been planning to spend this time relaxing and planning for my return to my PhD program - I'd been on a leave of absence working at a different startup - hence why I have the free time.)

My hourly rate for total cash compensation at my most recent full-time job (as a data scientist) was $97/hr, not taking holidays and PTO into account. This job also offered equity-based compensation (it was a startup, though, so actual value unclear until they exit), benefits, etc.

My understanding is that the additional tax I would be paying as a contractor is 7.65% (my half of Medicare and Social Security taxes), so plan to incorporate that. Is this the correct adjustment for the additional tax burden, or are there other self-employment taxes beyond this? I'm in California.

What other factors should I consider when computing my hourly rate as a contractor, given the specifics of this situation? I want to ensure they don't essentially have an incentive to keep me as a contractor indefinitely vs. making me a full time offer.

Some factors I plan to take into account:

* PTO, holidays
* Flexibility of salaried work - being able to go for e.g. a doctor's appointment without making less money
* Benefits (I'll adjust for the amount I'm currently paying in COBRA) - there are others it's harder to put a value on like LTD, 401(k), free counseling and legal services, etc.
* The greater security of full time vs. contract"

It seemed like all of my interviews had gone really well so I'm just shocked at the lack of response from them. 

I sent a follow up email checking on the status a week and a half later and haven't hear back. 

Why do companies feel like it is okay to do this? I don't even want to go and leave a bad review on Glassdoor because its a job in a niche industry and I'm paranoid about someone finding out that it was me."

I (31 yo) feel lost at work. I'm unsure if I'm in the correct field. I have worked in communications for juuuust shy of a decade, and dabbled in PR for a few years in there as well. This comes after majoring in creative writing in college (at a university well-known for its creative writing program, if that counts for anything). I also interned as a journalist in college, and have freelanced as one since 2014, publishing a couple things on the side every few months.

When I applied for and accepted my current job (after *five rounds* of interviews thoroughly discussing my experience), I was under the impression that it would be more writing-focused, but it's much more market research oriented (where we then take that research and create deliverables that tell our clients how to communicate). I'm trying to learn market research at break-neck speed, but it's been difficult because I have zero market research background. (I'm talking having to learn how to build quantified research surveys, how to moderate qualified research interviews, etc... I’m trying my best but I'm just a writer!)

Just to give some additional background on myself, in case it helps:
 • I also have an interest in health and fitness
 • I own and operate a literary journal on the side
   — This is not a job; in fact I pay for its existence lol
 • I've always wanted to open a coffee shop
   — No idea how to do this, but have a clear vision/theme for it for if I ever do tackle this dream
   — I was a barista for years in college
 • I've had a lifelong fascination with ships and the sea
   — Not ""shipping"" in an industrial sense, but what began as a childhood obsession with 20th century ocean liners grew into a fascination and appreciation that includes modern cruise ships, too
   — But zero formal education in this industry
 • I live in New York City
 • I think trains are rad, too
   — A well-planned subway network, Amtrak, you name it
   — When visiting family and friends in Houston, I take the train from NYC to HOU. Took an 11-day cross-country Amtrak trip once before, too. I'm in deep y'all
 • I'm on the board of a theatre company in Houston (remotely, of course). Love the performing arts
 • I'm gay and have a fascination with history
   — esp. queer history
   — esp. southern U.S. queer history
 • As much as I've worked as a writer, my true passion is editing
   — If I could workshop short stories all day with aspiring writers (and make a salary doing it), I could cry happy tears forever and die a happy man

I'm married, no kids, one dog. Not looking to move or upend my husband's life by moving across the country or overseas, nor would it be totally fair for me to accept a major salary decrease. My current salary is good (but under $100K) and I fear that if I don't learn this skill at my job fast enough, I'll be let go. But if I were to search for a new job... should I stay in communications? Should I do something else?

Is there some unicorn career out there that aligns with my experience and interests that I'm unaware of that I should be doing instead of this?"

Are you looking for a new challenge or growth opportunity? Are there aspects of your current job that you're unhappy with? Are you interested in exploring a new industry or role?

If you do decide to pursue the job offer you mentioned, it's important to consider not only the salary but also the other aspects of the compensation package, such as benefits, equity, and opportunities for growth and advancement. Additionally, you should consider the potential impact on your current team and whether you'd be able to maintain the same level of trust and support with a new group of colleagues.

Ultimately, the decision to leave your current job is a personal one and should be based on careful consideration of all the factors involved. It's important to prioritize your own goals and values while also being mindful of the impact your decision may have on others."

I'm in high school and this post is about my dad. My dad earns about 70k a year as an auditor for his dads company. He went to college and got a bachelors in business. He has a lot of experience, about \~20 or so years? He's also worked at Tyson for about 10 years. So 30 years of his life he's been an auditor.

Recently he told me that his boss can't afford his salary anymore, or any of the other employees, and that it's likely he will have to find a new job. He's not sure what will happen to the business yet. He doesn't really have a plan on what to do, and i want to help, but I also don't know what to do. 

The main issues are that within the next month or so we are going to most likely have to move apartments because the town we live in is getting very expensive, about 1.7k a month for a 1 bath 1 bedroom. This wouldn't be as big a problem to move if it didn't interfere with my siblings an I's education. If he moves, we will have to move schools, and we already go to the cheaper public school in the district, and the other ones that we looked at are too expensive. We will also lose insurance and medical plans.   


So we need to match his income or get more if we want to stay where we are without moving or something. What can I do to help??? I am trying to help look for jobs for him and get a part time job myself but I don't know what else to do. Is it possible to also set something up with the landlord to make an exception until we get this sorted out.

3,2023-03-24,"Staying or going: evaluating a company that was not as ""together"" as you expected",u/Apprehensive-Mode-45,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/120yd1u/staying_or_going_evaluating_a_company_that_was/,jobs,"Last spring, as I was finishing up a big 6-month project management/event planning project that was a huge success, my boss recommended me to a non-profit that they were on the board of. 

This org has been formed for about 2 years and had just completed its first big event, with an aim to do another in 18 months and become more permanent and build its reputation. My boss had told me bits and pieces about the org, that getting through the first event had been rough and they weren't happy with their current project manager.

I was flattered that she recommended me, and the little bit I understood about the mission of the org and it being another large project management role - I thought it could work. While I had a positive preliminary conversation with a couple board members early last summer, it took 4 months for them to get around to hiring me. Essentially, I am the single paid administrator, and members of the board lead different subcommittees. The co-chairs of the board are the closest thing to being my bosses. I take direction from the board, but simultaneously have to supervise the board members that have elected to take on volunteer admin work of the subcommittees. But all the board members are busy C-suite professionals, and often do not complete the work they volunteer to do in a timely manner.

For context, they had a big event in early summer 2022 and the next one was supposed to be Fall 2023. This org did virtually no work until I started in the fall. No post-event evaluation, no marketing. And since I started, there has been non-stop drama. 

First, they wanted to re-organize the workflows and bring on new board members with the aim of having more transparency and accountability - which was fine, but it took 3 months! I was getting the lay of the land, so didn't want to push anything at the time, but it was concerning to me that simple things were taking so long. We get to the end of 2022 and there still has not been any significant motion towards the fall event. 

Then my (old) boss suggested the org do a visioning workshop in early 2023 to get everyone on the same page - which I totally supported as well as board meetings were all over the place.

By 2023, I had discovered that the organization really has no solid internal structures or processes of how they do things. And a big chunk of what the org does is development - connecting with influential people with the aim of getting them to invest their time/expertise/reputation/money into the mission. 

Their ""database"" of people is a spreadsheet. They didn't have complete contact information for the people they invited in 2022. Development isn't my wheelhouse, but I know enough to know a lot was missing.

I knew immediately this org needed one more paid administrator to work with me (my job description was basically ""do everything"" and by that point knew it wouldn't be sustainable), and I also wanted to get them set up with a more secure and organized constituent database. 

But there continues to be drama that bogs it down every month. After realizing nothing had really moved for 8 months, some board members felt we were running short on time to execute a quality second event (and this was crucial, as sponsors were not happy with event #1 and said event #2 would have to be much better for them to continue giving their support). But that had to be argued about for a month.

The latest drama has surrounded shoring up the development work to be a lot more diligent and structured. Truthfully, all subcommittees have been asked to work (with me) on getting their processes and structures down on paper, and I've been putting in work building out a Gantt chart for myself and the org of all the different pieces that need to be completed in the next 3 months for us to stay on track. 

The development subcommittee chair has been particularly resistant and will not collaborate with me or anyone else. It came to a head a couple weeks ago, and I felt caught in the middle. My board chair bosses aren't particularly engaged and I just feel like I'm out in the wilderness, trying so hard to establish professional processes, but hitting wall after wall and getting ignored repeatedly. When I expressed in an email to them and some other key board members that things were not aligning well with the development subcommittee and I really need them to step in to help resolve it - it took them A WEEK to get back to me. They did agree to hold a meeting with the key players this week, but I talked to my old boss before the meeting to tell them I was not really happy with how this was going.

Not going to lie, the meeting was rough. The org chairs did put their foot down in terms of what needs to happen next with development, which helps me keep moving forward, but I know this development chair is still mad about it all - and truly, I have a feeling they are going to be nasty to me now because of it.

All that to say - after a couple days this week of thinking I just need to be stronger and lay the law down more explicitly with this org - I think I need to go. My feeling is there is just too much drama and toxicity with this group. They say they want to be professional and want a project manager to keep them on track, but they push back when I try to put systems in place that would do that. I don't feel any support at all, and I don't want to have to be a total bitch for things to get done. I also don't feel like I can be proud of this work, and the behavior is so unprofessional I don't really want to be associated with it. 

Oh and I should mention I've never had a contract (I'm hired as a contractor). I know, you're probably wondering how that happened. Truthfully, when I started in October, I was dovetailing it over another 6-month gig that was taking up most of my time so it slipped my mind at the time. When it occurred to me in 2023 as I was preparing to give them my full attention, I asked about it and they were like ""oh we didn't have one with our last project manager"" and acted like it was a strange request. I did explain that we should have *something* in writing but haven't been able to nail that down and it irks me. 

I just don't want to be in a job that makes me fight all the time and overanalyze every single interaction. My time and expertise are worth so much more, and I deserve to work with people that appreciate it. 

I have a feeling I know where this will go, but curious, have any of you dealt with jobs that ended up not being what you thought and needing to leave fairly soon after starting?"

Each question is answered with 200 words max.

**Why are you interested in applying for this position?**

I am interested in applying for this position because online businesses are what I tend to do well at. Businessmen tend to look for business-related jobs.

This is the only social media manager job that does not require a bachelor’s degree or years of experience. 

One of the classes I took at x College was a hybrid class, which matches because this is hybrid as well. 

I appreciate the unique hiring process where questions are along the resume, so I do not have to put my personality into the resume.

I want to learn how to become a better businessman.

**What's your favourite social media platform and why?**

Since learning that it is better to concentrate on one business, and that products tend to sell better than services, I have stuck with Youtube. This social media platform is also the one I have had the most success with, but I cannot get monetized now because the monetization requirements are way too high. I have also had success with Instagram and have 500 followers.

**How do you think x could improve its social reach?** 

Your recent videos and even shorts have a lack of views. There are plenty of grammar errors. The Instagram videos could be across the middle.

**What do you think we're currently doing well at in terms of our social content?** 

Your following on each platform is high.

**Our 3 values are heart, hustle and humility, what do these words mean to you?** 

I see that it includes alliteration. Like a poem, it means a lot more but is just summarized. A heart means empathy and passion. This job likely is fun. Hustle means to work hard. Humility means to be humble. Advertising includes a lot of poetry, so the person who made those values is likely an advertiser.

I think my answers are way too short, especially for question 4. I also don't think it's very concise."

I’ve worked in a role for nearly a year now, but it just doesn’t suite me and my skill-set. The pressure from the job has gotten more and more, and as a result I have been asked to resign instead of being dismissed under capability. So it won’t go on my record or references as it’d just say I have resigned. 

So now I’m on Gardening leave for 4 weeks until my notice period is over. However there is another job for the same company that is much better suited to my skills and I have a good chance of getting it. However I’m worried that if I got the job they’d ask why I’m on Gardening leave for my current role, as obviously when they ask my notice period I’d have to tell them I’m already going through it. 

What would I say to my potential new boss, without making myself look bad? My old job just wasn’t for me anymore, they acknowledged I always gave it 100% - not for a bad reason.

4,2023-03-24,"Just got promoted from supervisor ($12/hr) to assistant manager, but they offered me $1.50/hr less than the man who worked it before me. I'm female. They offered $14 and he made $15.50",u/-LoveThyself,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12100ew/just_got_promoted_from_supervisor_12hr_to/,jobs,"
I got this job in October. I was hired as a supervisor - it's a foodservice company.  At the time of my hire, this gentleman had been working there for about 3-4 months.  He was hired at $15.50 and stayed at that pay until he quit last week. So he only lasted maybe 10 months with the company.

I've since had interviews for his job, and today they offered me the position, but only at $14 an hour.

Mind you, where I live $12 is the absolute bare bones minimum pay for a foodservice supervisor, with the average being between $15 and $19 an hour.  I do receive tips at this place (both supervisors and assistant managers get tips, as well as team members.  I'm very aware that they are supplementing a lot of our wage for tips.  We usually get enough to equal $3/hr)

It's such a slap in the face - especially because this man that was the AM before me was absolutely lazy and did not care about his job.  He would sit in the back and let his team members and I close the store while he was on his phone.  It's common knowledge throughout the company that this guy was irresponsible and ignorant.  If he hadn't quit when he did, our general manager was going to cut back his hours and/or fire him, because he wasn't even ordering items that the store can't function without.

On the opposite side of the coin, the corporate office as well as my direct manager know I have been and will continue to fulfill all the requirements of the job and go above and beyond consistently because that's just what I do.  I even do more actual work than the other assistant manager in our store, and she makes $15.50/hr too (she was hired at $15 but got a raise last week because I was going to be promoted).

Anyway, if you were me, would you reach out to corporate and ask for more?  How can I go about this without giving away that we shared pay information?"

I did an interview 2 days ago and have been thinking about a  mistake I made. When asked what type of shipping classes we used, I  mistakenly said class A and B instead of giving the codes for the actual  product. Technically we did use class a, b, in-terms of the size of the  trucks lol, but I realize that's not what they were asking. The times I did  have to fill out BOL's or shipping documents we just used a guide, so it def wasn't something that I remembered off the top of my head. Mostly our freight carrier filled those out. I did admit that it was a good  question and that I don't recall clearly, but I had filled them out. The  job isn't purely logistics, but involves it. They didn't follow up on that  question so i'm assuming I blew based on that alone."

As soon as i finished my course I landed a job in the produce Industry, (totally unrelated to my course). Frankly I could have done this job after high school. But the perks are good, the work load is low, no stress whatsoever. 
I have been applying for a field job but we all know how messed up the market is. Now, an interesting thing happens, i get a job offer in my field but it is totally for unskilled workers. Good thing would be that I can get into my own field of interest and maybe (MAYBE!) get an opportunity to grow within the company. But the job is a physical laborious - lifting weight, standing for hours. 
Also, the company(i got the offer from)  deals with Automotive parts and we all know that recession is here, there is a chance that the company may layoff employees. 
I am confused if I should leave my desk job just to get into the industry with a hope to land a field job.

But... my manager doesn't seem to see it that way. His pride and ego gets hurt, and gets stressed out when I mention these things. I know this because sometime right after these conversations, he'll go to office cupboard to grab an Advil. I feel conflicted.

How do I provide feedback to management or my opinion without making it sound like I am criticizing their job performance? I don't know if it is because of the choice of words communication. Or, if it just my manager's personal issue and I shouldn't overthink it. I guess I kind of expect management/authority figures to be more openminded to hearing all feedback from subordinates. I mean, how else are we suppose to grow and be better at our jobs, if we don't get input about our work quality? (Note: my boss has never given me a job performance review. I've been with the company for 5 years now)

Edit:

As requested, the most recent interaction with manager (I work in property management):

My manager and I checked one of the empty units in our building. This particular unit has one of those large rectangular building vents in the corner of the unit going through the unit from the floor to the next upper floor. Instead of being behind the enclosing walls, it was installed in the corner, taking up floor space. Next, I assume dry wall was use to cover up the vent, because the vent noise was echoing significantly throughout the entire unit. (Interested tenants have mentioned the noise). Onto the conversation. I asked my manager if the vent's enclosing walls had any soundproof installed when the walls were constructed. He pauses and then says no. Then he appeared to be speaking out loud to himself saying things like maybe it could be done, but not sure if it will work. And then I said okay. No other comments were made after that. Then a couple minutes later, he goes and grabs an Advil from the office cupboard.

I don't want to assume what thoughts are going through his mind. But I think he realizes that he screwed up the construction project, and now its causing him a headache. 

For me, I would just think. Okay, so the project was done incorrectly. Then we fix the issue. Problems happen, there will always be unexpected costs. But I get the feeling he gets stressed out at every problem, when literally our job is to solve problems..."

It's a combination of senioritis, having no incentive to hide my resentment towards my coworkers anymore, and guilt trips from my coworkers for leaving.

I can't complete a single task throughout the day without my phone ringing off the hook. It's always someone screaming about some fire that needs to be put out. I have no motivation to pretend to care.

For a long time I've felt resentful that I always take care of my coworkers' clients if it's something I can just take care of while I have them on the phone, but my coworkers never return the favor. They just cold transfer people to me or put them in my voicemail. I'm talking about things that would take two seconds to look up. But they put them into my voicemail.

I've started doing the same thing because I can't be bothered anymore, but they're being butthurt about it. Now they see how annoying it is.

They're all talking loudly lamenting how they're going to split up my work. My supervisor was going on and on about how she's going to start coming in on Saturdays. I'm just sitting there trying not to roll my eyes.

My new job is an internal transfer, so it's not like I can just walk out and completely burn this bridge.

I'm just OVER IT! I thought having a light at the end of the tunnel would help, but my job has only become more unbearable.

I’ve talked to lawyers about this as I was a victim of domestic violence, and that’s why I suffered in my job and I just got back to work two weeks ago after being on medical leave and I had a meeting with my manager had an end of the week wrapup and he brought HR on unexpectedly, and they told me that my performance this past year has been unsatisfactory and I can take a PIP where if I don’t meet the requirements in 30 days I’m fired or I can take a separation package which would be 6 weeks of pay. They also told me I have to decide on Monday and if I take the separation package on Monday that my last day will be that day. I emailed HR earlier and told them that I have the right to review the package with a lawyer and I will not sign anything under duress and I need more time because they gave me no warning.

I also told them I haven’t been there a year because I was on medical leave for months and I have a documented disability so that’s an unfair evaluation and I just got back a couple weeks ago and I was not aware that I was going into a performance review. I got no warning, and when I was there for months before I went on leave I was never put on a PIP or even had that mentioned. I have spoke to lawyers, some say I may have a case esp with domestic violence discrimination, I’m not sure. My manager and HR did tell me that outside stuff shouldn’t have affected my performance the outside stuff being my assault I experienced and since they know about me being a victim domestic violence as it was reported to them and they have the police record, I would say it’s understandable that being a victim of domestic violence will hurt me and my male manager is an asshole and shook his head when I was saying that. So messed up. 

So I spoke to lawyers, and they said I have a lot of leverage as I didn’t get a warning before, I literally just got back to work, there’s a paper trail of HR not helping me, the pip is only 30 days, they also didn’t pay me on time initially when I was on disability and there’s a paper trail of that. Also, lawyers did say the time is suspect, and they clearly want me out. I’m not sure if it’ll hold up in court. Unfortunately, the law is in favor of the employers. It’s a really sad situation, but I did get told by a lawyer that I could negotiate my separation package at least and maybe make it four months instead of six weeks or something especially because of potential domestic violence discrimination.

What I’m wondering is could I qualify for unemployment after payments if I do negotiate the separation package and leave or will I not? Is it better to take a separation package or be put on a PIP and then fired? Like the law firms told me they’ll fire me no matter what they want me out lol. It’s a really sad situation but I want to do what’s best for me because I live in nyc which is expensive. And sadly I don’t have family or anyone to fall back on and no savings and I’m in my 20s and I got to be able to afford to live before I get a new job you know?  Since I haven’t hired a lawyer yet and they’re super busy I would love some more advice if anyone has anything! 

It’s a really sad situation and I would love justice, but I know that the law will probably not be on my side so I wanna do what’s best for me and I would really love to move on."

* ability to travel and work remotely (went out of country and worked from there for a month) **(MAJOR UPSIDE)**
* decent salary (120k)
* hybrid (but can stay home if I want to. Very flexible)
* great boss
* annual salary increase + bonus

Cons:

* No room to grow **(MAJOR DOWSIDE)**
* No promotion
* No new challenges or opportunity to learn new things
* Bad culture (cool boss but I do consider some of my coworkers toxic)
* unhappy

Could be a pro or con

* only work probably 2-3 hours. 4 hours max

I'm in a pretty niche industry. Let's say I'm in the restaurant business, I have been working as a chef along with other chefs in a pretty big restaurant group. We all have our sous chefs and direct reports. Most of the heavy liftings are done by them. We get paid for our expertise, in a way. I'm good at what I do and get things done quick. I have been wanting to do more in the industry and learn to do the business part of the industry. The fact that I only work 2-3 hours a day bores me, I'm not gaining any new knowledge. I can't ask for a promotion because I haven't done anything above and beyond outside of my primary responsibilities. I'm not allowed to work/touch management stuff or other chef's orders. 

I have looked and interviewed for similiar position at other places, most of them pay 10-40k less and those places require 5X days a week in the office or hard/non negotiable in office days.

I have tried applying for non-chef positions in my industry but of course, they require experience and my background does not match they say.

I love this industry and want to grow and be at the top but i know if I stay here, I won't go anywhere. The only option I can thing of is to move to other places, take a paycut and hope I can do more over there. It's risky but I'm not sure what else to do."

Right now, I can help how the next two weeks left are spent with job applications, but if anyone has any genius cover letter tips I'd love to hear them!

It's the cover letters that I struggle with. I used to write them with ease, now I can't seem to finish one goddamn letter. I will spend two days writing one, decide the entire thing is a lost cause and panic, move on immediately to writing a fresh new one, rinse and repeat. If every cover letter is an opportunity to land an interview then it's something I do not want to mess up. I am applying for retail assistant and/or receptionist positions, specifically.

I often end up writing an essay on what I used to do at my previous job, and not what I'm *good* at. I struggle to explain what I'm actually good at, as they relate to my work history. Mostly because, I completed a day's work at my previous job on auto-pilot. And whenever I do mention what I'm good at, and try to support it with past experiences or vice versa, it always feels unrelated to what I'm actually saying.

Here is one example of what I'm writing, and why I feel it's wrong:

""In my previous position, I was the first point of contact for internal and public customers, and would answer over 20+ phone calls a day, greet customers in store, and order new supplies to replenish our stock inventory every week.""

Too many buzz words? I guess that's where I feel like it's wrong. I looked up too many cover letter templates/examples and now I feel like I'm imitating or loosely paraphrasing Google templates, but none of it sounds like *me.*

Does anyone else know how to get over this writer's block, which actually seems to be writing for me? Thanks in advance!"

I’m a 27 year old man and I’ve been in the UBC (NJ) since 2015, I’m an architectural woodworker and I do installs on occasion. I also took a year off from the shop to work in the field doing interior system work, trim, sheetrock, etc. I’m back working in the shop, the work is much steadier as opposed to being a field carpenter and job security is a top priority for me. 

The company I work for won’t be around till my retirement and I have no interest in working for another shop. Also, top rate in the mill cabinet local is pretty mediocre. With our new contract, we’ll be bumped up to $37/hr by 2027. This is why I’m looking for a career change.

This is how I landed on working for the Port Authority of NY NJ. I’m sure they’ll still be here by the time I hit the age of retirement, the benefits are just as good as I get through the UBC, the starting pay ($33.64/hr) is more than I make now as a journeyman, and there’s a lot of opportunity to move up the corporate ladder. I applied for a “station trainee” position. I would be working in Jersey City doing maintenance at the stations and tunnels. I had a brief phone interview and have my exam scheduled for nine days from today.

My question is, does anyone here work for the Port Authority, in maintenance or something close to it? How do you like it, what are your shifts/hours like? How does the money compare to when you first started? Are layoffs/furloughs common? What is the work culture like? 

I really enjoy my job now, and I like the people I work with for the most part. My foreman is cool and doesn’t crack the whip, they’re not very strict at my shop at all and pretty lenient when it comes to pretty much anything. I get to listen to my podcasts and work on whatever I’m working on in peace. My commute is also less than 10 minutes and I don’t hit a single highway. But there’s no way I can survive in Jersey on my current salary. Thinking about my future, I won’t be able to support a family on my current salary. I need to make a change, and I’m excited about the idea of working for the Port Authority!! So please, I’d like to hear about your experience working at the Port Authority, thanks."

I hold one offer and have an interview scheduled for next Monday.

Here's the deal: I am in HK but have plans to work in Canada before March next year. The duration of my stay is undetermined but would be at least one year to fulfill some requirements. Actually, I still haven't been even issued a visa (the application is still processing, though it's pretty much at the very last stage), so technically I can't even say anything with surety...

I currently hold an offer with **Company A**. They know nothing about my plans for Canada. It is an international company but according to its website, it does not have a Canadian office. However, I do see on LinkedIn that there are people from company A working in Canada. I am having a call with the hiring manager next week to clarify some questions I have about the offer. Should I bring up my plans and ask about the possibility of relocation during the call? Is there a chance that they'd reconsider or rescind their offer to me?

I have an interview upcoming Monday with **Company B.** It is more international and according to their website, they do have an office in Canada. I read one employer's story that the company has been very flexible and supportive in her past 3 relocations within her career so I feel hopeful. Should I ask about the possibility of relocation during the interview? Would this lower my chances of getting an offer?

I'm not even asking for a relocation package because it is me who wants to be relocated. (or should I still expect one?) All I hope for is that they'd be able to *provide employment* in Canada -- that way I have one less thing to worry about. Worst-case scenario, I'd just quit and seek alternative employment in a new company in Canada, but it might not look so good on my resume. Also, if the new job turns out to be a good fit, I'd definitely want to keep it.

I just feel like an employer would appreciate it if the employee is transparent and honest from the onset. My main concern is that mentions of my unconfirmed plans would lower my chances of employment, which is NOT something I want since I desperately want to leave my current soul-sizzling job. 

**OR** \-- given my priorities, is it wiser to keep my mouth shut now and work at my new job till it's closer to 2024, discuss relocation possibilities only then or directly seek employment in Canada where a relocation package is offered? Any advice is appreciated!

Note that I'm junior in the work field and the positions for both companies do not require specialized skills.

**TL;DR:** I plan to move to Canada (temporary or not) early next year and gain at least one year of employment there. I currently hold an offer with company A but they do not know my plans for Canada. I have an upcoming interview with Company B. Both companies have international offices. Should I ask casually about the possibility of relocation while discussing with Company A about the offer and during the interview with Company B?

Thanks in advance!"

It was generally believed by everyone in my team including my manager that not rehiring me was NOT the move as it just increased everyone's work load whilst having to train staff overseas. I had the vibe everyone was unhappy they were not making my contract permanent.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been 3 months since I left the company. I haven't found new employment yet as I am currently recovering from some health issues which was diagnosed earlier this year (but recovering now that I am medicated). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply? I am not sure how to go about it. Should I drop my bosses' boss (my manager has since left the company as well) an email showing interest in reapplying?

I'm 20 years old, turning 21 this year. Have always held a casual job since I was 14 and 9 months. Graduating highschool was on the easier side for me, I really enjoyed my highschool years and finished with a 75 ATAR. This year I was supposed to start Uni for secondary school teaching, I chose it because I am and can be a leader and it seemed like a safe job for the future which I may enjoy. Well after attending my pre course requirements I decided to not go just before I had to pay tuition fees. This is because waking up to study the course I felt anxious and I didn't have any passion or drive to study it. I admit looking back I was never excited for the course and I guess I only wanted to go so I could tell my peers ""yea I'm at Uni"". I mean my main was Art because I'm really into video production, Digital Media, but my minor was outdoor education and I don't even like camping or kayaking. 

Now I'm at a point where I'm not sure whether to put my head down and study something useful or just get a full time job and let life play out. As for me I have a car, I go to the gym, I don't have anything stopping me from doing something I like. Other than maybe I'm not smart enough. If you were in my position at age 20, what would you do. I would not like to travel at this stage. I have a great friend group and I pride myself on taking care of my mental health. The only thing holding me down which is unhealthy is that my biggest fear is not being successful. I don't mean rich I just mean enough to move out one day. I believe this is because I cruised through all my schooling and thought I'd just walk into a decent paying job straight out of school. Very naive. I currently get payed $35 to do nightfilling at a grocery store, but because it's casual I don't get many hours. I still live at home and I'm in a  very fortunate position where I do not pay rent. 

I have had a great upbringing and have so many resources and a supportive family to do whatever I like. To be honest I just wanted some opinions from people who may have been in my situation. I'm not in a hurry to be successful, I just feel like I need to do something with my life now."

I'm not expected to do OT and I can just work M to F from 8:30 to 5. I've been here nine months, and I'm noticing my coworkers and boss are steadily piling more and more on me.

I work hard early on in the week to get my stuff done, and my coworkers are behind (or so they claim), yet I've seen that they spend a lot of time talking to each other in chats and skype calls, and I think a lot of their time spent isn't really working. I'm a day behind at most, and they're sometimes three or four days behind. I've also covered for them while they took vacation, and I managed my work load plus theirs, so I know they aren't doing that much.

 I also have another co-worker who was told he has to do certain tasks, and he's refused to do them for four months now. I asked my manager about this and he said, ""It's being worked on. We will either fire him or make sure he does the work, but we have to wait longer before firing him."" So four months of not doing your job is not enough to be fired, I guess.

Now I'm noticing that every few weeks they're asking me to take on a task of theirs. It's things that ""just take a couple minutes"", but they keep adding more and more, and it's really aggravating. I don't mind doing extra work, but my pay isn't increasing with each additional task.

Am I in the wrong for thinking this is ridiculous? One co-worker does nothing, and the others say how stressed and busy they are but I know that's not true. I don't mind helping out, but I am tired of doing extra work for people who don't need the help."

I did that, but then a few days later I got a reply saying the position I applied for was filled. The owner of the email said that instead, based on my resume, they’d like to interview me to be their personal assistant.

They claim that there is a fixed pay of $1,250/week and that I’d be paid every two weeks. Job duties include: 
*Working on documents in Microsoft Word.
*Scheduling programs and flights for the person who sent the email.
*Answering phone calls on their behalf while they’re away.
*Donating to charity on their behalf. 

They claim that “working with me is basically about instructions and following them,” and that I wouldn’t need to leave my current job to work for them. They also claim to be a 73-year-old who’s on the board of directors for “several companies and other charity foundations.” They also say they’re currently in Toronto meeting with “partners” and will be able to formally interview me in two weeks when they return.

The email account is a basically Outlook account, and the sender’s signature is just their name and a disclaimer saying not to copy any part of the email and share it. My gut is telling me this is a scam, but I’m also a broke bitch who’s desperate for a job that pays more than $23k/year. I want another perspective to make sure I’m not just being overly skeptical."

I work at a hospital part-time in the imaging department as an aide, I’m trying to get into X-Ray school so it’s a really great position to get some experience. Problem is, this hospital is bleeding employees badly. It’s very overworked and understaffed, managed poorly, and run down. Since I started working here in October 5 or 6 people in the imaging department alone have left for other jobs. I work every Sunday and every other Saturday since we’re usually most understaffed those days and they’re a little less hectic, plus some weekdays. In all I probably work around 28-36 hours a week depending.

One of my fellow imaging dept. aides who typically works every Saturday just put his two weeks in, and I noticed on the schedule that I’m now on for both every Saturday and Sunday, which I didn’t agree to. I’m only part time and every full weekend is a lot for me, I work 2 days during the week on top of going to school for prerequisites for the X-Ray program. 

I feel like it’s not my job to pick up the slack for my coworker who’s leaving, especially since they didn’t ask me if that was okay? Just put me on for those days. This has happened by mistake before and I just wrote my real hours in (as most people do if there’s a scheduling error) but this time it seems like my supervisor just added those days on to make up for my coworker leaving. This isn’t my responsibility, right? Should I raise this with my boss? The hours I work already are hard to juggle with school and I was thinking of cutting back before we got this new schedule.

TL;DR I’m a part-time employee and student, my boss added me on for every Saturday without talking to me to make up for a coworker leaving. Can I push back against this? I feel overworked with this and school already."

i want to take the job since it’s the only offer i got after a month of applying to jobs. i need the money. however the job is a bit far and in a secluded place. if i get offered a job that’s closer to me i would take it and leave this one. even if it’s after a few days. i want to take this job because what if i don’t get any offers for months? i can’t take that risk.

however i’m scared now because all the emphasis the manager put on it. i mean legally speaking i can quit at any time right? i don’t have a contract. the most that can happen is the manager gets mad? or should i not do it? is it wrong to deceive him?"

My name is Matt, and I recently have gotten laid off as a part of the whole tech layoff trend.

The job search process is brutal. Applying to jobs in itself is a huge time sink, and I found myself stretched for time, applying to jobs while prepping for and participating in interviews 

Here are a couple of my gripes with the job application process:

1. A significant number of jobs in my job board don't relate to my skillsets
2. A lot of jobs posted by 3rd party recruiters, where they promote a job where they have no relationship with the hiring manager whatsoever -- essentially serving as a middle man, all the while pinging your phone to set up a fruitless call

I've wasted hours dealing with this. Linkedin's filtering system can only do so much, and there seems to be no solution for this major inconvenience.

\-----

I spent the past month working on a chrome extension that alleviates the aforementioned problems.

I called it **Job Sifter**

It's your LinkedIn buddy that does extra filtering based on what you don't want to see.

As someone who's been applying to jobs, I found the tool I created to be very useful for my job search as I can spend less time applying to jobs and more time interview prepping and living life.

Either the job requires certain experience or the hours don’t suit me or I just straight up get no response from the employer. Is this usually how job searching goes?

1,2023-03-25,Question about offer letter,u/ChristelLite,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/121um4w/question_about_offer_letter/,jobs,"So I'm worried I got myself in a pickle. I was offered a job via email and sent an offer letter but I ended up declining the offer in the email. The recruiter kept trying to email and call/text me to change my mind. My sister recommended looking at the offer letter (hosted on a third party website for digital signatures) to decline the letter there in hopes of making my decline more formal. Website mentioned an ability to decline but I couldn't find it beyond a vague ""please sign or decline offer letter to view other documents"" despite there being no listed option to decline. I started to fill my electronic signature (a mistake I know now) to see if that was needed to move on, had a bad feeling about it, and decided to close the document via the ""cancel/do not save signature"" rather than just closing it. Even had to confirm that yes, I wanted to close without signing. But I don't know what went wrong, as now its showing on the onboarding website that its signed with the dates auto filled and more documents to sign (which I'm not even opening).

I already sent an email to the recruiter apologizing for the mistake and that yes, my intent is still to decline and I've already accepted a different job offer. Obviously, lesson learned was just to keep ignoring recruiters rather opening any documents. But I'm stressing that I fucked myself by technically signing the offer letter. I'm in CA if that matters."
2,2023-03-25,Landed a top-notch job despite having average academic qualifications. How do I build up my confidence?,u/poreo2k19,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/121vdoq/landed_a_topnotch_job_despite_having_average/,jobs,"As a primary student I used to be academically brilliant and a regular class topper. Once I started secondary though, laziness and distractions got the better of me and my O &amp; A levels were average. Tertiary was no different, I enrolled for a bachelor's degree but left university with a diploma because I never completed my dissertation. 

However, career-wise, I would say I have been very lucky. As soon as I finished university in 2018, I was employed by one of the largest MNCs in the FMCG industry where both the position and the salary was very good for a fresh graduate. 3 years later, I was offered and accepted a really good position with another MNC (rated Top Employer for 4 consecutive years). The salary and benefits offered was much more than the national average for that position. The reason for me obtaining the job was the experience gained at my previous company as well as the very good recommendation letters provided by my former managers.

2 months ago there was a vacancy at our affiliate in another country and I applied for the position. Given that the requirements were quite high, I didn't really expect to be considered. However, the fact that I deal closely with this affiliate, I was actually prioritized for this position and was offered the job within one week of applying (considered as an amazing promotion within my current entity). Although initially this was a moment of huge excitement, going through the LinkedIn profiles of my future colleagues, I've been feeling quite inferior because they're all people who have graduated with distinctions and have more than a bachelor's degree. Some of them were even offered more than 1 scholarship. 

As an employee, I have always been dedicated to my job, worked with integrity and considered as someone valuable wherever I have been. However, as the date for me to start my new job is approaching, I have started casting doubt upon myself due to the fact that I'll be working with highly qualified people while my highest qualification is just a university diploma. 

Appreciate any tips and advice you people have to share."

However the situation is : I suddently, out of absolutely nowhere, got my contract terminated only 2 weeks after my first day. Their reasons being ""I wasnt ready at all for the job, and I seemed stressed out by it, according to the head supervisor"".

However my mentor told me that he only did say in their meetings that I was learning slower than normal (because of my autism, and note that they already knew about that), and all I needed before being switched to evening shifts was like a week more of training, and he said himself that I was starting to understand the job and the systems faster and faster, and I had the potential to become an excellent employee here.

And yes, my former mentor is someone I am willing to trust on those infos, since we enjoyed working with each other and we had a great vibe together.

Also I am pretty decent at identifying my weaknesses, and being severe and honest to myself I would have known exactly why I would get terminated. In this situation however, I was left completely confused by my employer's reason of termination.

All of that to say : since its technically a termination without cause, do I still have the right to claim compensation even though I worked only 2 weeks on contract? The employment is in Quebec.

I know I might not be 100% clear, and Ill gladly try to answer your questions in the best of my capability."

That said, I kind of just asked for the bare minimum the first time around. I now have the opportunity to ask for what I really need—last year I would not admit that I needed space for LOA, for example. It would be really cool if I could get some advice on what accommodations work well for people like me.

So the guy has mentioned before that he doesn’t like that democrats want to “take his guns” which is dumb to me, but I did not think it was enough to worry about, even though I lean more towards the Democratic Party. I brushed it off

Yesterday got really weird though.

Company B also requires I sign a non-compete, as this position is a promotion/higher level role, company B non-compete is 12 months and they would pay 50% of my base salary.

In the job offer from Company B, they did not offer to cover any of my remaining 40% of lost income during this 6 month.

Is it standard for the hiring company to offer to cover the non-compete? I feel that if they want me to sign their non-compete 12 months/50%, they should also be paying my 40%. Am I asking too much? When I changed jobs 7.5 years ago, I was stupid and didn't negotiate enough, I don't want to leave any money on the table this time.

This is my first time dealing with a non-compete, so I just don't know. I'm in Oregon, this non-compete is enforceable.

Other -

Company B - didn't offer a signing bonus or any other items, just a salary in the offer letter. I feel like they are waiting for me to counter on salary and the missing non-compete income."

I worked there for 5.5 years, I wanted to work there for my entire career. But I got covid and it made my chronic health condition much worse. 

The week I got covid, a new manager had just started. Her whole time as my manager, I was having to call in and leave early constantly. I did that for 6 months until i finally took a 10 week leave of absence, and then I had to fully quit. 

I'm not using that manager as my reference (she told me to only use her as a personal reference🚩) 
but I'm using my previous manager, who still works there and literally shares an office with my other manager. So she obviously knows I called in all the time and why I had to quit. But I was a freaking great employee during her years as my manager and hardly ever called in.

If a perspective employer calls my reference (old manager), can she tell them the reason I quit and that I called in a lot/took a leave of absence? Or can she only comment on the time frame when she was my direct manager?

Or, instead of using my references, can a perspective employer just call the company and ask for my most recent manager? And since she asked to be a personal reference and not a professional reference, she can say whatever she wants? 

I just had an interview and it went great, but I didn't get the position. They didn't ask for references, so I'm wondering if they just called the company and talked to my most recent manager?"

The recruiter told me the opening was because they want to test the position out and the person recently left. I see on indeed the company itself has a F/T job position opening.

Monday i have a video interview through the staffing agency with the company. Do i try and convince them about the F/T opportunity listed on indeed/their website? I dont feel comfortable with temp to hire as  i feel like id be open to their lower end range of the job listing. Would that be ethical for me to do on the interview tomorrow?

I'm not even really sure what I want to do yet (basically just finishing my degree so I \*have\* one).

For a few months now, I've been working for a Costco near me. In terms of retail, at least around here, I'd say you can't get a better job. They've been flexible with my schedule and I appreciate it, but I'm always keeping an eye open for better opportunities. And I'm probably not going to find many others. Right now, I get $17.50/hr which is the base rate for all new employees of my level in the warehouse. Most of everything around here pays closer to $10/hr because it's almost all retail or fast food that you'd see high schoolers doing. So unless you become an RN or want to work in an industrial warehouse, you're going to be making low wages.

But that's all to my knowledge. Maybe there's some sorts of jobs I'm overlooking? I really want to get out of the retail and food service environments. I suppose though that retail wouldn't bother me if it were a more relaxed location, like a bookstore, but despite what Indeed says, I do not think stockers at Barnes &amp; Noble are being paid over $18/hr on average.

I would say generally that I can't afford to have a job with less pay, but then again, after I graduate, I can actually work full-time, so it would balance itself out. At this point if it could get me out of food service and potentially retail with decent pay, then I'd seriously consider it."

I work part time as a freelancer in the field and have an unrelated backup work to cover financing gaps.

I live alone, no help from anyone, parents were not helping since I was 17 I’m 25 now. I have a really difficult past where I was severely abused and studying was my best career option. 

The internships (40hs a week) where I live are by law regulated to a maximum of 390€ per month (for at least 6 months twice), which if that’s the case I can’t even pay half of my shared house room. and would be basically accepting to underpay and under perform from the market.

If I go on internship alone, it leaves 0 time to have a part time job to live, and will still accept underpaying and taking lower level. Assuming after that I have to go with a starters job which is again below. 

Therefore, would need a possible employer to extend the duration to reduce the weekly hours, and offer a part time job next to it. Other option in mind, if it would be straightaway full time in my level, I would need to ask them to let me work 16-20hs instead of 36hs until I finish university except during the internship timeframes. And convince them to sign the bureaucracy paperwork which they are not willing to as they see it as a different position and not a competency checklist. Then I still likely get rejected right away because I don’t have a bachelor degree (yet). Both ideas somewhat unrealistic. ?

I have noticed obviously every employer wants me for internship, and quite demand for full time too. BUT are not willing to consider offering a part time job next to it, often without realizing I could still be an valuable asset if they would discuss it with the hiring manager.

It’s quite frustrating because then I get two other reactions from them: why are you so young and weird questions about being young with experience, or hinting towards that I’m underpaying myself and therefore they’ll make obviously use of that. 

I took the bachelor so I could have a higher position in future and I’m also afraid I will have to start from scratch just like if I had 0 experience. This is so frustrating.

 Any better ideas to approach this? Should I maybe just apply for full time jobs and then explain? I’m lost and starting to get demotivated

TLDR: have previous experience in the field and have 2 internships to do for university. I need at least a part time job next to the internship to be able to live (emancipation, past abuse). Accepting internship means greatly underpaying and perform tasks way below “level”. Any better solution I could instead offer to an employer? Should I just apply for full time and then see for them to arrange the hours and internship paperwork?"

It is taking a slight step back, but they are willing to cross train me and support where I want to move up to - lots of growth potential. Vacation and sick time suck though - 3 days sick and 5 vacation that I can’t touch for a year.

Job B is 100% in office, but is a 12 minute drive. It’s closer to what I’ve wanted to be doing, but pays $4/hour less than job A. Sick and vacation time are better - 5 days sick and 8 days vacation. Not sure how much growth potential there is.

Both have 401k and similar health benefits.

Hi, im currently on a gap year after doing a levels and work part time. When initially starting the job in September last year, i said that i would be looking to work until i leave for university.

However, i have decided to leave early to take up a different job working for a family member. How do you think my manager would react to this. My contract states that my notice period is only one week and im on a zero hours contract so i have no obligation to work. 

I’m also the only person that works in that specific part of the business so they would have to quickly hire someone to fill my space.

Should I feel bad for leaving???

I’m just worried I’m going to get a bad reaction from my manager.

Any advice and opinions would be appreciated. Thanks."

She has no degree or experience beyond waitressing or “running” a local ice cream shop (closing down the store at night).

She’s extremely personable. And I think if she can get her foot in the door somewhere she’ll be able to grow and be promoted internally.

My question is what kind of position do you think I should help her get? What field or position would be easiest to get into given her experience?


EDIT: people… I’m not looking for parenting advice here. It’s a very simple question on skill transferability and ease of career break in. If it helps you from getting the uncontrollable need to impart unsolicited parenting advice, pretend like I’m asking for myself (I’m the waiter looking for a 9-5). Thank you to those who actually are answering the question.

EDIT 2: there seems to be some misunderstanding of the word “help”. For some reason people are immediately going to the extreme and thinking I’m going to be calling employers or even showing up to interviews. That’s ridiculous. My daughter lives on her own and financially supports herself. She has just expressed an interest in a different career path and I want to be there to help her when or if she asks for it. I’ll be there to strategize and talk things through. Things are hard enough out there. If I can mentor her through that transition I will. And I hope you all have people in your life that would do the same."

If you work the typical 9-5 Monday to Friday, how do you guys manage to get appointments and business stuff done or anything that comes up like a car repair, or something that needs attention. I've noticed some employers I've worked for in the past are strict on not taking days off and such, and frown up on if you need too. Seems to be be all or nothing, and lose your job or get attacked for it. But if you know your car needs a repair and they won't give you a day off to get the work done for example how do you handle it. Quit? Call in sick? That makes it seem obvious. Same goes for anything like a doctor's appointment, etc. Just curious on thoughts.

I was just contacted today by a hiring manager and I am going to have a job interview in 3 days (Wednesday 29 March). Previously, I have a job that I left last year in March 2022 and a clinical placement that I completed just short of a month ago.

My question is - should I contact the managers of my previous job and my placement asking them if they would be comfortable providing a reference for me before I even attend the interview? I put “reference available upon request” on my resume but I’m not quite sure how that works because of my limited job experiences.

Do I text my previous managers first asking for their consent to provide their contacts to my interviewer if asked during the interview, or do I attend the interview first, and if they ask for a reference, I would then contact my previous managers and get back to my interviewer after I get a reply back from my old managers?

Just a bit of background: I was unemployed for about 6 months. Put in hundreds of applications, many with very long response/turnaround times. Many rejections, few acceptances. I finally obtained employment and begin this week, but I have to say that I am anxious as heck. The months-long battle with anxiety, depression, being poor (no active income outside of support from mom), isolation (due to not going out much, and living alone away from family) has been so taxing on my body, mind, and my spirit. I am super grateful that I will finally be doing meaningful work and actively earning a solid income. But, I am also super nervous and have physical symptoms of being in that tough patch for all those months: shakiness when writing/typing, a bit of anxiety over being social again, slight imposter syndrome, among other things. I know I will do well, but there's something about NOT having a job for so long and finally earning it, that feels... heavy. I think unemployment burnout is REAL. Have you ever felt like this?"

The job I'm currently at is my first grown up one after graduating and I've been here for nearly one year. I liked it, it wasn't a job I'd like to stay at forever but it's good enough for a few years until I save enough money for my masters degree.

I'm close to like three people but friendly with the rest of the team and I'm okay with it, but I've been noticing the manager is actively trying to exclude me. It was her birthday last week and the rest of the team talked about getting her a surprise birthday gift and I was okay with it, even though it was way over my budget (especially because she won't acknowledge my existence), and then they went out to celebrate during lunch and didn't invite me. She even sent a text on the group chat asking another girl who I know she doesn't like to come and left me out.

I've started to look for new jobs but I'm worried because like I said, this is my first full time job and I'm scared it's gonna look bad on my resume to leave after like eight months, and thinking about possible interviews, what excuse do you think is good enough for the HR in case I go on another interview? I've thought about ""company's culture and values didn't align with mine"" but I'm scared it's gonna sound like I'm the problem.

Just need a space to write and vent. After ten years in the nonprofit world, I’m finally out. It is a bitter sweet moment. I’ve always been passionate about the work I do. It’s part of who I am. 

I’ve given my all. And in doing so have found myself in a very niche and specialized space in the industry. The pay is OK but as most in the non profit world can attest to- we are perennially underpaid. 

I’m finally at my wits end, so 6months ago I decided to begin to test the waters of private sector. Specifically in sales. Last week I was given an offer. Big earning potential, great benefits and a real opportunity to change my financial trajectory. For me and my family (just had my first child). It’s also fully remote: compared to my current 6months of travel.

I feel compelled to do it. To leave the work behind. It’s exciting but I feel guilt and shame for moving on. I feel insecure of how I’ll be viewed by friends and family who always saw me for a passionate individual. Now I’m giving it up. I don’t know if there is anything other than to ask- have you been her before and how did you move on?"
5,2023-03-26,"Love my job but I’ve gotten Multiple promotions and outstanding reviews with barely any financial increase and I have limited options, is there anything I can do?",u/Redbird2992,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/122qxue/love_my_job_but_ive_gotten_multiple_promotions/,jobs,"Hey, everyone. Just hoping for a bit of guidance on how I should handle a situation, any advice is greatly appreciated TL;DR at the bottom. 

Im in the US and started working for a SaaS company 1.5-2 years ago in a technical role. I got lucky because everyone in my role has at least a bachelors but I do not, I was hired mainly due to how well I interviewed and my background using their systems extensively in previous jobs. Since being hired I’ve done amazingly well, outstanding reviews, “promotions”, etc. Additionally I find the work easy and I really like my immediate team a lot. The issue I have is compensation. 

6 months after I was hired 2 of 5 people on my team got promoted and replaced with new hires, they both got 5-10% raises plus another 5-7% for their annual raise and a 5k bonus (I didn’t qualify for annual bonus/raise as I had been there under a year). In February 2022, 2 more left and I was given a “promotion” without a raise for “temporarily” picking up their workload plus my own (it was just me, 2 new hires, and the 2 who now had different roles). Fast forward to October, after failing to find replacements (they said it was due to budget constraints and unqualified applicants) they decided to promote me again instead and have me take on the extra work permanently as “you’ve shown you can handle it and we want to show that we appreciate you.”, my raise for being promoted was 2% with them promising to fight for a larger annual raise to make up for it as “there are raise freezes and we were lucky to even get this approved”. Well, we just got our annual reviews and the company decided it was 3% for everyone “no exceptions” and was based on what you made total over the course of the previous year, most of which was before I got my 2%. They also cut the bonuses by 2/3rds company wide. 

That means after taking on 3 roles, handling 52% of the departments workload since the beginning of 2022 (trackable via our ticketing system) getting 2 promotions and an annual raise I’m making roughly 3.33% more than when I was hired while the 2 “not so new” employees working 1 role got 3% and I’m not sure how to move forward without becoming resentful. 

Tl;dr - working at a SaaS company, Since the beginning of 2022 I’ve been “promoted” twice, received an “annual raise”, and I’ve made it so they can operate with 1/2 of the employees as when I started by handling 52% of my depts workload but my compensation has gone up 3.33% in total compared to 2 others who got 15-17% for promotion + annual last year and 2 newer employees who also got the annual 3% this year. I feel trapped by not having a bachelors when other companies require it for my current role, Im worried Ive made myself indispensable to my team meaning further growth will be almost impossible, but on the flip side this is a decent paying job for no degree, I find the work easy, and I genuinely like my team. So I’m not sure what to do."

I had been working at my previous company for 5 years but a close family member offered me a job at her company. I wasn’t ready to switch jobs but they were very persistent on wanting me to work there.

Long story short, I left my previous job and took this job offer for a better salary but so far I’m not too happy. I’ve already worked there for 2 weeks and I don’t feel like I’m being trained properly and my tasks are a lot harder than I expected. I feel intimidated by the person who’s training me because she doesn’t seem too nice and I already have a feeling I will not get along with her. She’s the type of person who wants you to learn quickly with zero mistakes. And they had promised to take good care of me and offer training which so far I don’t see happening.

I reached out to my previous boss to see if they had found a replacement yet. She said no. Out of frustration, I asked her if I could come back and she said she would get back to me this week (this was on Friday). 
But now I feel like I gave up too easily and I should’ve talked to these people first and expressed that I needed better training. 
I asked my mom for advice and she said to talk to the people at this job first and if my previous manager takes me back to tell her that I want to try out if things get better at the job to give her a final decision. But I don’t know if this will make me look bad, like I’m giving her false hopes and I’m not being serious. But my mom says it will look bad if I leave this job without having a talk with them and expressing my concerns since it’s a family business. My sister in law’s mother is the owner of the company so they will probably be offended if I leave too soon.

I work in a toxic environment where my full time job is trying to quiet fire me.

I got this call from a staffing agency about a opportunity of a temp to hire role.

From my understandings, its just the name to get the person to work hard and when the time nears they just let you go and they repeat the process. The recruiter told me the opening was because they want to test the position out and the person recently left. I see on indeed the company itself has a F/T job position opening.

Monday i have a video interview through the staffing agency with the company. Do i try and convince them about the F/T opportunity listed on indeed/their website? I dont feel comfortable with temp to hire as i feel like id be open to their lower end range of the job listing. Would that be ethical for me to do on the interview tomorrow? Would i be able to convince them to hire me behind the staffing agency that way they dont have to run into the fees they have to pay the services for?

I realized that I was behind the company's standard for productivity by 33% and was rank 15/16. I had already identified the most efficient ways to do the job and came to realize that if I wanted to meet the standard for productivity that I would just have to hustle all the time. I thought to myself that this must be worse than fast food, because in fast food at least you have slower days/times.

As I am still working on finding a career path that would be a good fit for me, I've come to realize painfully that I will have to work a crappy job to afford a career counselor, an eventual move to a big city, and possibly going back to school (I have a B.A. in Music Composition and Production which is basically useless because now I have no desire to work in the music industry.)

Well, it's also true I could go abroad again and teach English since that is what I've done here and there for the past 4 years, but choosing this path always seems to be delaying making a decision as to what to do for a career long term. I'm 31. I can't afford another gap year or sabbatical or whatever you want to call it. I need to figure this stuff out.

**(tl;dr)** Returning to my original question, though, how do you even tolerate working a less-desirable and possibly miserable job when you have no career direction or something you're working toward? To me it seems like rolling a boulder up a hill only for it to come back down again just to be rolled up the hill again like Sisyphus.

I'd appreciate any advice you may be able to provide."

&amp;#x200B;

The first scene of any home makeover show is demo day. They get out a huge sledgehammer and tear the place apart; they whack it to smithereens until it's unrecognizable . This is the scene we are all in right now.

&amp;#x200B;

You're currently in your demo-day scene.

&amp;#x200B;

Job searching is hard. Depression is real. There may be (or have already been) days where you just can't get out of bed. Failure is a part of life. It's also a part of the process. You're not alone in this.

&amp;#x200B;

Get back to the drawing board and see what hacks you can make to create the best ""dream home"" you can create.

&amp;#x200B;

Saying some [prayers](https://21stcenturycatholicevangelization.org/prayers/st-cajetan-prayer/), getting some [fresh air](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491965/), rough-housing with your [pet](https://hr.unm.edu/docs/ehp/mood-boosting-power-of-dogs.pdf), cooking your favorite [meal](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/24/well/eat/comfort-food.html), and allowing yourself to [dream](https://millennial-grind.com/how-to-manifest-a-new-job-in-5-steps/) crazier than you've ever allowed yourself to dream in your life may be a few helpful tips.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have all the answers, but what I do have to share... is hope.

&amp;#x200B;

You are a good person. Good things will happen. Try to believe you deserve good things.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanting a job is the first step. You're not lazy! That's half the battle. I'm not sure what the rest of the steps are, but don't give up.

&amp;#x200B;

***Don't give up!***

&amp;#x200B;

If you're exhausted, step back from the applications from the rest of the day. 15, 30, 100+ applications is a lot of work, even though it can feel like nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell yourself you are worthy of your dream position. The first person you have to convince is yourself, my dear."

I'm currently unemployed. Left my last job due to pretty bad burn out. The last two companies I worked for were terrible toward their employees. I hated seeing hardworking and kind coworkers burning out and leaving and eventually it happened to me too. 

I've been getting offers in my last field due to my experience but I'm trying to transition to a different career instead even if it pays less. Those offers had red flags in the interview. 

One company in a field I like is actually giving me a final round of interview. It's for an entry-level job but it's pretty much a start-up, so I expect it to be pretty messy. 

I've seen people say entry-level employees are more eager to please and companies take advantage of that. My brother hated his first one as well as his second, but now his third job in his field is way better and he's pretty happy.

Was your entry-level job pretty bad? I'm trying to prepare for it mentally. I guess I can't keep waiting for a decent one because my employment gap is getting bigger."

Recently I have been hired for a temporary adjunct position which has yet to begin (as I am awaiting for my paperwork to be processed by HR)(also this temporary job would be for about two months tops, it would by the end of May I believe). However, I am still looking for a full-time job to help me with my career goals. I found a perfect job and I’m applying for it, however they’re asking if I can or cannot commit to the role for two years (which I can) but starting on April 1st. I don’t know how to answer this question. 

The problem is that the adjunct position would potentially require me to be on campus for about an hour and a half (either once or twice a week) early in the morning. I don’t want to miss out on this potential job opportunity because of a temporary job I have now. I also don’t want to give false information promising that I can start on April 1. I don’t know who to ask since I’m doing this on my own, I don’t really have family that can help me since they have no experience in this sort of thing.

Any helpful advice is greatly appreciated

EDIT: Despite accepting the temporary adjunct job can I hypothetically not go through with it if my application goes through and I get an offer? Thank you :))))"

I’m looking to go into consulting or something similar, eventually one day running my own company, as I’m already quite successful for my age and I like to think I’m an intelligent person.

My question is, how should I spend my downtime at work? 

A lot of my job that doesn’t relate to project management is data entry so I’m thinking of looking into JavaScript and stuff to automate some of that. Another thing I’m thinking of doing is doing my own research on starting a business and such but don’t want that on my company PC’s search history incase I get into shit.

My job is also quite malleable. I could 100% justify my time being spent researching JavaScript and stuff as I could claim (not untruthfully) that I’m trying to set stuff up for the office so it automates the paperwork side of things. 

Any advice on any other sort of stuff I could do?"

5,2023-03-26,mid-30s career switch; have questions and seeking guidance about potential jobs &amp; best path forward,u/rswoboda12,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1232viz/mid30s_career_switch_have_questions_and_seeking/,jobs," Hi everyone. Like many here have posted before, I'm in the process of making a career switch and am in search of some guidance on the best path forward. A little background first in order to understand my situation:

I'm in my mid-30s (36 to be precise) and for the last ten years I've worked in the mortgage industry as an underwriter. Because of the quick raising of interest rates throughout the last year I was laid off at the end of of May '22. For the remainder of the year I submitted upwards of 250 job applications and didn't receive so much as a call back on any of them. The industry is known for being incredibly cyclical, which is almost entirely dependent on interest rates, and that's just not something I want to have to deal with for the rest of my life. So I've decided to pursue a switch to the computer industry.

I have a B.S. in Business Administration from 13 years ago and no experience in anything computer/IT related, so I'm starting from scratch. I registered at my local community college in January for an Associates degree in General Studies; Computer Science concentration, which is basically a customizable Comp. Sci. degree. Since I haven't been in school for so long I decided to start off slow and take two classes this semester, Programming 1 and Networking 1. The pro of having a previous bachelors degree is that almost all of my gen. ed. requirements from my previous degree transferred over, so other than a science class I only have to worry about my core courses.

I'm not really sure what job and field I'd like to pursue (reading a few paragraphs about what a particular job entails has never been sufficient for me). My first question is this, is there a consensus on how to determine what field and job would be best suited for me?

Second, being an adult I don't have the luxury of staying at home for several years going to school full-time without an income. After my lease ended last year I had to move back in with my parents because I couldn't afford to live independently without a job. I'm still at home and going to school in person this semester, but I fully intend on getting a full-time job after this semester ends in mid-May so I can live independently again (friction with family, an entirely different matter). This of course means continuing my education online as a part-time student. Are there any computer/IT jobs I could qualify for after having only one semester (two classes) of school under my belt? According to the research I've done myself the only thing it seems I'd be able to get is a help desk role. Is there anything else out there for someone in my position?

I would greatly appreciate any advice/insight anyone would be able to provide.

Thank you"

I just recently got hired with a new job working an overnight shift. From 10pm-615am Sun-Thursday making $22.50/hr. 

The breakdown/Why?
I currently live 1 hour from my job so it’s a two hour commute everyday back and forth. My new job is only 15 min away from my current Job. I plan to sleep in my car during my work weeks. I get a 1 hour break which they are really flexible about and I get a 30 min break for my second job. Also I will have 3 hours of down time after my first job so those will be my nap and dinner times. I will be micro-dosing either Monday or Tuesday once a week and will be utilizing polyphasic sleep. I recently just got out of the military, along with being diagnosed with insomnia I’m use to doing 20 hour days all the time so I have experience surviving off minimal sleep. I will try to avoid coffee and will only use it to get through the last double of the week. My plan is to test my limits and make money. I definitely think it’s manageable and will post everyday and write about my experiences for science and research purposes. P.S I don’t care about sacrificing my social time."

The interview went well and a second interview was scheduled which also went well. Now my husband is being told he needs to do a third interview and if that goes well they will fly him out to meet the team in person. So basically an unofficial fourth interview. Is this a normal interview process for this level of job? Based on the job description my husband is more than qualified for the job. Also they have not mentioned when he will get an offer or denial. It's really disheartening that we spent days practicing for these interviews to have no offer or denial in sight. My husband has also taken time off work for these interviews and will be taking time off to fly in to meet everyone if the third interview goes well. Also he doesn't apply for other jobs while he is preparing for an interview because we have other family responsibilities. Any insight on if this normal and stories from others who have been through this. It's a really good opportunity this job and it's his top choice although he is keeping his options open and applying and interviewing with other jobs as well when there is time. 

Thank you!!"

I've been pondering a question lately and would like to hear your thoughts and experiences on it. Is it possible to be financially successful in your career without taking on leadership roles, or is leadership the only path to high salaries and financial success?

On one hand, leadership roles often come with higher salaries and bonuses. However, not everyone is interested in or well-suited for leadership positions. Some may prefer to focus on developing their skills and expertise in a particular field or function, without the added responsibility of managing others.

So, my question is, can one achieve financial success without taking on leadership roles? Are there other factors that can contribute to high salaries, such as specialized knowledge or outstanding performance? What about networking and building relationships with colleagues and industry professionals?

Additionally, for those who have achieved financial success without taking on leadership roles, what advice do you have for others looking to follow a similar path? What strategies did you use to maximize your earning potential and advance in your career?

On the other hand, for those who believe that leadership is the only path to financial success, what experiences have led you to this belief? Have you seen examples of individuals who have achieved high salaries and financial success without taking on leadership roles?

I'm excited to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Thank you for sharing!"

I’ve been working with this company since early last year. Handed in my notice last week. 

I got 10 holiday days and 5 sick days. I used them all last year. 
I ended up getting covid in November (already used all my sick and holiday days before this). Even though I used my PTO days, i got paid for the covid days off. She never mentioned unpaid time off, or gave me any option to take it unpaid. She just paid me as normal.

She calls me tonight to tell me I owe that money and it will be taken from my final pay. Is this allowed? I just don’t think it’s fair and I’m not sure if I should argue on it or not.

UPDATE!

So I met my boss yesterday. I not only owe her for when I had covid. But I also owe her for the holiday I took in February and the 3 sick days I took this year! I am in Canada by the way. 

I am so confused as I am not Canadian. I called the labour board and she is not allowed to do this. She told me I am only entitled to 5 sick days and 10 holiday days IF I work 12 months. Since I am ending employment 3 months into the year, my entitled days get divided in 3 months? Can someone explain to me if this is correct?"

The only work experience I have is from mandatory work experience I had to do during high school and a couple of weeks of cleaning at an apartment building that my dad was able to get me. I was very reluctant to apply for jobs until recently because of social anxiety, however in the last few months I have become desperate and been applying for many places just to earn some income and experience while I study.

I must have applied to between 60 and 70 jobs and have had nothing. I either don't hear back from the employer or get rejected within a couple of days. I have only had two interviews so far. I can't even get jobs that don't require any skills like fast food or working at a supermarket. My resume is very short for obvious reasons but what else am I doing wrong? Everyone else I know my age and younger can get one of these jobs easily but I seem to always struggle. It's honestly really stressing me out, and I'm really worried not having this experience could have consequences for me in the future. Being 20 with virtually no experience is a very bad look, so I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to improve my chances of being employed somewhere?"

2,2023-03-27,Should I lie to a potential hiring company about my current pay?,u/RamblingKitaabiKeera,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123ha3t/should_i_lie_to_a_potential_hiring_company_about/,jobs,"I'm not in the US, but the company I'm applying for is a US company based in my home country, Pakistan, with offices in other countries. 

Quick sum up, I'm new to my field and my current company is where I learned and excelled in the field for the last 2.5 years. My current salary is pretty low because of this (and because it's a local company) and I haven't been able to negotiate more. I checked with some people and they said that the job I'm applying for has a pretty great salary and that I shouldn't go lower than X (I'm not comfortable saying what X actually is). The thing is, X is like 2.5 times my current salary. So now I'm wondering if I should lie and say my current salary is a little less than X so it seems like less of a leap. The folks I asked work at the hiring company and they said that for the pay-grade my job falls under, X is the minimum I should go.

I highly doubt they'll be able to find out my current pay, but I guess it's making me nervous asking for so much because current company just doesn't have the funds to pay me more and frankly, I know I'm being underpaid for the amount of work I do and the skills I've built while here (all on my own btw), even if I don't have the degree (which most people don't), I have the work experience and skills. The hiring company is MASSIVE and I know they can afford it. This is a relatively new field so I can't really ask others around me what to expect.

They haven't offered me the position yet, but they did email asking me this and a few other questions **in case** I get an offer. Their words:  While waiting for further instructions and decisions, I just want to make sure I have these information on hand already just in case you get chosen for the role. This will help us further in terms of reviewing your candidacy for the role."

They seem like a high turn over company based on their reviews on multiple platforms. If that happens how do I go about asking if I can think over their offer?! 

This job is a slight resume boost compared to my current one but apparently the pay is not the best (the salary actually wasn’t disclosed on the job description) and commuting where I live is not cheap. 

I want the job but the company has so many turnoffs. I feel like I’m stuck in a tug of war. Would love to also know if you took a job you where unsure of and you ended up not liking it, how long did you stay?!

**UPDATE**
They offered me a position! 
At the interview I got lots of pros and cons from them. Company is very laid back but hours are M-Thurs: 9-6 Friday 9-3:30 ( they said some days we may work until 7) 

I think I may take it just to gain some office experience. I do have a back up job incase it’s as bad as I’ve heard it is. I’m nervous but hopefully it will help me get closer to a job I want!"

1166,2023-03-27,coworker is starting too early and ending her workday too soon. I am getting stuck with her work because she’s done for the day - we work remotely,u/newboobsinmarch,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123marf/coworker_is_starting_too_early_and_ending_her/,jobs,"I’m getting burnt out, and I’m not sure what to do. I’m starting to look for a new job, but I been so exhausted lately that I have been pushing it off. 

I have been doing one of the new coworkers work because she leaves so early during the work day. I have been having to do her research/ answer manger questions about her “work” because no one is left to answer. I have been putting in 55 hours a week for a few weeks now because of this.

She starts her day at 6:30 AM and then leaves around 2:45-3:00 PM. Additionally, she will have a least one appointment for the week where she will have a “half day” and leave early. She also has blocks on her calendar where she picks up her children in the morning and around the time she leaves. 

I mention that because it’s also hard to book meetings with her to go over training and things like that. For instance, I need to go over a report with her today but she has her calendar blocked off and she leaves early at 12 for an appointment. 

Everyone else on the team either starts 7:30- 8:30 AM and leaves between 4-5 PM. Our manger and the clients we work with generally have the most questions between 3-5 PM. 

The main issue is since our clients are more active during the evening I have been left to cover her because she’s usually gone at 2. It’s a lot of work to research their question, get caught up on the status of her work, and then reply back. 

I have been simmering on this and I am really questioning if she does anything between 6-9 am. It seems really convenient she always out or at an appointment during important times. 

I’m not really sure how to approach this. I don’t want to mention anything to my manger yet because she said a couple things to me to imply she got hired because she knows one the higher vice presidents.


Edit: 

I just want to point out that I’m not trying to micro manage her. The reason I look at her calendar is because I’m trying to book meetings with her and see when she is available. I don’t blindly make meetings without considering others work schedule. I make sure we’re not both in back to back meetings all day. It’s getting hard because she’s been literally out of office half the day for the past month.

I don’t mind a flexible schedule and helping other coworkers out, but this has been going on for awhile now and I’m tired of it. It’s not even her logging off early, she’s rude to work with too. 

She doesn’t want to collaborate or meet half way.  For instance, she has declined a training meeting with me two times (even when her schedule looks free) resulting me having to tell her I could only do a specific day. she showed up on video during her facial/Botox appointment. It wasn’t even marked on her calendar. Another recent issue was when we had to have overview before I went on PTO and she was sitting at the pool yelling at her kids and not listening to a damn thing I was telling bee. That’s not knowing boundaries, it’s unprofessional and mean. 

I think it’s all BS and I think she purposely brings up the fact that she texts and is best friends with a VP.


Edit:

So set up a time with my manger to go over my concerns later tomorrow evening. I think she suspects it’s about the new coworker. I kinda brought it up with other coworkers before I left for the day and one other team member has already complained about her being at facial during our meetings. 

I also didn’t answer any of her emails or requests for today and the manager stepped in for a couple emails and CC everyone on the team for us to see her response. Not sure why she did that. We will see how tomorrow plays out.


UPDATE:

yeah, she hasn’t followed up with anyone yet. Looks like a couple business units sent a follow up email to the entire team, manager, and director for a response because its been a couple days since they heard from her. 

Manager is now asking the whole team what’s going on with a couple of her processes and why the director is now CC to a few emails. No response 

It’s going to be a sh*t show today.


UPDATE: 

She is currently offline for the day and it’s 11 AM - answered none of the emails and people are pissed. She really is working that 8 hour shift, boundaries am I right? /s

FINAL UPDATE:

They removed my updated post. She ended up getting fired. Numerous team members and clients ended up complaining. I was just the last one to complain. The process of her being fired was already started."

Backstory, I am a contractor at a fortune 500 company. I didn't work on Monday because I was sick so I ""worked"" like 8h15 minutes Thursday and Friday so roughly ~32 hours total. Thursday/Friday were no different than any other ""work"" I normally do. It's just frustrating because I am not sure what to do.

We’ve already been in talks with our manager about a salary increase as we have been tasked with other duties outside our job description and feel we should be getting compensated as such but I don’t know if more customers should be included.  Should we get paid more for still doing some of the same work we were doing before for customers but now there’s more customers to service?"

Any tips?,u/JaeRen20,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123pbj5/im_getting_calls_back_but_cant_get_past_the/,jobs," My social &amp; communication skills are not very strong. I'm also an introvert on the more extreme ends of the spectrum and not a natural talker. I've been challenging myself, but I have to study ahead of time and plan what i'm going to say and how i'm going to respond to questions to a T. If even one curveball is thrown at me it will throw me off and I may bomb the whole interview. I impulsively hung up in the middle of the last phone interview I had because a question was asked to me and I didn’t know what to say. I spent the whole week preparing for another interview just for them to ask me something completely unrelated to what I prepared for. In addition to this, I sometimes have trouble remembering the lines of my “script”. I’m just not good at this and it’s affecting my chances.

* Is anyone else like this? How do you deal with it?
* Do you have any suggestions/resources on how to improve interviewing skills?

Also, should I look for jobs/work cultures that align more with my personality, or just conform to another way of being (and embrace office politics)? I know bad communication skills &amp; introversion are not the same, im asking about the latter separately. It can still play a role and I know I'll never be a talker or be able to woo a room. I'm applying to customer service roles right now but want to make the right long term career choices."

1,2023-03-27,Horrible Manager. Need Job Advice,u/macncheezy10,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123qmv7/horrible_manager_need_job_advice/,jobs,"I have been struggling in my current job which I have been at for 9 almost 10 months. 

The benefits are really amazing, I work from home and my job is relatively easy.  I work for a large corporation but I work in a very small team of 4 (myself, two other colleagues and our manager). My manager reports to her boss who over sees our whole department. 

Before I landed this job, I had graduated from college during covid and my industry closed (media) so I ended up working at an events company as I needed something. The pay was horrible and it was a privately owned company and the lady who owned it was very cruel and took it out on the newbies. I knew I had to leave because I was overworked and severely under paid and so I landed the job I am currently in.

The issue I am dealing with is that my manager is horrible. She is either very nice or can be incredibly condescending and passive aggressive especially in front of my two other colleagues. She speaks down to me in front of them like I am stupid and a literal child when I ask for clarification or help on things, as if I should already know. My on-boarding and training was terrible and I should also mention the current role I am in is the first of its kind, it was created and then I was hired for it. I knew it would be a learning process but I had confidence my manager would help me and the company and team I would be on seemed great. It got so bad to the point where I felt like I couldn’t ask any questions or I would be treated like I was stupid so I developed terrible anxiety and it snowballed into a mental breakdown and I had to contact HR and take a week off for my mental health and physical health.

In my absence, my manager was spoken to by HR and several of the things I told HR were addressed and a plan was created to help me. We were going to do a training refresher and my manager was basically scolded and put into line and when I returned she was so nice and kept pushing the “we want you to feel supported” agenda.  This was only a month and a half ago.

Things seemed okay the last few weeks when I returned but recently my manager has returned to her old behaviour. Speaking down to me in our team meetings and frankly being rude. In comparison, she jokes with my team members and clearly loves them.

I don’t know what to do. I medically struggle with ADHD, depression and anxiety and I feel guilty like I am being too sensitive and it’s my fault. But I also feel like I can’t keep working in an environment that makes me feels so unwelcome and isolated and horrible. I also get excluded from other projects that the rest of the team works on together and I feel like I have no opportunities to expand my role.

I am so afraid to quit because I can’t afford to and looking for a new job adds so much emotional stress on top of everything. My mom has said she thinks my manager is trying to force me to quit. Do I have any rights? What am I supposed to do? I can’t sleep, I feel sick everyday and I can’t keep doing this. 


I am in Canada, ON by the way."

Of course the problem is that I don’t have experience in these roles or Microsoft office/google workplace (most jobs want Microsoft office proficiency &amp; job experience) so no one will hire me for them.

And more importantly, where is the best place to get certified? A google search shows tons of different options and I want something that will actually teach me, not rip me off, and stand out to potential employers.

That was Friday morning and it’s now Monday and I’ve heard nothing.

Should I follow up or leave it? Getting the impression they’ll expect me to drop everything or ghost me.

If it’s the former I have issue with the lack of notice and expectancy of me to “jump”, which concerns me when it comes to negotiation / looking desperate.

To give you some context, I am 28 years old and have been employed at the same organization for around 7 years. Over time, I worked my way up to my current job title as Director of Compliance at a medical supply company, which I have held for a little over a year. Although some aspects of my job are in line with my title, I don't feel like I am performing as a Director of Compliance. This is mainly because I am assigned miscellaneous projects as the company is overwhelmed in multiple areas. My extensive experience with the company allows me to tackle different projects that don't necessarily relate to my job title. 

Unfortunately, my compensation doesn't match my job title, and it's challenging to request a raise when my work doesn't align with my title. Moreover, our company doesn't have a dedicated compliance department, and I am only involved in a few related tasks. For everything else, the CEO assigns me to work on it. I desire to find another job, but I'm unsure of what position to apply for. Although I can't apply for senior-level roles at other companies due to a lack of experience, I also have trouble landing interviews for lower-level positions. I think that potential employers view me as ""overqualified"" because of my inflated job title. Additionally, my interests lie more in the financial sector than the compliance sector. Before becoming the Director of Compliance, I worked as a billing supervisor for four years and as a customer service supervisor for a year or two at the same company. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Health Administration, which is relevant to my previous roles and current position. Can you provide any suggestions for job applications? Should I apply for senior-level jobs, despite feeling underqualified in some areas? Is it advisable to modify my job title when applying?"

I graduated last Spring with a Media Arts BA and the intent of getting into the film industry, wanting to become a director, DP, or other creative artist position. Jobhunting, though, it looked to me that I would have to jump through numerous different hoops and that the film industry was very difficult to enter as a graduate, or at least one who didn't go to a dedicated film school.

I started looking at alternatives, both career paths and ways to enter the industry. The video game industry was another thing I thought about prior to college, but I was turned off by the programming and math. However, the 3D side of it looks promising. Since both films and video games approach 3D in similar ways, I thought by learning it I could build a skillset and portfolio applicable to both industries. If I wanted to still be a part of the film industry, I could do things with 3d, or if I had better opportunities with gaming, I could go that route. Of course, I could leave filmmaking alone, and pursue just the game industry as a 3d artist or level designer. Though, I'm still interested in film, and don't want to think of my time in college as a waste if I don't try to get into that industry. 

Now, as far as 3D goes, it seems to me that environment design is, on average, less competitive and has more job openings than say character modeling or animation. And while I thought that'd be the case for both film and gaming, someone in the Filmmaker subreddit told me that 3D skills in film will only get me probably VFX work. They said modeling and animation, besides being competitive, are usually handed off to international companies to do for cheap. Idk if this varies between film and video games. 

Anyways, I guess my question is more asking for advice than anything. If I stuck to just video games, I could do Level Design or Environment Art. If I still pursue film as well, and the VFX comment is accurate, then character modeling and animation are probably out the door. I just feel so lost and stuck at a fork. I like worldbuilding and environments, but I also have interests in character and animation. Any insight would be helpful."

As I understand, they are just venturing into my niche as a company and I attribute that non-technical approach to that. However, I am worried that it may be a sign of some bigger issues within the organisation - don’t know the kind though.

I googled the company and it showed me employee complaints about things that don’t really concern me (like lack of remote work - I live 300 miles from their office and they are happy for me to work 100% remote) or things about different departments than I would work at, so I can’t really decide.

So should I consider it a red flag and keep looking? If what they say is true, company would be awesome - in terms of money and in terms of type of work I would do."

Previously worked as a teacher in a Prison. I left the post to persue a related qualification abroad. Upon completing my course I was offered 2 jobs with my previous employer. I accepted, have signed my contract (online) but am waiting lengthy security checks (5months). Being unemployed is really making me depressed, I have contacted the employer several times about updates(they said they are chasing it) but I am really stuck.   


I searched through my emails to find details about the security checker. Contacted them and they told me no new application has been made for me.....I have friends and a GF who work there and they all say I am welcome and they are understaffed etc. It's a business within a business and I am waiting for someone to press a button...

I have part time income but starting to look for new jobs. Any job in my field will require references from this employer and in my mind that would end the onboarding process.

Any ideas on how I can progress this? Should I move on?"

I've run my own small construction business (residential home framing) for the last 20 years, since college (I'm 43). The business has morphed into a sort of consulting gig over the years. Where I once ran several framing crews, I now offer framing, residential design and drafting, technical drafting, residential building supervision, basic construction engineering consulting, estimating materials, and several other things. I feel like these are all important things that I'd like to show on my resume, but since it's all been done for a single business, which happens to be owned by me, I'm not sure how to go about formatting it. To be clear, I personally provide all of those services. I employ laborers as-needed.

I also have substantial experience with other things like Solidworks, Inventor, Revit, AutoCAD, BricsCAD, Sketchup, Linux system administration, network administration, Python, C, Rust, x86 Assembler, statics, dynamics, etc... I have seen several jobs where my combination of skills and experience would seem to be a great fit, but I'm not sure how to show all of this in a simple, straightforward, and cohesive format. I'm hoping someone here can help me out. Samples or examples would be wonderful.

To be clear, my current work situation is perfectly stable. I'm looking for something new, but I don't have any specific timeline. I'm perfectly fine striking out on 99.9% of applications. I'm just thinking there's probably someone out there somewhere who will look at my resume and think ""This guy may not be perfect, but we see a lot of value in his combination of skills and experience."" I'd like to find those people and have a discussion with them, even if it goes nowhere.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this. I look forward to hearing your thoughts."

Unfortunately when they were a part of our agency clients, they were very shitty to our internal team. And after I met with the husband/co-founder of this brand, they cancelled our follow-up call (this time with the wife). Then they rescheduled and just didn't send a calendar invite and I followed-up the night before to confirm we were meeting and there was nothing until 2 days later. Now they're wanting to meet again and I'm just not feeling it, but I don't want to make my former boss look like a fool for referring me.

Everyone has been extremely welcoming and kind, and the supervisor has been very keen to hear feedback on processes and training since I'm the first new outside hire in awhile.

One thing I've noticed is that documentation is lacking. Things will be either barebones or nonexistant, leading to confusion and wasted time trying to figure out who did what and when, where the patient is in the process, etc. There are a lot of habits the other workers have that work between each other but not for anyone else, and end up just making things confusing.

This is apparently an issue with the social workers we work alongside as well, to the point that several don't send applications to us because it saves time to just do it themselves from start to finish.

The situation is that the rest of the team works on the main campus while I work in an offshoot clinic in a different town over an hour away. I think the issues arise from the fact that these people work together in the same room, so issues can be settled quickly and easily between them, and rarely if ever interact directly with the nurses. By contrast, I sit next to the social worker and across the hall from my nurses.

I feel like these habits arose from trying to save time in the short term, and in their defense they are extremely busy. But it leads to hours of confusion later, when someone else has to figure out what's going on.

How can I inform them of this in a tactful and polite way, given that I just started here and don't want to come off as rude? We're having a lunch meeting this week."

1,2023-03-27,Changing paths in a promising career,u/desapercibida,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123vv40/changing_paths_in_a_promising_career/,jobs," 

I´m (27F) a 2022 graduate from one of the best universities in the world rankings, where I graduated top of my class. I studied an international bachelor´s, lived in many countries, and did internships in top companies. Currently I am stuck in a city that I hate, working my first ""real life"" job for Amazon. My job is great and I really like the skills that I am learning, but I work too much overtime. This, combined with the fact that there is nothing to do in the city (stores and restaurants close early, there´s overall not a lot of going on in the city) is affecting my mental health and I feel that I´m missing out. I feel that after sacrificing so much of my personal time during my studies, I now would like to enjoy an active social life before I turn 30, start a family, etc.

I have received a job in a city that I love, in a company where I know that overtime is very rare, and where people usually hang out after work, etc. The problem is that I feel overqualified for this position: currently I do IT finance (coding), whereas in this new position I would be calling clients to claim payments, processing invoices, assisting other coworkers with their IT questions, etc. The bright side is that they offered me a managerial position after 1 year. The pay is good, but I am worried that I may be ruining my career. With these skills, I am worried that I may not be able to land a job easily afterwards.

What would **you** do in my position? Would you prioritize your career but ruin your mental health, or would you take an ""easy"" job in a city that you like, even if this means throwing away all the sacrifices you did to get here?"
2,2023-03-27,Contradictory feedback? Want to see others thoughts,u/Xano74,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123vvc5/contradictory_feedback_want_to_see_others_thoughts/,jobs,"I've worked at my company for almost 4 years as a contractor. I am the most senior individual in my role but I noticed other people getting offers and opportunities while I don't hear much back.

I have the most responsibilities for my position but barely make any more money than someone just hired for this role (I make $2 an hour more)

Essentially my feedback was very clear.

1. I am the top individual in my role. My manager made it very clear that he feels I am the best at my job and can trust me with any project they give me.
2. The reason I have not been given other opportunities is because I have not come to several meetings before and after work.

These meetings are very bland and barebones. Often they just provide reminders for people for that day of what to do/not to do. I work with vehicles, so it will be a meeting where they remind someone to ""take the exhaust hose off before leaving so you don't pull it from the wall"" Basically information I don't really need.

We also have afternoon meetings that we used to be able to zoom, but now are mandatory in person in that were similarly boring, often going over recycled information that I have heard over and over for the last 3 years. I commute further than anyone for work and the extra time being in person vs zoom adds significant time to my commute home. I'm basically leaving home at 6am to get to work by 8am and leaving at 430pm and getting home around 6pm. 12 hour days. 

My manager made it clear these meetings aren't really for me, but for everyone else, and said his hope for me being there would be to ""ask stupid questions"" in case other newer people are afraid to speak up so that everyone is aware of the answers. So he basically wants me to look stupid in front of my collegues asking  simple questions even if I know the answer to them.

On one hand, its very clear what they want me to do. They want me in these meetings no matter what. That part is easy. We are required to go to these now since attendance is taken.

The part that bothers me is that he considers me the best of the best at my job, admitted that the meetings we do are pretty pointless for me, but still wants me to attend, and says the entire reason I don't get promoted is because even though I'm the top, its because I don't go to these pointless meetings.

To me, it makes it look like they don't want someone who does well, they want someone who they can control more. I plan on doing all the meetings, it just felt a bit off putting that they are giving people roles who are not qualified simply because they are going to meetings."

You find something you like, apply, interview, and get the new job. It’s a pay cut but a way better working environment, closer to your true skill set, and you stand to level up your skills and ultimately move your career forward in the new role. Overall win. Yay! 

Now, let’s say the current job is remote and new job will require you to move several states away and work at least partially in person. You ask to start the new job in 4 months to give you time to wrap up projects at the current job and get yourself moved. 

The current job pays way more so you kinda want to squeak as much out of it as you can - you’ll need it for moving, etc. 

You know it’s not fair to string them along for too, too long given you will be leaving. But, as per your contract they have the right to drop you with zero notice, meaning they could drop you the same day you tell them you’re leaving. Basically, you have to be willing to either terminate the day you tell them or just a few days after because they won’t have much use for you once they learn your leaving (remember, this was not an ideal working environment and nobody is particularly happy with the fit).

I sent a message to my contact on Friday and today, asking what the next step of the process would be. I don't understand why they have been silent for this long. A simple ""Hey we are currently getting the right documents in order"" or something would be a valid update. Am I being impatient? 

I'm worried the recruiter made a mistake and offered me a job that doesn't actually exist. Not the end of the world but I'd like to know sooner than later."
2,2023-03-27,Message employer on LinkedIn after recruiter ghosted me?,u/Upset_Strength2183,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/123yckh/message_employer_on_linkedin_after_recruiter/,jobs,"Hello fellow redditers - looking for some advice.

So I had a phone interview on March 16th with a recruiter. She had emailed me two days prior saying she was interested in my background and would like to schedule an interview for the job posting I applied to. So on March 16, we had the initial screening/interview - and at the end of the call she said she thinks my experience is great and she liked what she heard. She said she would schedule me for the next round of interviews on Monday and told me the name of who she would schedule the call with.

Mind you, I am extremely interested and excited about this position. So after our call, I emailed her thanking her for her time and reiterated my interest in the job. Monday comes along and I don’t hear anything. So I figure hmmm I’m sure she’s busy so I’ll wait a couple days to reach out again. 

I reached out again on Wednesday asking if there was any update and again, reiterated my interest in the position. I still have yet to receive any response yet from her and I’ve come to the conclusion I am being ghosted.

My question is - I have the name of the person she said she would set up the next round of interviews with. I found her on LinkedIn and am wondering - is it weird to message her? I really wanted this job and just am really disappointed that I never heard back. I don’t understand why the recruiter couldn’t have told me yes or no either way so I would have an answer.

In summary: should I linkedin message the person the recruiter said she would schedule a call with? Or is that too much and I should just take the hint and let it go."

They're just more extroverted, and although I have managed to come out of my shell a lot in recent years, the way this coworker dominates our workplace kind of stifles me?


Maybe I'm feeling a sense of entitlement because I have some seniority and make the schedule, but idk.


For example, I came up with a project and was going to explain the instructions. I did give this coworker the basic instructions, but they didn't fully understand. Before I could start explaining to everyone else, they jumped in and gave the instructions instead, but they explained incorrectly, so I had to give more materials out to compensate for the mistake made.


Or I will start the discussion because I'm the one who came up with the topic and very quickly they will take over, and I'm unable to get back in the conversation because they speak before I can.


Or I will be asked for a favor, and before I can respond, this coworker will jump in and say that they will do it.



I really love my job but it's making it really difficult to work especially when I already have a whole complex about being left out. Which is my own personal issue, I understand, but I'm not sure how to get my spot back and have a more evenly distributed workload or equal importance in the job? Help me out y'all, please."

Because of this, over the past two years, I’ve been given more and more responsibility, including difficult accounts that others in my department struggle with. I’ve always wanted to be a team player, so I accept these accounts without complaint, but because they are difficult accounts, I’m only able to save them about 50% of the time.

Recently, our company hired a new vice president who has begun scrutinizing our department, looking primarily at client retention as a key performance indicator. Given my propensity for handling a large, difficult client load, my retention numbers have always been worse than others in my department, but my boss and coworkers have always understood why and had my back. The new VP, however, doesn’t seem to understand this, and I’m worried this will cause him to pass me over for promotions and raises — or worse, make me a candidate for layoffs — despite the fact that in reality I’m one of our best performers.

The question is, how do I diplomatically show the new VP that my poor metrics aren’t actually an indicator of my performance? Did I essentially paint myself into a corner here?

Tl;dr - I’m a “fixer” at work so my overall numbers are worse, and I don’t know how to show this to upper management without coming across as complaining."

Since my employer offered tuition reimbursement, I prioritized business related classes.  So I have 66 credits and not even an Associate's because I'm lacking the requirements.

I worked my way from a loan processor, to mortgage underwriter, to AVP of Credit abd Compliance.  Then covid happened and there were mass layoffs/demotions so I was demoted to an underwriter again.  Took the opportunity to leave because I hated the company.  Became and underwriter again for a few months, then into a mortgage transaction manager type role.  Now the industry tanked and they moved me into an associate role with a sister company.

I want out of mortgage but I'm not getting any bites no matter how much I adapt my resume to fit the job I'm applying for.  I have tons of transferrable skills in project management and so much more.

Wondering if my lack of degree is holding me back.

Do I put it on my resume as the dates I attended or do I look like a loser for not finishing?  Or I can finish and get some done through CLEP testing but really don't want to pay thousands to get these last irrelevant classes for my degree.

It's a tough decision because I would like my degree but my mom was terminally ill so I had to stop taking classes and then got promoted to AVP.  

Opinions, please, on 1) listing my college experience as-is, 2) not adding to resume and keep on applying, or 3) finish my degree.  Thank you."

I work for a small plumbing company. We work 4, 10 hour days weekly and get paid weekly as well. We get 3 sick days each year and the following are my hours from last pay period.

Thurs: Sick

Mon: 12.5

Tues: 12.5

Wed: 10

Naturally, I was expecting to have 5 hours of overtime (45 hrs including paid sick day) on my check. However, it was listed as 35 hours regular pay and 5 hours of sick pay. I thought it was a mistake and asked the office fellow this morning. He says they don't let people make overtime when there is a sick day on that pay period, because people could just take all 3 of their sick days in one week and get overtime on the 4th day, assuming a job went longer than expected. I've been thinking about this all day because one one hand, I understand if they don't want to pay me overtime for those 5 hours (it's a stretch, but I can conceive it), yet it still feels like I'm missing 5 hours, at least of regular pay. It seems like what they did was just give me half a sick day to give me 40 hours, even though I didn't take half a sick day.

Is this kind of thing normal? If so, do you see this in larger companies as well? If you can shed any light on this situation, I'd greatly appreciate it. I want to be a ""company man"", but sort of feel like I'm getting shafted.

About a year ago I decided to try retraining for a tech job and then all of the layoffs started happening.

I haven't had much luck applying for tech jobs. I have professional certifications, projects and some volunteer experience. The biggest problem is that I have zero paid tech experience and don't have a professional network let alone in tech. Every job I apply to wants 3-5 years experience and even if I get a job offer, I still might not get the job because I don't have three professional references.

Everyone always says that people with challenges finding work should look into temp/staffing agencies. I'm interested in trying this, but am I going to have the same issues as I am having right now due to lack of experience/lack of references? Is it as easy to get a job through a staffing agency as people make it seem like?"

So I'm a 30 yr old with a finance degree. Working on getting an accounting one in the afternoon. I've worked AP, bookkeeping, staff Accountant etc. I started a new job in January and today was my 90 day review. I was basically told that if I can't pull the next two check runs by myself, I'm done. At my 30 day review I was told I was behind, which made sense. I didn't get computer access till after two weeks and then was sent on a one week orientation. I still don't have all the account access I need to have and I don't know what I need to have access to. I spent a good month not knowing what I didn't know. They use a proprietary accounting system that I have no experience with. They changed the check run process two weeks ago because the company is trying to get funding and we're still finding quirks that need to get fixed on the fly. I want to just quit, I don't want to look bad, but I can't meet their expectations, this has never happened to me before. I wish I could say school is getting in the way or find some reason, it feels like lost battle already. Comments, criticism, advice is welcome. This has never happened to me before. I honestly don't know how to react to it."

I had a very productive senior year, but was very much focused on the present. After a couple months unemployed, I got a temporary political campaign job where I grew up (have done political work since high school).

That ended in November and since then, I've been overthinking my job search to death and realized I underestimated how tough the transitionary period post-college would be. While I have a resume for politics, I don't think it's best for my mental health to keep going down that road as I've seen how it takes the life out of people. This is a tough admission because outside of some restaurant jobs, it's all I've ever known.

While I do have a lot of interests, I don't know which one to immediately pursue job wise and I don't know where I want to live. My ultimate passion is stand-up comedy which I've done for the last 5 years, so I know I need to be in a city so I can continue to pursue that when I'm not working.

Overall, I'm feeling paralyzed from my overthinking. I know your job right out of college isn't expected to be great, but I still want to put myself on a good path.

How do I decide where to move and what job to get without getting stuck overthinking it to death? The only true non-negotiable for me is getting to a city to continue to pursue my dream. The overthinking has set a high bar for deciding which city and what job to pursue."

He went of lecturing me about religion and God and me being a catholic kindoff shaming me because I am a catholic he asked me if i drink or smoke i said i smoke occasionally socially. He said if I found God I can stop smoking. I was to the point of crying then because i am a hardworker for that job even though they only pay me 13 dollars an hour. I always ask for work when i ran out of things to do and I always ask if they need anything for me to help in anyway i can with work. I was shamed for beinng a catholic.

I cried in the bathroom because he was mad at me for being rude which i didnt even know I was being rude i always greet them with a smile and always happy to receive anytypenof work even though it was outside my job description. The rest of the day went by i just finished fixing the policies needed for the state which I wasnt even supposed to be doing because he is the director and he should fix anything regarding policies. I was looking at the calendar he said i was counting my time to get off of work. I was shocked by this bcause i just finished the policies they asked meto do.

I was told when I was hired that it was a regular 8-5 Monday-Friday with a small raise. I work and go to school full time so I came in with the understanding and the agreement that I would be able to make up as much of my hours that I miss from classes as possible. Then I meet my new team and I’m told that we don’t actually start until 8:30, which is already a kick to me because I really need the hours. I came into this job being told I would get 40 hours and then they told me I wouldn’t be able to make up my time AND I would lose an additional 30 minutes every morning because I’m in training and they can’t leave me on my own. So I thought “okay, this is only until I’m out of training and then I will be allowed to come in earlier and stay later like I was promised.” When it comes time to leave today (my first day) I’m told that in fact I will be losing about hour every day working 8:30- 4:30 and won’t be allowed to get much over 36 hours a week even though I’m full time and I told them from the beginning that I cannot afford to work less than 40 hours. The supervisor then tells me that the reason I got a raise was so that I wouldn’t have to take a pay cut to come to that position where I would be working less hours but I was not aware of the permanently cut hours until after I started. So I came home and did the math, by taking this job I’m making $100 less per month than I made originally without a pay increase and $300 less per month than what I would make with my new hourly rate (which also eats up the 5.5% company wide raise that I just got separately that had nothing to do with my new job) working 40 hours per week. 

How do I politely and professionally tell my employer that I’m taking an unagreed-upon financial loss and I need more hours other wise I will have to reconsider my position with them?"

But for the past year, after visiting Seattle and wrapping up my masters degree in Data Science, I have had strong urges to move out to Seattle to work in Tech (love the weather/nature and enjoy coding)-these urges keep me up at night. About 2 weeks ago, I was laid off from my job in project management, and am planning to turn this into an opportunity to move out to Seattle to increase my chances of finding and hopefully landing a Tech job, which I have been applying to while in Minnesota, but to no success. I believe the main reason for my lack of success in applying out of state is that all my experience in coding (python, R, SQL) are tied to my 2 year masters degree, i.e., I have learned a lot, but do not have any related work experience.

**Motivation:** I am passionate and enjoy coding, so I am hoping that by moving out to Seattle (in May), I can talk with companies/people in person and network, to improve my chances of landing a job than I would otherwise by continuing to apply remotely in Minnesota.

For anyone with past experience or who can help, does this sound like a good plan, and what **advice** can you give for someone who will be moving out to Seattle, **to maximize their chances of landing a Tech job**, e.g., contact hiring temp agencies, change phone number to match the Seattle area code, visit companies in person to talk with hiring managers?"

there’s no laws/rules regarding me not working from home so it’s just a matter of courtesy. i just feel like i’d be kinda an asshole for not saying anything. i really like my job and my boss and i just don’t wanna jeporadize a good relationship.

I left my job of 7 years as a gardener at the start of the year because I thought it was the right thing to do. Nearing the end of my last week there, I knew deep down I didn’t really want to leave, but I did it anyway. 

Now a few months have passed on, I have this sense of yearning to return back to the job, and my boss is happy to have me back. I’ve tried to return a number of times, but whenever I decide to go back, it’s like my brain goes into hypervigilance mode. I develop instant insomnia, get physically Ill, can’t think properly and emotions become buried somewhere. 

I know this is probably a topic to discuss with a counsellor, but I haven’t had any luck securing one as of yet. I can’t tell whether there is some anxiety about committing to returning to my work place or what, but I definitely know that it is causing a huge disruption to my psyche. And similarly when I decide to leave the work place, I feel an instant sense of relief, but am left feeling depressed and yearning to go back. An endless cycle that doesn’t let up.

Any Help Appreciated!,u/CaptKraken33,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/124gzhl/need_some_advice_any_help_appreciated/,jobs,"I started my job with this company back in August of last year. Everything started off great and it was an absolute pleasure coming to work every day. During these times it was not uncommon for me to put in 10-15 hours of overtime a week simply because I truly enjoyed what I was doing, and the extra money was nice. Management was always super helpful and response with any questions I had, and all seemed to be going great. This seemed like the place I would want to make a career out of.

However due to the nature of work that I do (Lead tech for IT infrastructure installations) the work slowed down during the winter months due to the weather and holidays. It slowed to the point that my once 50-60 hour weeks turned into 10-15 hour weeks with some being even less. This was not mentioned to me during the interview process or even in any conversations I had, had after being employed.

Upon asking about why the hours had declined I was met with very hostile and rude responses to the point that I was basically told that when work comes in then I will get it, otherwise stop asking about it. I sucked it up and powered through trying to make ends meet where I could. Work has now started to pick back up but in the past 2 months I have either not been paid correctly or it has been several days late after payday. I asked if there was something that I could do to help this from happening and was told by payroll that it was my bank that was causing the issues. I proceeded to call the bank and of course it wasn't an issue on their end. They proceeded to show me that the transfers didn't go through because they were submitted too late or that there was a lack of funds in the sending account.

After hearing this I messaged payroll again with the new information and was met with again hateful and rude responses, even to the point of being cursed out on the weekend by the owner. Due to the nature of his vulgarity and his misspellings it was pretty clear that he was intoxicated.

This all leads me to today where my hours have since been cut once again and I'm averaging about 5-10 hours a week. I'll go days without any work, and I can't message about it because if I do I face getting the same attitude as before. I decided to start applying for other jobs, but it's been 2 weeks and haven't got one call or email about any new opportunities. I have applied to about 50+ places and nothing. I thought this was odd and tried to inquire at a few places as to why I hadn't heard anything and was told that I had received bad references. This puzzled me but it all made sense after the email I received today from my current employer, stating that they know I've been applying to other jobs and good luck finding a better job than this one.

After the email came through my hours for the week were gone and there are none scheduled for the remainder of the week or next. I haven't been told that I'm fired or anything, but it feels like they are intentionally cutting the hours to get me to quit.

So, my question is this:

What did I do wrong to warrant this type of behavior? I started off and put in many, many hours for this company and took on any extra work that was available. I showed up every day and my work was even commended several times by clients and other employees. I didn't have issues until I opened my mouth about the lack of hours or getting paid.

Secondly:

What do I do about the job search when I'm getting bad references from this company? If I don't list them on my resume, then I have a large job gap and if I do I face them giving a bad reference out of spite.

All I know is it's been weeks without a decent paycheck and bills are slowly piling up and savings is depleting. I have to find something fast but I'm unsure of what to do at this point."

My company doesn't pay sick pay but gave me 2 weeks compassionate leave. I have since self certified and my plan, which I discussed with HR on Friday last week was to have 3 days this week as annual leave and then do half days on Thursday and Friday and Monday and Tuesday of next week - so I can gradually come back to work as I'm not ready to just go straight back to full time hours.

My company has rejected this plan saying it's not sustainable by the business and expect me to go back full time from Monday. HR did say they needed to double check my plan was ok, but that they didn't see it as being a problem, so I'm quite upset after finding out they expect to just got straight back full time.

If I get signed off on statutory sick pay I lose over £400 a week, so I either do something I'm not ready for or I lose money I can't afford to.

I'm looking for some advice or possible reasons why my company would not support this and what my options are. My head is such a mess at the moment with everything I'm hoping this isn't as bad as it feels right now. I have asked my company for clarification and stated my reasons for a phased return, but that I will have to see how Monday goes and that I may need to get signed off until I feel full time hours are doable.

2,2023-03-28,Is our new manager taking a heavy handed approach?,u/Puzzleheaded-100,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/124kd7j/is_our_new_manager_taking_a_heavy_handed_approach/,jobs,"The company I'm working for has a written old-school style of dress code. By old-school I mean things like male members of staff like myself should be wearing a dress shirt and tie, trousers, closed dress shoes though a full suit is not a requirement. Female staff should wear skirts around knee length and nothing revealing.

However, none of this has been enforced since I have worked here and this is just down to our last manager who never enforced any of this so most staff including myself dressed in much more casual attire. I will admit that he was far too easy going and quite lax.

He has now retired and we have a new manager, she is completely different, she is very young and this is her first role as a manager so she is inexperienced. Though I don't mean to put her down at all because of that, I would actually give her credit for progressing into management at a young age.

She has told us about some changes she wants to make,  as new managers usually do. One change she has told us about is she will be enforcing the dress code as it is written. She has said she will be strictly enforcing the dress code at all times and she will go through the disciplinary procedure with anyone found not to be complying. She was asked if it would just be anyone who repeatedly does not comply that would be taken through a discipline procedure. She made it quite clear that this will be done even for single instances. She gave a couple of examples, one being that a tie must be worn and if she sees anyone not wearing a tie, she will discipline them.

There can be no arguing around the requirement to wear a tie as it is stated in the dress code that a tie must be worn at all times in the office, which applies to all staff including non customer facing office staff like myself. I accept that she does have the right to enforce all dress code rules and I would not have any issue with her giving out a write up to anyone who repeatedly does not comply but I feel it is a rather heavy handed for her to say she will be disciplining people for any single instance such as not wearing a tie.

I am one of the older guys in the office and I have had to work under more formal dress codes in the past so I don't feel like this is going to be a deal breaker for me and I don't feel like looking for an alternative job because of this, but I have taken to dressing more casually with no enforced dress code and I do much prefer this. I won't dispute it though and will comply as I've been told.

She is allowing a three week period of grace with which we are now one week into. Some staff have now taken to complying with the dress code and this week she has been  giving polite reminders to those still dressing in more casual attire that they will need to fully comply after the grace period otherwise she will discipline them. She also gave a reminder at our team meeting around this.

With the grace period being allowed and her now giving polite reminders, I'm now not so sure if she is taking that much or a heavy handed approach. Some of my colleagues feel that she is perfectly justified and taking a very fair approach to this. I can't recall anyone being taken though any discipline procedures since I have worked here but that is probably just because of our previous manager as he did not enforce anything.

I may well be over reacting in feeling it is heavy handed as some of my colleagues feel she is being fair. I'm not looking to hear comments about whether anyone feels it is or isn't right to have a formal business dress code as that is what we have in our company. What I would like to hear is what views some outsiders see on our managers approach to enforcing the dress code. Do you feel she is justified to say she will discipline anyone for any single instance she sees of not complying or do you see it like she is taking a heavy handed approach? I don't mind anyone giving a one word answer or a more detailed explanation of their view on it."

I started a new job recently, i'm now almost 4 weeks in, but i don't know if i should leave or stay..

The job itself is not doing something i really like, it's a security job so it's alot of sitting and doing nothing. I also now work weekends, night shifts and holidays. I've worked that before at a other job but i really start to dislike it.. And its like a 30 minutes bike ride.

My colleagues are nice people tho, i felt very welcome in the team right from the start, so thats the hard thing for me...

What do you guys think? I don't like the job at all, but i like the colleagues.."

It’s my first job out of college and it’s 100% remote. 

The job progresses by levels. I’m a “I”, and after that is a II, III, and Senior. I do much more work than a I is supposed to do (both level and complexity), but the remote part is a major pro for me so I don’t want to complain. Anyway, to get to the point. I have a coworker “Beka” (Senior) who is a prime example of the a-hole who does little to no work but has a big mouth. Not going to get into too much detail, but I do much, much more work for less pay. 

Part of her big mouth is also that she complains about every “personal” issue to our boss. One day she essentially tells me she doesn’t give a shit about the job and her husband comes first, and the next she puts a play on for our boss: cries and says she feels she’s not “giving it her all”. He starts assigning her essentially no work, makes exceptions for her, and she says she’ll change her work hours 7-4 instead of most people 8-5. She typically gets offline around 3:30, and lies about starting at 7, she’s on at around right before everyone else gets on and is never really online anyway. 

To get to my point: I stay up late and feel nauseous in the morning so I’ve been starting around 8:30-9ish for a while. Yesterday my boss texted me and said he didn’t see me online, I told him I start later, and he said “that won’t cut it.” I’m fuming. I produce so much more work than my coworker (for much less pay), I’m on till 5 or after (even if I don’t have to be since I skipped lunch or really nailed my work before 5), and I never say anything about the obviously unfair treatment. 

What do I do in this situation? I got up early today again to see if she’s on, and nope. Literally this lady works maybe 2 hours a day and my boss has the audacity to tell me something about starting a bit later when I have nothing important in the morning regardless."

I am finishing my third month at this job, I have exceeded my sales goals massively from 5k to maybe 15k + 

However, I haven't contacted all the clients they have asked me to do. This was a serious issue as they've mentioned it many times before. 

They assume I'm slacking off, and honestly it's just a mix of me getting a lil overwhelmed and distracted really easily 

Last week they said I have two weeks to contact the nearly 400 + clients or I will basically be fired. 

I am on 150 right now and it's not looking good before the end of this week

TLDR:

If I'm still in the first 3 months of a job in the UK, I'm a recent graduate 23M, and have a few gaps and longest I've worked since uni is 7 months.

What is the benefits of me quitting on my own terms vs getting let go, if I'm still on probation period and will my next job know that I got let go.

If leave on my own terms will it say I just left instead of fired if I get a reference?"

Both offer equitable benefits.

One was for a “payroll clerk” position with Ennovance Capital. I was originally supposed to handle their records but the “check” they sent me to buy equipment for that position never cleared so they changed the arrangement. That’s kinda what my issue is. Now they have me transferring bitcoin and keeping 15% of each transaction. The second position is data entry for Startek Global. Someone who I thought worked for this company offered me a job via Facebook. They emailed me from a company email. But it’s the same situation. “We’ll send you a check to buy equipment.” Once again the check didn’t clear. I know Startek is a legitimate company but I don’t think the people I’m talking to actually work for them. Is anyone familiar with these companies and how they do business? I know most remote jobs don’t send a check to buy supplies. But are there any that do? Also the position for Ennovance Capital was found on indeed. Does indeed ever post scam jobs?

Firstly, it took them nearly 2 months from my hiring date to actually get me in. I was still chasing them up a month and a half after my intended start date and having to ring up colleague support who had no clue what was going on. Thankfully I still had my old job at the time to lean on though still should have been a red flag. 
No air-con. Okay, not the worst but despite it being January when I started we we’ve been made to work in temperatures around or over 30C. 
Not working around my given availability for university, so I missed classes and even when I spoke up nothing changed. Only non-management member made to work at different stores with next to no notice, despite us being very understaffed i.e. 2 people doing the jobs of 4-5 people during very bad rushes. 
Condescending supervisors, one of which I noticed would use my name to ring up orders which I believe is fraudulent (?). 
Finishing work at 8:30/9pm and starting next morning at 6am which I believe is illegal.
Didn’t even finish training, I am weeks behind.
I have to take out all my piercings for health and safety reasons, no retainers allowed whilst I’ve worked with others who get to keep theirs in or wear retainers with not a word said to them which is kind of hypocritical.

I work for a small startup. It is one of those weird places where there are more managers than people to manage. I started here 2-3 years ago in a low level position and worked my way up. I consider myself mildly competent at what I do. My first supervisor was amazing. He had his flaws like everyone else but was still amazing. 

I was promoted again a few months ago and I am now in charge of a big job function. Some companies would call it a department but I don’t get the title of manager because I am the only person in it. Yet I have no real authority. My new supervisor is not a technical person and yet my job function is technical. I have tried to inform the supervisor what I do etc but it always somehow ends up with more work on my plate. This is going on so much that I am now thinking of giving my supervisor just what I am asked. This means I get no support from management. 

The problem I’m increasingly facing is that I now do the work of at least 2 people. Almost a year ago we had a director+me doing this work. The director left because she said her work was too much. Now I do both this. Yet I don’t get paid enough (not even close to what the director made but then again I don’t have 20 years of experience). Yet I have been told that I am doing a good job managing this work. 

I recently asked my supervisor to hire a junior. I was told NO. I asked if I could offload my work to others-NO. Just last month, I was asked to do something that should be done by the software team because ‘they have so much on their plate’. Yet I am one person and I am drowning in work and yet me doing this is ok. 

Every suggestion I make gets a pushback. Everyone in management thinks they are an expert at my niche field yet they are not. This company went through 4 people in this department (all director level employees including the previous director, I mentioned) in a span of 3 years. I regret taking on this expanded role and promotion because it put me under a pretty much useless supervisor. 

I feel suffocated and unsupported and I am thinking of leaving. Could someone please advice me? Am I just overreacting to being asked to do more work?

Thank you

I have a broad background in STEM and a masters in teaching. Eventually I would like to make more money- I am interested in advancing in Higher Ed or potentially transitioning to something like HR or corporate management. 

I recently got a really exciting opportunity to do a free dual MBA &amp; Masters in Engineering Management through my job. I definitely want to do the MBA, but I'm feeling a little hesitation about the MSEM since my background is not in engineering. I think it could potentially give me a really great way to transition to working in a corporate role at a medical device company or something like that, but I'm wondering- if I decide I want to go into HR, for example, is there any chance having done the Engineering Management masters in addition to the MBA will actually hurt me?

Thank you in advance for any advice or thoughts!"

I like my work a lot, but there are some serious downsides: having to pay independent contractor taxes, for one, and having to pay out of pocket for healthcare. I've started to think about finding something a little more traditional. 

But I'm not really sure what I should be looking for, because I've developed a ton of new skills through this job, and there isn't really a clear title for my role--I was hired as a copywriter and ended up doing a bunch of other stuff as well. For instance:

* I planned and oversaw multiple product launches, including planning sales strategy, creating a launch checklist, creating a mailing schedule, creating and testing sales sequences, etc.
* I wrote all the marketing copy for email and social media and wrote and edited sales pages. I also wrote a lot of other stuff, like blog posts and teaching materials.
* I trained new employees
* I did a TON of customer service, both in person and over email, and got really good feedback on how I interacted with people

Basically, if it needed to be done, I did it. I tend to jump in and just figure things out as I go, which is part of how I ended up doing so many different things. I even taught myself a little bit of code to make the website look the way I wanted it to. 

My question is: what job title does this reflect? I've looked at copywriter positions but I'm not sure I really want to move in that direction, and I think my skillset after all this time is a little different than when I started. 

Thank you so much for your help!"

I have been working as a nanny for a little bit over 6 years now. I live with boyfriend in a small town A since 2022. Both me and my boyfriend have struggled to find a good paying job here. So I started looking in a bigger city B that offers more jobs. City B is quite expensive though. Rent is a little more of what we’re paying. I have already started interviewing with different families and I know I can get this job easily because of my experience and most nanny jobs want you start within 2 weeks, sometimes right away.   
I was thinking of renting a room (month to month contract) for about 2-5 months for $800-900. My boyfriend is a truck driver on the road by the way. He takes care of our rent, I just pay the utilities. If all goes well, I was planning to post our apartment for someone to take over the lease and to move to area B. Is this a good plan? Am I missing something? This job is offering $24,000 more than what I’m getting paid right now!"

So then I apologized and said as mentioned last week in our quarterly review (which was fine ) that there is one process that is extremely manual and takes a very long time to do so that’s why I got sidetracked. I told my boss I’m not trying to make an excuse but just giving you an explanation. I apologized again, ensured this wasn’t going to happen again, and that I appreciated the honest feedback.

My boss just said we’ll discuss it in our one on one this week. 

I’m terrified because this is my first time a boss ever told me they’re disappointed and also concerned because our former coworker who got the disappointed comment received a PIP the following month and was let go

He’s a little timid and newer to being a manager (coming on two years). I really like to believe he’s doing his best, but I am often frustrated with our conversations and interactions. For example him and I will have a conversation about holding off or completely not moving forward with a task or project. Then two days later he will ask me when I plan on doing said thing we discussed two days ago we were holding off/not doing. I feel like I am constantly having to say “remember we talked about…” I feel like that can’t make anyone feel good and it makes me feel like I’m being passive aggressive. Once I say that he compliments me and says I’m the best and almost seems like he’s panicked or scrambling. This happens at least 3-4 times a week. I’ve now started to screenshot conversations we have and send them to him when he asks me things like this. Is this too harsh? I just worry that if something doesn’t get done that we discussed we weren’t doing, I’ll be thrown under the bus by him just based on his panicked and scattered brain responses. He seems to like to act like he’s on top of things, but it feels like 99% of our interactions are confusion or reminders of detailed conversations.

Any advice how to talk to him about this without offending him?"

So the application for the job required submitting a resume and a portfolio. But when they responded requesting a job interview, they asked very basic questions like ""tell me about your current job,"" ""do you have a degree,"" ""can you cover the requested work hours,"" etc. I mean, obviously I wrote them a detailed cover letter and if they'd taken a look at my resume all this would be obvious. 

And during the Zoom interview they asked me to do a typing test and the rest of the interview questions were basically the same. Told me to basically reiterate work and education information already in my resume. They didn't ask any questions based on my resume or portfolio. 

So the job advert was for a content writer, which means a person who writes things like blog posts and press releases for a company. But it did include a job responsibility saying ""data entry between departments.""

About 6 years ago my husband and I decided to move \~19 hours away from our home state for work opportunities. A few months ago, we decided that we'd like to move back due to family illness and general homesickness.

My husband is in the medical field (he was the reason we were able to come out here in the first place), and since he would have little trouble finding a job, we determined it would be up to me getting a job to start our move back. I'm in the creative field and my work tends to be a lot more competitive.

The problem I've been running into however, is that while I've been getting a good amount of interest when I apply to local positions, if I mention that I'm planning on relocating the moment I get employment I get ghosted or rejected. I make it very clear in my resume and portfolio that I'm relocating. I'm getting to the point now where I feel like I am going to have to tell some white lies in order to get a chance. I'm not asking for a relocation bonus or looking for remote work. We are fortunate to have friends, family, and opportunity for places to stay in our home state. I would prefer not to drop $600 for a plane ticket for a simple interview for the *chance* at getting a job.

I have TWO separate interviews coming up next week and I am nervous for when this point comes up. What do I do? I could say that my husband has gotten a new job and we are actively in the process of moving, but what if they want to wait to see me in person?

If anyone has any advice on what to say or if anyone has gone though a similar situation I'd appreciate it so much. This has been causing me a good deal of stress.

It is especially difficult to learn since my team is all offshore, and any mistakes I have made result in escalation on a department level with all eyes on me. 
I want to be able to learn and grow more in the space but the stress is driving me crazy, plus it includes extended hours going into night time during the week and occasionally on the weekends. Would it be right to leave without anything lined up? I’m trying to weigh my pros and cons but it’s becoming unbearable to stay here."

I actually put myself down and decided I had made a mistake, they were constantly ringing me so in the end I decided to answer. I was honest with them and they said they would be willing to complete my training. So I went for the interview and it went really well and lasted 2 hours. He was saying how they will train me, how long it will take, how they cant wait to get going with it etc, showed me around, was talking personally with each other. I also know some people working here, I hope that is a good thing, Ive never knowingly done anything wrong to these people. 

He said he would let me know early last week, so I thought Monday-Wednesday. He also said I could text him with any questions I had regarding the role. It got to Thursday so I text asking him if he is any further along with my application, no reply. I'm not even overly bothered If I haven't got the job its the ghosting me that has infuriated me.

Should I do it?,u/Junior-Bunch-7326,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/124w8v1/resigning_via_email_should_i_do_it/,jobs,"I work as an Optometric Assistant at a doctor's office here in CA. It is a full time job with anywhere between 32-40 hours, $15 minimum wage pay and offers no benefits. Despite informing my employer of my school schedule, I am a full time college student, my shifts always interfere with classes. Additionally, there are a lot of changes happening in my life with my parents and overall dynamic of the house that I feel have not and will now allow me to fulfill my duties in the near future. It is a busy but small business, and since it is a medical/professional setting it is required that I make him aware of my resignation at least 3-4 weeks in advance in order for him to find coverage. 

My boss is also somewhat of an issue. I cannot imagine the stress and busy life he carries having to manage his offices, payroll, etc. But there have been a few instances in which I've had family emergencies (a reason for which I want to resign) and he seems to be put off by me calling in/asking to leave early/asking to work a shorter shift. About 2 weeks ago I was in a car accident and I informed him. Later that same night he asked me to cover a shift for someone - it kinda felt like he was disregarding the accident and the fact that I literally had no means of transportation, I was in pain, and that I was just completely spooked over how scary it all was. Besides that, he can be very passive aggressive and makes it very obvious how he values making money and looking good in front of patients despite us dealing with all kinds of bs. The pay is not the best for the position either and having no benefits whatsoever also puts me off. 

I see him often but he works in his other offices/different locations a few days a week. I was wondering if it would be professional of me to resign over e-mail first. I think that is what would, personally, make me feel more comfortable before speaking to him in person. Of course, I would comply speaking with him one on one if he asks to do so. Just thought I'd ask!"

In the last couple of years I gained some extensive experience in a bit of a niche job (centrifugal tumbling/mass finishing at a piercing jewelry manufacturer). I set up the program, picked out the machines, tested and selected the tumbling media and maintained the machines. I was good at it, I enjoyed it and I made decent money but due to a toxic work environment I had to leave. I've been bouncing from shitty job to shitty job since last summer. 

I'd love to get back into doing that (it's a process that can work for a number of industries including but not limitef to jewelry, maxhine shops, 3d printing, dental and medical prosthetics omong others) but there isn't a single company in my region that uses the process. Moving isn't an option as my wife has a degenerative arthritic condition that will eventually leave her crippled and we are already starting to rely on family to help take care of her. 

I'd love to work with a business person to start a new company or find an established company to set up and run a program for though I'm not sure how to approach anyone. I've always been an employee, though I have often enough been a foreman, lead hand or shop manager (usually in industrial construction roles over the last 20 years). 

Money is running out and I'm feeling defeated after so many years of pouring literal blood and sweat into other companies only to be cast aside when they need to show growth for the next quarter. I'm physically not able to work in construction any longer as the wear and tear and injuries have  piled up. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks."

1,2023-03-28,Should I tell my boss in my resignation letter that the reason I wanna go is her b*tchy consultant friend?,u/Public-Can-7590,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/124ypvq/should_i_tell_my_boss_in_my_resignation_letter/,jobs,"Today I decided to resign from my job. I’ve been really unsure about it for a while, but today, something really it triggered me. To give you some context I work as a marketing coordinator in an entry-level job, with an entry-level salary, while covering managerial tasks. 

My boss decided to hire her friend as a marketing consultant to our department. I’m all for having someone experienced as an added value to our team &amp; for me to learn from them, but ever since the woman came all she’s done is criticize us, especially me. It’s literally only been two days! 

The first video I showed her was about me explaining a new promotion we have going on. She criticized how I apparently wore too much make up on the video; and mind you I made sure it wasn’t a lot. I’m not stupid. Then I sent a post I designed for Instagram which follows a certain template, and for that simple visual with barely 2 words on it, she had five comments to give me. She also complained about us not having enough Instagram followers without even asking to see reports showing our progress. 

My last straw was today, when I sent a video marketing the coffee we sell in our stores:  1) she didn’t like how the guys talked 2) she thought his shirt was short -when it was just fit- 3) she thought it was too detailed -video was 49 sec- 4) she thought we needed to focus on one type of coffee instead of the whole machine. If she asked to make the video shorter, I would’ve been fine with it but I know my audience, I know what they like, and I know what product I should be showcasing in my video. Numbers don’t lie and it’s very unprofessional for her to be giving feedback solely based on personal preferences.

She cant just come out of nowhere, and not ask for any reports, not ask about our strategies, not try to understand how we work, not even ask for any context, and just start being bossy and criticizing everything we do simply to seem relevant. On top of that, I feel betrayed by my boss; instead of standing up for her team, she’s been clapping and supporting her friend/consultant. As far as I’m concerned, that new woman is not qualified to be giving us orders and feedback. From what I’ve seen she has no clue how social media works. 

And so I’ve decided to resign as soon as I get a new job. So should I tell my boss in my resignation letter that the reason I wanna go is her b*tchy consultant friend?  I’m honestly dying to give her a peace of my mind.

TL;DR: boss hired new friend as a consultant for our department, and all the latter has done is criticize my work without viewing reports or asking about my strategy. Now I wanna resign now."

I don't know if it's just me but if i'm in a meeting, i tend to just listen mostly (especially if it's a new topic) and very rarely does a thought come across my mind for me to ask or say anything in the meeting  - i guess that's just me processing things. 

However i am now getting quite conscious how i am coming across and i've noticed that my colleagues  always seem to have something to say regarding whatever topic (workwise) that comes up in a meeting . 

When available i try to read up on any materials provided before meetings. 

Is there anything i could do to change this?"

A bit of backstory…I am 28 and returned to school this past Fall to get my degree in construction management. I have about 10 years of residential experience building custom homes with my father. After graduating, I plan to work in the commercial industry and have two companies that I WANT to work for and are my top choices. Company A and Company B. 

-I will be graduating Spring of ‘24. 

-I have my first internship this coming summer (2023) with Company B that starts in May. 

-I have received a job offer from Company A for a full-time position after I graduate in 2024. I never applied for this position. They reached out to me and offered it. 
They have given me a deadline of Dec 4 to decide (I asked for at least mid-summer to decide). 

-I have high faith that Company B will offer a position, but they don’t start that process till mid summer. 

————-

-My fear is that if I wait to accept Company A, even though they have obviously shown they want me, that the position will be filled in this time frame. 

-If I accept Company A now, but later decide I want B, I don’t want to burn any bridges by rescinding my offer. 

-Do I push more to Company B and explicitly tell them I have an offer already and see what their move is? 

I would like to add that as of right now, these two companies are neck and neck in my eyes. Company A may have a lead at the moment because I’ve gotten to job shadow and work with them before. I see how they operate. BUT I will see more of Company B this coming summer. 

Thank you!"

The salary range for this current job is 48k-55k and I am planning to only ask for 2k more. Would it be inappropriate to ask the recruiter if it's possible to have my salary closer to or at 50,000? Would it be inappropriate to ask for more, and ask for potentially 52k? This is for a development associate position, and the only leverage I could bring up is that I have a masters degree ( should i use that as leverage?)

I’m really just looking for suggestions in other jobs. I’m currently a design engineer for a smallish local company (sub 100 employees). 
I think I just need to get away from being at a computer screen 9h a day 5days a week. So changing companies wouldn’t necessarily help in this. I don’t want to throw away the last 5 years experience to start again but I feel as if I might. The salary isn’t exactly great (under £30k). I do have a degree but it’s semi unrelated and I’ve decided against pursuing that path. I think I want something that is more hands on or let’s me get away from a screen for the majority of the week but still has great future potential. I need help and suggestions ideally from someone who’s had similar issues. 
First time post so if there is something wrong or I haven’t done let me know :) thanks"

This current job I’m going for has been very different, as I am having a 6th and 7th interview tomorrow which breaks my record for most toward a single position. The 6th interview is with some peers at my similar level (I’ve met with every higher up on the org chart) and the 7th interview is with someone having a title “Senior Consultant: Talent Acquisition” and she does not work for the university. 

What do you think this would be? I specifically spoke to HR in the beginning and we already talked salary expectations, so I‘d imagine if it were the typical references/background check stage it would be HR again. Maybe this is to get my opinion on how the process went/see if I still want the job? Anyone meet with someone like this?"

I’ve since completely wiped the email from my account, so I’m not too worried about any hacking or anything, but my employer hasn’t responded at all. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. Should I just leave it and wait for them to say something or should I email them and apologize for getting ahead of myself after a certain amount of days?

They realized that this is high-level work so they wanted to compensate me. I was SO HAPPY like finally I will get paid! I discussed with them back and forth and the way that they tried to pay me didn't work out (Basically, they wanted me to charge them as an external consultant but I do not have the business license to operate as a business.

I am still doing the other work that my boss assigned. I have been discussing new roles within the company with several departments but it is still an ongoing process. I have been interviewing and finding jobs as well. I just did not work on that project and intend not to do it until the payment is sorted out.

I love the organization's mission and its commitment to persevering in these uncertain economic times. However, I'm carrying a pit of ever-growing anxiety in the pit of my stomach when thinking about fundraising shortfalls and the absence of clean, clear and updated documentation as the nonprofit moves into its busiest season of the year.

Given that the CEO is going through some serious personal issues and my peers are feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities themselves, it's not a good time to share my concerns. I don't know how sympathetic they would be to learn their newest team member is deciding to leave because of organizational and financial stability issues.

For the time being, I am keeping up with my assignments and working as if everything is fine. I don't plan to give any more than the standard two-week notice period.

Is there anything I should be doing to collect information for myself? Create how-to guides and checklists for whomever takes on the responsibilities?

Lastly, because I will have occupied the position for a few months, what should I say in my resignation letter?

I’m hoping to get some advice from the Reddit world as I’m torn and have never had two job offers at once. My wife and I are pretty young (almost 30) and we eventually aim to have a house and a kid. 

I’m not going to be super specific due to privacy. I’m located in California Central Valley area. I have two different job offers:

Job 1: located in Sacramento (roughly an hour or so from where I live). This job is in my field that I went to school for and I know I would do just fine in it. The pay is more than I’m making now and would lead to gaining more experience than I can get at my current job (though, not that much more experience). They would want me to eventually make the move within 6 months or so of me working there. My wife works mostly remote and would still be able to meet occasional in-office days as needed. 

Job 2: located in Las Vegas. This job is not in my field, but I have family on the hiring side and am basically getting in on nepotism. The pay is more than I’m making at current job and is just barely more than what Job 1 is offering. I would have to move (obviously) and family is willing to put us up for a month. My wife would eventually lose her current job probably after a 1-3 month grace period. 

I’m stuck because while job 1 is in my field and I enjoy that type of work, it’s probably not something I can get very far in life in (it’s science on the environmental/ecology side so no one cares). Job 2 is kind of scary because it’s a whole new field, though I’ll have on the job training and I’ve been assured I can do it (it’s entry level construction project management and admin work). Job 2 comes with perks like my own work truck that company pays for. 

Vegas (job 2) also seems cheaper on the housing side when compared to California and the Sacramento area (job 1), so my wife and I will probably get a better value of house for less cost. 

Please let me know your initial thoughts or questions! I’m super appreciative of any advice!"
0,2023-03-28,Prospective employer contacted my current supervisor for reference before sending me offer letter? How do I navigate this?,u/fordilhp65,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12565gz/prospective_employer_contacted_my_current/,jobs,"So I technically received a “verbal offer” with this new employer a month ago - however salary has yet to be finalized. A few days ago they asked me to fill out a verification of release form, which is where I list my references, including my current employer. There is no “I do not wish to have them contacted” option on the form. I signed off on it, which means they technically have the legal right to contact anyone listed. 

I didn’t want to omit my current employer  because they make up 90% of the relevant experience I have for this job - so I wrote my supervisors information down. They told me that this a last step before they would send me a “conditional offer letter”. In previous experiences, they send a conditional offer letter and then begin contacting your employers for references. I mistakenly assumed the same applies here.

I was waiting to receive the letter before telling my boss. He messages me today saying he received a reference request from my prospective employer, and was shocked. 

In the end, I spoke to him and was upfront and honest about why I applied (location, family..etc) and he understood - but I am extremely fucking anxious now because I don’t have an offer letter in hand, and my future at this job is now obviously in jeopardy. I probably also overshared in a the heat of this anxiety. 

I’m not worried about my boss speaking negatively in my reference, but I’m just irritated at the prospective employer. Is this normal? I thought it was common courtesy not to contact current employers without a heads up. But technically I did give them permission via that form so I recognize it’s on me.

Is it reasonable of me to apply pressure on my prospective employer for an offer letter given the circumstances? Or should I just leave it alone?"

There is no one reason why I wanted to quit. But I guess the last straw was my performance review. Long story short, I was hired on to do data analytics work. Then the team went in a different direction and I didn’t end up doing much data work. As a result I’m not performing tasks I’m good at and is perceived to be just barely meeting expectations.

I don’t see myself as having much development opportunities in this role and my mental health is suffering due to the constant criticism I receive.

I used to have a good relationship with my team but due to my declining mental health I haven’t really been sociable for a few months at this point.

I don’t want to burn bridges but also want to clear that the issue isn’t me, it’s them. What should/can I say?

Update: my manager found out because I’ve been backing up my personal files and templates into SharePoint drive, complete with notes and instructions on how to do my daily duties. I want to be able to leave ASAP without causing my coworkers too much trouble.

But now I want more. I have nearly two years of experience and I don’t want to settle and end up with another toxic job. That’s the one reason I haven’t done the spray and pray method.

I stopped him before he walked past me and asked him what was going on with his coat. He told me that it was his favorite chef’s coat, so he had his grandmother cut the logo out of the brand new coats we gave him and sew them onto his old dingy one.

He didn’t last long. I sometimes wonder if he’s still wearing that coat?

Another time I went to the back dining room to meet a line cook candidate. I scanned the room, which had some of our staff members lounging in it, but didn’t see the guy. Then I noticed someone waving their hand at me. It was a strange face, but he was wearing one of our chef’s coats. I sat down with him and asked him where he got the dingy old coat.

The state of the distribution area is terrible it's been over capacity for 6months and the director keeps ordering more containers even though we can barely fit any more pallets of goods inside. Most of our products require manual labelling and we are behind 4 containers worth of workload, even if we hire people there's no space to work or even walk unless we take 2hrs taking pallets outside.

It's not an exaggeration to say everyone hates him, the guy has never worked a single day of his life only knows how to give commands.He even makes his 2 merchandisers load up their cars with at least $4000 worth of loose items for self delivery but they can't even see the rear mirror with all the goods in the way. If that wasn't bad enough he makes them deliver raw meat which is part of his own personal business nothing to do with the wharehouse.

I know it sounds like I'm complaining but my boss often orders the director to help but he causes more damage than help. Empty boxes are left where they were, he expects us to clean up after him every time and the few times he does clean them up it gets dumped in my packing area.

The only forklift we have is a small electric one which no one has a licence for and when this guy uses it for his personal business he blocks off the whole walkway and the whole team has to wait for him to finish and we can't get any work done at that time. Not to mention he takes away equipment need for work and misplaced them or never returns it

During busy periods we aren't able to meet deadlines, yet the director will lie to the boss about it making him need to call in the merchandisers to come in and help label for 3hrs of unpaid overtime with us. He has conflicts with us often and whenever something happens which he is at fault for he reports it to the boss but in a way that makes it sound like he is always in the right.

I've been here for a long time and the situation is only getting worse, we started ignoring him as a temporary measure but I think this is manpower abuse and safety hazards are being ignored my team leader even has to stay behind until 7pm sometimes 9pm to clean up the place when work is supposed to end at 5pm and it's all unpaid work.

If those people knew about it beforehand no one told me shit😒 

Anyways my entire evaluation was spent talking about my team lead (because i guess her stupid ass complained about me) but it was posed to me as “how is everything going for you? How are you communicating with your team?” I stood my ground on “I think everything is going well.” Because I was not about to go into complaining about stupid bitches because fuck them. We spent a really long time discussing her and her job duties at MY evaluation. 

It bothered me. They tried to put words in my mouth and I corrected them. They said “it seems you’re frustrated with…so and so” and I was like “I wouldn’t say I’m frustrated.” 

Then they said I need to show up on time because i was 10 mins late today and I said “yes I’ll take ownership of this, I have a hard time getting here on time, but I’m alway here within 15 minutes of my start time, but I will work on it” To which they said that when I’m not here on time it creates stress for my team because they don’t know if I’m going to show up or not 😒 That sounds insane af to me.

Then I asked if I could work a hybrid schedule and they basically said no and then said they would think about it and I asked “when will you get back to me?” And they said next week.

Then they asked if I had any more questions and I said “well, am I doing well????” To which they said I don’t really work with you one on one but as long as you’re doing your job…


All I got from this is that I better start showing up on time or I’ll get fired? and that I should ask my team lead more questions but to not interrupt her either. 

DF kind of evaluation is this? 🙄😒 Guess i have to show up on time now and keep looking for a new job."

My boss (and the team) knew I potentially wouldn't stick it out, and I knew I just needed to support myself until I finished my degree, so at the time of hire my understanding was that I would do the job and do it well. And if there were tasks that required more experience, my boss would keep me in mind for that type of work to keep me from getting too bored (their words, not mine).

Over the course of the past few months, however, my boss has increasingly questioned me about why I'm not doing more since I am earning an advanced degree - the type of work they expect from me is more of a leadership position where I submit business cases for program improvement and development. But they said prior that THEY were going to pull me into projects (which they didn't), and that while I am looking at process improvement, I believe I am not being compensated properly for the type of work they are thinking of (I am making at least 10k less than my co-worker who has the same role and who does not have the same expectations placed on them). My boss also doesn't spend much time managing us because they are stretched thin focusing on another team, and was assuming I was looking at our program improvement on my own (I've been there just over half a year...)

Some of their reasoning is their own personal experience where they chose to do extra work outside the guidance of their boss because they were eyeballing a director position and knew what it would take to qualify themselves for the position above their boss. They also constantly tell me how they put a good word in for me with leadership who are potentially looking at reorganization, but that they can't really recommend me for a role if I don't go above and beyond in my work. It's this weird statement that they can't show management work I haven't done, even though I don't even know if I want to stay at this organization.

On top of this, when I agreed to take the role for lower salary due to union agreement restrictions, they said I would earn a 2 step increase upon my annual review. I was just informed, however, that I would not earn more than a 1 step increase because my work wasn't ""excellent"" - again, I wasn't submitting business cases or taking initiative on tasks that are above and beyond the call of duty, that it is too late to do anything about it now and they cannot request a 2 step if they can't prove that I deserve it. Which was an expectation never explicitly stated when we agreed to salary.

Long read but my question is - 

Am I getting yanked around, is it inappropriate that my boss expects me to do work that I'm not being properly compensated for?

Alternatively

Am I wrong for not taking extraordinary steps to do work above and beyond the expected duties of an entry level position, regardless of the pay (work I am more than capable of)? Does that make me look bad in the eyes of management?"

Basically what the title says. Here is some more context regarding my situation.

I'm not meeting the ""calls per hour"" expectations the company has despite the overwhelmingly high surveys and customer reviews.

I've been on a PIP for almost 2 months and theres only 1.5 weeks left. It's unrealistic for me to reach the mark they're asking for and even if I did, the case work would only pile up and I'd dread going to work every day knowing they'd want the numbers even higher. It's quantity over quality.

I am not concerned about nor will I seek unemployment benefits. I'm fortunate enough to have had some interviews I've taken part of and am hoping for some phone calls soon. I've reactivated food delivery services so that I can earn some money in the meanwhile during the search. I can even get some work with the family business as well.

I just want to know if its better that I submit a letter of resignation (two weeks) the final day of the PIP period or that I wait to be terminated. I'm not even sure there are severance packages for performance terminated employees.

Would being terminated for performance be a Yes  for ""eligible for rehire""? If not, does resigning even change that? 

Any input would be appreciated,

Thanks!

** EDIT:
Thanks so much for all the input! All of the different scenarios and ideas are appreciated. I just wanted to clear some things up as well

1) I do have a pt job but asking for more hours is not an option. Even if I got ft hours there it’s not a livable wage to support my bills and rent. 

2) unemployment is something I’ve dealt w before and it was nothing but trouble. I lost a job during Covid and filed. Then come to find out I was put on back pay because I had a part time job when I lost my ft job so they basically made me pay back what was given even though I needed the $. I barely cleared that debt not long ago. That’s why I don’t mind quitting in lieu of no unemployment. 

3) the eligible for rehire part is more for when I interview at new places. Typically they’ll ask the old employer if the applicant is eligible for rehire. It’s not for my current soon-to-be-ex employer.

4) I’m basically killing time these last 2 weeks. My last check is mid April if I fill in these last 7 business days. So I know I have one more check coming after this Friday. I would’ve quit weeks ago but knew I could still get an extra couple of checks when they basically gave me a final warning on PIP.

Typing all this while getting ready for work lol but I’ll check back during lunch. 

7 more days 🤞"
1,2023-03-28,Retail vs. Pub Job and Mental Health,u/mnsbelle,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1259bvv/retail_vs_pub_job_and_mental_health/,jobs,"Hello, 26[F] from London, UK. I'm interviewing for two jobs this week. One with a retail store and one with a pub but I'm trying to decide which I'd be best suited to. My previous job history was working in an art gallery, doing social media and ambassadorships at university.


I've been out of proper employment for about 5 years due to my poor mental health. I'm bipolar type one with treatment resistant depression and I suffer from anxiety disorders as well as agoraphobia. So I've known I'm not very reliable when it comes to mind mood if I'm in a bad way. I'm doing a bit better now and really need some work.


The retail job is low pressure but I'd have to commute to central London which makes me very anxious as I have a particular anxiety around travel. But the pub job is more local but it could be subject to a higher pressure environment. And more difficult customers. 


In an ideal world I would choose retail locally but that's not an option. So I was wondering which would serve me best given my condition. A friend mentioned that I'd meet a lot of people at the pub which is a plus for me as that's also part of my motivation for working is to make friends. I know people say that retail is the worst but this is a higher end company that also sells home goods. So it's not as stressful as somewhere like Primark for example.


I was also wondering, which environment is best for if I'm having a bad day or something. talking to my therapist she said she'd be fine with someone not all happy and smiley at the pub as long as the service is good. but in retail I don't know if I could get away with that.


Thanks if you've read this far and have any advice for me. Appreciate it."

I used to do many jobs, most of which I hated and felt really bad at my workplace. I used to work on a construction site, at a car wash, as a waiter, welder, etc. I found all these jobs very boring.

3 years ago, I started working as a helpdesk IT technician. I still work at this job. I fix computer system issues remotely through my laptop, and I work from home. This job is the first job that I worked and that I don't find boring.  It's fun, and I enjoy talking to people in a foreign language because our customers are foreigners. I enjoy working on IT issues, working in different programs, having different browsers open, etc. There's lots of multitasking too. I guess I like that the job is dynamic and that I get to do many different tasks during my 8-hour shift as opposed to the jobs that I used to work before where I would get to perform only a couple of repetitive boring tasks. 

At my previous jobs, I kind of felt I didn't like being stuck at one place for too long. For example, working as a welder in a hall for 8 hours felt depressing and too static. Now that I work from home I'm still static but for some reason, I don't have that feeling that I'm at a place where I don't wanna be for 8 hours, and it doesn't feel static, I guess I don't feel static because I get immersed into the job because it's fun so I don't mind that I'm at one place all the time (in my room).

Now I have an opportunity to complete training and then work as a train driver in Germany, where I would get to live in a better country and where I would get a better salary than the one that I have now. How do I tell if I'm gonna like that job or not before I actually start doing it? Any advice?"

I’m still working 40 hours a week with this company, just have the ability to take unpaid time off pretty much whenever. It’s a super flexible gig. I just accepted a new job today in a trade that I’ve been trying to get into for a while. Substantial pay raise from what I’m making now, and it’s the industry I want to be in. My question is would you all recommend staying on with current company for a shift a week? 
Work has the potential to slow down a little in winter being a trade but not a whole lot. 
My main reason for asking is my current company gives out a large bonus in May, and we receive our re-up on vacation days which I could cash out. 
I’m hesitant to stay around 1 day week because I feel like I’m going to end up getting sucked back in to the old job. It’s a very good company, but very bonus oriented, and pushy. 
I will also be working 40-54 hours a week @ new job. Just looking for advice from someone who’s been in similar situation.

I’m at the beginning of my career.

I work for an international company, making less than ideal &lt;500€ on a 8 hours x 5 days a week job. I do nothing here. They don’t need me, at all. I struggle to find something to do during the days I am in office (2 hybrid ). My entire work a month consists in max. 1 hour.

I managed to get a job, call it J2 at an international company. Here I will really learn and do things. I also have another job I can choose.

I can either stay here, do nothing and wait for the other job or go for the J2.

I’m struggling with my decision ( I’m depressed ).
I don’t really like the people here, they are fake and make snarky comments. Some are ok.


What would be the best option for me ? ( of course, I should know best ) but from a CV point of view, taking the new job and then hopping off if I don’t like it in less than 6 months will be frowned upon ?"

Two years ago I was applying to several companies and I almost made it, I was interviewed and I passed all the tests; but two years later I'm not even called or given a chance with the same resume and I think it's because of the gap.

I was thinking I could write down in the resume that I was taking care of my disabled grandparent. I mean it's true, I lived with my disabled grandparent and all this time I took care of them, I took them to the doctor, I did all their errands, I did the cleaning, laundry, helped them with their health issues... Other relative is taking care of them now so I'm free to get a job and live my life. 

Do you guys think it is a good idea? Or should I just keep sending the same old, boring resume that says I worked and studied until 2021?

On a daily I deal with nerve root compression, dull pain in my back and legs, trouble bending and standing, and even trouble holding my pee, as embarrassing as that is. 

I’m a 23 year old man with bills and deadlines. I need to make a certain amount to survive (at least $2000 a month) so I’ve been working as a package delivery driver since 2021. The job itself can be hard on my body, it involves heavy lifting (no more than 35 pounds) and driving for a long period of time. I enjoy what I do, but once again I’m having trouble going to work each day and completing my entire day. 

I’m looking for advice from people in a similar situation to the one I am in, and I am seeking a good career path to take with this lifelong injury. I want to work, disability is an “option” for me, however with rent and a car payment, I couldn’t afford to not work for several months to be eligible to qualify for SSDI.

I haven’t been working to the job level standards of the role I’m in. This has been mentioned a couple times by my manager. I have been working very hard to try and achieve everything needed, but it’s not good enough. My boss said that for my 6 month probation review, HR will do a performance assessment to see if I’m suitable (2-3 weeks away) I don’t see myself succeeding… I am in a job level that require a bit more experience (speed, confidence, ability to manage several projects). I am a young worker and don’t have what my manager is after.

Should I resign now or go through the HR assessment?
Reasons I am considering to resign is to save my confidence, it has been very low for the last 2 months. My manager doesn’t see any improvements although I am working hard, staying after contracted hours and missing majority of my lunch break to try and improve my performance (only small talk with colleagues and I’m not on my phone)

She always says what’s on her mind and isn’t afraid to contradict you if she has a different opinion and she sometimes makes fun of you. I’m trying my best not to blow up with her comments. And today I almost lost it.

Another coworker with whom I have a crush on asked everyone if they had an iPhone charger. I do, but i was using it to charge my phone. And I was like, “I got one! But I’m using it, but I have no problem lending it because I have some battery left on my phone”. And he was like “sure?” And I was like “yeah I think! It’s the same to me”. And then this coworker that I disliked said in front of everyone “well you don’t seem very convinced to lending your phone charger haha you’re like yeah but no but yeah” in front of the whole office and in front of my crush, and in front of my boss. 

I wanted to hit her in the face and tell her the worst words but I couldn’t do it, so I borrowed the phone charger and I gave it to my crush. 

Afterwards, she wanted to ask me some stuff about a code I wrote, (I’m a programmer), and I was at my limit. I was like wtf does she want. I looked annoyed and talked to her like what do you want now? Another coworker of mine laughed slightly because of how annoyed I was. 

I’ve been here in this job since June 2022. A lot of months where I have ignored this girls comments and stupid remarks. For example today I told her that there was a lot of stuff to study for uni, and she was like “are you kidding? You’re worse than me lol it’s not a lot to study! Lol” and I was like “well to me it is a lot…” she always contradicts me and wants to shove down my throat her opinions and she’s annoying as fuck. The worst thing is that this semester I have a group with her at uni. 

I feel like she is very passive aggressive I’ve when she talks to me and it’s not only me, she is like this with other coworkers too. How can I do to ignore her ?"

And, well… it’s having an effect. I had no bites for ages, and am now reliably getting interviews (I think winter is just a doldrum for hiring in some ways). But I know you should keep applying until you get a new job and it is official, so I’m trying to keep up…and failing.

My computer has been sitting shut for several days. I can’t open it. I can’t apply for jobs. If you told me the world was going to end if I didn’t apply, I still don’t think I’d be able to muster the nerve. Realistically, the worst that could happen would be to get rejected again, which is not that bad an outcome. But somehow I can’t face it. 

The worst part is, there’s no hope of getting treatment for my anxiety without more money/a job with benefits. I live in Canada, but mental health stuff is usually not covered. So I’m just stuck in this ridiculous standoff with my laptop. I try to do household chores and things to at least keep moving, but it feels like things that used to take minutes now take hours.

It’s also really affecting my moods. I cry a lot. I get resentful. Frankly, I’m becoming a bit of a bitch, though I keep most of it locked up inside and rarely tell anyone. 

I don’t like who I am anymore.

So even after all that it's not guaranteed for such a low paying job. If they wanted me I would have started working that day too even for that awful pay. But places just make it so ridiculously difficult to get in. If someone is really wanting to work and places need bodies just let them start.

This is my first time providing a reference and I am excited about the opportunity to help one of our students move forward in her career. 

My question has to do with a question in the reference form asking to provide 3 ways the individual could improve upon her performance. Due to the nature of the work, my oversight of her performance is largely conducted remotely and we don't check their work for correctness (due to the simplistic nature of the task). I have plenty of positives to say about her for all of the other questions, but I feel like any improvement would be a reach I'm making up to write something down and I would feel terrible saying something that could reflect negatively on her. 

Literally the best I can come up with is her work pace (fyi we collect this as a data point for our research, not bc we're horrible slave drivers. This is the most chill job and boss ive ever had) has been consistently average in comparison to her coworkers, but her productivity is higher (many have had decreased work pace over time bc of burnout and tediousness so staying consistent is not a problem for us) and attention to detail is critical for this job so rushing isn't exactly a good thing. 

Or I could say something to the effect of she could read more relevant scientific literature, but that's not an explicit expectation of the position so I feel like it's unfair to say that she could improve on something that isn't expected of her. 

Alternatively, can I just say due to the nature of the work and the remote oversight, I cant comment on any areas of improvement? Is that a cop out or would that reflect poorly upon her? My boss will also be providing her a reference for her, so I feel like if he says something and I dont, then it makes my lack of experience clear to the recruiters and reflects poorly on me (and therefore possibly on her for choosing me as her reference). 

Sorry for the huge block of text!!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Edit. Additional question, can I mention a role she had previously that was on an earlier edition of her resume that had since been removed for space reasons? It seems relevant to the point I'm making, but it's external information the recruiter wouldn't have so I'm not sure if that would be considered a good practice or not."

I blame the company for me not performing well - I was employed as a junior, I had no experience going onto the field and they knew that. I was trained up by another junior - who was also let go due to poor performance, therefore how was I ever going to perform well when I have been trained up by someone else performing poorly?

I was expecting it, I knew she had been getting her documentation in place and I was unhappy so I started job searching last month. I was offered a temp position yesterday that will last for 6 months but has the potential to be extended or come on full time once the assignment is done (I plan to keep job hunting in the meantime just in case). 

I am also starting a part time position next week with really good union benefits. The part time position will require me to take a week off for training. My problem is that I can’t financially afford to sacrifice my last paycheck at my current job if I do decide to take the temp job. I am nervous that if I put in the request to take leave next week I will be fired due to the PIP. I am also concerned about taking the temp position as it will be a bit of a career change for me but I believe it has significant potential. If I take the position I will need to start by April 17th. 

I am also taking a slight pay decrease with the temp job but I feel like it’s worth it for my mental health. I also plan to use the part time job to supplement my income. I cannot afford to lose two weeks of pay in the transition. 

I need to move quickly as the recruiter needs a response today. My background check has already been completed and my offer letter has been signed. 

I know it’s hard to come back from a PIP and conversations with my manager have been strained for a while now. My current company offers unlimited FTO so I should be able to take the time but I am nervous how she will react with the PIP and short notice. 

Should I put my two weeks in today and request the leave next week? Or just go on leave and put my resignation in upon my return? 

Posting from a throwaway account as I have friends and family who know that I’m on Reddit and would like to keep this private 

TLDR: Manager put me on a PIP. I was offered a temp position that doesn’t start until April 17th. I need to take leave next week for training. Should I put my two weeks in today?"

I say ""new"" because I worked there prior to coming to my current company. The reason I left prior was turnover in our office and I was severely underpaid. I received a 50% salary increase to leave, so I did. Now 18 months later, I actually applied back to that company, but to a different office with an upgraded job title. (It's a very large company with 10,000+ employees) The new opportunity would also be fully remote as opposed to my current hybrid(3 in, 2 remote). 

Another wrench was I interviewed back in January for this same role at the same office and was not selected for the job. They said they went with a candidate with a bit more experience. 4 weeks later a recruiter reached out saying another position opened in the same office and I was selected for that job.

I don't have the counter in hand yet to be able to compare, but I was told they are putting one together. 

My dilemma is that my current company has a 60 day required notice, so I'm not supposed to start til mid-late may. &amp; It's been about 2.5 weeks since I gave them my notice. If I was to accept a counter, I'm pretty sure I'd be black listed from that company at this point, so the counter would need to be significantly better.

My current reasons for leaving this company are that I am ready to take the next step in my career and want to have the compensation to go along with it. I'm basically doing that job now, but still for roughly the same pay I was hired on at(minus a cost of living adjustment in January). 

I know the saying ""never accept a counter because it just gives them more time to replace you"". But I honestly don't think that's the case here. When I left my prior company, they made no attempt to keep me and everything I did from an education standpoint was very formal with like reimbursement and stuff like that I had to owe part of it back. My current company has invested in my education and just paid for it themselves on their corporate cards, so if I leave nothing is owed from me. I feel that's a pretty cool thing to do and show they like me. And now the fact that they want to counter shows I'm valuable in their eyes.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

My gut tells me it's not the right fit and there are a number of reasons I think it it would be a bad move, but I have a hard time saying no to anything job related, especially since this one pays fairly well.

I currently have a job that pays really well (the job I'm interviewing for could potentially pay just under $20K more). I currently work from home, which I love. I like my co-workers and supervisor and, although the job is demanding and I work a lot of overtime, I enjoy it. The reason I was initially looking is our funding is running out, but we got additional funding for another year and appear to be in good shape to get additional funding on top of that to keep our organization going. (I work in academia) So generally I like my current job.

The other position, as I mentioned, could pay as much as almost $20K more than my current position (and that's at the top of the range, so probably unlikely I would get that instead of mid-range). However, it would involve working in an office, having a huge workload (at least it looks like it from the huge long job description), would require travel and driving. I hate to travel and hate driving almost more than anything. And the job is also grant funded, so there's no guarantee in that regard. Also, I've heard that the department the new job is in is not a great department and people are leaving due to management issues (also academia). In theory it would be a good opportunity as it would utilize my degree and would be a great position as director of a program, but all the negatives are the issue.

Despite all this, I have trouble turning down an opportunity. But part of me thinks I should cancel the interview so I don't get sucked in and end up accepting a job I don't want.

Please help me with this decision. Not sure why I'm such a wimp about stuff like this."

I'm open to a couple of agencies but have applied in the last 6 months for 3 positions within one large agency. The first one I applied to last Fall was an absolute perfect fit. It was a newly created position. Paid very well, was the same job title of my most recent job but with a lot more responsibilities and interesting work. I did interview and then heard nothing, despite being told I would hear one way or another. I emailed a follow up a few weeks later, and no response. Checking several information sources, it does not appear that the job was then, or has been filled. There are a lot of changes going on with the agency then and now. That is the job I still very much want so that's why I have been keeping tabs. I believe that they are trying to fill a manager position in the office (recent listing for it this week) that the new position I interviewed for would report to and will likely readvertise \*my\* job once that manager is hired. 

With the other two jobs (same agency, different office) that I applied for in the last 6 weeks, I saw a message on Indeed that I did not meet one of the two requirements of the position. But I did. Both positions were Executive and Program Support and in addition to having 10+ years experience, I also have a Masters. 

My question is any ideas on whether or not to email the Dept of Personnel and ask about the screening process, or what to even say? Because if it's kicking me out of the running, I wonder how many other qualified, great candidates are also getting rejected for an agency that definitely needs good, solid people to help turn it around..

How many of these jobs there are possibly 5 jobs on my indeed resume. I try to manage my current resume to be less than that and jobs pertaining to the job I am applying to .. 

I keep running into this situation where 1 i find myself severely depressed working for a company that either works me and others to a pulp. 2) Toxic management and coworkers 3) no room for growth 4) Unorganized work environment 5) It being last resort or concern, the amount of pay I am getting for the experience and work I put in customer service (10 years in retail and customer service) 

It seemed like at the time some jobs were fun because of the employees but the work was never anything promising. And I know it is a dumb way to think that if a job is not self-fulfilling and I'm only in it for the paycheck that leaving it is an immature or makes me look bad in my resume despite the experience I bring. 

I am losing hope in my job search because no one is considering me at this point. and I don't know what type of job id flourish in. 

I have been searching for Job career trainings available in my area to possibly help me find something a bit more promising, but I am at the applying stage. 

I am an artsy person, but I have no bachelor's degree. I am stuck currently with only a high school diploma and if I can pay off my student bill, I can reapply this year and earn both an AA in associate and science with emphasis in Social and Behavioral, and AS in Assoicate in Art with emphasis in Liberal arts and Humanities. I'd only have 4 classes to take to get those out of the way. 

Ideally, I want something that I feel confident in sticking with Career wise and for way better pay. 

If anyone has any advice they can share and maybe some constructional input I would be more than happy to take it. 

My depression is getting the best of me at the moment, and I am trying to fight it by being more proactive about this issue."

Both my husband and I work full-time from home. I had a baby five months ago and I’ve been working a month now since I returned from maternity leave. Both my husband and I were under the impression that I can continue working and we can both take turns being with the kiddo throughout the day. Well, as it turns out, he’s a bit more needy than we expected and I’ve been meaning to quit my job and maybe take something part time instead. Since I’ve come back to work, my workload is kind of light, so I haven’t been trying to get a new job just yet, I was kind of taking my time, but just yesterday I found out that they are trying to get us to go back into office 2 to 3 times a week and increase my workload. My office is about 40 miles away from home and the commute with traffic could be like 1 to 1 1/2 hours one way. I work as a software engineer though I’m not very good at what I do. This is the first job I got in this field and it’s safe to say I’m not a fan. I have intense anxiety every time Work comes to mind and the thought that I have to go into the office now is stressing me out. My pay is pretty good and we have insurance through my job. Not my husbands.

Anyways, I guess I’ve been really struggling with when and how I should go about quitting. I really don’t want to go in the office but of course my insurance and pay is nice and if I can hold onto that as long as I could, I definitely want to. But I’m also thinking about when I do decide to quit, I don’t want to just say I’m quitting because I can’t make the commute(which is one of the reasons, but as a reminder, I just can’t work full-time anymore and do childcare). I’m paranoid that they would for some reason they would allow me to continue working from home. Because then I would have to then tell them that actually I don’t have the time either. Also, the actual money isn’t a big issue, my husband makes enough to support us, though we obviously won’t be as comfortable as we are with both of our paychecks.

OPTION 1:
So should I buy myself some time by “looking for childcare options” for the next few weeks and then end up saying that this just isn’t working for me and then quit? And also if I do that, though, my work load is still increasing so either way that’ll give me even less time for childcare but id be buying myself some more time for health insurance and paychecks.

OPTION 2: my husband was just suggesting to tell them I can’t come into the office under the assumption that they would just fire me and giving me severance.  But again, I don’t want them to make an exception for me to continue working from home and then me having to quit anyway.

OPTION 3: just quit in the next week or so, there’s no point delaying if that means things will be more difficult with an increase workload

OPTION 4: i’m open to whatever anyone may suggest….

EDIT: I just want to add that I’m not actually trying to keep this job. I don’t like it at all. ideally I’d get a part time position elsewhere. But I’m quitting this job no matter what, just a question of when …"

.customer experience specialist (four interviews AND I had to make a presentation) 💀

I have a PhD in Computer Science, Masters in Computer Graphics, a Bachelors in Mathematics, and I used to work in a big tech company in the Silicon Valley (for 4 years). Some of my previous experience is programming in C++ | Python for 3D Graphics, Machine Learning (image-based), and Research related to low-level and optimized software development. 

I recently got a job offer from a startup located in the area of Los Angeles (not close to most well know areas of LA though) with the following compensation package  
\- Base : 150k  
\- Relocation : 5K  
\- Equity : 10k (but do not have current valuation of company neither current value of one stock) which I was told is equivalent to 0.05% of the startup  
\- No bonus program neither retirement savings company match  
\- Health insurance and 3 weeks of PTO (on top of the federal holidays)  
\- Requires for me to move to LA from SF  


The startup is currently in series xxx round of funding but it is about to finish series xxx + 1 round of funding (targeting 10x the current funding | cash of the company)  
Do the compensation package sounds reasonable | fair? After researching in sites like [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) or [glassdoor.com](https://glassdoor.com) the base seems to be low considering the startup offer do not provide a bonus. I am trying to counteroffer for the base to be 180K while maintaining the other stuff of the offer the same.  
As an extra, the original job posting has a salary range of 120k - 190k and when I asked the recruiter about that range I was informed that such range is for legal purposes, they are trying to provide a base in the middle of such range, and that the company has the upper bound of 190k reserved to some people that have all the skills I showed in the interview process plus being able to manage people (although the job posting do not have any description of management for the job)"

I’m very strong at reading, writing, recalling facts (I’m a history nut) - but I’ve always sucked at math throughout my life, flunking calculus in college.

I keep hearing that data analysis needs math, and not a ton of advanced math, and that one could technically learn the math required to do this job - but I’m personally afraid that if you’re not already quantitatively-inclined, one would have a hard time excelling in this field as a data or business analyst.

Would I be better off trying to focus on being an accountant in this case? (Which only requires ultra basic math). I’m thinking of learning SQL and courses on Udemy to learn data skills, but afraid I would be wasting my time.

I was thinking about slightly embellishing by saying that these plans were made prior to the pandemic but were put on hold until reopening. The travel package was paid for and if I didn’t go, I would forfeit my travel package. I tried to see if I could have a leave of absence and it was denied, so I had no choice but to resign.

One issue I have at work, and the only thing my manager pointed out during an assessment review - i lack confidence. I rarely speak out, I have trouble standing my ground and I get easily swayed when someone confronts me on smth.

It gets better with time, I work more independently as I gain expertise and I learned to learn and let go when making mistakes, instead of actually having full on mental breakdowns over them.

But still - it's not enough. And that is usually when people older than me in age/seniority. 

I am finishing my masters now as well, and it really hit me how different I am at work and in university. I am very active during lectures, I can make a joke, and I'm not afraid to talk to professors at all. Heck, I talk even when I barely know the topic! And in group assignments (we have lots of them) - I realised we kinda always end up doing my idea lmao. I'm put together groups, organize calls, come up with ideas, I ask members to finish their parts, and my friend pointed out you can see when I'm mad because someone was late/didn't do their part.

At uni I'm highly confident - to a point someone asked me to explain a subject to them purely because ""you seemed like you get it"" (i barely did)

At work I'm rather fine with colleagues my age - but as soon as someone older is involved I pipe down quickly. I'm don't want to be disrespectful or seem stupid, so I just stay quiet most of the time.

What do I do with it?"

Hi guys, I am a Lao Creative Director and YouTube Manager with over 5 years of experience. I specialize in product (video essays), management (workflow, writers, narrators, editors, etc) and YouTube system optimization. What I do best is identifying potential (new &amp; profitable) niches through research and data analysis, and creating a self-sustainable team with a high probability of longterm growth. Essentially, I generate better odds for the content (mainly YouTube) department. 

In the past, under my direction &amp; management, my old YouTube project (owned by someone else) doubled its revenue twice, from $7k -&gt; $14k -&gt; $30k/month in around 1 year, with minimal increase in budget (Also, not mentioning the money from bookings that comes with the higher views). Sadly, my salary wasnt going up, and I also didnt get any stake in the company. So I left. After I'm gone, revenue dropped. And with the way things are being run now, it'll probably never hit $20k again, or at least will take years.

Recently, I moved to a new company. Their YouTube monthly revenue for \~10 months before I joined was \~$3k, sometimes less. Before I joined, revenue never passed $6k. But now, after 5 months and a lot of hardwork, their revenue/month is situated at \~$8k, fluctuating betweek $6k and $10k, with projections indicating that it will reach \~$20k/month at the end of this year (again, not counting money from bookings). Thus, my boss has agreed to reopen negotiation for my salary.

Now, my fixed salary is quite high in the company ($1.5k/month), since we're a startup (higher than that from my old company). It's a bit lower than what I want and what my position is getting at another city, but I'm sorta okay with that. I see myself working here longterm, so I wanna convert the salary raise and bonuses to a fixed % rate with the revenue. I'm thinking somewhere between 2-8% of the total revenue from YouTube. Because my objective is the increasing the money generating power of YouTube, thus I want my salary to be tied to it. 

I'm a technical kinda guy, so all this money thing is quite new to me. I knew that I undersold my self at the old company, therefore I dont want to repeat the same mistake twice. So... business owners, or people with experience in dealing with this stuff, is tying the revenue of a project to the salary of the one responsible for that project's growth a sound decision? Am I asking too much? Or should I just go for a bigger fixed paycheck (thinking somewhere between 20-30% increase)? How do I solve this problem?"

I've been with my company for almost 10 years now.  I am happy at my company.  Currently, I am an analyst getting paid a decent salary of $95K.  I been trying to get a promotion for 5 years now but it never materialized even though my performance reviews and 1 on 1 are great with no complaints.  

Because of the lack of upward mobility.  I been applying, interviewing and getting offers for senior analyst roles.  However, the position's salary ranges max out at around $95K. It seems like I am being paid really well for my job.  But obviously, I want a pay raise if I want to jump ship.  I have been applying for manager roles as well but I haven't been getting any interest/interviews.

So my question what do I do? 
1. Continue trying to apply and hopefully land a manager role or a senior analyst role that pays more than $95K.
2. Take a small paycut/lateral move just to position myself in another company to move up
3. Stick with it and hopefully this would be the year I get that promotion 🙃

Thanks in advance!"

Now for the past few weeks we've been getting lots of comments from higher ups saying how valuable our work is, that we've been generating lots of revenue for the company, etc and we've even expressed concerns that with our increased workload, we should be getting a bigger merit increase than what we usually get and our manager seemed to agree with us on those points.  When they got our numbers back, they were saying it won't be anything like 10% but that we should be happy that we were able to get an increase like this despite inflation, etc.  My usual increases since working for the company have been about 3% with the one exception after my first year I got over a 7% increase.  I got the email with my increase on it and it was 3.5%.  I kept looking at it and it just felt like a gut punch to me.  I didn't know what else to say in our meeting and just thanked my manager for showing me this and that was that.  I've been mulling it over all day and I feel like I need to say anything but I don't know how to address it with our current manager as they've only been our manager for less than a year now and they're still trying to understand the ins and outs of what our department does and on top of that I've discovered that our annual reviews that help determine how much of an increase we get does through a supposed third party so I'm not sure how much pull they'd be able to put in but I just feel like if I don't let them know how I feel about this, nothing is going to change."

I've had 3 Administrative Assistant interviews, but those didn't amount to anything because there were ""more qualified candidates"".

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to make a career for myself but I'm getting exhausted and demoralized. I got a 15 dollar and hour job at a call center which starts in 2 weeks for a bank. It's a temporary job. It won't pay me enough to live and I worry I'm wasting my time.

I’ve been at my company for 3.5 years and got a “very good” on one of the categories for the first time ever, so that’s exciting. However, I’ve been applying to new jobs for months and now I’m moving further away (45-60 minute commute with tolls). My pay, even with a 5% raise, just won’t cover all of my new expenses (they barely cover my current ones). I’m moving in with my bf and I told him the commute isn’t a big deal because I’m trying to leave anyway. Point being is that I don’t know what to say to my boss when we sit down and he hands me a piece of paper that says what my meager raise will be. He’ll ask me if I have any questions or input, and all I can think about is that I feel overworked and underpaid by at least 10k. He’s also seen my updated resume on Indeed and asked me about it. They wanted me to be trained on a new system (of which they already trained 3 people on, but 2 weren’t a good fit and the 3rd guy left two weeks later). He wanted to know I wasn’t going to waste time training and then leave them high and dry for a replacement. I was honest and said I was looking around but they let me train anyway. That was in November. When he tells me what my raise is, do I counter? Is it even worth possibly making things worse by even bringing up that I want to leave in the first place? Or do I just smile and take it until I finally land somewhere else and tell them how I feel then, if at all?"

I need input on whether this company unethical/illegal or not.,u/DrywallJackson,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/126c3ad/i_had_a_job_interview_today_i_need_input_on/,jobs,"I’ve been taking a shotgun approach to finding a job lately, just applying to all kinds of postings on Indeed and ZipRecruiter. Apparently one of these jobs I applied for was an “event coordinator” position at a local event management company. I had an in-person interview with them just earlier today.

The energy at the office seemed great. I could tell it was a young company, and I was stoked when I immediately got along with the interviewer over shared education paths and interests. He then started to go into what my responsibilities will be if selected. I wasn’t so alarmed at first, but as I thought about it more and more, it seemed shadier and shadier.

Evidently, if I get hired, I would be standing around at events, specifically charity fundraisers, asking people if they’d like to donate to a charity as well as explaining what the charity does. After doing this for 3–6 weeks, I believe I’d be promoted to some sort of managerial position, although I didn’t get a lot of information on what that would entail during this interview.

I really wish I got more of an explanation of what my moment-to-moment responsibilities would be, but I didn’t think to inquire further about them at this time. What I did think to ask about was the pay, as it hadn’t been advertised on the online job board.

I was told my pay would be determined by how much money I raise. I believe the number given to me was 3%. I would take home 3% of however much money I collect for charity. By the way, the charity they’re working with right now is one that provides assistance to the families of kids going through cancer treatment.

The other number I remember hearing was $540 per week. I could expect to make around $540 per week by taking 3% of all donations. I’ll do the math for you: they expect me to raise about $18,000 for charity per week (or $17,460 after you subtract my cut).

This feels wrong. I assume, if I take this job, I won’t be advertising the fact that a small part of their donations are going to me. If random people walking by knew that was the case, I feel like they’d prefer to just go donate online, where they can assume that almost 100% of their donations are going directly to the charity.

I have a follow-up interview with them tomorrow morning. I’m going to seek more clarification about my responsibilities and how the finances actually work. Maybe I’m just misunderstanding. Even if the pay comes from the charity *based on* how much money I raise, that’s still money coming out of a charity’s treasury which could be going to help people who are seriously suffering.

But while I wait to find out more, I wanted to get advice from you all.

Am I wrapped up in a scam? Is this even legal? Or is this actually just normal in the charity world? If I don’t accept this job, it’ll probably just go to some other schmuck with fewer scruples than me, so should I just take it if offered? Is this all some kind of social experiment?

Any input at all would be really helpful. Thanks!"

My last job was a short contract with AMD as a Power Management Engineer but I haven't been able to find another comparable contract since then. In the time between then and now, I've started my own computer repair business in a official capacity under an LLC but its not growing as fast as I'd like it to. I've also picked up a part time job to get something steady and to soak up time but I haven't been able to find anything at all. In the last eight months, I've gotten three interviews, one of which was the part time I'm holding, out of over 400 applications.

I've thought about taking a pay cut and jumping into culinary but that hasn't worked out in my favor either. I have training as a chef and I've kept my skills very sharp with home cooking since culinary school tends to drill certain habits and skills into you to the point that its the only way you do things. I got an interview offer there but never gotten a call back for a practical examination of my skills.

I could take a pay cut in IT as well but the pay cut is much steeper and most places never reach out, or when they do its to decline my application because I'm overqualified. I don't know what else to do. I can't live off of $15/hr on a 20 hour work week for much longer. At least its more than what unemployment benefits was giving me. I thought about going back to school to finish my culinary degree but the TSTC branch that's near me in Austin only has classes that run from 9am to 2pm , which interferes with my part time. It also wouldn't start until the fall because they don't offer a summer semester there."

I suffered an injury a few weeks ago that required surgery and has me on bedrest until roughly April 20th. I am fulltime and on medical leave, receiving pay through short-term disability. I had applied to a new job about a week before my accident and had my phone screening the day before. During my time on leave, I had an interview and was offered the position. I accepted and have orientation on May 8th, contigent on my drug screen, which will be clean. The new company has been extremely understanding through this ordeal and I am not worried about my offer being rescinded.

However, I am unsure when I should give my current employer my notice. I am a high level manager with specialized knowledge in multiple applications vital to our operation that while others should know, they do not. There are also few prospective replacements for me within my location, outside hires aren't acceptable for this position and transfers from other locations are unlikely. Essentially, they have been struggling while I've been gone and are going to be in a tough spot when I leave. This makes me want to let my manager know as soon a possible so she can start making arrangements to replace me, but I'm hesitant to make it known that I'm quitting while I'm on leave. I don't believe they would fire me for it, but I know they will be surprised and upset by my decision and right now they are my only source of income while hospital bills are piling up.

I graduated college months ago but couldn't find a job (useless degree that is only useful if going for grad school: economics + coursework in accounting). So now I'm desperate for a job.

*My job search*: Applied for 100+ positions. Interviewed for a retail position (2 back-to-back, 1 with hiring manager and then the manager) but wasn't hired. No one else has given me the opportunity to interview. I got a bunch of rejection emails and ghost rejections.

*Positions applied for*: Data entry, data analyst, banking jobs (loan assistant, teller, credit assistant, anything entry-level), administrative assistant, office receptionist, translator, retail positions for multiple corporate stores near me, bookkeeping (a/p, a/r, payroll), warehouse/stocking associates (early-morning, nothing overnight), and virtually anything marked as 'entry level' that I can see myself capable of doing or learning to do, I've applied for them.. I've applied for positions asking X years of experience whether I have that or not (because people say ""apply anyway""), positions who want applicants with X years of using programs XYZ (even if I don't, I'm willing to learn), and still, no luck.

*My work experience*: Just food service / restaurant experience (server, busser, host, cashier roles). I could apply for restaurant positions but I've avoided it because I want to gain new knowledge, new work experience outside of food service.

My parents are growing impatient and want me to get a job &amp; get out of the house already! I share their frustrations. My self-worth is going down the drain. I'm willing to take minimum wage jobs but no one will hire me.

The reason why I'm seeking positions with minimal social interaction is because I'm super introverted and don't have that charismatic charm or outgoing energy. Years in food service industry didn't really help me get better at it - I'm still as awkward as ever in social interactions! Luckily in food service, it was more or less the same drill, the same phrases. Of course the pros will make ""lasting relationships"" and really engage with customers dining-in, but I've never been the one to be that person. Friendly and welcoming as possible, smile on my face, but very short with words in-person (kind of slow, not very articulate lol).

This leads me to wondering if there are minimum-wage jobs that are less social interactions, that doesn't entail driving (i.e truck driving or food delivering) or overnight work. Is there something like that? I'm still applying to customer-service jobs because they seem to be 99% of the jobs out there, but just wanted to ask. Most my search results for ""minimal social interaction jobs"" just show positions with bachelor's/master's degrees or saturated fields like transcription."

0,2023-03-30,When should you change jobs?,u/_Rama_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/126hclb/when_should_you_change_jobs/,jobs,"Hello,   


This may be a surprising question, but it's a real thought: When should you change jobs?   


Let me explain. I have been in the job market for 4 years. I spent 3 years as a consultant, and then I was recruited in a similar structure to do the same job with of course a salary increase.   


I don't think I can say that I am ""professionally fulfilled"". BUT, I am in a comfortable situation. I earn a good living. I have a very nice client who doesn't bother me. I am good at what I do, and I do it well. And best of all, I have 3 days a week of remote work. All of this allows me to have time to focus on my other projects, without being under a lot of pressure or being overloaded (of course, during certain periods, it happens, but these are controlled and known). In other words, I am in my routine and my comfort.   


And yet, when I take the time to think about it, this question comes to my mind: That's all well and good, but when to change? What criteria should I take into account? What is the evolution I want?   


So yes, I could find a more stimulating job, where I put my heart and soul into it and get a better salary. I agree. But at what price? I would potentially have more boring contacts, less remote work or not at all. And thus, less time for my side projects. So, I was thinking about this, and in my professional development in the years to come, I felt lost. What can justify taking the risk to change?   


In this case, I did 2 companies, I changed because in the end, I was with the same client for a similar position with a higher salary. The risk is measured. Tomorrow, if I see an interesting ad from a professional point of view, but there is no more remote work OR the workload/pressure is not the same, it will inevitably disrupt my habits and my life.   


It's almost a personal development question. I was curious to know your positions on the subject."

I’ve (f) noticed that one of the managers (m)  at my job refuses to say my name when he needs to have my attention and it bothers me. He is the manager of a department I spend most of my time in therefore I have many encounters with him. We have short conversations occasionally and he also does know my name but never says it.

He will say ” excuse me ” or ” you there” or something else. When I have my headphones in and he wants my attention he will make some noise like slam a water bottle hard on the table or shuffle the trash can to get my attention instead of just saying my name. 

I wouldn’t mind if he did this to everyone but he seems to only do this to me while he uses everyone elses name. When he wants to grab someone else’s attention he will lightly pat them on the back to get their attention instead of slamming something hard on a table . I need advice on how to handle this.


Edit: 
- Everyone keeps saying he doesn’t remember my name. But when I ask him to correct something for me he does it on the spot which means he not only knows my name,  he also knows my work-ID number without me telling him. One time my coworker told him to hand me something (she said my name) and he came straight to me , which means he clearly can put a name to my face. I’m not a new employee im just back at work again for 6 months now after being on leave for a little more than a year, before that I rarely worked at his department. We work together 5 days a week and there’s not many employees per department. He makes sure to call everyone by their name , even the new girl who just started a few weeks ago. 


- As for the pronunciation I have a very easy name to pronounce and my name is only three letters , you can’t go wrong. There’s people at our job with far more complicated names than mine and he still says their name.

- Headphones- everyone at work wears headphones to block out the loud noises and to focus better on the tasks. It’s even encouraged . However,  most of the incidents where he has startled me with jarring noises have been when I wasn’t  even wearing headphones and we’ve been in close distance. 

- gender- I also keep hearing that it must be cause i’m a girl and he doesn’t know how to behave with females. My job is not a male dominated workplace, we have a fair amount of men and women of all ages and he seems to be capable to be show decency to everyone.

I can tell he’s a very awkward manager in general but atleast he seems to not startle everyone else to get their attention."

I know I got a bad review 2-3 weeks ago from a colleague regarding the speed of my work. It was also hard for me to fit in because of remote work, and the few rimes we met face to face were kind of awkward, but I am trying to break out of my shell.
Today, the new engineering manager came to me to tell me about getting into some short 10-15 min 1on1 meetings regularly and just normal stuff that didn’t raise any questions. He ended this whole discourse by saying that another topic we could cover in these meetings would be finding a new spot in another project in the company.

Can someone please tell me if I'm overreacting or if I should say something?

I'm a 16 year old girl that has somehow landed a part time job as an assistant in a head-office (I graduated high school a year younger). Although I'm under-qualified for the role, I have managed to gain respect from coworkers for my hard work and I'm very grateful for this opportunity.

A few weeks ago, a man (28M) was hired and placed next to me (we have a conjoining desk and we sit at opposite ends). When he first started we both communicated in a cordial manner and I was happy to see a fresh face at work.

But within the week I've noticed his behaviour changing (examples listed down below):

* He constantly interrupts my work to ask questions (which is fine) but then he will quickly steer the conversation to something else about his personal life and I don't really want to hear about it
* He quietly moves his roller chair in my direction and pokes me on the shoulder when asking these questions which startles me as I don't like being touched
* When I get up and go to the printer he follows me and pretends he is looking for something 
* There has been a few times where I have been discussing a tech issue with someone else and he moves over to my desk uninvited, puts his body in-front of mine to use my keyboard and cursor at my computer and tries to fix it himself. I tell him that it's fine and to go back to your desk but he doesn't listen. This also seems innocent but it feel like he jumped at the chance to 'help' so he could invade my personal space. I felt very uncomfortable in the moment but I could have also been overreacting
* I find him turning around at his desk to watch me while I'm working, but then when I look at him to ask if he needs help he says he doesn't?
* He keeps trying to play around with me by waving random objects in my face but it just startles me every time. I never engage with these actions but he keeps doing it.

We work in an open area with two managers and another full time colleague (26F). Logically, he should be asking her or the managers these questions as she has much more experience than I do, I am only a 16 year old assistant at the end of the day. Even though we share a desk he is closer to our manager and 26F so it actually makes more sense for him to be asking them questions.

He never acts this way with any one other than me which makes me feel like I'm being targeted. He also waits until times when my managers and 26F are out of the area when he does these things to me.

There have been no sexual comments/harassment/advances towards me and on paper, all of this behaviour can easily be deemed innocent which is why I know talking to my managers won't work. I don't feel like this is harassment (tell me if I'm wrong) but more of an issue where he has no self awareness?

I have tried giving him short answers, negatively reacting to him touching me by quickly moving my shoulder forward and away from him, wearing headphones, making it look like I'm really busy to give him hints that I don't want him to talk to me but he doesn't get them.

Please tell me what I can say to him, I feel so smothered, drained and emotional at my desk. I have to go on walks during my day because I feel so overwhelmed by him and it has made me dread coming into work. 

**SUMMARY**

A newly hired man (28M) keeps annoying me (16F) at work, gets up in my personal space, follows me around the office, watches me while i work, constantly asks me questions that he knows the answer to so he can start telling me about his personal life and more. He doesn't do this to anyone else, but all this can be deemed innocent so I can't tell managers he is harassing me. He is also a nice guy and is really well liked by managers (they don't see this behaviour).

Am I overreacting/how do I get him to stop?"

So I started at my job about a year and a half ago in August of 2021. I made 19 an hour plus a monthly bonus of 400 before taxes. In April of last year I got a big promotion with a 2 dollar an hour raise BUT they took the monthly bonus away. My problem here is that monthly bonus broke down to roughly 2.30 per hour. 

So basically with factoring in the bonus I actually took a 30 cent per hour pay cut. However, I didn't speak up. I should have but didn't.

This week I had my review and was told I would not be getting a raise as I have been promoted and received a raise with in the last year.


That's when I finally spoke up. I said well yes, technically I have. However for one that promotion was 11 months ago and 2 I actually didn't get a raise. This is when I showed her the breakdown of how I actually took a pay cut.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a family emergency, I am needing to take unpaid time off. Can't take FMLA. I also really don't enjoy working with an indirect supervisor of mine and the job itself does not have much work to do so I feel I am stifled by micromanagement and feel anxious, I am constantly bored during my day and I've been looking for the next best thing job-wise. For this, I'm thinking about giving a one week notice because the alternative is I am somehow not fired, come back from my leave, and I'm kind of in the doghouse and will never hear the end of it. I'd rather leave and leave fast, disregarding the conventional two week formality. I'm shielding my reasons with my family emergency because I don't want to deal with the office politics of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in my role for four months and intend to keep this job on my resume as I have gained lots of experience with it. I am not planning on using my direct supervisor as a reference. So with all of this in mind, basically, what's the repercussions of leaving an employer with inadequate notice? I am most concerned about future job verification checks with the question ""would you hire this employee again?"" ""how were they were during their time there?"" etc. These would go to the company HR person at another site, not my supervisor. FWIW, on paper I have done a stellar job and I'm not a bad employee - this situation will just tarnish my standing."

During the first 8 months my position was warehouse officer. During this 8 months, I believe that I did quite well because in the 9th month I was promoted to an office position. Sadly I found out that I don't really fit working in office. I can't really blend in with the office people, from the way I  talk to the way I present myself I just feel like I don't really connect with any of them. I feel really isolated. This also affect my performance which took a nosedive which my current supervisor took notice. 

My first thought was to ask for a demotion so I can get back to my old position but my old position has been filled in and I read that taking a demotion is not really a good idea. Better stay at my current position, suck it up and use it as leverage for job hunting. I did the latter which is fruitful because  I got an offer as a senior warehouse officer with 20% wage bump compared to my current office wage. The drawback is I have to move to another city which I'm not keen of.

My question is can I or rather should I use this offer as a bargaining chip to go back to warehouse department but with promotion to senior warehouse officer. I'm already settled in this city so if I'm okay with just 10% wage bump. I feel like I'm asking much because I'm aware that I just got a promotion, have underperformed for the last 4 months and now I'm asking for another raise."

I am an experienced, talented employee who used to have an excellent relationship with our biggest client. 

Since my manager came on board, I've slowly lost my drive. He talks incessantly, to the point I can't even speak for 45 minutes in meetings. Literally, cannot get out a sentence, even if the very first thing he said was a misunderstand and we could avoid the meeting. He wants to have these meetings multiple times a week, despite me telling him it breaks up my work flow. I have to take anxiety medication to be in meetings with him. 

He has to read every email I write before I send it out. He has to have a summary of every phone call I make. He has to be in every meeting. He sends an email with markups for my timesheet each week, to the point I have serious anxiety just putting in my hours.

His markups often have mistakes, but if I counter them, I will be overridden, so I just leave the mistakes. The client has complained about him speaking over them and not listening to them. He is obsessed with having them order this custom cable for a job, to the point the client has asked me if he has a financial stake in it. I finally told him, after weeks of terse emails from the client, that they don't want the cable and can we please drop it. He told me they would thank him later and is making me write a spec and add it to our drawings. 

I used to feel good at my job, but now I'm constantly down on myself and feel like a worker drone. I had an issue with sexism from another employee that got pushed up to HR, so I'm afraid to complain and make more waves. I've considered moving on, but my manager is high in the industry and I'm stuck with golden handcuffs.

He will retire in five years, hopefully, so I'm just holding on until then. Just wanted to rant so I can hopefully go back to work on writing this cable spec without too much animosity."

Hi all! I'm a VP of Marketing and my career has been heavily performance marketing (e.g. running Google/FB/Display ads, designing landing pages, SEO, a/b testing, running MMM regressions, etc.).

My industries have been primarily huge, well-known entertainment brands.

I'm currently at a PE-backed company executing a ""turn around"". Once the company is sold I'll look to move on, and that time frame is about another 2 years.

What can I do to put myself in a great position to find another VP or SVP role in two years? Create posts/engage on LinkedIn? Periodically touch base with people in my network?

So I recently accepted an offer at a large, multinational company in North Carolina.

However, when I received the official contract documentation, I noticed that the Confidentiality agreement has what seems (to me) to be a highly broad and restrictive Non-Compete clause.

I've copied some of the most relevant text here, please let me know if more is needed (or whether I should just post the whole section):

*""I hereby agree that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Company, during my employment with the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment with the Company for any reason, I will not directly or indirectly, within the Restricted Territory, for my own account or for the account of any other person or entity, engage in the following activities:*

*a) develop, produce, sell, offer for sale or promote the sale of, or perform, any Competing Products or Services;*

*b) contact or solicit any Customer to market, sell or provide Competing Products or Services to such Customer;*

*c) accept as a customer any Customer to market, sell or provide Competing Products or Services to such Customer""*

There are  a few more stipulations that are much more reasonable. The ""Restricted Territory"" is any state or country they do business in, which again, is basically the whole world.

I'd love to hear input from people as to what extent they think these provisions are enforceable or how I could push back/try to negotiate a less onerous version (a shorter version time period would be ideal)."

In my youth I was involved with the wrong people and got into trouble resulting in a horrible conviction on my record. I am coming up on 7 years since the completion of my probation, etc after which the record is no longer required to be reported to an employer.

I have changed my life drastically since then and am a good man for my family. Attending college, still have a ways to go but possibly looking into a career in healthcare.

I am interested in getting an entry-level job in this field until my bachelor degree is finished (2 more years).

Should I wait 8 months until November (when my record is sealed) to try and get into the field? I’m sure I can secure a low position at an assisted living facility or office setting with my experience, but I worry since I have to report my criminal history, it would hold me back from advancing with the same company after completion of my degree that would qualify me for a higher role.

TLDR: Should I wait to get a job in a field with advancement opportunities until after my criminal record drops off? I would think although they can’t legally discriminate against me, it would be on file and surely promote some bias once I finish my degree and am eligible to move up the ladder…

I'm based in the US. 

I am currently working Full time for a large technology consulting organisation (think Deloitte, Capegemini, Cognizant, Wipro, etc).

Can I ask them to convert me to a contract employee?

I would be going on the payroll of a different company and requesting my current employer to enter a C2C arrangement with the new employer?

How would I go about doing this?
Whom should I approach?

Here's my situation. I was interviewing for multiple jobs. There's job A which I really liked, and job B which was meh. Job B was not flexible with their start date so I accepted their offer because I thought Job A would get back to me before I would actually start. Turns out, Job A finally got back to me with an offer but I am now 4 days into training at Job B. Here are my issues:

\-Job A is doing a background search (through Vero, a UK company. All of these jobs are in america). Would Job B show up in my employment history? (I haven't submitted any paperwork to HR yet)

\-How do I quit Job B respectfully?

Basically, would it be alright to quit job B tonight via email, and not have to worry about it showing up in Job A's background search? Again, any and all honest advice would be much appreciated!"

512,2023-03-30,HR took my negotiation as me rescinding my acceptance. Any advice?,u/zelyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/126vrca/hr_took_my_negotiation_as_me_rescinding_my/,jobs,"For some background: I went straight from undergrad to grad school, which I finished in May 2022. This is my first job offer for my first ""real"" job. I include this as a disclaimer that I don't know all the ""unspoken rules"" of negotiating or accepting a job, but I'm trying my best.

I'll try and be short about this, but it's basically the title. I applied for, interviewed, and got offered a job for a well-funded nonprofit that my friend who works there referred me for. I received a verbal offer for the role last Friday in which they offered a salary and I responded that I would be happy to consider with the whole benefits package. I knew that I was going to negotiate salary going into this regardless and was under the impression that I should do it after receiving a written offer. HR verbally said in this phone call that I would have to accept the verbal offer before receiving the written offer, which I did via email that following Monday. 

After receiving the written offer Tuesday, I sent in email that night asking for **consideration** for a higher salary, approval for a family vacation in the near future, and also inquired about the availability for a relocation stipend. In this email, I affirmed multiple times that I was excited for the position and was ready to move forward with hiring. I got a call the next day (Wed) where HR left a voicemail saying that their offer was their best and final and basically that if I wanted to negotiate, the phone call with the verbal offer would have been when to do it (which I did not know and was not told to me in the call). What was concerning to me about this call was what she said twice and ended the call saying which was that she wished me luck on my future endeavors despite saying that it would be great if I would move forward with their initial offer.

I called back 15 minutes later and left a voicemail saying that I would be happy to accept their initial offer once I got confirmation that my vacation could be approved and then followed up with it again this morning via email just in case. To this, she emailed back that ""once I changed my mind about accepting the verbal offer...we moved on with the position."" I was literally shaking. I never once changed my mind about the position, and she never indicated to me that by sending a negotiation, I was rescinding my acceptance. I called her immediately in which she basically said the same thing and that she told me the verbal offer was for me to negotiate in our initial call (this is incorrect). 

I'm just completely shaken and upset. Yes, I admit that I made a couple of missteps in the negotiation process, but I don't think that means I have completely disqualified myself from the position. Are there some unspoken rules that I don't know about? My language about the role in my emails were completely positive and showed a lot of eagerness for the role, so there is no way that they could have misinterpreted me. My only solace right now is that I have the voicemail in which she told me that it would be great if I accepted their original offer which I have sent to her. At the end of the phone call, she told me that she would speak to the team, but she makes no promises.

I'm just devastated because I've been searching for a job for about a year now, and this was a really good opportunity. Any thoughts or advice?"

I don't hate it but we've had almost consistent staffing issues for the last 3 years or so, and the few people we do get can barely tie their own shoe laces. Another thing that I'm fed up with is the fact that I have to work every weekend, as I'm one of the more experienced and reliable members of staff. They do try to give us weekends off occasionally but the staffing issues make it almost impossible. I think I went 7 or 8 months in 2021 without a single weekend day off. This means I've barely had much of a social life for the last few years and its starting to get to me. I briefly left for a customer service job for a bank in a call centre, but it was horrible and I went back after a month or so.

I've been looking at warehouse jobs as there are several near me, and most of the ones I've seen advertised say they give you 1 in 4 weekends off or something similar. I work 10 to 12 hour shifts in my current job so I'm used to long hours and late into the evenings. I also like the fact that I wouldn't have to deal with customers which would be a nice change.

I'm thinking of getting my forklift license as most of the jobs I see advertised say its desired but not essential, but I'm assuming that means if someone has it they're much more likely to get the job as it saves the company money putting them through it. I have no experience working in a place like that so I figure it will somewhat increase my chances of getting a job.

My whole life I've never known what I want to do as a career, I studied IT years ago but hated it and never did anything with my qualifications. I worked in Dominos for a few years and my current job is similar. At this point I just want a job that's less stressful than my current one and allows me to have some sort of social life outside of work, and frankly I just want a change. What are the pros and cons of this type of job?"

Early on in the job, I was told they ""like to give people lots of runway to learn and grow in the role"" but in less than five months, I was then told they had concerns I wasn't growing fast enough. I requested a support plan to help me get where was needed in an accelerated timeline - which went great (even according to my direct manager) for two months, until senior leadership stepped in and suddenly I was being told that I wasn't performing up to standard (again).

I then went on a second support plan with the implication that if things didn't work out, I may lose my job. However I powered through, got strong feedback, hit all my goals and the support plan period ended with seemingly little concern about my future with the company. 

However just this week, I got feedback from my direct management that there was concerns about my work output and the amount of input that was needed from senior leadership on it - this occurred during a very unusual week where 2/3rds of both teams were out on vacation, we had multiple deliverables for multiple different clients and I was doing my role and assisting in my bosses, while they were also out of office.

I have communicated this tendency to say nothing until a number of apparent issues crop up - as well as the fact that client deliverable standards are entirely on the whim of senior leadership (instead of having a set of agreed-upon standards that all staff can follow) - but so far haven't seen concrete change on either front. If I could avoid it, I would like to not have to start job hunting again but I'm not sure if it's worth my time to stay in a role that I keep having to fight to see healthy change happen (at the expense of my own self worth from being constantly told I'm not performing when I know I am) or if I should just cut my losses and find an exit sooner rather than later."

I’m talking: perfect salary, perfect company mission that fits my ideals, perfect hiring process that I actually ENJOYED (which is like finding a needle in a haystack with tech jobs), 100% transparency through and through. I was at the second of three interviews, and then what I feared the most happened: 
I got an update from them informing me they are halting their hiring process because of the current banking crisis. They assured me if all calms down economically and they can expand their engineering staff again they will reach out and push me to the final interview. But this was devastating. I was fully qualified- they told me that- and I thought this miserable job search was finally over, and not even for a role I’d force myself to settle for, but for a role and a company I was genuinely excited for. 
Finding another opportunity like this, especially as a fresher, is going to be so difficult. 
Has anyone else dealt with this before, and can maybe give me a success story despite the odds to keep me from giving up? I just felt like I was so so close this time."

I already expressed coming back to the state for important onsite meetings/reviews but no luck. I don't think it's a performance issue since I have been promoted 3 years in a row. 

Now I am searching for a new remote job while continuing to work at the same company (trying to do it before we anticipate moving later in the year).

***Abroad***

**- Jobs applied :** 31

Summary : 91% chance of getting ghosted from my own country. If applying abroad, I have only 80% chance of it. Only 4% of employers take the time to send you an update or rejection email in Canada. 12% in Europe or Australia. 6% chance to get an interview if apply to jobs in other countries compared to 3% in Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe my statistic means nothing and related to my field of study (multimedia, digital marketing) which is very competitive. What I saw is that in Canada and US, employers ask for X years of experience while in Europe and Australia they only require general knowledge and don't base yours on your experience, but willing to learn and work hard.

All that to say that I have an interview next week for an Australian company. I'm a bit scared, because it's the complete other side of the world and they are also driving the wrong way lol...

2,2023-03-30,Where do I go from here?,u/Proto_Sapiens,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/126ztr3/where_do_i_go_from_here/,jobs,"Hello, I’m 32 and I have a good job. I am a department supervisor at a small manufacturing plant (~80 employees). I take on any new responsibilities I can. Currently I handle all the raw materials ordering for all departments from our main supplier. I also have my hand in storage and organization of raw materials and equipment. I have taken on many initiatives, without being asked, to handle/ clean up/ organize/ create procedures for areas and ensure compliance with varying environmental/ safety laws or policies etc. i was at one time also the “dock manager” until they hired on someone else for that role. When I was made supervisor, i went from regular operator to supervisor of a department I’d never worked in from one week to next. At the time it was our worst department, bad infrastructure, new experimental processes, completely green staff assigned. In the past 4 years i have totally turned it around and the department has become a major force in the organization as well as the broader market in general. I have done everything from logistics, process development, contributed to engineering projects, maintenance, policy writing, SOP writing, and I feel i am very well rounded compared to most/ all my colleagues. 

So here’s the problem. It is commonly believed that some of the upper management will be retiring soon. I feel I would be a good candidate for plant manager or similar, given my familiarity and already overlapping responsibilities. I feel I have a lot to contribute in many aspects of our operations. I don’t look that good on paper however, and in many ways my thinking doesn’t jive with our president’s, which makes me wonder if he’d ever consider me. I have no meaningful degrees or certs really, just a good track record but I feel the people who would be making the decision are never as aware of my contributions as I want. I also have the feeling he’d want someone with more “life experience “ (meaning older), I’ve always gotten the impression he views me as a “kid”, since i started here at 23. Should I try to pursue a management position here? Or could I be better off jumping up a wrung by going to a new organization? I’m not sure I want to make a big speech about wanting the manager job if there’s no shot and i may just make myself look greedy or cocky and ruin future chances."

I get to the next round with the hiring manager and they say 12 days PTO and 3 sick. :/ Call me greedy, but average PTO in the US is 11 days, so I would hardly call 12 ""generous"". I'm also usually (sadly) sick for more than 3 days out of the year. I don't have kids yet, but I would like to someday soon, and I'm afraid to ask what their parental leave policy might be (if they have one at all)!

So what about those of us who have been working in a factory, warehouse, office, or company for over a decade yet only gained a moderate, mid level, broad and nonspecific skillset? People who stuck around this long because the pay is decent enough, benefits are great, but want to move on but are now trapped by  mediocrity. People who have no other viable option but to stay at a dead-end but good enough job and only have around 3 hours after a draining day of work to better themselves. Starting over at a new job would mean a massive paycut and risk, and the lack of high level education or specialized skillset means having to start all over from a bottom role.  
The main question however (sorry for the rambling) is HOW... how can a single adult living alone in this situation gain a higher level, fully developed, marketable and employable skillset with only a few hours of free time per day?  
  
Additional context: i worked 11 years doing mixed roles at a warehouse / assembly line / factory and my experience is a basic mix of email communication, shipping, receiving, organizing, inventory tracking, small mechanical assembling, working as a user with basic software (SAP and the Microsoft office suite), and having soft skills like being personable and giving mild directions. A real mix of warehouse, office, and assembly line.  
Also, what i would like to go into is UI / UX Design, but that means taking online courses for several years to learn and build experience and a portfolio. Problem is once i get home after a draining day of work and with all other chores and upkeep i have to do, i have no motivation, energy, will, or interest to do that, much less alone in a silent room by myself. I am the opposite of a self-starter and it seems i do best in an environment that facilitates work, which my bedroom desk in a sad silent small apartment is not."

I moved to Puerto Rico not long ago and have been job hunting for approximately 2 months. Salaries here are lower than the U.S which I knew from the get go but i wasn’t prepared for how low even compared to Florida. 

Turns out i got 2 job offers the same week. None of those jobs were anything I wanted but bills need to be payed. One of them was told me I was the candidate chose but they needed to reach out my references and do all that extra stuff. 
The other one gave me an offer (nothing crazy) and told me I could start the following week. Since bills don’t wait I had to take whatever came first since I didn’t want to end up with no job. 

Turns out the other job reaches out to me and told me they just need the drug test to send me an official offer. (Idk how much is the salary from this company but since this is a company based in mainland U.S Im guessing salary should be higher than what I currently have). Another thing is that they were clear from the get go and are looking for someone long term (minimum 2 years).

Today I had an interview from a company I really like. While it’s not something in my desired field, it can open doors and I could network. The downside is that they’re looking for someone temporary while the other person goes out for maternity leave.

Now, should I stay in my current job (which salary is ok for PR standards) and suck it up until I find something in my desired field,

OR should I take the other job (which is not something in my desired field) that might potentially have a much better salary than my current one and stay there for a good 2 years,

OR should I take a chance and accept the other to work for the company that I liked and might help me network even though is something temporary?


I really don’t know what to do 

Oh by the way (i hate my current job, which I just started on Monday) but it’s extremely boring and you can tell my boss has an attitude. 

Any help will be greatly appreciated."

I got an email today stating that they did not pick up apparently, so to try to get them to pick up or to provide three different ones. 

Is this ridiculous? Cuz it seems pretty pushy. Should they have told me the number they would be calling them from? Should I have asked which number? Never had a potential employer be this inquisitive before."

Or do they say that to everyone?

Hello everyone, I’m looking for advice or support or some words of encouragement. I currently teach 3rd grade and have for 4 years. I applied for my dream school for their 1st grade position. The first round of interviews, I could tell they really liked me. I felt so confident. The second interview was with the K-2 principal and the head principal and the first grade team. I left feeling so so. On the way out the head principal told me that he would let me know by Friday. And if 1st grade doesn’t work out, I’d be a top choice for any other position at their school. 

Now they have a 3rd grade position available. And in the state I teach, 3rd grade is a critical position bc it’s a testing requirement grade. His comment made me feel like he really liked me, but wanted me to for the third grade position. But I made sure to note that 1st grade was my top choice in my interview. 

Fast forward to today, and I got a voicemail from the head principal saying I didn’t get the job, but ”he would make sure my resume was at the top of the stack for all other positions”. I’ll admit I balled my eyes out 😞 I really wanted this position. But my parents think this comment means he likes me but thinks I’m better suited for the other open 3rd grade position. Does anyone think that too with how he worded it? Or do people tend to say that to all applicants? TIA and thank you if you read all of this"

I am currently at a crossroads and need some advice on a job decision. I work on databases and servers with my team, but not many people know what they're doing except for one person. My current company has been struggling in the market, and there have been layoffs. By far this is the best group of people i have ever work with and even the managers are cool, the job requires me to be on-call and work 5 days a week. I'm paid $75,000 per year. Also to keep in mind, I haven't been fully trained up yet. Its been a year I have done my best to learn the material which I am no where near of mastering it but also my team is so slammed I just become forgotten most of the time. I been here over a year and I can say that I should know alot more but I don't sadly. Which drives me kinda mad when I get paged out because I can not help out at all. (Drives my stress and anxiety thru the roof) Which my team knows. Also the company im at has let go so many people including a co worker sadly. One last thing since the company is not doing well they have stated as of now and possibly the whole year no raises. Theyre doing really really bad in the market we are probably going to get bought out by another company to get saved but who knows.

I received a job offer as a IT support, a job I have done before. From a totally different company. The job is fully remote, 3 days a week on nights (12 hour shifts), with no on-call duties. The pay is higher than my current salary. Its Hourly around 43 ish. The company offering the job seems more stable in the job market, and there haven't been recent layoffs. However, I'm concerned that going back to this job may be going backward in my career, and I'm also worried about starting fresh with new people( I didnt have the greatest experience with the first company when i first started the job and worried it may happen again since this role in the industry is easy to get and may have people that are hard to work with) Not trying to live in chaos again. But I did have a life when I had this job, i left because of ambition to become better in my career. Which I am starting to realize maybe I was wrong for leaving...

This maybe a no brainer for most, I have switched jobs before like its nothing but I am having second thoughts like crazy for this decision. Major anxiety to the point i am breaking down badly. I dont know if I just believe things can become better here or I am just tired of restarting back to zero. Sorry guys, I am just so drained and stress that I can not even think straight. 

My goal is to have a better work-life balance and time for myself. I've been feeling drained and I dont know if i am just burnt out completely. Which is why i am asking for advice since I maybe not thinking straight and my gut feeling maybe wrong because I may reject the new job just because I am too stress to make a decision. 

current job - SRE 75,000 remote

New job - IT Support 81,000 remote nights ( also hourly and can work overtime and make more)

I would appreciate any advice or insights you have on this job decision. Thank you in advance for your help."

(love what i do but somedays it can be a total pain) lately i wanted to leave due to feeling burned out and wanted a change.

i applied to a local car dealership as a express service advisor with no experience nonetheless. i was freaking out for my interview as i really wanted the position. while the staff seemed friendly but the service manager who interviewed me wanted to hire me not even 3 minutes into the interview which kinda struck a huge red flag for me. all he asked was tell him about myself and if i knew what i applied for. he didn’t ask about my work ethic, what i’d do in stressful situations, etc etc.

while at chick-fil-a i had to go through 3 interviews. (phone, my supervisor, and the owner/operator)

i handed in my 2 weeks and my supervisor begged me to stay as i’m a very good worker and she had a proposal for me. today she called me into her office and she’s gonna give me a raise to $14 (the same pay as i will make at my new job) if i complete my online training i’ll make an additional $3 to which i’d be making $17 an hour at the age of 19. with the same hours and i’d be promoted to a trainer.

not to mention i really like the majority of my coworkers and i like what i do at chick-fil-a so i think i’m gonna stay.

i just feel very bad for wasting the car dealerships time as i have a start date as well. i signed some paperwork as well but not nothing super important like my direct deposit or a background check. 

any advice?"

Recently I went from residential cabling($15/hr), to FedEx driver($22) quit to learn garage door building ($21) laid off, to commercial cabling ($22.5). 

I just started commercial cabling and hate the company I'm at, everyone just complains about others and management, pretends to be productive, they give us(new hires) no training or even any tasks to do, most of the people just stand around and wait for orders and nothing gets done. In the last 2 weeks I've done overall about 4-5 hours actually worked of \~80 hours, some people might think its good I'm getting paid but I can't stand having nothing to do, I've been asking for things to do but the leads just send me off to another lead who tells me the same, its starting to really frustrate me, it seems like they don't actually want people getting things done.

I've called off work to apply to different jobs, my plan was maybe stick with the cabling for 2-3mo, learn as much as I can, lie about experience and go somewhere else for a pay raise. Other than that I don't really know what to do, I'm interested in analyzing and working independent, possible IT but have no exp or certs, I really enjoyed being a FedEx courier while there. My goal for work is to find something I can either learn from to get paid more in the future or do something that uses my strengths/ I enjoy and pays around $22. So far it feels actually impossible to achieve this because I have been trying very hard without success these last two years."

I'm wondering because when I initially applied on the company's careers page they only had one job opening which was located in the suburb. I recently got a response from the company and a time for an interview. As I was rechecking the website for more information I noticed they now have an opening for the same position but in the city. I'm happy with the original location and am grateful to just get an interview, but am wondering what it would look like if I applied for the city position as well.

Personal context: I'm graduating in the next few months and want to live in or around this city

Should I bring it up at the interview? Email the recruiter about how I'm flexible about work location? or submit another online application and mention something in the comments section? 

No matter what I'm doing the interview but I'm wondering if I should apply for the city opening as well.

2,2023-03-30,I'm ignoring my health because of my job.,u/Financial_FreedomPlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12795u5/im_ignoring_my_health_because_of_my_job/,jobs,"As I've continued to get success at my job, I noticed more and more that my health is getting ignored. It seems as though the more successful I get, the more I'm unable to focus on my health. 

For me, there are at least 2 major health issues that I have. One of those leaves me incapable of traveling. I absolutely need a surgery to address this one, though there is no guarantee it would fix it, and I have been putting it off because of my job though my plan was to address it this year but those plans are halted due to some situations on the job I'll speak about below.

The other is a chronic condition I have been dealing with for 10 years. It has not gotten worse, but I am definitely not where I should or want to be.

Recently, I've been recommended for a promotion and a raise due to the exit of my manager. My new manager has already given me that work that falls within that promotion without the promotion or raise in itself, with the intention that the promotion is pretty much set in stone even though it's not official yet. It is essentially me proving myself that I can do this job. 

I feel like this is a red flag and I've considered saying ""NO"" to doing anything else further until it becomes official now.

Due to this, I don't want to screw it up by taking extended time off so soon into a potential new promotion and new role. In the same sense, I would not be disappointed if I did take time off. This stems from the fact that the new boss is a bit of a loose cannon whom I don't know which personality I speak to day to day, and it increases stress levels high, whereas my prior managers were more chill and laid back. 

Add to this that I would manage employees that I know are looking to leave and would leave me with even more work to deal with. It would be the equivalent of me having two or even three jobs instead of just having one. However, I do get paid very well.

My fear is the obvious of not only don't I get promoted, but they may see I'm not needed if I take extended time off and continue on without me.... and I have many bills and debts I need to pay.

In the same sense, I have been reading some articles about how health should come first as it could become financially worse later on if I didn't have a job, especially if I let health issues go and had an emergency because of it. It's really making me think about this, as I can replace my job and the work can be replaced as well and will always be there, but I can't replace my health and there's no guarantee it will always be there.

I want to share this in case anyone has any words of advice or encouragement for me. Reddit has been good thus far for solid advice here, most of which I've taken. I'll respond a within the next day or two to anyone who can offer advice or give me their experiences with this.

Appreciate any responses!"

I am also getting super worried after reading bad reviews on Primark website. So, I have few questions and concerns regarding

\- Are team leader just bluffing around or they are serious that management are brutally strict?

\- What would be my duties and responsibilities for position as **retail assistant**? Would I be working cashier heavy jobs or stocking, or would it be mix of both?

\- How commuter benefit works at Primark? Would they cover my commute insurance if I use UberX, Lyfts, or even personal car to get to work or the commute benefit only limited to slow and obnoxious public buses, and subway (which I am not counting since no subways travels to the mall).

\- Is it really easy to get fired from Primark as most people says on the online reviews, as well as recruiter mentioned during orientation?

It's really concerning me since they made me wait 2 months after I had orientation with them. I had orientation in mid February, and they are now telling me I cannot start until early-April. I already told them I will be moving forward with another job if they make me wait until late April and don't let us start the time they promised during orientation. I am planning on working there temporary anyways since I am using Primark as temporary to find better places and positions that is more aligned with my degree in Engineering.

Took years to learn how to keep my own emotions in check and how to get taken seriously after many negative pasts experiences of dealing with bias and accused of having an attitude, despite being lucid.

Manager, however, is fairly new to programming and is utilizing my expertise to learn, grow, and help troubleshoot alongside me, which has been great. However, she is treated differently (actually poorly) by upper management and I think it’s because she shows frustration, angry, annoyance, etc. rather than checking her emotions at the door. I believe it’s because of this, it’s why upper management has bypassed/overlooked her and are reaching out to me directly for status updates and assigning tickets to me without her nor my consent. She and one of her other subordinates are now on the verge of quitting, which would really puts me in a tough spot as I’m fairly new to this company and am still ramping up and I’m stressing out.

It’s put me in a tough spot as a woman too. A director sent me a private message calling my manager “sensitive”. This has me feeling helpless. I hate drama, I don’t like being involved in. I just want to make my money and go home lol.

My manager has asked to be included in all conversations and for upper manager to go through her when tasking me, but they’ve since ignored her request and still reach out to me directly. Manager has coached me on how to redirect a conversation to include her but it’s not working.

My family thinks I should step over her and play the political game to get promoted faster. My friends think I should start looking for another job and quit in solidarity. I just want to get paid and go home. How do I deal with this? I’m scared to go to HR for fear of retaliation.

I wanted to share my recent experience of leaving a job I thought was a dream come true, only to realize it was more of a nightmare. 

A little context: I was laid off from my previous job after only two months, and while reaching out to my network, I got an opportunity to work for someone I had admired for a long time. I was moving away from SEO into paid advertising, and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to learn and grow.

I was so excited to join the team because I'd always admired the person I'd be working for. I'd followed them on social media for years, and their presence was nothing short of inspirational. Atleast that's what it looked like.

Right from the get-go, I felt something was off. There was zero training, and within the first month, two people left the company. I was expected to pick up their tasks as well, and when I asked about hiring new team members, I was made to feel bad about myself. My boss would say things like, ""I don't think advertising is for you,"" and ""There was a reason you were laid off. You can't work in a small company; you might as well leave.""

This kind of behavior and attitude was intolerable, and I decided to leave after just three months. My boss couldn't have cared less and seemed happy to see me go. I tried to be the better person, even when leaving, only to hear him say, ""You might need to choose a different path. You don't have what it takes to make it in this field. I've seen over 300 people, and trust me, you're not that guy.""

After speaking to some of his former employees who managed to stick around for almost a year, they described him as a narcissistic, empty husk of a human being who only cared about money. He didn't care about his people, hired and fired as he pleased, and maintained a fake persona online.

I wanted to reach out and ask if any of you have had a similar experience - have you ever been let down by someone you admired? If so, did you mention that stint on your resume, or did you find a way to avoid it? How was your mental health after leaving, and how did you move forward to land a subsequent job?

Would really appreciate any insights, advice, or stories you can share. Thanks!"

Has anyone used Vero screening before after a job offer? I've recently been offered an amazing job &amp; was told I have to complete a Vero Screening. I haven't received the link as of yet.

42,2023-03-31,How to get a fulfilling job,u/lektikos,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/127ffy8/how_to_get_a_fulfilling_job/,jobs,"Even by being relatively new to the workforce, I am already sick of it. the mere thought that I will have to work for the next probably 40-45 years of my life drives me crazy.

The problem is that, given the current job market situation, I am considered to be well-off since I am treated very well in my job, getting paid better than average and it looks like my company is grooming me to become a manager in the future but still, it all feels wrong to me. 

Most of my days, when I return home from work I spend a lot of my free time thinking of ways I could avoid the 9-5 life, with the only possible solution that I can think of being creating my own business which can turn out even worse ( instead of 9-5 it is a 24/7 thing, you need a starting capital &amp; a good idea that you can implement correctly, etc.) so I cannot seem to get out of this loophole.

But today it hit me, I realized I genuinely do not care for any of my colleagues. I would never go out for a beer with any of these guys if it weren't for work. Maybe if, in some other universe, I could have as colleagues my best friends then work wouldn't be so dull and unsatisfying, even if my work tasks were super boring. 

Maybe a fulfilling job is not about the job itself, but the people that surround you while you do it. At the end of the day, you spend more hours with your colleagues than your family and loved ones. 

On the other hand, friends can turn out to be terrible co-workers so maybe it is not always a good idea, any thoughts on this?

I'm just trying to find a way to wake up with an eagerness to start my day, which by the looks of it, seems unlikely to happen."

0,2023-03-31,Quitting job- should I give boss feedback if asked? She's like a very formal robot and hard to work with,u/imakeitrainbow,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/127j91h/quitting_job_should_i_give_boss_feedback_if_asked/,jobs,"Longish post, feel free to read TL;DR at end. After two years at a job that's a poor fit for me, that I do not enjoy, and that it takes me 1-1.5 hours to get to, I'm quitting. I can't describe how relieved and happy I am!! My main reason for quitting is that I'm moving across the country to be with family, but I probably would have quit around now anyway.

My position requires two months notice, which I'll give my supervisor in our next meeting. My department should have 5 people, but only have 3. It's worth mentioning that I tried to quit a year ago, she didn't take it well, partly b/c my other coworkers was also quitting. She asked if my leaving had anything to do with her, which I danced around. I ended up staying on a part-time basis, rather than quitting.

I'm anticipating she'll ask for feedback again, and I'm going back and forth. There are many things I could give feedback about, but my biggest thing is that she's very difficult to work with. She's hard to relate/ talk to (others have told me they have the same experience with her so a lot of this is really about her). Basically, she's like a very formal robot. She's very distant, and I know very little about her and what she thinks about the work we're doing, or most things. My coworker and I have noticed that when we give ideas or ask questions she essentially turns the question back on us, rather than sharing her thoughts, so we don't know what she thinks. She's very rigid and boundaried, and it's uncomfortable. My coworker and I try to have normal conversations about life stuff with her. Hey, what did you do this weekend, and she'll give an unoriginal response so that the convo doesn't go anywhere. 

Also, when she gives instructions or we have discussions, she is really wordy and talks for a long time, yet ends up being vague and hard to follow. She makes things much, much more complicated than needed. Because of all this, I try to interact with her as little as possible. 

It's been really difficult to have a boss that I don't feel I have a real relationship with. I feel no sense of connection, and I've never felt this way. In the past few months, I've experienced an inordinate amount of loss and instability, which has affected me in many ways. I would have shared some of these things with former supervisors because I think it's important that people know what's going on with me, but I just didn't feel comfortable telling her much.  I'm not sure why she is this way, I think a lot of it has to do with anxiety, but of course I don't know. It's also possible that this is just a personality thing and can't be changed. I'm certain she's not on the spectrum. 

Just want some perspectives about what to say, and how to say it.

TL;DR: I'm quitting. Supervisor will probably ask me for feedback. She has a very formal, distant way of relating to me and others, which is uncomfortable. Makes it hard to relax and be authentic. I never know what she's thinking. She also makes things overly complex, so that I try to avoid her. Should I share this feedback? How?"

That job just got posted, and my manager called me into her office and said that if I’m interested she’d like me to apply. She said it’s not guaranteed and it has to go to the right person, but she really wants to me go for it. 

The job description is *exactly* what I’m doing daily anyways, and I really like doing it. If I get the job, it’ll be my first full-time job with a salary, benefits, etc. Before this job I’ve just worked in the service industry. What I’m wondering is, is it appropriate to ask my current coworkers to be my references? I don’t have anyone else to ask, and I have a good relationship with them. Because I’m the only hourly employee, I don’t think there will be any competition for this job, as it’s the lowest on the totem pole (next to hourly of course).

Any other advice would be appreciated too!"

What made me a terrible candidate? My resume is good and gets interviews. 

Did the company specifically want people that didn't work for them before? I don't know why that would be the case. Is it because their university is next to the company office? But the position is still remote... Sheesh. I wish recruiters would say why they reject candidates."

I have never worked within the school system, nor have I ever worked in administration or in secretarial positions. Most of my previous work experience is kitchen and/or physical labor jobs. I do not know how to use Excel and I am horrible at any kind of math but I am very tech savvy aside from that. I have a B.A. in Communications / Media Studies but no other business education. I start on Monday and have no idea what I'm doing. As a casual, I am on-call; like a substitute but for Admin Assistants so I could be at different locations all the time. My first gig is a 2-week job at the District office. Any suggestions, tips, or info that might help me on this new career path?

*A few questions:*

\- Do I really need to know Excel?

\- Will I need to do any kind of math or deal with finances?

\- How often will I actually have to interact with kids?

\- Would my daily hours be the same as students/teachers or will I have to go in earlier and work later than the general school day?

\- Do I get all the same time off as teachers/students (Long weekends, Spring break, Christmas break, Summers, etc.)?

\- Do I still get paid for Good Friday and Easter even though that is my first week working?"

I'm trying to move on so I'm working a bit harder to find something.

I'm a big gamer, content creator/consumer, and also an athlete. I would LOVE to find a position within the gaming/content creation industry as this is my true passion. I'd love to work in an industry that I so heavily relate to.

My question to you all is - what companies and/or positions do you think would be a solid fit for me within the gaming/content creation industry? I have a good amount of experience with project analytics, project management (not a PM role, though), and excel and the rest of the MS suite.

I have a Bachelors and an MBA in Business Administration/Management.

The rest of the time was me asking questions. Which was what took up most of the time allotted. 2 and a half weeks later, I got the call offer and offer letter. 

My point is, don’t stress yourself by looking into these little things to hint that you are getting the job or not. Based on my interview, you would think that was a bad interview because they didn’t ask me a lot of questions, the interview time didn’t take long or they didn’t introduce me to the team ect.

This post may be all over the place, but it is generally a positive one! No complaining here :)

Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m stepping into a new phase. For one, I stopped caring about looking like I’m busy working all the time. Which doesn’t mean I’m not working. I’m just working smarter (thanks to chatgpt!)

COVID really put me under a lot of stress and pushed me to document all the things I did. Coworker relations have changed. I’ve gotten closer to people I didn’t think I would get closer to and distanced myself from people I cared a lot about.

I’ve been pushing to be more professional in the way I speak and the comments I make. I’ve gotten rid of my participation in work gossip (it’s the worst, feels like I’m back in hs whenever I hear it)

All these little changes have brought up a new way that people are interacting with me. I don’t think some like it. I used to run around and do a lot of tasks, but with this new vision, I’ve come to accept this is just a job that pays my bills and I’m going to do just what is expected of me and a tiny bit more. I feel liberated and like I’m back in control of what I once had.

Back around 2015, I joined my parent's company full-time in a role that I was qualified to fill, had some good success, but moved on after about a year because I wanted to make my own way. Since then, I've demonstrated a track record of starting low in a company and working my way up to management positions.

\*Note: working for my family wasn't my first ""real"" job, if that has any impact.

I continue to work for them in a part-time capacity in my off-hours, helping with back-end projects, marketing initiatives, and internal comms on an hourly basis. This includes data work using the skills I've picked up in the last year, which have actually had measurable benefits to the profitability of their business and are highlighted in my resume.

Here's the issue: my father and I have damn near the exact same name, save our middle names. Googling our name sans middle initial brings up our company's ""meet the team"" page, where his profile sits directly above mine like a little nepotism bonnet. The second set of links are his linkedin profile directly above mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that since it's so easy to search us and see that familial link, it may give recruiters/hiring managers big nepotism energy and could be a weak link in my efforts to get hired. Especially since my resume highlights a lot of the recent data work I have completed for their company.

After a few hours the recruiter comes in to tell me there are 2 more teams that would love to meet me. Same deal, I spend the same amount of time talking to 2 more teams. All goes well. I was there from 9AM to 3PM. 

This morning she sends me a generic rejection that the ""team"" loved my experience and expertise, but is going to go in another direction.

Which team!?

Anyway, obviously it's a stock rejection but I feel so fucking stupid. I feel worthless and incredibly dumb and foolish."

But ultimately, yes I received access to my paystub through ADP, I'm used to getting my check handed to me every two weeks and not having direct deposit so I didn't know where to find my paystub, I guess I'm an idiot for that. I started at this job March 6th, I thought we get paid every two weeks but we get paid semi-monthly. So I'm aware that's $2000 pre tax, and take home would be around $1600. My paycheck was $1250 and that worried me. So I posted here for advice, I also messaged my boss because the paystub had the pay period as 3/16-3/31, so because I worked those days I was confused. He told me my paycheck was for 3/1-3/15, so the mystery is solved and I could've just waited for his response rather than get ridiculed on Reddit, but I guess you live and you learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (30F) just started a new remote job as a technical support specialist for a veterinary software company. I've been a vet tech my whole life and felt like I couldn't ask for more than I was offered because I don't really have experience with this type of job. I had been searching for 8 months and finally someone wanted to take a chance on me. It's a salary position, so I wasn't sure how to gauge how much my take home paycheck would actually be. I asked during the interview process how that salary amount compared hourly and the number he gave was about what I was already making. So I figured it was a safe bet and that if a made a few hundred less per month I would still be okay. However I received my first paycheck today and it is $400 less than an average paycheck I was making as a vet tech. This has me freaking out and wondering if I can afford all my basic needs. I did not even consider this much as a worst case scenario. Maybe I'm naïve for not knowing what a good amount is for salary, but it can't possibly equate to the hourly rate he gave me.

I guess my question here is, can I reasonably ask for a raise after only being at a company for a month? I'm not completely working on my own just yet, but my supervisor has told me I've exceeded his expectations of me thus far. What can I do here?"

I began getting sick a couple days before my first shift but I powered through each shift even if it was unbearable sometimes. 

Sometimes I would even come home and just cry because the headaches were so bad. 

Today I threw up in my bathroom sink and decided that I definitely could not go into work tonight. 

My manager generally agreed with me and had already marked me as sick when I put in a request for someone to cover my shift. 

However, I’m nervous this will make me look bad to the company. My fiancé is always going on about “in the first 3 months you can’t call off” “you’ll look bad to the company and they’ll slowly cut your hours” and things like that. 

Is it really that serious? If I’m legitimately sick and my coworkers have all been able to tell in my previous shifts will I really look that bad to management? I like this job, I really do and I don’t want to lose it or look bad to the company.

2. I told them I need 2 weeks to start because of my current job which they happily agreed to, but they never sent over an “official” offer letter or anything like that.

So with all that i decided to start job hunting and actually have a phone interview on Monday. So if i get asked a question like ""why have you decided to move on from your current position?"" What is a good way to say at least a few of those things without bad mouthing my current job too much?"

I got a IT help desk job when I was a freshman (upgrade from working in Walmart, lol) and worked my way up to sys admin, all while in school for computer science.

Now I’m about to graduate and I feel stuck in IT. I make 75k and I repeatedly get emails for jobs that pay 90k. Add in my CS degree and experience I can get a high end IT job relatively easily. 

But, I’m screwed regarding becoming a software engineer/developer. I don’t have any experience except school coding wise (except for writing scripts). And I feel like if I were to become a super junior software engineer I’m restarting my career, definitely won’t get a job making 90k (especially in my MCOL state and the current job market for devs) 

I also am realizing that IT jobs seem more secure then software engineering ones (from what I’ve seen). I live in a state with a LOT of startups and so many of them are having a shit ton of layoffs. 

I tried getting a software engineering internship but I kept bombing the coding interviews. 

I feel like I’m just way better at IT stuff.

I really dont like my remote desk job. It use to be the easiest job ever. I worked for a telemarketing company that added a branch thats a 3rd party for insurance companies. We would help schedule inspections for homeowners, doing both inbound and outbound calling. I did so well in my job that i got to be an inbound caller and it made my job SO MUCH EASIER. I would wait until people would call me, sometimes for 20+ minutes just to tell me their inspector didnt make it yet. In those spaces of time i would watch shows and movies to kill time. There were some hiccups that made the job annoying like this one higher up youll hear later on in the post (lets call her T). Back on topic: everything was great until a few weeks ago on sunday, which is my off day; they decided to call me and say i no longer with work for that branch. I asked why and they said their contract was up and chose to alert CERTAIN people, not everyone. They only alert me because im the only spanish speaking rep. Everyone else they told the next day, WHEN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR. They told everyone they no longer have a job and to leave. Obviously everyone was mad and a close work friend of mine even got a panic attack. I thought “damn there goes my easy paycheck, time to actually work”. It was alot worse then i thought. My current job now is i call random companies and bug them into buying computers for their business. Im not a pushy person but i gotta do what i gotta do. But that same higher up T, is my boss. I hate her with a passion. She only discussed personal information about herself aloud in the middle of us calling people, taking how her period and what guy shes gonna ride that night. I called HR on her multiple times but nothing came of it. She even openly harassed a coworker who was 18 at the time making nasty remarks like “god i love chocolate men!” and “ill take em any size”. It got so bad that he quit because no one would listen or help him. Now shes micromanaging everything i do and criticizing everything i do to the point its driving me crazy. Im sorry for the long rant im typing this in full rage. Im already looking for a new job but i wanna know if i tell off my boss will i get in any sort of trouble?"
