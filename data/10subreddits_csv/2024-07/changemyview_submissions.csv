His ability to work with Congress and get things done has been amazing. He got infrastructure bill passed, inflation reduction act passed which gave money for climate and lowered drug costs and capped Medicare costs at $2,000 a year which no one talks about. He's forgive tons of student loan debt. He signed an executive order that would recognize the US mission to be net zero by 2050. 

There are some more complicated things to argue if he's been better like immigration and foreign policy but he's been better on most domestic policy. "

3,2024-06-30,cmv: presidential democracies should have the equivalent of PMQs,u/AstridPeth_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dshe53/cmv_presidential_democracies_should_have_the/,changemyview,"In Westminster Systems like in the U.K., weekly, the prime minister has to go to the parliament and reply questions from the parliamentaries. It's called Prime Minister Questions. It starts with His Majesty Most Honorable Opposition Leader, who has 4 questions all for himself. The Prime Minister has to reply. Then, for the remainder part of an hour, the speaker of the House of Commons asks Representatives to ask. When they are from the PM party, the questions are mostly ""Mr. prime minister, my constituents want to know how are you so wonderful?"", but opposition members make good questions.

In the presidential systems, like in the United States, presidents usually make an annual message to Congress. In the U.S., the president has for the better part of the century fulfilled his constitutional duty by reading his presidential message in person, in a Speech called State of the Union.

But congresspeople aren't allowed to make questions.

Presidential systems are famous for having Weekend at Bernie's situations, where the presidents aren't mentally fit, but it is hidden from the public. In the U.S., it goes back all the way to FDR. 

Presidents should be exposed with some periodicity from scrutiny from the opposition in their legislatures. Make it so that the organized opposition has the opportunity to make questions to the president."

I was probably around 7 the first time someone told me this and even then i thought it was horseshit and through the years i’ve come to believe that all this psycho religious nonsense is behind why the idea of being raped is pushed as being “the worst thing that could happen to you” and so many people have internalized this, that at this point i view it as purposeful and weapon in itself. 

Women are raised from birth being told this is the worse thing that can happen to them, that it means they’ve “had something taken from them” that they’re “ruined” and because of this harmful rhetoric, rape is used to do exactly that. Rape is considered so heinous not because of the physicality but because it’s the only crime that’s used to destroy the victim mentally so unless you buy into exactly what rapists want you to believe they’re doing to you then i can’t see how it’s worse than any other assault. 

obviously rape is a horrible disgusting thing to do to someone but as far as being victim to a crime i’d rather that than being murdered , stabbed, shot, burned, beaten beyond recognition, literally almost anything. 

And for the people that might say i wouldn’t understand until it happens me, yes i can’t fully comprehend what it’d be like but i’ve been in situations some might consider adjacent. i have never been raped in the technical sense but ive been coerced, Im a lesbian and i’ve had men beg and beg and beg till i’ve said yes out of fear they’d hurt me, i’ve had men be too rough and make me bleed and can barely walk the next day even after telling them to stop . in the physical sense i completely understand the sensation it’s awful but i can live with it just fine in my head it’s an equal experience to getting punched in terms of how i process it and i get that people process things differently but i feel like people make it into too much of a thing and internalize that because they are told by the whole world it’s the worst thing ever.

0,2024-07-01,CMV: Putin’s fears which led him to invade Ukraine are justified(the war was not a smart move though),u/aiwoakakaan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsmc11/cmv_putins_fears_which_led_him_to_invade_ukraine/,changemyview,"Gonna start by prefacing this I do not believe that the invasion was the smart thing to do. Though his fears are justified and valid the invasion only makes sense if applying 1960s war tactical analysis to the situation.

Putin’s fears are as follows in my understanding 

1)Ukraine joining NATO. That is a perfectly valid fear, historically Russia has always had an exposed southern underbelly which has been exploited time and again. I.e napoleon,WW1,WW2. NATO is a hostile organization to Russia. And they would be quite happy to see Russia collapse. Common arguments against this are. nato is a defensive alliance(not necessarily true the example for this being the 1999 bombing campaign in Serbia). This isn’t an argument whether that was justified this is just to show that’s not just a defensive alliance.


2) Putin and many Russians feel, the only thing garunteeing russias security is its nuclear arsenal and the threat of MAD if Russia was to be invaded. If Ukraine is part of nato that allows the position of mobile nuclear launchers closer to Russian nuclear silos which presents a threat to its existence. Because again if Russians nuclear arsenal can be disabled then its existence is very much threatened. When Libya gave up its nuclear program it didn’t take long for USA to organize their fall. When Putin sees how’s the USA dismantles countries without nukes he worries that if Russian nukes can be disabled there’s nothing garunteeing Russian security.


3) Ukraine if made even more pro western may be used as a staging ground for coup attempts in Russia. Dismantling the Russian government  and turning Russia into a pro American puppet would be a great strategic move for the USA removal a minor obstacle to full control over the world. 

4) Ukraine is a buffer state/zone removing that zones threatens the security of Russia as NATO may place its troops closer to Russia thus threading its very existence.


These fears are totally justified and plausible though I personally don’t think he should have gone to war because even if with Ukraine in NATO having the capacity to neutralize half of Russias nuclear capability there’s still enough for MAD.  "

0,2024-07-01,"CMV: Due to South Korea's fertility death spiral, North Korea will invade and annex South Korea in approximately 50 years, and the U.S. would not be able to stop them if they decided to intervene.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsnxhv/cmv_due_to_south_koreas_fertility_death_spiral/,changemyview,"I'm watching [this video](https://youtu.be/lmoZ_W4WjW0?si=ZpW6WnTsKHLJ7D81) by RealLifeLore about how South Korea is slowly going extinct due to their plummeting fertility rate.

Why South Koreans stubbornly refuse to increase their fertility rate is a complex and multi-faceted problem which I will not delve into here, but what I'm hoping to be persuaded otherwise about is the fact that because of this fertility death spiral, North Korea will have an overwhelming military advantage over South Korea within the next 50 years or so, and they will exploit this massive power differential to invade South Korea and annex it, as they have always wanted to do.

In the section around 13:35 in the video, this explanation is found:

>The two sides of the Korean Peninsula currently have lopsided populations with the South having roughly twice the number of overall people and twice the number of working age people as the north has, but due to North Korea's dramatically higher levels of militarization that conscripts all North Korean men for ten-year terms in the armed forces and selectively conscripts some of the country's women for five-year terms, Pyongyang controls the larger standing army of **1.3 million** Personnel compared to the South smaller standing army of only **500,000 p**ersonnel that only conserves men for fewer than two-year terms and doesn't conscript women at all.

>As of 2024, North Korea's fertility rate is also beneath the replacement level and stands at an average of about 1.8 children per woman, *but* that's still more than **double the number of children that South Korean women are having** which means the North Korea's population will be shrinking and aging as well but at a much slower rate than in South Korea. By assuming that these fertility rates remain more or less constant North Korea's total population will only decline to about 24 million people while South Korea will crash down to only 36 million and their working age populations will nearly approach the point of equivalency with 14.3 million working age people in North Korea and only 16.6 million working age people in South Korea.

>If the north maintains its policies of hyper militarization and the South fails to adapt, and the ratios of personnel in their standing armies out of their working age populations remains the same as today, then **the north will go from having a standing army of 1.3 million Personnel to 1 million** while **the South will go from having a standing army of 500,000 to just 225,000** which means **North Korea will go from having a 2.6 times advantage in manpower in their Armed Forces today to having a 4.4 times advantage in manpower by simply doing nothing and waiting out the next 45 years.**

Given this information, I see no reason to believe that North Korea wouldn't pounce on this weakened and shriveled South Korean military to overpower them and annex South Korea.

For the sake of argument, I'll assume that the United States will honor its alliance with South Korea and come to their aid if North Korea attempted to invade. But considering North Korea has nuclear weapons, I see the United States being *very* careful in how they engage and defend South Korea, in the same way that we see them behaving with the Ukraine war and the conflict in Palestine.

Especially considering how unhinged and hateful North Korea is toward the United States, I could easily see them making a genuine and valid threat to nuke South Korea and/or the United States if the U.S. tried to intervene.

Suffice to say, the outcome of U.S. intervention is uncertain at best, and could result in the destruction of the entire world, with nukes flying all over the place from all sorts of countries. Given this risk, the United States might not honor their military alliance with South Korea and leave them to their fate.

However, my military knowledge is limited and maybe there's good reason to believe that the United States has a plan to protect South Korea indefinitely without putting the safety of the entire world at risk.

Anyway:

* You might say that South Korea can counteract their fertility death spiral by government programs that encourage fertility.

Well, they've been trying, and it's been an abysmal failure. Each year they spend roughly 1% of their GDP on programs and incentives encouraging the public to have children, such as tax breaks, cash grants for new parents, 90 days of paid maternity leave, and even state-sponsored dating programs. All of these programs have utterly failed. In fact, their fertility rate has only dropped by a further 25% since they began.

* You might say that South Korea can counteract this by importing a massive amount of immigrants.

They have no history of doing that - they are a homogenous society with only about 3% of their population being foreign-born, and are arguably a xenophobic nation.

Furthermore, if they do decide to do this out of panicked desperation, they'll have to import *millions* of foreigners in a rapid amount of time. This is likely to create widespread strife and chaos which may cause the fabric of South Korean society itself to unravel with similar problems that we see in other countries which have opened their borders to immigration. And I don't see South Koreans being so weak-willed in their response to these problems. Civil strife is a likely outcome.

So what do you think? Is South Korea doomed? If not by a fertility death spiral, then by a North Korean invasion? What am I missing? CMV.

0,2024-07-01,CMV: Surnames are obsolete and unnecessary,u/Unusual-Double-2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsoom8/cmv_surnames_are_obsolete_and_unnecessary/,changemyview,"Surnames no longer serve any useful purpose in modern society. They're remnants of an outdated system that described ancestors' professions or origins, but that information is irrelevant today.

As identifiers, surnames are ineffective. Common surnames like Smith or Wang are shared by thousands, rendering them useless for distinguishing individuals. The patrilineal nature of most surname systems perpetuates gender inequality by erasing maternal lineage.

Surnames often lead to bias and discrimination. A person's name can trigger assumptions about ethnicity or social status, influencing decisions in job applications and social interactions. This goes against principles of judging individuals on their own merits.

For administrative purposes, numerical ID systems have long replaced the need for surnames. In everyday life, people tend to use other descriptors to differentiate between individuals with the same first name, making surnames redundant.

Many cultures function perfectly well with single-name systems, proving that surnames aren't necessary for social order or identification. The argument for maintaining family legacy through surnames is weak, especially considering that most people can't trace their lineage back more than a few generations.

The ability to legally change surnames in many jurisdictions further undermines their supposed role in preserving family heritage or tradition. It demonstrates that surnames are essentially arbitrary labels.

Surnames should be phased out. They're unnecessary, potentially discriminatory, and don't align with modern values of individualism and equality. People should be identified by who they are as individuals, not by inherited family names."
0,2024-07-01,"CMV: If you believe in both a strictly materialistic metaphysics and also an unbounded reality, it is logically untenable to say that death is the end.",u/NihongoThrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsoous/cmv_if_you_believe_in_both_a_strictly/,changemyview,"Okay, so I guess I should clarify what I mean by this. I'm a layperson interested in Philosophy who has lately been trying to learn as much as I can about the subject, I'm not a professional and my knowledge about the subjects that I wish to discuss today is lacking to put it lightly. This came into my head as a fun thought experiment but I've since grown kind of fixated on this idea because I lack the capacity to refute the argument, ergo I would like some input from people perhaps more knowledgeable than I. Anyway onto the argument.

It's a simple propositional argument starting with 2 premises, these are not necessarily my beliefs but I think both are commonplace and often go together. They are:

* Reality, in either size, time, or number (as in multiverse) is infinite. I don't think many people claim that there's an infinitely large universe, moreso that there are infinite multiverses or just that time is infinitely long.

* The universe is purely composed of physicalism ,the only noteworthy aspects when talking about external reality are physical properties and states.

From these two axioms, we can draw some conclusions. Namely, an obvious one is the probability of any event happening that is not 0 is going to occur an infinite number of times. Secondly, our experience of reality derives entirely from a physical state. Our mind is composed of the same materials that inanimate objects are composed of, and experiential consciousness (whether it be illusory or genuine) emerges from your physical state. 

From that we can then argue that the *exact* physical state that lead to the emergence of mine or your consciousness is destined to happen and infinitum, since it is P(E) =/= 0 as evidenced by you being here. That means if you die and this model of reality is accurate, a sort of transmigration of consciousness will occur. And your consciousness will essentially be birthed at another point in time or space. As the exact state will essentially be reconfigured and organise itself to be identical to the state that led to your current conscious emergence. I'm not simply talking about atoms here either, the congruence would perhaps be baryonic or fermionic if that is relevant.

This is essentially my thought experiment. I think it falls apart if you alter the assumptions even slightly. For example if you say that reality is not unbounded, but very very large, or in other ways too. However, I would like to hear what people who believe in the original premises have to say about this thought experiment. I am open to critique and a refutation. Thanks for reading."

Not all men, but many men. I don’t think this is the cause of the increase of single hood now contrary to what some feminists especially supporters of the 4B movement say.

I think what’s actually going on is that social and economic changes are making dating as a whole much harder. People lack third spaces to find potential partners in, and as a result they tend to go single for longer. Many people don’t have the time to seek out partners too. Online dating doesn’t compare with irl dating as far as getting results.

I think many people tend to interpret their experiences through a political lens. Probably due to external political beliefs. It started with incels and now women are having a similar interpretation.

But I think what’s really going on is essentially society is getting worse and people are trying to blame others for their problems. 

Women may perceive men as being generally bad because on dating apps, unlike in irl interactions don’t really display positive traits like being nice or whatever.

I’d argue men probably have gotten a bit worse after learning that being kind isn’t rewarded by dating apps, but this is probably pretty small.

The idea these shifts are from women “having more options” such as perpetual singlehood imo doesn’t really line up with any trends like one would think it would. If that was the case then all of this probably would have happened around the time of second wave feminism. Women have been long in the workforce and catching up to men’s income, so I imagine this would have happened quite a bit earlier rather than seemingly 40 years later.

Another reason I have to doubt this narrative, is that I think if it were true then basically being a male feminist would be a surefire way to get dates. It absolutely is not. Now I think South Korea is a different culture so South Korean men would act differently, but in the west I imagine this would be enough to tectonically affect the way men acted and resolve the issue.

I think this shift isn’t happening because in reality male feminists are still constrained by material conditions into having much higher difficulty in dating than previous generations. They probably have some level of advantage as it is an attractive trait, but basically I think women are probably in reality roughly as willing to settle as they used to be, but not in the position to easily find someone to settle with."

Probability seems highly useful as a method for making choices about what to do in respect of future events (e.g. investment decisions) because it is one of the most rigorous and logical heuristic tools we have.

However, it seems to me it is useless in determining the likelihood of past events or for judging the likely truth of someone's statement about the past because a) the past is infinitely complex and so we cannot assess all factors; b) even when the chance of any single outcome is infinitesimally small, one outcome still has to occur.

For instance, if I rolled a die, there were six possible results, but in theory each of them had only a 1/6 chance of occurring (though in reality air resistance, initial position, strength of the throw etc all likely determined it). So based on probability, I should reject the claim that I rolled a one, a two etc. up to six, even though one of them definitely occurred. So probability is useless for deciding on the truth of the claim that I rolled a six etc.

Where am I wrong?

PS what got me thinking about this was claims by theists that the low probability of the universe existing as it does suggests a designer."

The fact that they can now accept “tips” (bribes) for rulings and don’t even feel the need to conceal this means that they know no one can stop them either. 

Congress would be the only means to do so and thats just another issue. We have a legislative body that is so unwilling to work across partisan lines that effectively nothing gets done anymore. The system of “checks and balances” that we lie to kids about in school is an illusion that relies on everyone within the system acting in good faith. That hasn’t been the case in a long time.

Trump can lose in 2024. But it’s just delaying things until 2028. American voters are, frankly, not very intelligent and I don’t trust that they will succeed in not electing corrupt officials that will only appoint more corrupt judges that will issue more destructive rulings.

0,2024-07-01,CMV: Rejecting a visibly incompetent Biden is more important than any 1 term presidency,u/TheBestNarcissist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsverc/cmv_rejecting_a_visibly_incompetent_biden_is_more/,changemyview,"""The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.""

-George Orwell, 1984


The Democratic party machine has long lambasted anyone who has dared to question the mental acuity of Biden, allowing the absolute SHOCK value of the truth last Thursday. In factual reality Biden is ""an elderly man with a memory problem"", but the Dems are trying to sweep this under the rug. Something that people are not relating this to is the long term consequences of voters not denouncing Joe Biden as an acceptable candidate. I choose to look at this issue over a much greater timeline: how does this situation relate to history, and how will it relate to the future?

Voters need to reject Biden on the basis that he does not have the mental faculties to do his job. A strong rejection is the message the Democrats need to hear, as well as the Republicans and political parties the world over: Leaders cannot be at this stage of human cognitive decline. We are living in a truly unique time for our species. Life expectancy essentially remained flat for homo sapiens for 300,000 years and then drastically increased in the last 200 years.

So how does this problem relate to history? Well... This problem of old leaders losing their marbles started like 20 years ago [(6/10 of the oldest leaders OF ALL TIME ruled in the last 20 years)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_state_leaders_by_age). How does it relate to the future? For all of humanity and from here on out, this is going to be a problem. God willing our lifespan doesn't return down to the 30s. It's a new problem but it's here to stay.

We keep looking at this on a case-by-case basis. RBG. Pelosi. Biden. These aren't individual cases, this is the first few drops of the waterfall of mental decline in leaders that's coming.

Luckily the one thing our species is good at is recognizing and changing things. We need to collectively realize this problem, take away the taboo and talk about it, and make a decision: what mental acuity is acceptable for the leaders of our businesses, our governments, and civilizations?

I am now firmly in the camp of ""Biden is incapable of being president for 4 more years"". I was going to vote for him until Thursday. I'm a ""never-Trumper"". But I believe the democratic arguments that Trump will end Democracy are overblown: our institutions held once, and they will hold again. He's going to be out in 4 years no matter what. He is also declining in mental ability, but that is going to be hidden by the fact that his opponent is farther mentally gone. I would argue it is more important to reject the Democratic leader, who is visibly and audibly unfit for office, to push the parties to realize, frankly, what the voters have said in polls for a while now: We need younger and more clear-headed leaders. Otherwise where does it end? Do we continue to hide leaders' mental and physical abilities from the public and have staffers do their jobs? Do we accept a government full of people who should be in memory care centers and unelected support staff making decisions, unvetted by the voters?

This needs strong condemnation, and is more important than a 2nd term of any individual president. The Dems are wrong to downplay the reality of the debate, and will hopefully pay a hefty political price if they stick with Biden."

I was part of the Tea Party when I thought it was about small government rather than race, and I left the Republican party years ago because they focus on emotion-driven social issues  rather than effective governance. And by centrist, I don't mean I'm wishy-washy. I'm firm in my beliefs, and neither party shares most of them. Oh, and most importantly, I'm *adamantly* anti-Trump. The bloated prick has destroyed the minds of all my friends with this weird cult worship.

Here's the thing. I keep seeing Project 2025 brought up as the right-wing bogeyman, sort of the way conservatives bring up the Green New Deal. They keep saying that it's a blueprint for fascism, that everything will end if Trump gets the White House, the normal leftist fear-mongering that I've gotten bored with.

I would normally ignore it, but I do believe Trump is an enormous threat. So I looked up Project 2025 to see what the deal is. From what I could tell, it looks like a plan to gut the governmental administration.

That seems to be as far as the argument goes, and that's enough to send people into a panic. But I personally believe that the government IS too bloated and inefficient, and that it's full of unelected people wielding too much power too irresponsibly. Saying that Bob the Democrat  IRS agent is going to be replaced by Steve the Republican IRS agent doesn't fill me with existential dread. It feels like just more politics, and the left-leaning people who staffed all those federal jobs don't want to lose their sycophants.

So what am I missing? Why should I be so afraid?"

I'm well aware Democrat voters especially have been calling for expansion of the Supreme Court for several years now, but there's a gaping hole in this that I feel is being ignored.

Simply put, we all know that if expansion of the Supreme Court was started by one side, the other would expand it even further at the first available opportunity; it would go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth…
There would be no end to it and would we really need or even want a Supreme Court with, say, 500 justices?
I think a better idea would be a constitutional amendment that specifically states only a certain number can sit on the court (9 or 11 if they insist on odd numbers,) and which ends lifetime appointments for them, requiring that they either retire at a certain age or after a certain number of years; maybe at age 75 or after 20 years, whichever is closer and yes, this would be regardless of who appointed a given justice. Thomas, for example would have to step down now because he's 76 while Alito would have another year, Sotomayor another five years, Kagan another six because she was nominated and confirmed in 2010, Roberts another four years and five months or so etc. 

Would this throw Scotus into absolute chaos the first few cycles? No doubt but eventually, I think it would smooth things out.

0,2024-07-01,CMV: the SC's decision regarding Trump's immunity makes sense from a constitutional point of view,u/Stiblex,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dszd73/cmv_the_scs_decision_regarding_trumps_immunity/,changemyview,"Let me start by disclaiming that I'm no expert on US common law but I do have a law degree in the country I live in. I'm also very anti-Trump. That said, I think the decision of the Supreme Court that a president has criminal immunity from ""official acts"" isn't very surprising and makes a lot of sense outside of the political implications. My country has similar immunity laws and I'm using the same arguments. Here are they:

\* The president is head of the executive branch. When he's acting as president he's not in the capacity of himself but rather as the Executive branch. The Executive branch is assumed to always be acting on behalf of the public interest, just like the other branches of government. Why? Because it's the nature of the government, which by definition acts on behalf of the public interests because that's what gives it legitimacy. That's why the SC makes the distinction between official and unofficial acts. Unofficial acts is Trump acting in person, but official acts is him acting as the Executive branch.

\* Separation of powers assumes that each branch keeps the other in check, in theory anyway. The executive branch is checked by methods of legislating (making laws the executive has to abide to) and impeachments (removing a person of the Executive branch). Assuming the president has democratic legitimacy and so does congress, it makes sense for congress to be the one to check the president. It does not make sense for another branch of the Executive (police, DOJ, FBI, etc.) to check the president.

\* The president has the power to instruct the DOJ. It would not make sense for the DOJ to be able to prosecute an Executive branch that has the power to instruct itself. That's a loophole.

\* If the president is not immune from prosecution, he would be a suspect. A suspect has rights, mainly the right to remain silent. It does not make sense for the president to both have the right to remain silent but also abide to the Freedom of Information Act.

Let me make this clear: I'm not saying the president is above the law. He can still be corrected. I'm merely saying that the president is immune from prosecution in accordance with criminal law.  


Arguments that will change my view:

\* Logical rebuttals to the points I've made

\* Correction about my (wrong) interpretation of how the US government and its laws work

  
Arguments that don't change my view:

\* Ad hominems

\* Straw men or misinterpretations of what I said

\* Political arguments against Republicans or Democrats"

At that time, the country, then called Santo Domingo, had just 150,000 inhabitants. For comparison purposes, Puerto Rico already had 670 thousand and Cuba 1.4 million. It was a territorial area of ​​around 50 thousand km² – much larger than Puerto Rico, which has only 9 thousand km² of land area. Furthermore, Santo Domingo has a better geographic location than Puerto Rico, as it is not as affected by hurricanes. Much more natural resources, whether in arable land, water resources, minerals (one of the largest reserves of gold and nickel), a large natural port and exuberant nature - contrasting with the Haitian side of the island of Hispaniola which is heavily deforested and degraded in environmental terms.

In short, considering only the geographical aspects and the low population, it would have been an incomparably better acquisition than PR.

But not only that. I also see that it would have been perfectly possible to integrate Santo Domingo in cultural terms with the USA – differentiating it from PR, which continues to be a foreign society. As stated, there was a small population and also a plan by President Grant to settle post-war black southerners. The details of this plan to encourage black migration to the island were not outlined by the annexation rejection, but I think it could be as follows:



1. Immediately extend American citizenship to all islanders so they can migrate to the mainland and thus further reduce the Spanish-speaking population.

2. The federal government takes public land and buys private land, and then distributes the lots to black families – paying for the trip to the island and the initial assistance.

3. Establish military bases with black troops, who would live on the island

4. Create a state guard and fill all public administration positions in Santo Domingo with black people.

5. Build public works such as roads and dams to encourage the economic development of the territory, with the creation of jobs in the private sector and in construction, which would obviously be filled by black Americans.

6. Invest in wide dissemination of the benefits of migrating to Santo Domingo



Over time, Santo Domingo, a state built and run by black Americans, would become a refuge for those oppressed by Jim Crow and unofficial racism, attracting a steady stream of new emigrants for that reason alone.

The triracial Spanish-speaking population would not only be outnumbered by black Americans, but also absorbed over time, with some still leaving the island voluntarily.

Of course, I don't believe that all black people on the continent would move there, but I believe there would be many. Enough to erase Hispanic society and significantly reduce racial tension in the rest of the country.

One of the potential problems that would arise soon after annexation could be a native insurgency – and this was one of the reasons that led Senator Summer to lead the opposition to the treaty. I believe America could defeat the insurgency, especially by turning to black troops, biologically adapted to the tropics, and promising them land after conquering the country.

Another problem, this one long-term, would be America having a land border with Haiti. Well, it's about transforming the border into something more militarized and armored than the North-South border of the Koreas.

As for PR, I think that America should acquire the island as a protectorate after the Spanish-American war, to prevent it from returning to European colonialism, but instead of keeping it forever, prepare it for independence over a few decades, on the same path as the Philippines. Construction of public works, especially to mitigate the impacts of hurricanes; encourage American private investment; establish a family planning program; reorganize institutions and encourage the adoption of good public administration and business practices; and finally, set a firm date for independence so that Puerto Rican authorities do not become apathetic.



PS1:  I hope no one considers this post an idea that could have been used to get rid of black people. Especially because Santo Domingo would be a state of the Union. It is not a project like Liberia, which would be an independent state.



PS2: We would not need Puerto Rico due to its strategic location in military terms, given that the DR is also in that part of the Caribbean."

And despite the entirely separate humanitarian argument to be made, I've been stuck on the thought of: **does punishing homeless people even DO anything?**

I recognize the standard, evidence-supported Criminal Justice theory that tying fines or jail time to a crime is effective at deterring people from committing that crime - either by the threat of punishment alone, or by prescribing a behavioral adjustment associated with a particular act. However, for vulnerable populations with little or nothing left to lose, I question whether that theory still holds up.

* Impose a fine, and you'll have a hard time collecting. Even if you're successful, you're reducing a homeless person's savings that could be used for getting out of the economic conditions that make criminal acts more likely.

* Tear down their encampment, and they'll simply relocate elsewhere, probably with less than 100% of the resources they initially had, and to an area that's more out of the way, and with access to fewer public resources.

* Jail them, and it not only kicks the can down the road (in a very expensive way), but it makes things more challenging for them to eventually find employment.

Instead, **this is a return to the pre-English Civil War kings of absolute monarchy and risks reducing the power of Congress to a medieval talking house**.

Agreeing with Sotomayor's dissent, I think this decision is simply too catastrophically bad to allow the institution of the SCOTUS to retain any legal legitimacy. Presidents cannot be above the law. This is literally a constitutional crisis, and should be treated as such.

Keeping in mind that a SCOTUS judge's appointment is for life - assuming good conduct. There are degrees of bad in terms of bad decisions. This decision is so bad it couts as bad conduct vis à vis of their appointment.  
  
Keeping in mind SCOTUS **just** granted the president immunity from legal consequences for ordering the arrest of the people who gave him this power. 

Possible solutions in the medium-term include packing the courts because it is harder get a large number of people to agree with a radical activist position than it is to get a handful of people to do the same.

The war in Ukraine was a culmination of actions and hostilities since 2014 including Russia’s use of paramilitants, planting fake citizenships in Ukraine to falsely inflate the amount of ethnic Russians in the area, Putin claiming Ukraine is not a real country but rightful Russian land, a false claim propagated by the Russian Government of an ethnic genocide of Russians in Donbas, and saying it was because Ukraine was joining NATO (which would basically bar off Russia from invading because they wouldn’t dare to try in that scenario) which was really an excuse to sell the invasion.

The last straw was when Russia lined their troops in Belarus in an attempt to get the E.U to fold to their demands, which the E.U called a bluff. This led to Putin (who was having a falling approval rating) to either look weaker than he already does, or invade. He chose to invade (the 3 day operation). This wasn’t a “product” of Biden and there’s more than enough reason to believe Putin would have done it if Trump were in office.


• Trump has been insistent on this idea but has not said how


Trump is against aiding Ukraine. I know he has said it’s due to Europe not picking up slack, but Trump is certainly more than aware that his biggest advocate in the E.U (Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary who is a Putin suck up), has constantly blocked aid to Ukraine because the E.U requires a unanimous vote. Orban in his interview with Tucker Carlson that getting Trump back is the “solution” coming from someone who has done everything to prevent aid to Ukraine. I highly doubt that Trump is fully not aware of this. If there’s no aid, the only way the war “ends” is in a surrender where Russia likely annexes territory and they face Stalinist levels of persecution under Putin. There’s no “peace” in a surrender. 

You can claim peace talks as an option, but if Trump decides Ukraine has to give up the annexed territories (which I know he said he wouldn’t in his debate with Biden he likely would) then the “peace” is absent. Not to mention the U.S has tried but in doing so Russia has only agreed on outrageous terms.


• “Biden made the U.S look weak”

A yawn of a statement, Putin barely could hold his own ground against Prigozhin and had to compromise his government by succumbing to Prigozhin’s terms via pulling Wagner troops out of Ukraine and not subjecting the Wagner Group to the Ministry of Defense’s absolute authority they were going o be granted on July 1st of 2023 (which is what caused Prigozhin to attempt a coup). Putin does not look as strong as he makes himself out to be.

This was an act of desperation by Putin, his approval fell to 55% (keep in mind that is bad for a dictatorship) with how bad he handled the coronavirus such as internationally exporting Sputnik vaccines for political clout while Russian citizens were having a hard time getting any. 

Not to mention, unless Trump implied that he would use direct military action against Russia (which America wouldn’t do because it’s a PR disaster and has disastrous implications) there’s not much more we could do besides standing by Ukraine and giving consistent aid which Trump is against."

Both Naruto and One Piece have entire filler episodes as well as filler within canon episodes. So what really matters is that One Piece has a number of attributes which Naruto does not: 

1) More character development and character building. The biggest problem I have in this regard for Naruto is Sakura; I mean, get over yourself. In fact, most of the female characters are fairly stagnant.

2) World building. This one seems obvious, because it is what One Piece is most known for.

3) Amount of music. Naruto has that cool flute song as well as the villain music. The music in general is good, but there's just not as close to as many great songs and scores as One Piece.

4) Metaphors and historical implications and layers of depth. There's just so many double meanings, cultural and historical implications, and layers to uncover within One Piece. 

5) Plot flaws and inconsistencies. Naruto has a number of plot flaws, whereas One Piece has very few that aren't later explained or fixed.

disclaimer: I am black and while I don't that is important the last thing I want to see is people calling me racist.

The civil rights act of 1964 was attempting to fix the societal issue of racism and while I think that is a good moral virtue to uphold, I believe its terrible in practice and I will arguing for why and how its bring negative moral and legal impact to the society we live in.

The first argument I'll be making will be a moral argument as this is the main reason why the law was made and in order to properly critique it, I must bring up morals in one way or another.

The moral argument I will make is freedom of association, the natural right of freedom of association is for individuals to make a choice for who they want to associate or disassociate with and the civil rights act of 1964 doesn't allow for that in denying services or not hiring to some people for their race, sex, gender, or sexuality though it applies many other things as well. The reason why this is so important is because its an restriction on the individuals right to associate or disassociate with people they have an ideological/beliefs conflict with or flat out do not an individual either for their traits like race or sex or them as an individual. People should always have that choice to disassociate from whomever they please and in any situation where they can disassociate from other individuals.

The legal foundation for the civil rights acts of 1964 relies mostly on a logical fallacy or a logical fallacy I would the equity fallacy. The reason for this fallacy is because of disparate impact, disparate impact is a legal term meant to describe unintentional discrimination where outcomes for groups are unequal or worse than other groups in things like housing or employment. The problem with disparate impact is that it assumes discrimination without any actual evidence that people are being intentionally discriminatory against other groups but there are plenty of other explanations or other variables that account for why there is inequality between groups other than discrimination so it makes this entire legal concept a logical fallacy and the civil rights law as well for using it as well.

I believe that people should come together as a willing choice they make instead of being forced by gunpoint to legally not disassociate from each other. its no different from the jim crow law but instead of forcing people to disassociate its forcing association and not allowing people to disassociate when they want to. It a right that everyone human is allowed to do and I do not think the government has any right to restrict it other than to prevent the government themselves from being discriminatory."

One cannot simply go live in the woods for free and survive off of the land anymore,  because the government owns the land, and will send people with guns in to remove you from the land, and potentially lock you in a cage. 

Now one cannot even live on the street for free because being homeless is illegal, and people with guns will again, put you in a cage.

We are essentially forced to work under threat of being locked in a cage and then forced to work in prisons for slave wages.

There are social programs of course, like unemployment or disability insurance for people who cannot physically work, but their income is limited, and therefore so is their quality of life. People can even lose their disability benefits if they decide to marry someone who has an income or assets that go beyond the cap. It seems like if you are not able to make capital for someone else, you are for all intents and purposes, punished. 

There is the case of inheritance, where you are born rich and do not have to work like lower class people do, but often that is a result of exploitation of someone else’s labor somewhere down the line. They just got lucky to be a part of the ruling class and not the forced labor class. 

I don’t want to be bleak but with this revelation, I do feel like the motivation behind a lot of laws is to keep the lower class poor and working for the ruling class. I’d like to be proven wrong because it’s a bit of a depressing outlook but I can’t see it any other way right now.

The motive of these acts cannot be taken into account by the court; so long as they fall within his official powers, they are legal. An obvious upshot of this, which both Sotomayor and Jackson acknowledge, is that the President could legally order an assassination of a political opponent on domestic soil. The President is legally commander-in-chief of the military, and is constitionally obligated to protect America from threats, both domestic and foreign. 

All that a president needs to argue, then, is that they were acting in their official capacity to protect the internal security of the United States when they ordered rival politicians killed. Whether the 6-3 conservative SCOTUS will accept this argument, I imagine, is largely determined by the party of the President who orders the assassination. If a Republican such as Trump were to argue it, I imagine that they'd accept the logic; were a Democrat to try it, I imagine that the President's powers would be read in a significantly more narrow way.

As such, I don't see any reason why the following chain of events couldn't occur:

1) Some opportunity arises for President Trump to flex test extraordinary new powers. A journalist runs an unfavourable story about Trump; he declares that said journalist is a member of antifa who is trying to throw the country into chaos/incite extremism. He orders SEAL Team Six, or some other group of thugs, to murder that journalist, with promises of presidental pardons later. If possible, he takes the victim outside of the US first, to avoid local laws.

2) This comes out, and the case goes to the SCOTUS. The conservative SCOTUS rules that Trump was acting within his legitimate powers as commander-in-chief, and that he has the right to pardon whomever he wishes. No legal action can be taken.

3) Seizing off this victory, Trump assembles a death squad of brownshirts to intimidate, detain, and kill anybody who obstructs his presidency. Congressmen and Senators who publically criticise Trump, or try to organise an impeachment effort, have their houses burned down, their children taken to Guantanamo Bay, are beaten to death, etc. Again, pardon those involved after the fact, and try to commit crimes out of state if possible. Even if those involved do go to jail for breaking local laws, you can fundraise significant cash payouts to make it worth their while.

4) Trump strongarms this newly cowed legislature into abolishing the 22nd amenment. He tells his supporters to kill, detain, or threaten anybody who votes against changing the constitution, and pardons/pays them out later.

5) Come election time, Trump can have his legal death squads posted outside of every polling station in the country with AR-15s. These people can enter the polling booths, and look over the shoulders of prospective voters to check they vote correctly; they can also pay a visit to the counters later, and burn any votes cast for the Democrats + shoot anybody who objects. Again, if he gets legally challenged for this, he can argue that was acting in his capacity as CiC to defend the constitution by ordering his men to prevent electoral interference by foreign enemies/antifa/illegal immigrants.

6) Meanwhile, Trump orders his newly-cowed legislature to pack the Courts, and gets his brownshirts to murder any SCOTUS members who seems to be questioning the regime. He appoints judges based on loyalty, regardless of qualifications, and gets them to rubber stamp his every act. Eventually, he can simply declare that elections are indefinitely suspended, and the court will ratify that decision.

I'm not looking for a discussion of whether Trump would WANT to do this. I'm simply asking, based on the SCOTUS' interpretation of the Constitution today, what specific mechanism in US government would prevent Trump from pursuing this exact strategy? The only big hurdle is convincing the SCOTUS that, as commander-in-chief, the President can order anybody who he legitimately suspects is a threat to national security dead. Seems like that would be a fairly reasonable interpretation of the current law, given that two justices have entertained it already. 

Where specifically would Trump be stopped in this chain of events? Assuming the SCOTUS rules in his favour, the only real limiting factor would seem to be time; this would be a lot to achieve in one term, what with rulings on legality needing to go through the courts, and so many people to kill. But that isn't a particuarly reliable defence mechanism."
0,2024-07-01,CMV: It's totally natural to find 16-17 year olds attractive no matter what age you are.,u/russiansign,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dtaq41/cmv_its_totally_natural_to_find_1617_year_olds/,changemyview,"It seems like in society if you admit to finding anybody under 18 attractive in the slightest, you're a pedophile and a terrible human being. The thing is, I don't understand this. Many 17 and even 16 year olds often look exactly like 18-20+ year olds. Some people just look older, some look younger. I often can't tell the difference.

I understand that whether you act on it when you find out they're under 18 is very important, but still. Do people think that someone 17 years old and 364 days is incapable of being attractive but as soon as they turn 18, they're fair game? What the hell is this? I feel like I cannot be alone in thinking this but I never hear anyone acknowledge this.

Now, my ideal age for a woman is maybe 21-27, but I have seen 16-17 year olds I would consider attractive (No, I wouldn't date them) and I do not consider myself a pedophile. What gives?"

Cities like San Francisco spend over $1.1 billion per year, and over $50K/homeless person. 

I think cost isn't a barrier to sheltering the homeless, but ego and liability law is. 

The reality is that basic shelter is not expensive. If desired, governments could build permanent long term shelter from the elements for a for a few thousand dollars. They could be something along the lines of cinderblock rooms with steel roofs, and located on inexpensive land away from the city center, and connected by bus. this is already infinitely better than the current state, but social services and even police could be provided to these locations. 

Im convinced that there are two reason this doesnt happen:

1) the public would rather have the homeless live in far worse conditions and maintain plausible deniability than be directly involved in an ""imperfect"" solution. As a result, they are willing to let hundreds die in the street rather than be part of this improvement. 

2) Providing a massive improvement that isn't perfect exposes cities to liability. If hundreds of people die and are raped in the streets, the city has no legal exposure. If 1% of that number are hurt in a government slum, there could be millions of damages and even class action suits, despite the massive advantage. 

Please change my mind. This can come in a few flavors:

A) Arguments this solution wouldn't be an improvement

B) Arguments these reasons against it are different

C) Arguments that it CAN be done"

I have my own life. I work a full-time job five days a week, and part-time jobs/hustles on Saturdays. My rent is too damn high, and every time I try to build up a cash cushion to move somewhere less expensive, it goes up yet again. I have health issues, and so do my two aging parents who I do my best to look after and help navigate the medical system. I'm depressed and anxious and on medication. Thankfully, I don't have children to look after. I don't even know how I could manage with kids. 

My point is - my plate is already full. 

I am a Democrat. I want my party to preserve and protect our democracy. I want them to defend the rule of law and order. I want them to fight back against the elements that have been consolidating power and willfully - and in full public view - eroding the meaningfulness of truth, honesty, and integrity. I vote for them every election. In the past, when I had the free time to, I even campaigned for them. But they simply aren't fighting hard enough. They seem weak and ineffectual to me, at least when it comes to the existential threat that faces our government right now. The Republican party is passionate, energized, zealous. The Democratic party, meanwhile, seems more concerned with always taking the moral high ground and keeping their hands clean than they are with winning this struggle. They refuse to 'stoop' to the rival party's level, reject any notion of 'fighting dirty' like their opposition does, and seem to be indicating that they believe that the best course of action is to constantly remind *us* to vote vote vote vote vote as the only apparent recourse we have for staving off this rising dark tide. Why is this all on us? Why won't *they* fight? It's as though they think everything will work itself out if they just keep fighting fair, but that has never worked and isn't working and will never work as a valid strategy to fight back.

As time goes on I feel as though my party simply isn't doing what it needs to do. The opposition is making massive gains and consolidating power, completely out in the open for everyone to see, while the most that my party seems to be able to do is slow them down somewhat - make it so that their coup will take years to manifest instead of happening all in a single afternoon. 

If the Democratic party isn't going to do the job I vote them into office to do, then it starts making sense to me that I might as well switch to the party that seemingly will not be stopped. I don't agree with the overwhelming majority of their views, in fact I find many of them morally reprehensible, but if I stick with the Democratic party and the worst-case scenarios begin to unfold - will sticking with the Democratic party, because they're of a higher morality, protect me and my loved ones from the party that's on track to install itself permanently at the helm of this country? Wouldn't it be safer to align myself and my family with them instead of clinging onto the 'less evil' party when it starts becoming dangerous to do so? 

It's starting to seem like the Democratic party serves merely as token opposition to the Republican party, whether deliberately or by unfortunate happenstance. My faith in the party has never been lower, and I'm beginning to feel as though they don't really count as valid good-faith resistance to the erosion of democracy. They don't seem like they're actually going to fight for the soul of this nation, and if that's the case, why would I remain aligned with them? It would be safer to just sign up with the people that they're allowing to walk all over them, so that if the worst comes to pass, my 'papers' will say I'm not their enemy. 

Like I said, I have my own life and my own family to look after and protect. If the Democratic party will not defend American democracy, then I need to start doing what *I* can to defend the lives and livelihoods of myself and my family, and increasingly it is appearing as though the best way to do that is align myself with the party that no one has the balls to take commensurate action against. 

If I am wrong, if the Democrats truly have more up their sleeve to defend this country with other than their fervent hope that the public will vote for lawful and civic-minded politicians, then please - try to CMV."
0,2024-07-01,"CMV: I believe that all things we claim to kmow are actually simple guesses and estimations, and that, in reality, we actually know nothing.",u/tryingtolearnstuffs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dtc8pw/cmv_i_believe_that_all_things_we_claim_to_kmow/,changemyview,"Title says my main idea but I will explain further here.

The universe is 10²¹ light years across in all estimation, taking into account the rate of cosmic inflation. This is incomprehensible to us. As well, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. This is once again incomprehensible to us.

I make these points to demonstrate two things. First, that we are fundamentally incapable of understanding the universe or conseptualizing it's vastness; and two, that we cannot think beyond ourselves consistently.

For all of human history we have found ourselves to be at the center of the cosmic show. The very things which religions are based on, and belief systems are built upon is this very idea, that we are special. And yet this is so incorrect it isn't even funny. The true fact is that we are fully and entirely insignificant in all reality. So small, that is makes a microbe look like a gas giant if we were to compare cosmic sizes to those here on earth. Thus, we have a very big problem. We cannot think outside of ourselves.

Whether it be philosophy, science, religion, art, anything, we cannot think outside of our human experience. This is the very problem. We as creatures are so incredibly limited in scope and in our very senses that we are really just guessing. We fail to grasp that the universe is so vast and impossible to understand. 

This idea undermines all religions and philosophies except the most pragmatic ones such as existentialism or absurdity. As those are the only one that are honest enough to state that reality is impossible to understand. As well, everything that we try to understand or know will always be based upon the subjective layer of us, thus failing to ever reach any truth given that we can never know anything true due to subjectivity. Everything is true and nothing is at the same time.

All that being said, I doubt that we can know anything true or with certainty. The only things we can know are that we are conscious and to doubt everything at all times. I think that all science, philosophy, religion, etc. Are all grasping at straws and are wrong always. I also think, due to the vastness of the universe, the suffering we experience, and the bleakness of the fact we will never know anything, that the only correct view of life is nihilism and hate for Being itself. We are insignificant and have no meaning at all, and yet it is only our hubris and arrogance that we think we actually matter. It is as much a faith claim, in my view, as any religious claim, because to say we matter is to say the cosmos would be different without us, and yet this clearly isn't the case.

Finally, I have read idealism, nearly all religious scriptures, and most forms of philosophy, so I do kmow that there is an argument that we somehow create reality through our observation. This is laughably false, because as schopenhauer put it, ""this is the worst of all worlds"". There is no reason to think that we are important even in our cognition. There is also no evidence for any spiritual world, idealism, or anything beyond base physicality.

Anyways do your worst. Truly I would love to be convinced that we matter in the face of the void that is the universe, because if we don't than not much matters to life and we all could die for all I care.

I agree with the statement (since even life itself is temporary) but not really the application of the statement. I hear the statement used anytime a person is considering or has already committed suicide.I just wanted to say it seems that the statement implies that suicide is viewed as a solution. I don't think suicide is always viewed as a solution and I’m thinking the flaw in that statement is that it’s assuming the suicidal person 1) has (a)problem(s) that needs a solution, and 2) sees suicide as the solution. To that I'm saying the assumption that suicide is viewed as a solution by those considering it can take away from other reasons for suicide and mean alternative motives for suicide get ignored. I feel like the statement takes away from reasons people commit suicide outside of wanting to solve a temporary problem. I can also go the extra mile and say some problems aren’t “temporary” (short term). So, for example, serving a life sentence, it’s clear the issue facing the individual isn’t short term. Or maybe being blind. Wouldn’t it make more sense in certain situations to validate a person in their experience, recognize they will have to deal with an aspect of their life until their death, and then get them to reframe their reality into something that makes the long term aspect of their life they identified as no longer being viewed as an issue by them. I can already imagine somebody would respond by saying “see, the perspective was the temporary problem because it was changed through reframing”. That makes sense but still, the aspect of the suicidal persons life that they once identified as a problem still effects them even if their perspective changed, so that’s why I’m thinking the “problem” isn’t always temporary and suicide isn’t always chosen as an answer to a problem."

My theory? A significant amount of people deep down fucking hate immigrants. Any liberal democracy will crumble in the face of them. When a democratic country is more homogenous a lot of people can walk around and see all the good things my country does for MY people.

",u/bananataffi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dtdlpx/cmv_out_of_body_experiences_should_be_regarded_as/,changemyview,"I will be using ‘OBEs’ to refer to out of body experiences. I am defining the term 'supernatural' as phenomena attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature.

There are a multitude of peer reviewed and verifiable studies and journals that consistently demonstrate that OBEs are the direct result of certain brain activity.

[Olaf Blanke published a study in 2002](https://www.nature.com/articles/419269a), from the abstract: ""Here we describe the repeated induction of this experience by focal electrical stimulation of the brain's right angular gyrus in a patient who was undergoing evaluation for epilepsy treatment. Stimulation at this site also elicited illusory transformations of the patient's arm and legs (complex somatosensory responses) and whole-body displacements (vestibular responses), indicating that out-of-body experiences may reflect a failure by the brain to integrate complex somatosensory and vestibular information.""

[He published another study on OBEs in 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632275/) in which evidence is reviewed that suggests that these events may be the result of the “disruption of several phenomenological and cognitive aspects of self-processing, causing illusory reduplication, illusory self-location, illusory perspective, and illusory agency that are experienced as an OBE.” 

[A study done by Cheyne and Girard](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa070010) on correlations between OBEs and sleep paralysis in 2007 showed that by stimulating “the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus on the right side in a patient” they could induce OBEs. In this experiment both of these scientists were able to repeatedly induce an OBE by stimulating this part of the brain. 

In spite of the evidence to suggest otherwise, there are still people who claim OBEs to be the result of supernatural means. Nothing supernatural has ever been demonstrated to exist and until it does it is irrational and illogical to claim that anything is the result of that. There is a clear and consistent demonstration that OBEs are the result of brain activity and until that changes that should simply be the preferred explanation. "

I will be perceived as an immigrant/ stranger forever, as it should be. Every continent, or country, have their own features. Every population has its own somatic features, which distinguish itself with other populations. A Chinese, for example, has a yellowish skin, black hair, almond haped eyes, and so on. He will be recognised immediately for being Asian. You will recognize immediately an African for his somatic features, you will never say he is Japanese. You will recognize an European simply because of his white skin. Populations are different due to somatic features. 

Having a South African passport will never make me an African, only on paper. I have nothing to do with their population as I am an immigrant and a stranger. Doesnt mean that I have no right to stay there or to be treated without respect. 

So an European in Africa will never be a true African. An African in Europe will never be a true European. This is because of somatic features, such as skin color.

This is literally what keeps internet running at high availability.

The blameless part is really important here, because once you remove blame from the equation, you approach the problem completely different. Ok, the guy was speeding or failed to yield, so technically he's to blame. But what can we do in the future to prevent people from speeding in that location? Can we make a crossing that completely avoid necessity to yield? Maybe the accident would be avoided completely if the baner that obscures view would be removed? There are tons of questions you can ask once blame is removed. And I'm not saying that people shouldn't be fined once the blame is established, but I'm saying that **blameless incident analysis should go in pair with normal investigation.**

What I fail to understand is why we, as a society, invest our time into investigating failure of whatever obscure internet service but don't do the same for literal lives lost. With every fatal accident, someone's reality ceases to exist, and I can't imagine an event of a greater impact.

Let it be movies, books, music and whatever other media you can think of. My post will focus on these three mostly, because these are the stuff I mostly consume, so if you want to talk about something more direct like going to a live-hosted performance of the aforementioned person, then please give a more detailed explanation of how the event works to avoid misunderstandings. Thanks.  
I will refer to the person who has controversial politics/done controversial things as the ""Artist"" from now on. 

My reasons: 

Reason 1: This is easy and most people agree with this, but I'll include it nonetheless: If the Artist is dead, then there is absolutely no harm, since he doesn't benefit at all since, well he is dead. 

Reason 2: If the Artist is alive, its not just THEM the buying of the product that benefits but dozens or even thousands of other people who also worked on it, other actors, editors, even the shop you buy the book from etc etc. 

Reason 3: Buying/consumming a product is done for enjoyment. I hold my enjoyment as a more important thing then whatever measly support me buying my product gives that person. This is a reason is one that will be hard to argue if even possible because its a personal belief, and therefore subjective but if you think you have a good philosophical argument, go for it. 

Reason 4: Consuming a product a lot of the times does not even benefit the Artist directly:   
-In case of a movie/series they have already been paid. Sure, royalites are a thing, but its such a fraction of a benefit compared to their initial salary.  
-In case of a book, it all depends on the book deals etc, which I'm not familiar with, but I at least know that unless you are a HUGE hit, you are not getting rich-rich from selling books. (If I'm wrong in this statement then correct me, I'm not overtly familiar with book royalty mechanics)  
-In case of music, its well known how little streaming pays artists. I consume 99.9% of music this way, its very rare for me to actively buy merch/vynl, so my stance is mostly about streaming, less about merch, but feel free to argue about the merch/vynl too.

Reason 5: I acknowledge that consuming the Artists works potentially gives them a platform in the way of being able to be called into talk shows, interviews etc. But, in todays world with social media being widespread, the importance of these fell hard. Anyone can write something on Twitter or Facebook or Insta and let it reach hundreds of thousands of people with their message. So the impact of the Artist given a popularity-reasoned platform is way less important today then it was 20 years ago.

Reason 6: Many times, especially in movies, the Artists politics or deeds they have done have no relation to the work itself. For example if an actor is a rapist, child molester, murderer etc, that does not reflect on the movie at all, it won't become a worse movie because of it.

Reason 7: I believe in separating the art from the artist. 

Extra things to mention, so we don't get bogged down in the arguments about them:

1: I don't think its a problem at all if someone DOESN'T consume these works. Its everyones right to protest and not do it, and I don't have a problem with it at all. Its just not my personal view.  
2: Obviously, if the work itself is overly racist/problematic etc then its usually not well written, therefore not enjoyable. So please don't argue about ""but why do you want to listen/read/watch racist/etc media?"". The reason is that the media itself is not racist/problematic usually. Or even if it does contain tones like that, it does not mean that the work itself is bad. Its easy to look at many previously beloved media that people suddenly say is shit because its problematic. It always was problematic, but it was still enjoyable. Perfect example is H.P Lovecraft. His stories are enjoyable,  (usually) well written, and scary. They are also EXTREMELY racist. (just look up how he named his cat). Two things can be true at the same time.  
3: Obviously I don't think that these people should get off free because they are Artists. If they did or said illegal things, they should be punished to the full extent of the law.  
4: Being an Artist does not absolve one of being a horrible person.  
5: Please argue with logical ways, emotional arguments like (""I should feel bad for watching a person who is a known rapist on screen"") is not one that will change my view probably, since emotions are subjective and personal.  Again, I respect your view and emotions, and have no problem with it, but its not going to convince me. 

Why do I want my view changed?  
I always seek improvement, and I'm the type of person who reevaluates their views periodically because I don't want to ""get stuck"" in one just because I thought it was right 5 years ago. This topic is one that had me wondering recently. 

If you bring up specific Artists in your argument, please include a one-line description about who they are and what is controversial about them, as I, or other people reading the comments may not know them. Thanks.

These accounts often share striking similarities across different cultures and belief systems, suggesting a common underlying experience. Throughout history and across different civilizations, beliefs in an afterlife have been central to religious and cultural practices. These beliefs often provide a framework for understanding the purpose of life and the continuity of existence beyond the physical realm."

Mike Tyson is athletic for his age, but he cannot possibly keep up with a trained fighter that is half his age.

The founding fathers knew the power of words over the people, that's why the founding fathers charge the president to protect the constitution on his oath of office. 

It is the president's responsibility to make sure the laws are followed and the integrity of the constitution is protected. If it is left to the people, free speech can turn the people into their own worst enemies.

A president that is witnessing crimes and the destruction of the constitution yet chooses to do nothing about it in the hopes that ""the people"" will fix it with their votes is both Naive and Coward.

The subtext of all of this is that, although Biden is president, he won’t order arrests or executions of any political rivals. He won’t stage a coup if he loses. But Trump would and will do all of the above.

The SCOTUS just gave Biden the power to have them literally murdered without consequences, so long as he construes it as an official act of office. But they’re not scared because they know Biden and Democrats would never do that, but Trump would and also will reward them for giving him that power.

I’m not advocating for anyone to do anything violent. I wish both sides were like Democrats are now. I also don’t understand how, if Trump wins the election, we can just sit idly by and hand the reins of power back to someone who committed crimes including illegally trying to retain power in 2020, and is already threatening to use the power from yesterday’s ruling to arrest, prosecute and possibly execute his political rivals.

E.g if you dive beyond a reasonable depth (depending on the location), you accept that you will be left to die by emergency services. Your diving partner can give it a go, but if they decide to surface, nobody will come down for you.

I saw that LA is forcing all schools to have the Ten Commandments in classrooms. And then I saw that OK is forcing all public schools to teach the Bible. I think there is also irony in the fact that these states rank lowest in education, but I digress. 

Essentially, forcing religion into schools is indoctrination. I guess the same way the right sees gay people’s existence is indoctrination. 

This is personally enough for me, a middle ground political viewer (perhaps left leaning) agnostic to have further reasons to not reproduce. I think a lot of people in the newer generations are feeling the same way, of at least not wanting kids for one reason or another. I think forcing religion into the state and publicly funded spaces like schools and so forth will be another reason for younger folks to not have kids. 

I guess there might be a few points here:
-Younger generations (millennials, gen Z) are already less likely to reproduce than older generations were. 
-Forcing religious beliefs on younger generations by state mandated orders is only going to perpetuate this. I know I personally cannot afford to not work and homeschool a child, and all private academies are religiously based.

As if in every instance it’s better to split up than to stay together for the kids. I believe the majority of the time yes that’s probably the case, but the level of which people automatically suggest that doesn’t account for how complicated and nuanced these situations can be. 

I’m open to having my view changed because I’m not an expert. 

Number 1 reason is the upheaval of a divorce could be more psychologically damaging to kid than living with parents who don’t love each other but can remain civil to each other. Divorces cause massive hits to finances and can lead to total lifestyle changes. It can even force one party to need to move far away for financial reasons making that the parent more absent in the kids life. Every kid is different. I truly believe there are some that would be more traumatized by that upheaval than living with parents that don’t want to be with each other anymore. 

I do believe in most situations separating is for the best, especially if volatile arguments are happening frequently. (Even successful couples can have a blow out fight once every few years). But I believe the rate at which this advice is expensed does not match the reality of nuanced and complicated these situations can be. "

In Canada we have amazing libraries with historical prints that could be compared to today's text books.

America is so fundamentally ashamed of their past, that they continually rewrite it.

Canadian books have stated since 1812 that they were invaded because the people who experienced those events **'felt'** invaded and thus they can remember the trauma.

American books since 1812, have been a massive orgy of mixed works that fight and debate each other currently 18 working names for the conflict into literature.

  
Canada in every single book since 1812, even in Indigenous languages described it as ""The Invasion of Canada"". If you are lost at this point, it would probably make sense for you to know that the word Canada is older than the US nation.

Americans **'thought'** they were in the right as invaders, then invaded the easiest local targets to them, which was the richest farmland in all of Canada.

Russians **'thought'** they were in the right as invaders, then invaded the easiest local targets to them, which was the most amount of farmland in all of Europe.

Because American didn't **'feel'** these experiences they can't remember what happened. Just a massive mix of information as they were defeated over and over and over again. 

Because Russia didn't **'feel'** these experiences, they can't remember what happened. Just a massive mix of information as they are defeated over and over and over again. 

  
1812 is the founding story of Canada, it's the connective tissue for all history, culture and heritage. It's a time when people saw Invaders were invading farm land, burning towns and raping families, they said they had enough. They didn't care if they were Six Nations, British, Loyalist or even American, all people in the land of Canada rose up to defeat the invaders.

Some very weak theoretical arguers try to blame Canada's occupier in false narratives (since this is probably the 16th revisitation of this by now). Some even like to blame the British, then attacked Quebec despite the fact that Quebec was under occupation under the British. So from the Quebecois perspective, Americans were invading their home, so they united with all other peoples to defeat them.

America has about 18 different versions of this historical event with some of the most pathetic being ""The Skirmish"" ""The American Civil War 2"".

When America was told it was wrong for such soft sanctions in 2015 on Russia, they shrugged it off.

If America is always re-writing it's history, when the hell are they going learn from their own mistakes? Let alone how the hell are they going to unite the country when everyone has a different set of historical facts?

That's worse, someone will spend their time trying to argue this, despite 1000's of historical documents and proof that Munroe Document was drafted before 1812. That's how sad society is now. We can't even know ourselves, and we don't know when we're the bad guy.

That's why I think we'll see the Burning White House Candles make a comeback in Canada soon, especially as America invades it with media narratives."

While his dorky and meek Peter Parker was ok enough, when he dons the mask he doesn’t have anywhere near as much charm or charisma as the other two actors. Every line feels forced; his overall performance in the films leaves a lot to be desired.

Ideally, a Spider-Man actor encapsulates both aspects of the full character. That’s why I’ve always thought Tom Holland is the best choice. A lot of the negativity towards him is largely due to the movies he’s in, and the fact that other MCU characters intrude on his storylines (cough, Iron Man, cough). But his Peter Parker is dorky but friendly, and his Spider-Man is charismatic and quippy. Plus he fits the physical characteristics the closest, which is why he was Stan Lee’s ideal choice for the character.

Simply put, we can't. We have effectively created a two-tier legal system with America holding itself to completely separate rules than what exists on the world stage.

Crushed ice melts as it's being crushed because of friction for starters then you incorporate the time it takes to be delivered after being crushed, all the while it's being exposed to open air as the flap for the crushed ice opens as it's being crushed.

By the time you get crushed ice it is already melted and turned to water by and large .

It is the inferior ice option on most fridges and people that use it over regular cubed ice are stupid. 

Not only does crushed ice melt but if you are using a straw you are more likely to get it clogging your straw it's also generally harder to sip your drink with because the small ice shards tend to settle at the top so now you're crushing the crushed ice with your teeth while you're trying to enjoy your drink that you simply wished was just colder.

Crushed ice serves one single potential use and that is simply for boo boos crushed ice is superior for ice bags as it can comform to the shape of your body where cubed ice is uniform and constant. "

I believe it's acceptable to ask someone to close the window if they're not actively enjoying the view. However, I find it impolite to do so otherwise. An individual could simply block out the sunlight with an eye mask. Therefore, by asking someone who is appreciating the view to close the window, you're essentially asking the window seat occupant to forgo their own enjoyment to compensate for your lack of preparation. Many people choose the window seat specifically for the view, which can be very cool, especially during takeoff and landing.."

The fitness industry recognizes the fact that body composition, not just weight is important, and science does as well. But I cannot recall a doctor testing either at any of my physicals or hearing about a physical where a doctor did test those things. 

This is problematic for a couple of reasons . First, there are some obese people who are actually healthy but due to muscle mass register as obese even if they have low body fat and good body composition. On the flip side, and probably even a bigger issue, there are some skinny people with excess body fat and poor body composition (~30% based on what I've read) who do not realize they are at risk because their BMI is fine. 

I do acknowledge that these tests would make some people uncomfortable, but these tests would also give patients a much more complete picture of their health which is the point of physicals in the first place. 

I understand why this would be a problem in school physicals. The equipment is expensive, students could feel ashamed and embarrassed if the tests weren't very private, and I don't think parents would want teachers performing these tests, and I completely agree. School is not the place for this sort of thing. 

But doctors have equipment/access to this equipment, doctors offices are private, and doctors are already trusted to examine children.

",u/Left-Occasion1275,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dtygih/cmv_saying_kamala_harris_was_a_dei_hire_or_that/,changemyview,"I want to start by saying that I have no particular love for Kamala Harris. I don't hate her by any means, but she was never my ideal candidate for President OR Vice President.   
  
Many people (okay, I'm seeing a lot of people on Reddit) argue that Kamala Harris was chosen as Vice President purely because she is a Black woman, reducing her selection to a ""DEI hire."" This perspective is not only reductive but also unfairly dismissive of her qualifications and achievements. Kamala Harris served as the Attorney General of California and as a U.S. Senator, roles that provided her with substantial experience in governance and law. 

Her selection was based on her competence and political acumen, not ONLY her race and gender. If Kamala Harris were truly a DEI hire chosen solely for her identity, why select her specifically? Why not opt for any random Black woman? The fact is, Harris was chosen because she had a national profile from years in government in politics and yes this in addition to appealing to Black and women voters, something that it COMPELTELY NORMAL in choosing a Vice President running mate. 

In contrast, Mike Pence was chosen by Donald Trump to appeal to White Christian voters. Despite this clear act of pandering to a specific demographic, Pence did not face the same level of scrutiny or criticism for being chosen based on his gender or color of his skin. This double standard reveals an underlying bias in how female and minority politicians are perceived and judged compared to their white male counterparts...or at least how that plays out with Democratic/Republican constituencies.   
  
Accusations of ""entitlement"" to the Presidency I feel are also unfounded. To further illustrate this double standard, consider Donald Trump. No one accused him of feeling ""entitled"" to the Presidency, despite the fact that he had never served a single day in an elected position of public trust before running for President. Trump, born into wealth and living in a golden tower, decided to run for the highest office in the land simply because he 'wanted it.' In stark contrast, Kamala Harris has climbed the political ladder through hard work and yes, playing the political game. Regardless of one's opinion on her politics, it's undeniable that she has put in the work and earned her place in the political sphere.

Similarly, the argument that she feels ""entitled"" to the Presidency echoes the baseless accusations faced by Hillary Clinton. Despite spending most of her adult life in public service—serving as a U.S. Senator and Secretary of State—Clinton was frequently labeled as feeling it was ""her turn"" to be President. This accusation lacked any substantive evidence of entitlement and served only to undermine her extensive qualifications and dedication to public service.

The same people who are saying Donald Trump was fit to be President in 2016 are the same people saying that DECADES of experience did not qualify Hillary Clinton nor Kamala Harris for the Presidency. "

Yes, even before the Ottoman empire.",u/The_RedfuckingHood,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dtyzrd/cmv_russia_is_bulgarias_worst_enemy_yes_even/,changemyview,"Hello, a bit of a rant as a Bulgarian. I assume most of you will not assume history so let me give you the basics:  
In 1396, Bulgaria fell under Ottoman slavery. There was a revolutionary fighter Vasil Levski who started the Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee in 1869, Romania. However, he was betrayed and hanged in 1873. Then the Russian empire during the Russo-Turk War 'liberated us' from the Ottoman empire in 1878. Then we gained full independence in 1908. Then in 1944, we fell under communism and we were the most loyal country to Russia.  
And you will wonder ""How is Russia Bulgaria's worst enemy."" they managed to accomplish what the Ottoman empire couldn't do for nearly 5 centuries- wipe out our national identity. Mostly every Bulgarian(Mostly, there are some who don't but they're in the minority, but I'm one of them) thinks we owe everything to Russia and that we should be close to them and to 'fuck the West and America'.  
 And we always side with them(Not the government, but the population), hell most of the older generation misses the USSR and how 'great' it was. And they said Bulgaria had the most powerful army on the Balkans(Judging by how the Soviet equipment is doing in Ukraine, I'm glad we never went to war) and we were the fourth largest metal/steel producer in the world. And they act like it's something to brag about. Do you wanna know what that tells me? That we were the USSR's factory. And no wonder there's fucking brain drain in the new generations.   
And our government literally tried to get Bulgaria to join the USSR officially.  
Do you wanna know what's more ironic? Our revolutionary fighters HATED Russia, they DESPISED the country. Georgi Rakovski(Another great fighter) called them 'savages'. Vasil Levski said and I quote ""Those who liberate us will also enslave us"", Hristo Botev also said something but I can't find the text. Another fighter said: ""DAMNED BE THE SECOND THE RUSSIANS ENTERED BULGARIA"" (It's not exactly that but its the rough translation) And the majority of the Bulgarian people love Russia and ignore what they said....They think we owe Russia everything, that there would be 'no Bulgaria'(I will bet you we would have freed ourselves after the Ottoman empire collapsed). And let me tell you- Levski is basically our Jesus, and they ignored what he said.  
Bulgaria is that little hurt child that still loves its father despite him favoring the other child. That's right- Fucking Serbia.  
I'm ranting here because I see Bulgarians supporting Russia. And I'm sad because they ignore what our greatest Bulgarians have said about Russia. We were so full of potential back in the 20th Century but Allas...our leaders were dumb.  I guarantee you that If Russia invaded us as it did with Ukraine, the majority of the population won't fight back, they would welcome those scumbags with open arms.  
That's why I don't see the Ottoman Empire as Bulgaria's worst enemy- Russia is. And then Bulgaria became its worst enemy and the USSR took advantage of that... Which saddens me as a Bulgarian...I'm done with the rant.

It's a threat to our safety for the president to be feeble. Responses to nuclear threats have to be decided in under 30min, imagine Biden trying to wake up at 3:30am to decide whether to launch the nukes.  

The Democrats basically conspired to make Hillary and Biden/Harris the nominees, muscling out younger and more exciting candidates before the primaries. This time there weren't even primary challengers for Biden. The Republican party's candidate selection problems are too self-evident to bother writing. There's no sign of either party improving for next time either.

Since the Rs and Ds consistently fail to provide us with reasonable choices, we need more candidates from more parties. The only way for us to have more options next time is to show up to vote for third parties. If you live in a non-swing state then your vote doesn't affect the election outcome anyway. But if you vote 3rd party that documents that there's a person that's motivated to go and vote and not voting for Ds and Rs anymore. Either it pressures Ds and Rs to reform or it slowly builds momentum for new parties, both of which are positive.

I'd love to hear a carefully reasoned argument why I shouldn't vote 3rd party in this election."

Money is not necessary to live a safe and comfortable life. But, it means you can convietnly trade with others. There are some places where trade is daily. In some places you may be in danger by not trading, because their is a mandatory tax, citizenship, or growing food/hunting is illegal without some form of money, no matter how small. And on the faces of these bills, are the people who were supposedly voted in. I am making this post in the hopes to better understand people who think that voting for a face that may be on a future bill, has a point. To clarify I am talking about optional voting, not forcefully mandatory. Although here in the us it is not mandatory, just highly recommend by schools. 

 So any modern person is supposed to be able to be voted in, and the idea is people can collectively decide who would be the best leader of the people for a few years. 

But in the USA, it doesn't quite happen like that. Almost every president was connected to a political party. Using money to fund support. And both candidates are selected by the USA government itself. 

The electoral college is not supposed to overrule the presidential vote, according to the book. But they do. Just like how the judge may overrule the jury, or the president veto the bill. Even if it's not recommend, and even if it wasnt so common, the option is still there. And even when the invidvual is in office, they are commanded by the board of directors. Checks and balances are apart of the system, but the three branches of judical, executive, and legaslative are all working for the same company/government.

I ove Americans. But the not ones on the tv in the suits. I mean the ones who I see in real life, day to day, working hard and doing their part so that all different jobs and fields come together to form a working society.

I see that as it's own sub-genre entirely. Hip-Hop country and mainstream ""pop country"" is simply just a catchy tune with cliche lyrics that does little for storytelling within a melody that many artists are able to capture. I do think there can be fun in that in terms of casual listening depending on the artist, (not looking at you, Hardy), but it's simply a different twang on pop music.

But, there's a ton of absolutely incredible modern artists and bands within the genre who are exceptionally talented vocalists, and capture the true unique acoustic sound that's just so unique from any other genre.

The beauty of true country music is that it's storytelling in the form of song that invokes emotion, thoughts, feelings, and calls on one's own experience. It's music that makes you feel something, and I think that's a beautiful form of art that is underappreciated for what it is beyond the people you hear on the radio or at the bar.

I may be biased, as I grew up in Tennessee and still live near Nashville, so many people I grew up with and know are involved in the business but there's so many talented people who are true artists in the craft that go so unnoticed for how truly talented they are. But, I wish there were more people out there who could appreciate how great true country music can be.

United States doesn't change anything meaningful about what the president can and can't do while in office, and this decision will have no noticeable impact on how the office of president functions. 

**This Ruling Does Not Make the President Immune to Consequences**

Before this ruling, the understanding was that the process for holding the president accountable for wrongdoing was impeachment. After this ruling, the courts have established that the process for holding the president accountable for wrongdoing was impeachment. As an example: Nixon broke all manner of laws, was impeached, and resigned before he could be convicted before being pardoned by Gerald Ford. But he was never sent to a criminal trial even though he obviously broke the law. 

Congress has broad discretion on what they can impeach a president for, and they can still impeach a president for official acts or even conduct which is not illegal but which is immoral. The SCOTUS decision does nothing to undermine that. Many presidents have broken the law while in office, some for good reasons, others for bad, but none has ever faced criminal prosecution, even though many of them could have some definitely should. Continuing that precedent changes nothing. 

Furthermore, Trump is still facing legal consequences for illegal actions he has taken before, during, and after the presidency. This ruling does not even dismiss the charges that were brought against him. It simply instructs the lower court to consider whether those actions were official actions. 

**Just Because the President Declares Something Doesn't Mean It Gets Done**

I see people suggesting that Trump could use this to assassinate his rivals if he gets elected or Biden use this opportunity to abolish the Republican party. Many people are talking as if suddenly anything the president says has the full force of law. This has never been the case, and the recent ruling doesn't change things in the slightest. 

I'll reference a quote from President Truman about Eisenhower being the next president: ""He'll sit right here and he'll say do this, do that! And nothing will happen. Poor Ike—it won't be a bit like the Army.""

The president is the nominal head of a bureaucracy that often takes his instructions as suggestions and has a lot of ways to avoid doing anything they don't want to do. The president has no authority to have anyone arrested, has no authority to change the laws, and has no power to rewrite the constitution. He can barely even exercise the powers the constitution explicitly grants him if the bureaucracy pushes back. And SCOTUS routinely strikes down executive orders and other actions that it deems unconstitutional. Government officials are sworn to uphold the constitution, not obey the president. They don't always abide by that standard, but the oath and the expectation behind it give officials a lot of leeway in ignoring any unconstitutional order from the president, as well as consequences for obeying illegal orders. 

Yes, Biden could right now declare that Mr. Beast is an enemy of the state and order him to dress like a chicken. And Biden could do that without facing criminal charges. But I can make the same declaration and it'll have about the same force of law. He won't go to prison for that just as I probably wouldn't. But a lack of jail time in no way means that what the president says actually has the force of law. And even if it does, it still probably won't be carried out, especially if the people involved drag their feet. 

**Conclusion**

Before this ruling, many presidents broke the law, some were impeached, but none of them faced criminal charges. This ruling establishes that pattern as the norm. Before this ruling, presidents could order all kinds of things, but those orders were rarely carried out. This order does nothing to change that. Before this ruling, presidents routinely issued illegal executive orders. Both Trump and Biden have had all sorts of their orders struck down or amended for being unconstitutional. Neither of them faced criminal prosecution for that; the orders just achieved nothing. This decision doesn't change that.

Some people are overreacting to a piece of news that seems important. The media have an incentive to exaggerate things. And I suppose someone could argue this would embolden Trump to do bad things. But you could make the same argument about anything. Does anyone actually think you can stop Trump from coming up with bad ideas with a single court ruling? In the dumpster fire that is American politics, this SCOTUS decision isn't even in the top million most pressing issues going on.  "

Taking this action would see no benefits other than political gains for one point of view. To stop a partisan effort of expanding the Court, I believe there should be a Constitutional amendment capping the Court at a certain number to stop court packings. This would allow only a general consensus of the nation to change the Court's number (the number 9 has no real significance, as long as it takes an amendment to change the amount of justices, it just seems that continuing the current amount would work better than changing it).

2. By becoming part of the US, Taiwan will receive security guarantees not only from the US but also from its various treaty allies, including every country in the NATO alliance and neighboring countries like the Philippines and Japan. These guarantees will not only enhance Taiwan's security but also the democratic alliance in the region against rising authoritarianism.
3. The annexation would effectively nix China's dream of waging any military operations (at least in the short-term) against the democratic, self-governed island due to the US military's might compared to China's, and thus would drastically diminish the chances of active warfare in East Asia anytime soon."

0,2024-07-03,CMV: Supreme Court Decisions Should Require Public Approval for Every Decision,u/Prescient-Visions,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1du6hif/cmv_supreme_court_decisions_should_require_public/,changemyview,"The Supreme Court holds significant power in shaping American society through its rulings on crucial issues. However, this concentration of power in the hands of nine unelected justices raises grave concerns about democratic legitimacy. To address this, every Supreme Court decision should be subject to approval or rejection through a national referendum every year. All of their decisions are placed on a ballot and decided on by We The People, to truly reflect the General Will of the People.

SCOTUS decisions lately have been eroding the bedrock of our society, and concentrating power into the courts with no recourse to their actions. Unelected, unaccountable officials being the final arbiter is antithetical to the principles laid out in the constitution. It is unsettling that the reality is the constitution means whatever the hell courts say it means, with no input from the public in the matter, only corporate and ideological influence.

If someone can give me a better argument on why we should maintain the status quo, I’m all ears. The issue is not merely academic but strikes at the heart of what it means to live in a democracy. How can a small group of individuals hold such significant sway over the interpretation of laws that impact every aspect of our lives without direct accountability to the people they serve? The notion of judicial review, while intended to act as a safeguard against tyranny, seems to have morphed into an unchecked power wielded by the Supreme Court.

Consider the ramifications of landmark decisions that have reshaped the social, economic, and political landscape of the United States. From rulings on civil rights, abortion, healthcare, and corporate influence in politics, the Supreme Court’s decisions have profound and far-reaching impacts. Yet, these decisions often reflect the ideologies of the justices rather than the will of the people. This disconnect poses a serious threat to the democratic principles upon which the nation was founded.

A system of national referenda on Supreme Court decisions would enhance democratic participation and ensure that the judiciary remains in tune with the evolving values and preferences of society. Critics may argue that the general populace lacks the expertise to make informed decisions on complex legal matters. However, this perspective underestimates the capacity of citizens to engage with and understand issues that affect their lives. Moreover, the referendum process would not eliminate the role of expert analysis and debate but would complement it by incorporating the voice of the people.

The referendum system could be structured to ensure that only decisions of significant public interest are subjected to a vote. Additionally, measures could be put in place to facilitate informed decision-making, such as providing voters with comprehensive, balanced information on the issues at stake and the implications of various rulings. This approach would foster a more engaged and informed citizenry, ultimately strengthening the democratic fabric of the nation.

Furthermore, the current system’s reliance on lifetime appointments exacerbates the problem of accountability. Justices serve long after the presidents who appointed them have left office, often rendering their judicial philosophies out of step with contemporary societal norms. Introducing periodic referenda on their decisions would inject a much-needed element of temporal relevance and responsiveness into the judicial process.

Some may argue that the independence of the judiciary is paramount and that subjecting its decisions to popular vote would undermine this principle. However, independence does not equate to unaccountability. A balance must be struck between judicial independence and democratic oversight to prevent the judiciary from becoming a de facto oligarchy. By allowing the public to affirm or reject Supreme Court decisions, we would not be compromising judicial independence but ensuring that it operates within the framework of democratic legitimacy.

The current system of Supreme Court decision-making, characterized by its insulation from public accountability, represents a significant challenge to democratic principles. Instituting a national referendum on major Supreme Court decisions would address this issue by empowering citizens to have a direct say in the interpretation of laws that govern their lives. This reform would enhance the democratic legitimacy of the judiciary, foster greater civic engagement, and ensure that the Supreme Court remains responsive to the evolving values of society. The time has come to reexamine and reform the relationship between the judiciary and the people to preserve the integrity of our democracy."

20,2024-07-03,"CMV: Majority of ""Protect the Children"" People Are Either Manipulative or Sheltered",u/AngelicusBGH,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1du7l3r/cmv_majority_of_protect_the_children_people_are/,changemyview,"Background: frequently, in discussions pertaining to suffering, be that in news, movies, or any of the circumstances in life in which suffering occurs, someone will express the opinion that the suffering of children is inherently worse than the suffering of adults: ""At least no children were hurt,"" or ""What kind of scumbag does that to a kid?"", or ""I just worry about the children,"" or ""There is a special place in hell for child molesters.""

It's taken for granted by a lot of modern westerners, many of whom I view as uneducated and low-class, that violence against children is worse than violence against adults — orders of magnitude worse. I contend that, due to the arbitrariness of this opinion, those who hold it as true either inherently lack morality, are virtue signaling; or are sheltered, ignorant of the profound nature of the suffering experienced by adults and those who have lost adult-aged friends, parents, sons, daughters, etc.

I will explain those comments about class and education. First, some reasons why it is arbitrary to place such importance on the wellbeing of children over adults, split into classes:

**A. Biologically**  
1. In the not-too-distant past, child mortality was drastically higher than it is now. It was expected that most children would not survive childhood. Naturally, we have developed coping mechanisms to deal with the loss of young children that may not be preserved for adult children, in whom we will have invested infinitely more resources and care. These coping mechanisms make the death of young children easier to accept, implying that human beings naturally are not meant to grieve as heavily for the loss of the very young as we are for children of an intermediate age.

2. The intermediate age. Those who have survived infancy and are now capable of reproducing are more valuable than children who have a very good chance of dying. Young people, especially women, who have entered the reproductive stage of their lives can produce many children.

**B. Aesthetically**  
The aesthetics of suffering matter. Although it may be shallow, this is human nature. The reaction to a beautiful young woman being harmed will always be stronger and more negative than the reaction to an ugly man being harmed. While the man may or may not elicit more sympathy, the negative emotion experienced in witnessing the harm inflicted against the woman will always be stronger and less tolerable.

Children lack characteristics that would elicit the same oppressively negative emotional reaction. Although they are cuter and more innocent than a young woman, we do not feel sexual attraction for them, nor can we fall in love with them, nor can we feel *limerance* (lovesickness) for them. While the suffering of children is less tolerable than that of men, it is, arguably, less tolerable than the suffering of attractive young women, which can produce a profound love that is at once painful and obsessive.

This will be the most contentious reason. However, I implore anyone who specifically challenges it to engage in at least a modicum of introspection. Do you truly feel that the death of an ugly man is as odious as the death of a beautiful woman, no more and no less? I implore you also to read testimony from the grieving friends and family of those who have lost attractive young women: [https://www.carlystrong.net/post/grieving-back-to-college-season](https://www.carlystrong.net/post/grieving-back-to-college-season) . It is uniquely painful to lose an attractive, adult-aged daughter. While the pain of losing a child can't be quantified, we can put peer pressure and social niceties aside and look inside ourselves for the truth regarding our emotions.

**C. Psychologically**  
1. Adults are more able to understand pain than children are, particularly psychological pain. Children do not fret over their own mortality. If a young man and a boy are both trapped in a burning building, only the former will agonize over whether or not there is an afterlife. Only the former will consider the grotesque possibility of his body being burnt beyond recognition, of his mother wailing at his closed-casket funeral. For the boy, the smoke and heat will be of primary significance, and death itself will factor further down on his list of concerns, and, even then, in a much vaguer, less disturbing way. Young children still believe in Santa Claus, and most children believe in some form of afterlife, something adults struggle to maintain. For any given dire situation an adult and child are placed in, the adult will have a more developed pain response and will experience the situation more negatively. This is as much due to brain development as it is due to a lifetime of experience. During a kidnapping, a young woman will understand that she is being raped and tortured for the fleeting sexual gratification of a maniac, that her body may never be found, whereas a girl will experience the kidnapping moment-to-moment.

2. Adults have more immediately realizable potential. A child is barely closer to achieving great things than is a sperm. This relates to the aesthetic of suffering: a young woman who has just graduated high school has hopes, dreams, and has associated with her life a certain excitement and maturity. She expects, as do her friends and family for her, to experience and achieve certain things that, when left undone due to an early death, cause more psychological pain to us than the circumstances surrounding a child's death, which may be more characterized by things like unicorns, action figures, cartoons, or even dirty diapers. It must be one of the worst feelings to lie dying on a hospital bed as a young adult, when one would be fully cognizant of how unfair such a thing is and what great potential has so tragically been cut short of realization. If you are one of the ""ignorant"" people I referred to in the opening paragraphs of this post, the analogy of the board games Monopoly and Trouble may help you understand: it is more frustrating to be set back when one is near victory than to be set back early on, before one has accomplished very much.

3. Adults have more developed social connections than do children. There is more to say about adults, as they leave stronger impressions on people.

4. Adults have preferences, quirks, flaws, knowledge, humor, beauty, etc. that children have not yet developed, things which serve to make people interesting and personable. Few could earnestly claim that they would prefer to be friends with an eight year-old than a twenty or fourty year-old. That claim can only be made with ironic misanthropy.

**D. Culturally**  
All of the best art, stories, accomplishments, all of the most important jobs, scientific contributions, etc. are not held and have not been made by children. Most children will grow into adults who contribute nothing to the world. It would be odious to sacrifice those who have achieved something and have so much left to give, such as our brilliant scientists and artists, so that a child may live.

Personally, it is more important to me that my favorite musician continues to live and produce music than that some random starving African boy I have never met receives food. If I were forced to choose between killing that musician and killing that child with the press of a button, it would not be difficult for me to press the button that kills the child. That's a brutally honest statement that I recognize will evoke responses of outrage and disgust. However, there are hundreds of millions of starving children in the world and only a handful of great artists. Killing one million artists to spare the lives of one million shitty kids would only serve to make the world more dull and boring.

**E. Logically**  
Why is it worse for children to suffer than adults to? A logical reason is seldom provided in answer. Those who dare question that apparently unquestionable maxim of morality are instead met with blind hostility. Answers are sometimes provided, though. Let's analyze some of them.

1. Children's innocence  
Innocence is not, in and of itself, a positive characteristic. A fat, dorky virgin is more innocent than a sexy woman, yet few would value him more than her. Fetuses are more innocent than toddlers, yet few would, if forced to choose killing one, choose the toddler. Inanimate objects are innocent. Should we adore them for this? Those born without brains, i.e. those who have anencephaly, are incapable of not being innocent. This innocence characteristic must be considered in aggregate with others, not as a singular virtue superseding everything else.

2. Children's relative helplessness  
Short people, too, are relatively helpless. Do we therefore value them more? If you were forced to defend either a large child or a dwarf from a pack of rabid dogs, would you defend the dwarf, reasoning that the larger child could better defend himself? I see it claimed frequently that it's worse to strike a woman because women can not defend themselves. But is that actually why? I would argue that the reason we truly feel it's worse to strike women is because we see them as attractive. Weakness is unattractive, if anything, and provokes a different emotional reaction altogether, one of pity. We feel pity for ugly people being bullied. We feel pity for a little old man being shoved to the ground and robbed. However, we feel disgust and outrage when a big man beats on an attractive, small woman. Those who merely feel pity in response to that, in my opinion, are defective in some way.

3. Children are the future  
This would be a strong reason if not for the counter-reasons discussed in class A (Biological reasons). Young, fertile adults are also the future. They are also respectable and personable, for reasons discussed in classes B through D.

4. Children are designed by nature to make us want to protect them  
That is to say, they have neotenic features. However, so do women! In addition to features of beauty, women also retain childlike features and traits. Why is it that when a girl turns eighteen, then, the ""protect  the children"" people no longer express any concern for her wellbeing? My instincts tell me to care for her. My reaction to stories of women like her being harmed is gut-wrenching. Yet, I am told, if she were ten years younger, we should care for her more. What is this if not arbitrary?

**Deduction**  
Seeing as this opinion, that children's suffering deserves our utmost attention, is arbitrary, we must ask why the vast majority of people continue to ""think of the children."" Not think of the women and children, not think of the scientists, just the children.

I have deduced that, from the popularity of movies like *The Sound of Freedom* with certain members of the right wing, that it is mostly idiot slobs who place such a high premium on the life of very young people, or on the life of fetuses. Those who repeat that mantra of church ladies during the height of the Satanic Panic in the 1980s, ""think of the children!"", largely do not care about children and simply use such rhetoric as a cudgel to threaten and intimidate political opposition with smears like ""baby murderer."" Violence against children is used as a pretext for violence against political opponents, much the same way as is done in prison against child molesters. Remember that prisoners are murderers, drunk drivers who gleefully take the lives of innocent people, rapists of women, disfigurers, torturers... and yet these prisoners claim to have a soft spot for children. That is manipulation. The prisoners, as well as any other sociopaths who use children as a rhetorical device, are all too aware of the psychological impact that a big tough guy loving children has on the normie psyche. Even socially inept manipulators have caught on to gaming the system in this way. Toughness and kindness in equal measure are like crack to easily manipulable idiots. It's too easy for a sociopath to pride himself on wanting to protect little kids. You'll notice many of these people feel worse about dogs and cats dying than they do people. That's not a coincidence.

For those who genuinely think hurting children is the worst thing in the world (or a dog being tortured to death), it's quite apparent none of them have really considered how painful it must be for young adult women to be raped and tortured to death. To recognize your own beauty and that it's being degraded by the scum of the earth, that is worse than being a little boy and getting hit by a car because you ran out into traffic. There simply isn't a comparison.  
  
There are levels to evil, levels to suffering, and the death of toddlers, infants, and young children is no worse than the tragically-timed death of young adults, or the culturally-relevant deaths of the people who keep our civilization running. There is something ""off"" about anyone who disagrees. Most of the time, this thing is simply lack of exposure and introspection, conformity to a fault, but, some of the time, this thing is sociopathy disguising itself as sympathy, using cliches as weapons."

0,2024-07-03,CMV: There is no good faith reason to oppose manditory paternity testing before the birth certificate is signed,u/7in7turtles,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1du8b67/cmv_there_is_no_good_faith_reason_to_oppose/,changemyview,"Honestly, I'm not a red pill incel, or one of these Andrew Tate/Jordan Peterson fans. I tend to find them being often overly mysogynistic and far too reactionary, and vindictive. But I have had a friend recently encounter this, and it tore his life apart. 

That being said, the idea that when a baby is borning, that the hospital perform a quick and painless paternity test for the peace of mind for the father. These tests are not expensive, generally reliable, unintrusive, and easy to perform.

Since the father will be responsible for that kid throughout it's life, it seems only fair to provide a small confirmation that the father is the father. Hell, the hospital can do the test and only alert the family if there is a discrepancy in order to not ruin the moment, however, I don't find any of the arguments against this to be in good faith. 

My understanding of the arguments against this are: 

1. It is an insult to the mother. 
2. It would unduly burden the tax payers who would be forced to cover the welfare payments for cases where women unexpectedly become single mothers. 

In the first case, I think this tends to be because when a paternity test is not compulsory upon birth, the test itself is considered an accusation that the mother has been unfaithful. 

In the second, this is NOT a fair burdan to put on the man, if that man is not the actual father of the child. If the State is losing money, then it should come after the perpetrator of such fraud, or the actual biological father of the child. 

Paternity fraud seems to be one of very few crimes where, when it happens, the victim could still be forced to take responsibility for the crime. 

What am I missing here? It seems like this would eliminate the issue of ""trust"" and virtually eliminate cases of false paternity. 

Can someone either explain to me what I'm missing? Or give me a good faith argument as to why this should not be done?

I think there are limits obviously. I don’t think president Biden should kill trump with a drone strike in the immediate future. Although he would be legally allowed to kill president elect Trump as a part of his official duties and should do so in a worst case scenario.

Democrats should not seek to fight dirtier than Republicans, but they need to actually fight instead of rolling over and letting republicans get everything they want.

I myself am an omnisexual guy open to exploring femininity. Questioning my gender identity. I'm also autistic, have muscular dystrophy and possibly some undiagnosed conditions. I'm an artist. So there's a lot that makes me want to or perhaps even have to be aware and open to various perspectives. (while they also make me struggle to do so)

Despite that I always seem to have these harsh views. Part of me sees the personal identity side. Even if I'm not aware of many effects one's own gender identity has on attraction. I suppose in exploring femininity I've come to appreciate it more and that may play a part in my attraction. 

I also see a movement side to it. Where people are stubborn in keeping labels merely because of the progress they've comtributed. I personally would never want to stick to a label because of such purpose. I'd want to overcome it and ask myself if it's the label I truly want within myself.

Convince me that beyond personal identity and history.. there is meaning to the definition of lesbian. "

In the past week I have seen an alarming amount of very defeatist content online. I have also heard a concerning amount of defeatism from my friends.

I have seen a lot of people talking about moving out of the country in December, talking about leaving immediately, and some even talking about suicide.

I know it seems really bad right now but this isn't the time to give up. This isn't the time to say boo hoo we lost a court case, this is the end and we should all get the fuck out.

It's not time to abandon ship yet, everyone should take a deep breath and think. While the prospect of Project 2025 and the idea of another Trump presidency are scary, they aren't unstoppable.

There are hundreds of thousands of men and women who have sworn to protect the Constitution of the United States of America, and we must have faith. Trusted agencies and government organizations must have the faith of the population if they are going to make a stand against whatever is ahead.

All is not lost. We are not defenseless. Don't give up the ship.

People who like so-called hard sci-fi argue that they prefer plots based around an extrapolation of current knowledge about physics and our understandings of how the universe works with a particular focus on science, engineering and technology.
The reason I would argue it’s not a category as such, but just an aesthetic preference is because in most of the stories, scientists have invented faster than light travel, which, according to the current laws of physics is impossible, light is the fastest thing in the universe, and we can’t go faster than it.
The reason they do this is simple, humanity would never be able to meet alien species in a reasonable timeframe otherwise given the vast distances involved but it is at the end of the day just as much magic as talking elves and dwarves, a nd much less plausible than what’s found in so-called soft science-fiction ."
0,2024-07-03,CMV: Kamala can win the Presidency but she would need a really strong VP pick to do it.,u/Deadmau007,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duedrc/cmv_kamala_can_win_the_presidency_but_she_would/,changemyview,"So lately there has been alot of talk about replacing Joe Biden at the top of the ticket and as Biden's VP Kamala often comes up as an alternative. However, many have concerns about her popularity with the electorate which is about comprable to Biden's whose approval rating is historically low. 

I believe Kamala could still win the Presidential race but would need a very strong VP candidate to balance her ticket and I don't mean a popular governor like Josh Shapiro or Gretchen Whitmer. I think this would need to be someone who is already a national figure in their own right, who would appeal to the independents and moderates that are going to be least excited to cast a vote for a Harris ticket. Al Gore or Mark Cuban are two example candidates that come to mind here.

I think this for two reasons. 
1) Switching candidates now means there is not as much time to introduce new candidates to the electorate so existing name recognition would be a huge asset here.
2) A famous VP selection would dominate news coverage in a way that could be very beneificial to the start of a campaign. Choosing a typical Democrat would not be nearly as newsworthy and give Republicans more of chance to define the Democratic ticket on their own terms.

I could have my view changed to either that Kamala could win regardless of her VP choice, or that Kamala has no chance regardless of who she chooses as VP. Either way I'm open to having my mind changed and am curious about how others are thinking about this."
0,2024-07-03,CMV: I don't think there is a hard problem of consciousness,u/Faust_8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duek8l/cmv_i_dont_think_there_is_a_hard_problem_of/,changemyview,"From the wiki of what the hard problem of consciousness is:

> In the philosophy of mind, the hard problem of consciousness is to explain why and how humans and other organisms have qualia, phenomenal consciousness, or subjective experience.[1][2] It is contrasted with the ""easy problems"" of explaining why and how physical systems give a (healthy) human being the ability to discriminate, to integrate information, and to perform behavioral functions such as watching, listening, speaking (including generating an utterance that appears to refer to personal behaviour or belief), and so forth.[1] The easy problems are amenable to functional explanation—that is, explanations that are mechanistic or behavioral—since each physical system can be explained (at least in principle) purely by reference to the ""structure and dynamics"" that underpin the phenomenon.[1][3]

My view is that the people who argue that this hard problem exists, or that consciousness can't arise from physical matter, are framing the question the wrong way. In part because of the language, in part because consciousness is an illusion, and in part because it's hard to understand.

**Language**

I think part of it is simply having the term ""consciousness"" as some separate thing. We tend to think of it as our brains control our heart, our internal temperature, and all our other homoeostasis processes, and that's all entirely separate from this elevated, special thing called consciousness.

Plus, many act as if consciousness is uniquely a human trait, and nothing else in the entire universe has anything they would describe as consciousness, which adds to the idea that it needs special explanations.

When, perhaps consciousness is simply what brains do. All brains, everywhere. Maybe what we call consciousness is just what happens whenever enough neurons group up and start firing. If we think of consciousness as just normal brain functioning, it stops being some mystical thing that needs more explanations than just the physical brain.

Also, even *bees* communicate information to each other, can learn things just by observing, and play with balls for the sheer fun of it, so I'm hard-pressed to think *only* humans possess what others would call consciousness. If even bees seem to have subjective experience, why then do we need explanations other than that's just what brains do?

**Illusion**

Your brain can separate into two major axes: sensory data and internal experience. Your brain is constantly receiving sense data from your senses--sights, smells, tactile sensations, the sense of up and down, etc--while simultaneously processing thoughts and emotions.

Your brain HAS to put an absolute, sharp divide between these two things. After all, when that divide breaks down, that's when you get stuff like ""hallucinations"" and ""shizophrenia."" If you're confusing thoughts with data from the outside world--hearing things that aren't there, seeing things that aren't there--it's very bad for you.

Your brain does this out of necessity. However, a byproduct of this is that it creates this divide between ""out there"" and ""in here,"" or in other words, ""me"" and ""everything else.""

When really, it's all one thing, isn't it? The universe is everything, including inside your skull. There is no divide, it's all atoms and physical forces everywhere, it just *feels* like there's a divide, but that's just to keep you sane. If that 'realm behind your eyes' didn't feel separate then you'd be imagining things that aren't there, which is not good for survival. But it is an illusion, not a fact.

**Argument from Incredulity**

The Argument from Incredulity is a logical fallacy, it basically amounts to ""I don't understand how this works, so therefore [insert preferred explanation here].""

I think a lot of the Hard Problem of Consciousness is just that; since we don't know exactly everything about how brains work, they just assume that it's unexplainable, or non-physical, or mystical, or whatever. But just because we don't know absolutely everything doesn't mean we get to inject whatever explanation seems to make sense, nor can we say it's unexplainable.

Just look at how often that's failed us. We didn't know how energy could go through a vacuum, so we came up with the Luminiferous Aether to explain it, then much later we learned that was wrong because radiation *can* travel through the vacuum of space. Oh, and surely Phlogiston is the reason for combustion! Oh wait...that was wrong too.

And Zeus isn't the reason for thunderbolts either.

I can understand that it's vexing to wonder how these neurons added up equal consciousness, but is it all that much different from a single copper atom being unable to conduct electricity, yet get a lot of them together and they can?

We're no stranger to emergent properties. No atom is alive, yet...we're made of atoms, and we're alive. How could it be that I could pluck a single carbon atom from your elbow and find a totally dead atom, yet it was once part of you?

Simple, some things are more than the sum of their parts. Aggregates often have properties than individual units do not. Is it that wild to think that a bunch of neurons together can produce things that we don't fully grasp?

So in conclusion, I don't think there is a Hard Problem of Consciousness simply because people frame the question in the wrong way, often because of the Argument from Incredulity, a term that obfuscates the reality of the situation, and because the brain itself creates an illusion so that it doesn't confuse the outside world with itself."

The thing with calling gender a social construct is that it directly denies the vast impact biology itself has on the person. E.g. Women were primarily caretakers because they are built that way biologically, and men were providers because they are biologically structured that way.

Masculinity and Femininity are derived from estrogen and testosterone and obviously, these are the female and male sex hormones. Now, the problem with ""identifying"" as the gender not correlated with your sex (E.g. identifying as a woman when you are biologically a man) is that you can't define what you are identifying as with using the word you are identifying as. E.g. If you're a male claiming to be a woman, you can't define what a woman is without using woman. 

A common defintion that I hear people use for ""woman"" is someone who acts, thinks, looks like a woman. But obviously, you can't use the word you're trying to define, to define the word (Correct defintion is adult human female). Then this raises the famous question: What is a woman? What are you becoming? If you're a male with a dick claiming to be a woman, you're delusional.

If you're feminine as a man (Likes wearing mini-skirts, wearing lipstick etc.), you're just a feminine man. You are NOT a woman. And if you're a masculine woman, you aren't a man. Just a masculine men.

  
This whole insanity becomes more comical when you realize there are genders like ""gender-fluid"", ""Gender-neutral"". ""A-gender"" etc. which is all bullshit and make no sense. If you love to dress in mini-skirts as a man, then you aren't a woman. And this comicality is taken to the next level when pronouns are involved.

  
TLDR: Sex and gender are the same. If you are feminine as a male, then you are a feminine man not a woman. Vice versa etc.

To support this already stretched-as-hell argument, they point out that the vast majority of insurrectionists never did anything truly insurrection-worthy once they made it into the Capitol, but most of them just walked around aimlessly. One guy from Arkansas propped his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk. So on and so forth. But nothing even remotely resembling an ""insurrection."" 

But here's the thing: That doesn't actually matter what they physically did. What matters is that those people were INTENDING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT by stopping the certification of the election in favor of Biden and forcing Congress to certify the election in favor of Trump!

Sure, they may not have moved and acted with military-like discipline and cohesion. They may not have carried assault rifles and hid behind cover like actual soldiers. But all that proves is that the insurrectionists (and yes, I will call them insurrectionists) were *incompetent* at what they were trying to do. But that still doesn't detract from the fact that the vast majority of them were, indeed, trying to overthrow the government. They may have been as incompetent as the Wet Bandits, but I think we can all agree that the Wet Bandits' bumblingness didn't make them any less guilty of their crimes when they ultimately got caught at the end of the movie. 

Whereas apologists look at the footage of insurrectionists wandering aimlessly around the lobby like tourists and see them just being a wee bit disorderly, what I see is them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to find something to do in furtherance of their goals. They were likely all thinking to themselves ""ok ... I'm inside the Capitol, so ... umm ... what do I do now?!"" Their end goal was still the overthrow of the government; they just didn't have a solid plan on how to make that happen. Again, that doesn't make them ""not insurrectionists."" That just makes them bumbling idiots. Big difference. 

Then, we have Trump himself. Yes, I'm aware the Supreme Court just declared he's above the law. But as far as my vote this November is concerned, I don't give a shit. The man stood back and allowed the rioters to do their thing for HOURS before finally enough pressure was put on him to send in the troops to stop it. 

And yes, I'm aware that he was never indicted for that part. No immunity necessary, he just never technically committed a crime when he failed to send in the troops immediately. DeShaney v. Winnebago County clearly says that ""failure to enforce"" isn't a crime in and of itself. 

But again, as far as my vote this November is concerned, I'd like you to take one guess as to exactly how many fucks I give about that legal technicality. 

Trump insisted that it was Antifa, not his boys, who were actually the ones doing the right. First of all, I don't give a shit, and second, even if that were true, that only gives Trump LESS excuse, not more, for why he didn't send in the troops immediately. If they weren't his boys, then what was his incentive to let them do their thing?!

So no, Trump can 100% kiss my ass. Change my view!"

Michelle Obama (obviously) carries the Obama name, and Barack is still a relatively popular president, especially compared to either Trump or Biden. 

Betting site polymarket gives Michelle a 5% chance to be the Democratic nominee, and a 4% chance to win the presidency, meaning betting markets likewise believe that she likely won't be president only because she doesn't want to run, not because she couldn't win. Even Ben Shapiro has said she should run and is the democrats best chance to win. 

My cmv is as follows- if Michelle Obama decided to run, and Biden endorsed her, she would have very strong (probably around 80%) odds of winning, as per betting markets. You can add on that I believe that no one else has higher odds of winning than she does.

By bringing a child into existence, parents are imposing this inevitable suffering on a being who did not consent to it. From this perspective, since murder is seen as a severe harm imposed on another, creating life could be viewed similarly because it imposes a lifetime of potential suffering and harm. Life carries inherent risks, including disease, injury, emotional distress, and death. By giving birth, parents are subjecting their child to these risks. From a certain antinatalist perspective, exposing someone to the risk of severe harm without their consent could be seen as morally equivalent to an act like murder, which definitively imposes harm. Philosophers like David Benatar argue that non-existence is preferable to existence because non-existence avoids all suffering. In his asymmetry argument, he suggests that while not existing avoids all bad things without missing out on any good things, coming into existence means experiencing both good and bad, where the bad may outweigh the good."

1- men make up half of the world, give or take, therefore I think that any significant change is impossible if you don't bring said half of the world into it; pragmatically speaking men also hold the great majority of power in our current society and, since they are also half of our world, it's impossible to make a popular revolution communism style. 

2- men also suffer from the pathriarcy and don't really benefit from it (parenthesis: I recognize that in the majority of our world men are still better off then women, but in the western world I don't think so, I think that we're both suffering equally): 

People care too much about what women do while People care too little about what men do, that's why I think that many young boys go towards tate and the likes of him, they try to look for guidance and answers and the modern left isn't ready enough to embrace them before they get caught in the sigma bullshit. 

This last part will be kinda a ""rant"" not an argument: It feels important to say, I am a boy and I'm kinda struggling right now.

This opinion stems from my observations of both Black individuals who dismiss the necessity of white allies and white feminists who trivialize the need for allyship by claiming that Black issues should be solved solely within the Black community.

Here’s why I believe this:

	1.	Historical and Systemic Barriers: The legacy of slavery, segregation, inadequate education, gentrification, the prison-industrial complex, and the impact of the 14th Amendment have collectively restricted the societal power of Black Americans. These barriers have created a systemic imbalance that is difficult to overcome without external support.
	2.	Population Dynamics: Black Americans constitute about 13% of the U.S. population, whereas white Americans make up about 60%. Given this demographic reality, it is challenging for Black Americans alone to effect widespread change without engaging the larger white population.
	3.	White Feminist Perspective: Many white feminists assert that Black issues are solely the responsibility of Black people to resolve. This view likely stems from their own historical context, where achieving women’s rights primarily required mobilizing women. However, this analogy fails to consider the unique challenges faced by Black Americans, who must navigate not only racial but also systemic oppression.
	4.	Activist Disparity: I specifically refer to feminists because they are activists who often advocate for equality and social justice. It is perplexing when their ideals seemingly align with the fight against racial inequality, yet they dismiss it as “not their problem.” This disconnect is particularly frustrating because one would expect solidarity from those who also fight against systemic oppression.
	5.	Power Dynamics: White Americans, particularly white women as a protected class, hold significant societal power. There are no specific legislative barriers that hold them back, unlike the systemic hurdles faced by Black Americans. This power disparity necessitates allyship to dismantle the structures that perpetuate inequality.

In essence, the idea that Black Americans should only rely on their own community to bring about change overlooks the profound and pervasive systemic obstacles in place. The need for white allies is not a sign of weakness or dependence but a pragmatic approach to achieving equality and justice.

I am open to hearing different perspectives and would appreciate a constructive dialogue on this topic."

This is what I've learned & this applies to 90% of the content.

How does content go viral? What you should do?
The answer, be entertaining...
How to be entertaining? 
Be unpredictable...

Get a boring day. Why is it boring?
Because you know what's gonna happen next.
That's predictable.
Get an exciting day. Why is it exciting?
Because you didn't know what was gonna happen next.
That's unpredictable.

Unpredictability comes with curiosity.
Curiosity comes with certain emotions.
When you enjoy a viral tiktok what do you think?
What's gonna happen at the end?/ next?
That next moment: ending has an emotion.
It would be surprised, happy, sad, scary, etc.

So then how do creators struggle?
(who wanna be large)
- they forget SM is a part of the entertainment field. Sm is among movies, songs, sports, etc...

There's more when it comes to scripting. Unpredictability is the second important thing. That isn't the only factor. The main thing is the info & the value you provide. There's other stuff like branding which is a whole other topic.
(things above work as long as visibility or not there's a person explaining something)

This is what Viral content has rather than saying how to go viral.

The government is doing this because the foreign workers do not mind making so little so the government creates artificial wage decreases in Canada to supplement huge corporations like Tim Hortons and Loblaws (who have also increased their prices exponentially) they also own majority of the grocers so buying a handful of food costs somewhere around $60 or more.

If Canadians straight up pillaged these corporations not only would police be unable to arrest every person but change would likely occur as this would put those who are living lavishly off the backs of Canadians and forcing people into poverty to be worried about their money.

It doesn’t even have to be violent it can be people straight up occupying entire parking lots. And preventing others from paying by not letting people in.

Sure it’s trespassing but trespassing is far more ethical in my point of view when the government has decided to sell Canada to corporations and causing more people suffering.

This movement is now forcing children to think and learn about sex at an age where they shouldn’t even know what sex is. There are books in kindergarten classes that including drawings of male genitals, and showing how to preform gay sex. That is disgusting, it’s pedophilia. We allow children to get life altering surgeries and puberty blockers. It is no longer about being accepted if someone is gay or trans or whatever, it is about indoctrinating the youth. They are shoving it down our throats (pun intended). No one cares anymore if you’re gay, if you have a penis or vagina, stop forcing our children to think about this.

I've always loved game shows. My whole childhood whenever I was home from school I spent every morning watching *Let's Make A Deal* followed by *The Price is Right*. *Jeopardy* remains a part of my nightly routine as well. Yet one of the worst parts about watching game shows is knowing in the back of your mind that they didn't really get to keep all the money they won on the show. A hefty percentage of their winnings will be taxed. This isn't as much of an issue when it comes to cash, but what really gives me a hard time is when a prize is won. When that happens, contestants have to pay taxes on that prize out of pocket, as opposed to cash winnings where it just cuts into your prize. I've heard many stories of game show contestants who had to either sell or even outright refuse their prizes because they couldn't afford the taxes on them. I believe that if you win the lottery or a game show, the stated prize should be the actual prize, no strings attached.

This is all caused by corporations getting the Government to do this to essentially cause artificial wage decreases as these individuals are willing to work lower paying jobs to have a chance at a better life and this causes housing demand to increase putting Canadians in poverty.

I’m suggesting everyone blocks entry and protests in front of each of these corporations to cause them to have real stress in their revenue.

0,2024-07-03,CMV: The Democrats should run Newsom as President and Biden as VP in the upcoming 2024 election.,u/SundaeRealistic3874,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dukkqd/cmv_the_democrats_should_run_newsom_as_president/,changemyview,"As an independent leaning democrat, I think that a Democratic victory in 2024 is essential to preventing the backsliding of democracy, Project 2025 (and its threats to checks and balances), destruction of the supreme court, and more. So the reasons I have for running Newsom over Biden as President are justifications for why he's more likely to win in 2024.

**First is his charisma.**

In a presidential election, charisma and ability to speak are VERY important. Like much more important than facts, which is why Biden's declining capabilites+cold+stutter made him appear so much worse than Trump in their debate. Public perception is more dependent on a president's ability to speak rather than their legislative accomplishments, and Biden is simply not functional as a speaker (especially for 4 more years). The Democratic party/Biden administration needs a convincing oratorr. Gavin Newsom is the perfect candidate - he[ absolutely destroyed Desantis in a debate a couple months ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKofOBmOTBQ) and can fill in where Biden is lacking.

**Second is his appeal.**

A main point of opposition amongst Dems against Biden is his position on Israel and Palestine, which is drawing a lot of his core voters away from him. You cannot, however, make that case against Newsom. He's (arguably) more progressive than a Biden, making him more appealing to young progressive voters who have lost faith in Biden.

[Even when you look at polls, post the debate, Trump's winning, Biden's ratings have gone down, and these voters seem to be switching going to RFK, who's rating has shot up in that same time.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) Newsom, with the backing of Biden, has both the legitimacy and progressiveness to draw votes from both RFK and Biden voters, which is the best possible scenario for a victory.

**Third is the 2028 election.**

If the Democrats do indeed run Biden in 2024, what happens in 2028 when Biden can no longer re-run, and you have Trump running against a Kamala Harris? That's a situation the Democratic party is unlikely to win. A sole Biden victory in 2024 is just pushing Project 2025 back a few years to the next election, one that Trump can easily win.

Contrarily, if Newsom runs in 2024, it is the perfect set up to a path to victory in 2028. Newsom can re-run for president with a new, promising vice president. That VP can be the presidential nominee for 2032, perfectly creating a road to viable Democrat victories in the future.

**The issue of the incumbent advantage.**

So now, the biggest issue against Newsom that he loses out on the incumbent advantage that Biden would otherwise benefit from. **After researching, it seems as if there are absolutely no restrictions on VP terms (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).** If there indeed are no restrictions on VP terms, running Newsom as President and Biden as VP is genuinely the best of both worlds. Biden can carry with him his incumbent advantage and successful policies of the Biden Administration, while Newsom can be a fresher, younger, stronger, and more appealing candidate for Democrats to rile up behind.

**What about Kamala Harris?**

People can argue that a Newsom/Biden run is stiffing Kamala Harris of her spot as president or vice president but A\] Kamala Harris and Newsom are both from California, making it illegal for both of them to run as President and VP anyways and B\] Kamala Harris just isnt a convincing candidate - it seems as if people either really hate her or are indifferent to her at best, whereas Newsom is a more convincing candidate.

**TLDR: Newsom can appeal to both the RFK and Biden voter base, is a much more skilled orator, and him running with Biden as VP can win over the incumbent advantage factor, and this is the safest path to a democratic victory in 2024 and beyond.**"

Everyone gets a set amount of money each month from the government. 

Not a massive amount. Just enough for people to be able to be fed and sheltered. 

I suppose it would be best to work it out differently for people based on their living situation.

So a single person living alone would get more money than a person living with a partner, as it has to cover their rent. 

So just to throw numbers out for an example... maybe £/$500 each a month for the couple and £/$1000 for the single person. So the household income amounts to the same. 

There would of course be a few different scenarios of course, like if they have kids, how many kids they have etc. 

But the basic idea is that we make it so everyone can just about survive on the money they’re given. 

Most people would want more than the bare minimum. So they can go out and get a job and use the extra money they’re making to pay for life’s luxuries. 

This would also encourage people to take risks in starting a company, developing a new product for instance. So it should lead to innovation as people know if it all goes tits up, they won’t lose their house. 

And of course the money given out is going back into society either by spending on products or services, or by creating a company and then paying staff who will spend their money in society. 

It’s really on the very rich people who hoard money. For everyone else, money just goes round in circles, so it’s not a case of just giving money to people and it just being a big cost for the government, because that money keeps circulating.

People can talk ""freedom"". Freedom isn't unlimited. Freedom is within bounds. We accept that kids can't buy tobacco or booze. Some countries like the UK and Germany have high taxes on booze and tobacco, mainly since it's recognised that they're both dangerous. There still is the freedom to drink or smoke, but then they both recognise that it's not good for society overall.

The same can apply to fast food.

For any high-fat content foods that are sold and/or made quickly, add a 50% fast food tax on them.

People will say it will cost jobs. Would it? Most people who work in McDonald's or BK are low-skilled. They can readily find new jobs. I bet most in Europe and the US are either low-skilled migrants or natives. They can be taken up by warehousing, retail, etc.

The world is obese. Even in poor countries, obesity is an issue. So something needs to be done to correct this.

I believe it's prudent to limit people's ""freedom"" via high taxes on fast food. Tobacco and alcohol are good guides to examine in this case. [https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/cigarette-tax-europe-2023/](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/cigarette-tax-europe-2023/)

[https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl\_8/e011866](https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_8/e011866)

To be honest, fuck freedom. Yes, I believe in it. But again, it has limits. We already curb freedoms because of the social and individual costs. Saying ""it's MUH FREEDOM!!"" is not an argument here."

Dating is down, marriage is down, having kids is down. This is happening all over the world and there isn't any social or cultural way to stop it. This drop in relationships and all the things downstream from them has led to things like mass killings being perpetrated by incels that can't accept the new female future. 

I simply don't think there's a way that things like incels and the like can be solved socially. The reality is that any attempt to solve inceldom culturally without hurting women as a whole is a no-go because it IS a zero sum game here, but it can be solved scientifically. 

At the global level, all countries capable need to have fewer and fewer biological males every generation. Have a generational limit in place so that when a certain number of males are born, that's it for that generation.

First, fewer men would mean less incels overall because men would be worth more due to scarcity. Even a ratio of 70 men to every 100 women would make a huge difference globally. If there are less men, dating would be easier for them and they'd be happier as a result. Men may scream and shit themselves but if you told them they didn't have to work and could just be househusbands or players dating and impregnating all day they'd sign up immediately.

Women are becoming happier and happier being single, while the same isn't happening to men. Women, in fact, live much much much longer if they stay single so it's in their best interest to stay that way if they want to live to a ripe old age instead of dying from stress in their sixties from a life of regret from settling for some doughy balding loser because Alpha Andy wouldn't commit.

There are technologies that are coming about, such as CRISPR and other forms of gene editing that can allow for lord knows what. In China two children were born completely immune to HIV, and we haven't heard of any huge biological issues so it's a success! If you can change something as small as that you can change the sex of a potential pregnancy through gene editing as well. This could mean no mandatory abortion of bio male fetuses if the generational limit is reached.

Yes, if there are more women than men that means that inevitably there will be fewer women getting into relationships and becoming ""femcels"" (I refuse to believe they're real. The concept of being a femcel is nothing more than a TikTok aesthetic fueled by Lana DelRay songs and some shitty play called Dirtbag).

Women, if they become femcels (they're not real bruh lmao), won't ever commit mass violence because they don't take it out on the world, instead they'll make being single a core part of their identity and accept being alone without any form of toxicity, which is much better socially.

On the political side, there are a few things that can be done to go alongside this. First, you can make poly marriages legal in places it's illegal. Poly relationships are rising in frequency anyway, so what's the problem? It would obviously go both ways, where one man could marry multiple women and one woman could marry multiple men or whatever.

Now I will go over one of the expected responses I'll get.

>The US/Canadian/EU/etc tax code just doesn't work for poly marriages!

Get enough eggheads in a room and they'll figure out how to make it work. If you got a large group of tax accountants, judges and divorce lawyers who deal with taxes and lock them in a hotel for a month they'll figure out how to get the tax codes to work for poly related divorces and the like.

>but it's muh eugenics!

Dating and relationships are also eugenics, but I don't see you complaining about that. You can't sway me with low effort emotional arguments. Demographic data shows whites are gonna go extinct by 2044 anyway so why would you care?

Change my view. I expect scientific responses with data to back up your claims. I will ignore any post I deem low effort."

401,2024-07-03,CMV: The idea that any and all government action is inherently a bad thing is toxic to political discourse and only enables authoritarianism,u/LineOfInquiry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duo62a/cmv_the_idea_that_any_and_all_government_action/,changemyview,"It’s commonly said in America that “government is the problem” and many people across the political spectrum believe any or almost any government action is bad or wrong by default. Politicians run on cutting regulations, without specifying which ones they’re talking about. They run cutting taxes, without specifying what tax rates they actually want. They run on states rights but don’t specify what rights they’re talking about.

This means that any sort of dialogue about these policies can easily be shut down. How are you supposed to have a discussion on if a particular regulation is helpful or not when you enter into it with the assumption that all regulations are bad? How do we have a discussion on how a federal state should be structured if the default response is that the federal government is always bad? We can’t, because there’s nothing to discuss, we’ve left the realm of practical politics so evidence doesn’t matter. I could provide you with all the evidence in the world that a law will save money, improve the lives of every citizen, and be a more efficient way of running things but that won’t change your mind if you think laws are inherently bad.

Furthermore, this rhetoric makes it easy for politicians to be corrupt because no one cares as long as regulations are being cut. Who cares that those regulations were only in industries the politicians buddies have companies in, or that a law was stopping bribery from happening, it’s cutting tape so it’s fine! And then when surprise surprise these policies make public services worse and the government more corrupt, the politician can turn around and blame the government in general rather than their own policies. Nothing is ever their fault and so nothing will ever be done to fix their mistakes. It also means that important bureaucracy meant to check government power can be cut as well under the guise of “removing red tape” but all that does is make the government more authoritarian with more power.

This sort of rhetoric also gives people the perception that the government as an institution is separate from them and has a will of its own when this is not the case. Governments do what the people running them want them to do, and in the US those people are elected by us. We decide how the government functions even in this corrupt age. The government is a tool, whether it’s helpful or harmful depends entirely on how those in power use it.

I’m totally fine with having a conversation about what powers should belong to the federal vs state governments or how directly democratic institutions should be or the role of the government in society. But our complex modern world cannot function without some amount of government action and pursuing some libertarian utopia that will never happen is silly and stops you from thinking critically about policy. No one thinks any and all government action is good because that would be stupid, and the opposite belief is just as silly yet millions believe it."

The debate was an old man trying to respond to blatant lies AND answer a question within the allotted time frame. When we look at the transcript -- its clear that Joe Biden won.

But the news media has stoked our fears (because its driving so many clicks, a democracy in peril has me heading to news sites more often now) and there are such an uptick in straight up hater comments that only drive one narrative: an alt right narrative. We're stuck in a swarm of negativity, as many are chronically online. This is disinformation and fear they're spreading -- all the talk about project 2025, outwardly and BOLDLY saying the quiet parts out loud are an intimidation tactic. They want us to cow, and be afraid. 

Joe Biden is an incumbent who beat another incumbent. That was already a rejection of Trumpism from the American people. They will do it again. Trump has not given a plan for the American people, he has only said the same things to whip up his base into a frenzy.

But it won't work.

It was published in the prestigious journal *The Lancet*. The study consisted of a dozen children, with only eight of them endorsing intestinal distress and developmental disorders. Wakefield used it to conclude it could have an effect on the pathology of ASD and questioned use of the combined MMR vaccine. What wasn't disclosed was the lack of informed consent by parents, the literal selection bias, Wakefield's recruitment by lawyers wanting to sue vaccine manufacturers, and Wakefield's profiteering off the research through a single vaccine patent he held and test kits for a fabricated disorder Wakefield claimed he discovered. 

All of this survived peer review, community scrutiny, and media sensationalism. It was not the medical-scientific community that led to Wakefield's demise, it was an investigative reporter who unveiled what did. As a result of the things I listed coming to light, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and barred from practicing medicine, and only *after* this did the Lancet retract his paper and repudiate him. Of course, The Lancet itself is not innocent either, as they criticized the medical panel that investigated Wakefield and proclaimed he followed proper peer review and medical ethics guidelines. 

Given the damage this scandal caused to public trust in vaccines, science, and the reputation of peer review as a gold standard, I feel Wakefield losing his medical license isn't enough. I think both Wakefield and The Lancet should be open to litigation for any and all harms standing can be established for. I also believe that The Lancet should be rejected by the research community as prestigious. No, The Lancet isn't the only old medical journal to be marred by articles that aged poorly. But fee of those caused the same level of damage this controversy did. 

Hell, Wakefield is still out there enjoying a modicum of public support. And The Lancet is still prestigious, despite the fact it stood behind the article until after Wakefield lost his ability to practice medicine. Neither party is innocent, and both deserve to be buried in bankruptcy. "

My view: voting for Joe Biden would already be voting for Kamala Harris, and Democrats should already be aware of that. 

There is no reason Harris would achieve a better response by running instead of Biden, because she's already running. If you are considering that Biden is unfit to be President, continuing to vote for him would mean Harris becomes President if your fears are proven true.

Therefore, the only reason to replace Joe Biden as the nominee would be to put someone other than Kamala Harris in the driver's seat."

Some choice are wrong, and some choices are right. Just because you have the right to choose, doesn’t make it the morally correct choice. Like free speech, we all have the right to it, but that doesn’t withstand you from being held accountable.

Relating to abortion, I sit on the fence. There is no black and white. In some cases I agree, and in some cases I don’t. It all depends on the context. I am not absolutist either way.

It seems to me that ‘my body, my choice’, is used as a way to justify a choice, and as a way to come across as whatever choice you choose, it is the correct one.

If my partner tells me that she is going to abort a baby we planned for, regardless of whether I agree or not, I have a choice. I can either talk to her calmly and control my emotions, come to an understanding and accept the fact that what she views as right, is not what I view as right, or I can lose my cool and cause some material damage. It is my body, my choice, and as long as my choice doesn’t affect her body, such as physically touching her when angry, I have the right to that choice. The problem is that although I have a choice, both choices are not the right thing to do.

I understand that what is right and what is wrong is subjective in a lot of cases, as I alluded to above, but “my body, my choice” seems to be used to project objective morality, that just because you have the choice, it makes every choice conceivable to you, morally good. It is your body, and you do have a choice, but that doesn’t make every choice the right one.

695,2024-07-03,CMV: Christianity’s decline in the west is largely owed to the fact that a vast amount of Christians are virtue signalers who use their “faith” to excuse being bad people.,u/Crushles,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duq261/cmv_christianitys_decline_in_the_west_is_largely/,changemyview,"I would like to start by saying that I know the title may seem incendiary, but I honestly couldn’t think of a better way to word my position.

I also think it’s important that I used the phrase “in the west” because Christianity is still growing in areas of the world such as Africa and Asia.

Also, I should preface this by saying that my argument cannot be proven by facts. Calling someone a bad person is obviously a matter of opinion, but I feel as though throughout my lifetime I have seen this phenomenon more and more. One fact I can point out is that Christianity is declining in the US, and i believe it is because of the people who falsely believe they are the “good Christians.” Don’t get me wrong, I 100% believe that anybody should be allowed to practice Christianity if they want to, and nobody is inherently bad just because they are a Christian. In fact, I would still say that if I all I knew about a person was that they were Christian, it would be my immediate assumption that they are a good person, as that is the kind of life the Bible teaches that one should lead. I also believe this transcends any one denomination, although what I’m discussing is definitely more common in more radical denominations such as Baptists.

I’ll be honest, this is an argument that is founded primarily on personal experience. But there are still plenty of examples of this occurring in the public eye. Conservative figures like Nick Fuentes and televangelists like Kenneth Copeland lead, in my opinion, extremely unchristian-like lives yet still use their faith as a shield in many cases. Also, a staggering number of churches have been exposed as being parts of human trafficking rings in the last 10 years. I don’t want to seem like I’m generalizing all christians; I am merely bringing up examples to show how this phenomena is a large contributor to the decline of public trust in Christianity. 

I know that sin is expected of humans, but it seems like some of the largest sinners want to let the whole world know they are Christians and hide behind their faith to excuse their bad actions more than the Christians who keep to themselves.

I’m sure many of you know people in your personal lives that fit into this criteria as well. I think that the growing number of Christians-in-name-only are, to their own obliviousness, causing the decline of Christianity. It makes people lose trust in the organization, because, like with many other discourse groups in America today, the loudest members tend to disproportionately represent the group as a whole. Actions speak louder than words, and just because a person gets up early on Sunday to sacrifice an hour or two out of their day does not by default make them more virtuous or moral than someone who doesn’t. I fear that this post is starting to sound more like a rant than a civil viewpoint, so I will leave it at this.

I see love as a universal bond that transcends gender. It's about deep connections and companionship, which I've always believed and found to have no inherent harm to anyone or society. Homosexuality represents a small minority, so just as we didn't run out of straight people when the Library of Alexandria was burning, we're not running out now.

However, my concerns lie with the physical aspects of homosexual relationships, and while I acknowledge that some of these practices aren't exclusive to gay individuals, it's still hypocritical to ignore them. Whatever reaction, i am okay with everything anyway, though i do wish to just understand 

Consider heterosexual intercourse – have you ever argued that there's something unnatural about it or found inherent defects that occur, which perhaps I haven't discovered due to my ignorance? It's based on anatomical compatibility, with natural vaginal lubrication facilitating penetration without additional external products. In contrast, gay sex encompasses practices like frottage, mutual masturbation, oral sex, and anal intercourse. Since life isn't like what you see in adult films, I'd prefer a logical consideration.

Mutual masturbation and frottage, for instance, may reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections but can entail uncomfortable cleanup post-activity. Unlike heterosexual or lesbian intercourse, where bodily fluids are managed differently, semen just stays there drying on the skin, and the remnants harden, which can be annoying and uncomfortable. Of course, one could easily argue, tell me to relax, get outside, and suggest that these fluids only need water to be managed. But wouldn't you think that if it were natural, they wouldn't need any external assistance? The keyword here is 'need'. For example, lube can enhance vaginal sex, but I haven't found that it's necessary for it to occur. Anal sex, in particular, presents distinct anatomical differences and potential risks, despite efforts to mitigate discomfort through external lubrication

If you are a healthy weight, eat healthy, get exercise, don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t do drugs, don’t have unprotected sex with strangers, gets proper sleep, keeps vaccines up to date, etc, then you should pay less than someone who doesn’t do those things.

Why should healthy people subsidize the poor lifestyles of unhealthy people.

And before someone says so, no I don’t believe this apples to people with pre-existing conditions. If you have a pre-existing conditions through no fault of your own, that shouldn’t affect your ‘health score.’

#1: Why was Delbert Grady's ghost portrayed like a regular polite human butler? If you're going to portray a spirit, you have to set them apart from a regular human and make them appear "" other-worldly "". The bartender made some effort in this area by plastering a wide smile on his face and never blinking....but there was no such effect created by Delbert.

#2: Why was the bathroom (where Jack talks to Debert) designed like a target showroom? And why was it's decor and interior design so different from the rest of the hotel? What's the logic behind that? Some might say it's the illogicalness and disconnect that creates the horror............that's just a stretch. A filmaker (or artist) has to put some effort into inducing emotions out of the audience. You can't just splash colors on a canvas and call it "" art "" (I know a lot of people do, but it's not art and requires no skill or effort)

#3: The book describes Danny's visions very well. About how he sees things (which aren't there in the present moment, but might have been there some time long ago) and how the visions come and go with something as  simple as turning his head to look in different directions. 

The movie made no effort at all in representing that. It could have done that with clever camera work and smooth transitions, but it didn't. Like the hallway scene where Danny runs into the twins. The film shows the murder scenes and the scenes of the present without bothering to maintain the same camera angle or use any transition (light on/ light off) effects to transition between past and present........to show what it looks like from Danny's POV. It just shows an awkward collage of footage mixed in together. 

#4: There's no connection at all between Halloran and Danny. In the book, there's a Harry-Hagrid type relationship between these 2, but the producers made no attempt at showing how well these 2 characters got along. 

#5: Then there's the hotel's design itself. The book desribes it as some majestic historical building that has stood the test of time. But I didn't get any extravagent stateliness from the hotel they showed in the movie. It should have been a character of it's own. But it ended up being the background. "

I can’t speak for everyone, but I hold my friends to the same standards as myself. I would want someone else to be honest if I was lying to someone for my own self gratification, and so I would do the same for my friends. Ignoring the woman’s perspective, you would be doing your friend a favor. Your friend, presumably, deserves to live a life with someone they truly love, and if they would cheat on their partner, then that’s not the person for them. (Unless they’re polyamorous, different conversation)

Now let’s analyze it from the woman’s perspective. I’m going to lowball it and say that partners spend about 7 hours a week talking to their SO. (This includes texting, talking on the phone, going on a date, meeting up, etc.) Now let’s say that you refusing to snitch leads to them staying together for another 4 months before finding out (a reasonable assumption). Minimum wage is $8, so $8 times 7hr/week times 16 weeks is about $900 across those 4 months. So if you found out that your friend was robbing $900 from anyone, even a stranger, wouldn’t you want them to come clean? And this isn’t even considering the emotional distress and relationship trauma that his partner will get from this. It’s just simply, $8 is the bare minimum that your time is worth and your friend is wasting that much of someone’s time.

Additionally, if your friend sacrifices the time and happiness of someone he supposedly loves for his own pleasure, then what’s stopping him from doing the same to you? Honesty is the best policy except in a few cases where lying may be justified. But cheating’s only justification is to feel at most 30 minutes of gratification while dragging someone along when you could simply break up and then feel the 30 minutes of gratification.

If I ever were to cheat, I would want my friends to have the slightest amount of empathy to tell my girlfriend the truth. And there’s nothing wrong with me treating my friends how I would want to be treated."

Biden right now likely loses to Trump if the election were held tomorrow, but we have every reason to believe a Last Minute Democrat [loses to Trump, as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz1TDJ36Uoc) -- and loses even worse.

Biden, despite is marked vulnerabilities, has numerous factors in his favor over other Democrats.

- Name recognition.

- Having defeated Trump before.

- An even more unpopular Vice President that nobody likes and is an ill suit to a path to victory in the MidWest. Anybody that thinks Kamala Harris could hold Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - the Blue Wall - is not living in Reality. She will lose to Trump. She will lose 35 - 40 states.

- A Last Minute Democrat starts off with a disadvantage of time, fundraising, campaigning, spreading spotlight, and developing a following.

- American Democratic voters may [say they think Biden should drop out](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html), but this sentiment is not complimented by support gravitating towards another candidate....It's just...Not.

**What Democrats should be doing** is focusing on the Messaging War and paint a clear picture of what the alternative presents. They should be telling their base ---- ""Listen...He's old and needs help. But this is a team effort, and you can be sure the President has trusted advisors that assist him in running the country. We've achieved a lot in the last 3 and a half years and there's more work to do. Trump back in office will appoint unqualified, dangerous ideologues and we will lose the Supreme Court for 100 years if he does.""

This may all be for naught, anyway. Like I said - Biden likely loses to Trump tomorrow. But he's still the best shot, with proper messaging."

In many ways it seems as though they are trying to condition people into believing their narrative or be completely shunned. This is especially prevalent on Reddit. Whether or not they act this way out of genuine goodness is not something that can be proven, so i'll leave my opinion out of it. But I do believe that it has gotten completely out of hand, as has the lack of accountability. I believe the lack of accountability is a major part of it, you can condemn someone so relentlessly simply for the sake of doing so, knowing full well there will be no repercussions. I have had many of debates online as I enjoy going against the grain, and I personally believe that many of these people know how unreasonable they are, it seems like they are acting to fulfill a larger agenda, rather than trying to disprove a certain persons argument, if enough people tag along and do the same thing, it essentially dismantles their argument by sheer numbers. 

Am I being pessimistic? Is cancel culture less of a problem than I believe it to be? Please change my view. "

0,2024-07-03,CMV: Congress should approve an amendment that limits the issuance of debt securities to the primary deficit of the same year or to the cost of debt service minus 20% of federal revenues if there is no primary deficit,u/SimplePoint3265,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duvlny/cmv_congress_should_approve_an_amendment_that/,changemyview,"The amendment would oblige the federal government, if it operates with a primary deficit (negative balance resulting from the difference between revenues and expenses, excluding debt service), to pay debt service exclusively with its own revenues (whether taxes, royalties or sale of assets). . . This would be done simply by limiting bond issuance to the primary deficit of the same year. The objective is not to allow the federal government to go into debt to cover the deficit in its accounts if it is unable to support the debt service it already has with its own revenue.

In the absence of a primary deficit, bond issuance during the year will be limited to the total cost of existing debt (repayments and interest) minus 20% of total own revenues.

Once again, the objective is to allow debt rollover and interest payments with new issues, as long as there is no debt to cover the shortfall in public accounts and at least 20% of own revenues are allocated to debt service.

Finally, the amendment would make an exception in the case of a war initiated by an attack by a foreign country on American territory or on federal government facilities abroad. In this scenario, the government could take on debt both to cover the primary deficit and to cover the cost of servicing the existing debt – as is the case today. However, it would continue to be mandatory to allocate 20% of revenues to debt service and conflict- related expenses, in that order.

In short, my proposal aims to impose brakes on the federal government's lack of control over debt, helping to reduce the harmful effects of public over-indebtedness on the country's economy."

0,2024-07-03,CMV: sociology is a pseudo-science,u/SelfLoathingAutist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duwil9/cmv_sociology_is_a_pseudoscience/,changemyview,"Sociology claims to be the study of society, but from the journals I read, the course I’ve taken and the sociologists I’ve talked to, it is much less about ‘studying’ society than it is about coming up with theories that support your own pre-existing beliefs about the world. A science is meant to be about knowing things objectively or as close to objectively as you can, but sociology is almost entirely conjecture. 

A society is a large entity comprised of millions of individuals, each with their own individual psychology. How is it possible to have any sort of objective view on how it operates when it neglects individual factors? Ignoring the fact it’s probably not possible, I don’t think it’s even trying to objectively analyse society.

Sociologist’s guiding principles are usually something like ‘inclusivity’ or ‘social justice’, which immediately causes it to be closer to activism than science. If you’re studying and theorising about something with a goal already in mind, especially something as nebulous as society, you’re just projecting yourself into your work. You’re not pursuing knowledge and understanding, you’re just using scientific language as a pretext for your political goals and promotion of your personal opinions. 

Every sociology paper I read has very complex language, using unnecessarily big words for the sake of it. Why? I think they overcompensate to make themselves seem more intelligent or intimidating. They want to trick people into thinking what they’re presenting is more than just waffle. There’s no reason a sociology paper should be harder to read than a psychology or biology paper. 

Lastly, I think the discipline has done great harm to society. Theorising about society is a grandiose thing to do; to think to yourself that you know what’s happening on a grand scale and that you should change society because you know the way it should be is some kind of narcissistic delusion, and this is the kind of person the field attracts; people who serve their own ego above all. They become imbued with intellectual authority from their pseudo-science degree, and all of a sudden their crappy musings are able to influence the way people think and act. This is what makes it dangerous. It’s not too far away from the religious authority of days past. 

Can anyone help me see some real benefit to this discipline?

We're not allowed to ask questions in good faith, and the justification for this is always something like ""people usually say this in bad faith, so no one is allowed to say it now."" 

I know the response to this will largely be ""then don't use reddit."" But... I want to use reddit, I like reddit, I think there are many interesting subreddits. I just don't like how everything is a complete echo chamber, and if you want to not get banned or downvoted, you have to toe the party line, so to speak. It's very disheartening to see people downvoted in a civil discussion because they have a different viewpoint. Downvoting should be used for spam, abusive language, etc. Not for a disagreement. 

I feel like downvotes should require justification, maybe in the form of having to select the reason from a list, similar to when a post is reported or a video is reported on YouTube.

171,2024-07-03,CMV: Nancy Pelosi Should Not Be Reelected To Congress,u/C4rlos_D4nger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duxedg/cmv_nancy_pelosi_should_not_be_reelected_to/,changemyview,"Hi Everyone,

This post isn't 100% about Nancy Pelosi, but I'm going to use her as a proxy for my view because she is representative (pun?) of the problem I want to address and her name probably grabs some attention. This post is intentionally designed to be linked to the Biden-is-too-old debate, but I want to look ahead a bit and address the issue from a different angle. I am not arguing here that Biden should not run for re-election in 2024. I'm also going to preface this post by saying I'm Canadian and so I guess I don't really have a direct stake in this issue.

Anyways, my view is that both the United States overall and the Democratic Party would be better off if Nancy Pelosi were to either not run for re-election or be voted out of office. Nancy Pelosi is running for re-election. She is currently 84 and would be 86 at the conclusion of the term she is currently running for.

As recently seen with President Biden, physical and mental capability is a salient issue when you are in your 80s. I am not arguing that Nancy Pelosi is incapable or senile, but I think concerns around age should be a major consideration, especially when Nancy Pelosi is second in the line of presidential succession. However, the main point I want to make is that both the United States and the Democratic Party would be better off if Nancy Pelosi passed the figurative torch down to a younger politician. At the federal level, both the US and the Democratic Party have extremely old political leadership. The median age of US senators is about 65 and the median age of representatives is about 58. This effectively limits the leadership pool from which presidential candidates can be drawn from (assuming candidates younger than maybe 75 are preferrable - obviously that would seem to not be the case right now) and I think is part of the reason why the average age of the current presidential candidates is a sprightly 80.

Nancy Pelosi also represents a noncompetitive dark blue congressional district. Unlike President Biden, who is in a competitive race, the 11^(th) congressional district is impregnable Democratic Party territory. The Democratic candidate in this district will win their general election, and so I do not see how Nancy Pelosi stepping down would jeopardize Democratic control of this seat.

I am not arguing that this should all happen immediately. I recognize there are administrative hurdles preventing Nancy Pelosi from ceasing her election campaign in 2024 and handing the reigns over to a successor. However, I would emphatically argue that it would be in the best interest of both the US and the Democratic Party for Nancy Pelosi to either not run for re-election or be primaried out of the candidacy for the 11^(th) congressional district in 2026.

At a glance, I would also apply this basic argument to the following congresspeople (mix of Republicans and Democrats) who are currently running for re-election (also not an exhaustive list):

·         Eleanor Holmes Norton (currently 87)

·         Hal Rogers (currently 86)

·         Bill Pascrell Jr. (currently 87)

·         Maxine Waters (currently 85)

·         Steny H. Hoyer (currently 85)

To clarify, I am not arguing for a hard age cap; rather, my argument is simply that both the United States and the Democratic Party would be better off if Nancy Pelosi were to allow for a younger politician to succeed in her place at the earliest practical opportunity.

I'm not talking about the fake sensitivity that is expressed on social media, which is usually a result of entitlement, virtue signaling, and close-mindedness. 

I'm talking about sensitivity as an actual personality trait. There is a term for this, and it's called being a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). [15 to 20%](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/highly-sensitive-person) of our society have this trait, and it is due to both genetics and having a bad upbringing as a child. I am an HSP, so I will use my own experience to form my argument.

Now to define the problem. The main thing that  I see is that the majority of people socially reject or ostracize people that are sensitive, especially for men. It's this idea that they are weak because of their expression of emotion. But, I would argue that the ability to express these vulnerabilities and be willing to accept the criticism of the people around you is a lot more commendable and brave. 

Compare this to surpressing your emotions constantly due to the fear of being judged. This would get you social acceptance and be seen as being strong, but IMO it only means you are strong on the outside. You are not accepting who you are on the inside, which will leave you with resentment.

Another thing that needs to be realized is that sensitive people literally process things differently and have an inherently larger sensory input. That means they will experience both negative and positive things in a more extreme way than someone that is not sensitive. So, of course, it will be harder for them to manage those emotions. But people do not understand this, and assume it is the person's fault for not regulating how they feel, when it is not that simple.

Now, I've talked about the negative, I also want to talk about all of the positive things that sensitive people are capable of. These range from having a high amount of empathy and compassion for the people around you, cultivating mastery/adaptability when placed in different environments, having a problem solving/growth mindset, and being in touch with your own emotions/introspection on a deep level.

The negative side gets focused and honed in for sensitive people, but their positive character traits continue to get overlooked for some reason. As if the bad that comes out of it is worse than the good. I am not saying that there aren't weaknesses to this trait. They are there, but I still believe that it is overall a strength because of how powerful the advantages of it are.

Last thing I want to say is that HSPs can find ways to become better at all aspects of life if given the right conditions and right support. I truly believe that if society changed their viewpoint of seeing this sensitivity as a weakness, we can work together to accept that we are differently wired, and that it is not a bad thing. Without that judgement, we can then get closer to working together and cultivate those relationships that would benefit everyone involved."
0,2024-07-04,CMV: Whales are Fish,u/Demoralizer13243,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dv05ta/cmv_whales_are_fish/,changemyview,"Okay so, in my opinion whales are fish for two main reasons:

1. Whales are descended from lobe finned fish which makes them indisputably fish cladisticaly. This is relevant because virtually all people in the know would agree that humans are primates, humans are mammals, humans are tetrapods, humans are vertebrates, humans are animals, etc. I don't get why we should just skip over the fact that humans are jawed fish and lobe finned fish just because it sounds kind of weird. Humans are indisputably descended from fish and so are whales. This makes them evolutionarily fish. You cannot make an evolutionary definition of fish that excludes humans but includes coelacanths and lungfish.

2. Anatomical definitions are also too vague and can't really include all fish while excluding whales. There are multiple traits that are considered to make something a fish. Cold bloodedness is one of those traits but a tiny number of fish like moonfish are warm blooded. Fish also supposedly should have gills but these are absent in many species of fish such as lungfish and mudskippers. Thirdly, fish should have fins but these are also present in cetaceans. Fourthly, fish are anamniotic but this one is also flawed because many species of fish give live birth including guppies. Fifthly, they say that fish don't have digits which is a specific feature added to target cetaceans which have digits. I don't see why we should exclude cetaceans from the fish class."

For this reason, I believe laws should be enforced consistently on the ground level, without respect for if a law is 

Argument two: Enforcing a law and taking it to its logical conclusion can demonstrate that a law is in need of deletion or revision to the public and politicians alike. 

Argument three: By observing the sometimes absurd nature of laws when taken to their logical conclusion and applied consistently, there would be an incentive for current law makers to think ahead when writing new laws, and to be more specific regarding the intent and mechanisms of the law.

Counterargument one: If police can't necessarily be trusted to enforce laws properly, how would my proposal change anything? My proposal would make it so that police don't have as much room for plausible deniability should they choose to enforce the law in an unequal manner and with sufficient evidence against them

Counterargument two: Enforcing the law to its logical conclusion with complete consistency would or at least could cause undue harm; why should innocents suffer for the sake of rigidity? My rebuttal is that through inflicting some short term inconvenience and suffering, more would be prevented long term by increasing police accountability and leveling the playing field, so to speak, no matter someone's race, wealth, gender, etc etc. Either everyone is equally subject to stupid laws or everyone is equally benefitting from a consistent sensible code of laws. I believe this is a fair gamble to make. 

Counterargument three: No politician, lawyer, etc is omniscient, and thus, there's no guarantee they would be able to understand how every law interacts with every other law or any flaws within a given law.

From the year 2017. until today 4 members of my close family died. My father, then my mother, then my grandmother and grandaunt. So I do have experienced some death recently.

Don't get me wrong, I also post about my life on social media like most people my age. (28F) But to post a picture of my loved one who has died, and say ""RIP"" or whatever long post some people do, just to get comments saying ""my condolences"" or whatever... it's to me the same as people have the need to instantly post their postpartum photos and photo of their newborn baby. Nobody asked the baby if it want's to be featured, also nobody asked the dead people if they want to be featured. It is purely a selfish need. Don't you think?  
Would you ask your dying one ""when you die, can I post about you on social media?""...How morbidly disconnected from the emotions is that?

I know some people will say it is a way to connect to people, sorry but no. People who connect with you when you are ok, will make sure to reach to you and talk with you in your time of grief. Why would one need likes and comments from some acquaintances if not for attention? So people talk about them like ""oh you know her/his loved died, blah blah""?  
I thought about this a lot and it truly is fascinating to me that some people have such need for attention. To me, that is disconnecting from your loved one who died. An act of just thinking about yourself and your needs.

ALSO, photographers on funeral like it' some kind of wedding, can somebody explain that need?

I believe that men who seek out prostitutes are actively ignoring the fact that these women are most likely only sleeping with them out of financial desperation or coercion.

Usually people object that this will lead to people choosing death on a whim. Just because they don't feel happy for a while.

This should not be possible if there's a solid proces leading up to it, that lasts at least, I'd say, a year. 
In this year the person who has signed up for euthanasia will be tested on various mental health aspects. People who suffer from depression will be offered to get help. Or people who are desperate because of debts can get financial advice to alleviate the stress.

Compare that to a system where people who are mentally in a dark or desperate place sometimes spontaneously decide it's enough. And all the secondary suffering that comes from sudden suicides: family, first responders and people that are involved unvoluntarily. 

Tldr: a diligent proces prevents suicides and those who have a persistent wish to die can do it in a peaceful way."

Can't lie.

(I'm Irish by the way, as in born and raised here in Dublin to an Irish mother. My dad's German but I don't know the language, don't have citizenship and only have a slightly below the surface level understanding of German culture, so I wouldn't consider myself half German.)

They try so hard to act like they're a part of the culture that their ancestors are from but my god do they suck at it.

I'd write long paragraphs to get my point across but fuck that, I'm just gonna use bullet points to get my points across. Way easier and much simpler:

**My points:**

* They claim to be Irish/Italian/Whatever but know little to nothing about the culture that they claim to be apart of. *(i.e.  Think of Paulie in the Sopranos when he visited Italy.)*

* Half of the time they have a heavily romanticised, stereotypical or warped view of the country/culture they claim to be a part of. *(i.e. Irish-Americans think Dublin is the only city in Ireland which isn't true because there are 6 and think the rest of Ireland is just stone cottages and farmland.)*

* They usually use the culture as a dick-swinging competition *(i.e. African Americans and their obsession with other people's food choices)*

* They usually expect to be treated like royalty when visiting the ""motherland."" *(Irish-Americans when they expect everyone to sit and listen to their boring uninteresting story of how their great great great great great great great grandpappy's pet goldfish was from Cork and that now makes them 1/69 parts Irish.)

* When visiting the country that they're descended from, they inevitably have a case of Paris syndrome where they realize that the country isn't this actually the romanticised view they had of it and 9 out of 10 times get pissed off about it because it isn't what they imagined.* (Irish-Americans when they expect everywhere to be green fields and stone cottages or Italian-Americans when they expect all of Italy to be pre-WW1 Sicily of something from the Godfather.)

* They have a tendency to gatekeep the culture they claim to be a part of (cultural appropriation) which is kind of ironic because they're the cultural appropriators in this case. *(I don't actually agree with the concept of cultural appropriation and I think it's bullshit, I was just giving an example.)* Despite the fact that the actual people from said nation or culture are happy to share their culture with others. (i.e. Mexican Americans on Cinco De Mayo.)

* They use said culture as an excuse for some political/religious/moral agenda. (i.e. Irish-American preachers visiting Ireland thinking we're still a theocratic shithole from the 1960s when we're actually very secular.)

To finish this off, they don't actually make an effort to be a part of the culture that they claim to be from. They're made fun of by others from the OG countries. They have a very surface level understanding of it all and if they actually want to be more integrated within the cultures they should go into them with the assumption that they know nothing and actually learn what the cultures are.

If you want more examples of different Hyphenated-Americans doing this, I'll be happy to give. I just wanted to keep this short so please ask in the comments.

What is worse, is that all these fully grown adults who seem to genuinely believe their own nonsense are now passing it down onto children. I’ve seen literal 10 year old children on TikTok claiming that they’re “transgender” or “gender fluid” or “demi-gender”. These are literal children. They don’t even have the maturity to cook their own meals and many don’t even know how to ride a bike yet. So why are we teaching kids that it’s okay to identify as some random made up word that will only damage them in the future? 

Also this pronoun business is absolutely shocking. What is a Ze/Zer/Zem? Do people genuinely go by these pronouns without cringing at themselves? What does it even mean? How does it work? How would I even use that in a sentence? Again, made up words. You’re a girl or a boy.  

And I’m honestly not trying to be rude. I’ve met a few of these people who are genuinely nice and pleasant people but it’s just nonsense. But if you can try and reason with me why it makes sense, I will be open to that. CMV.

I don't see why it magically becomes a person when it exits. Of course the most compelling argument for abortion is bodily autonomy, which does not apply to the newborn. However, you you are allowed to end its procession towards life perfectly legally towards life 10 minutes before it exits, but it then becomes murder somehow after it exits. There's no real ""transformation"" in the baby besides it's location during birth, so I would treat the fetus and newborn as morally equivalent creatures. Now, law is arbitrary, but I see people all the time treating mothers that kill their kids as evil demons when it doesn't really seem to me to be any different than abortion.

There is little or no difference, functionally speaking, between a fetus in the womb late-term and a newborn, minus its location. They can't see, don't have personalities or meaningful thoughts, are not sapient, etc, of course it would be a tragedy to the mother if it died but if the mother wants to kill it unless it's old enough to be sentient (at age like 3 or something) I honestly don't get why everyone is so outraged by it.

Yes this is fucked up I know obviously - but honestly, beyond religious values, I don't see why it should be immoral? And I'm not religious. So interrogating my own beliefs.

The White House is a symbol of the American government, its people, and the power of both. It is a symbol of democracy and valued as the “People’s House” vs a palace for a king. It is internationally recognized and possibly the most recognized house in the world.

It was also built by slaves*. 

Point 2:
The United States has never had a public reckoning on slavery (similar to how countries such as Germany have commemorated and reckoned with their role in WWII and the holocaust) and it will be incredibly difficult to heal that incredibly deep wound until such a reckoning occurs.

Conclusion:
It is incompatible with democratic, modern values  to retain a building recognized as the People’s House, which was built by the enslaved ancestors of its citizens. Building a new White House would be meaningful in that the eminent symbol of the US democracy and its government’s power was not constructed leveraging an enslaved people. It would be a direct acknowledgement by the US government of the abuses of slavery and is role in creating a country which is the world’s sole superpower. It would be a literal and metaphorical gesture of moving away from slavery. The current White House should be turned into a public museum dedicated to the abuses and effects of the institution of slavery and its abolition.

This is a clear admission that it’s racist in my opinion, it’s just fine because white people are the ‘majority’. And Reddit doesn’t care about them fuelling the fire because they are special and protected. It makes absolutely zero sense to me, going back to the mention of r/conservative earlier, it’s like if someone made a liberal subreddit and also started banning anyone who comments the slightest dissenting opinion and soon after the subreddit was entirely banned. You’d clearly think that Reddit was being unfair to liberals. It’s the exact same situation with these two subreddits. One group is allowed to be as racist and exclusive as they want whilst the other is literally forced to accept them with open arms and listen to their bullshit with a smile.

At this point all I see in that subreddit is your occasional actual funny content or genuine statements about bigotry and racism, and the rest is a bunch of mindless gruel about nothing more than shitting on an entire race without anyone being able to argue back, even politely. It’s not going to contribute anything to Reddit or society or to individuals, it literally just serves to reinforce their biases and set them against other races. Don’t even get me started on the fact you have to ‘apologise’ to be accepted as an ally there. It’s just an absolutely pathetic attempt to make themselves feel superior despite the fact that no one alive today even took place in the disgusting actions against them such as the slave trade, and treating every single white person like their existence is a curse is literally what white racists do. And then you get people saying ‘it’s just a joke, bruh’, but it clearly is not. More an attempt to just get away with saying whatever you want and not having any opposition whatsoever, no matter how politely you say it or however good and fair your points are.

If you really think that’s what equality looks like perhaps you need to take a look in the mirror. If anyone can present any actual points on how this isn’t racist (more specifically the fact that Reddit instabans any other subreddit and individual looking to do the same, which speaks volumes) then I’d be interested to hear your arguments. But I honestly don’t think there is a good defence for this. The fact that Reddit extremely quickly condemns and permanently bans anyone who even so much as thinks of doing something along the same lines speaks volumes in how unfair treatment is being given to them."

English is not my first language so sorry for any mistake. 

For work, I was going with 1 group 4 times a day to a cooking class for a week.

This was not private but open to public. 

We would meet other people there. 

For the precision, everyone cook for their individual food so, you can customize it to a certain level to your preferences and each participant has their own utensils. 

After doing it for a the first two days, I realized how women have more trouble than men minding their own business. 

Taking the knife out of their husband hands without asking and do the task, reconsider/re evaluate/doubting if not judging everything they do. 

How are they supposed to learn how to cook and feel more comfortable at home doing so if you don't let them improve? 

I think the most stressing one was when parents were coming with their kids (teenagers). 

The mother CONSTANTLY asking to their kids ""isn't it too much rice in your plate? Are you going to finish it?"" *Tastes the plate of their kids* this is too spicy don't you think? Don't you want to add some lemon? 

If the teacher was telling to take some vegetables in the individual basket, they would automatically make a comment ""that's the green one here"" grab it before the spouse/ kids does...ect 

It's like, they would make everything in their power so their family could not be independant.

0,2024-07-04,"CMV: Zionism is fundamentally a refugee movement, not primarily a nationalist or colonialist project",u/Unusual-Double-2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dveqhp/cmv_zionism_is_fundamentally_a_refugee_movement/,changemyview,"Zionism, often mischaracterized as purely nationalist or colonialist, originated primarily as a response to the persecution of Jews in late 19th century Europe. I believe it's more accurately described as a refugee movement, and here's why:

Zionism arose from the existential threats facing Jews, particularly in Europe, at the end of the 19th century. While the movement incorporated nationalist elements, influenced by the broader Spring of Nations, this aspect was secondary to its core purpose: creating a safe haven for persecuted Jews. The movement's initial focus on European immigration was driven by urgent humanitarian needs – Jews were seeking escape from discrimination, violence, and potential annihilation.

The selection of Palestine was partially due to historical Jewish connections, but pragmatically, it offered vast underdeveloped areas. While hundreds of thousands of locals did inhabit the region, early Jewish immigrants predominantly settled in sparsely populated areas or on legally acquired lands. This approach aimed to minimize conflict and establish new communities.

Crucially, the Jewish migration to Palestine wasn't an immediate mass exodus. Most Jews in Europe still led relatively stable lives, especially when compared to the challenges in Palestine – disease (particularly malaria), poverty, and underdevelopment. The majority of Jewish emigrants actually chose the United States until 1924, when strict immigration quotas were imposed. This closure of America as a refuge option significantly impacted subsequent migration patterns. These facts undermine the notion that Zionism was primarily a nationalist movement, as some argue, rather than a quest for refuge.

The relatively small groups of Jewish immigrants to Palestine made substantial contributions to the region. They battled malaria by draining swamps, developed critical infrastructure benefiting all inhabitants, and some groups even engaged in resistance against British colonial rule. These actions demonstrate a commitment to improving the living conditions for all residents, not just Jewish settlers.

The real surge in Jewish immigration to Palestine began after 1924 and intensified after 1933 with the Nazis' rise to power. These weren't fervent nationalists, but desperate refugees fleeing for their lives, who didn't have a real alternative. They joined the fledgling national community established by earlier Zionist pioneers, driven by survival rather than ideology.

I'm not here to assign blame for the subsequent conflicts between Jews and Arabs – both sides have their narratives. My central argument is that the majority of Jews in Israel are essentially involuntary refugees, not colonial settlers driven by imperialist ambitions. The rising rate of antisemitism in the world today only strengthens the feelings felt by the majority of the Jewish citizens of Israel - that they have no alternative even after 76 years.

While the ongoing situation in the West Bank is complex and controversial, with valid concerns about settlement policies, this doesn't retroactively apply to the establishment of Israel proper. At its core, the history of Zionism is fundamentally rooted in the desperate need for refuge, not in colonialist aspirations."

I've been thinking a lot about how we deal with homelessness and urban issues, and I wonder if we're focusing on the wrong question. A lot of the discussion revolves around ""How do we house the homeless?"" But maybe we should also be asking, ""How do we create orderly, safe, and pleasant cities?""  
  
It seems like our current approach has a bunch of programs that sometimes work against each other. For instance, some initiatives aim to help people get off drugs, but there are others that might unintentionally support continued drug use. This makes me think our strategies aren’t always aligned and might even be counterproductive.  
  
I also wonder if there's a bigger picture here—like how our policies and societal norms might be influencing behavior. Sometimes it feels like efforts to ""help"" can end up encouraging behaviors that make cities less safe and pleasant for everyone.  
  
Focusing too narrowly on solving individual problems like homelessness can detract from broader urban planning and community safety issues. Balancing the need to help those in need with maintaining order and safety in our cities seems crucial."

The media makes people believe there are wolves everywhere.

So I understand why people may think the media is exaggerating about Trump and the threat he poses to the US. But I don't think they are this time. 

I don't know of a single former president who calls for his political enemies to be locked up and subject to military tribunals. People can say he's joking or exaggerating, but if his hardcore supporters take him seriously, it doesn't matter. And he never says he is joking when he says these things. His lawyers might, but he never does. 

He also wants to pardon the January 6th people. And people say ""they weren't violent they just pushed police officers, they didn't have weapons."" But they were not invited to the capitol on January 6th so objectively they were trespassing- trespassing on government property no less. That's a crime. That alone is a crime, even if they did nothing else. And he wants to pardon them, many of whom are facing far more serious charges.

And a lot of the same people were dismissive of the idea that he was going to try to change the election results because that's unheard of. But he tried to, multiple times. 

I'm not saying Trump is going to be a dictator or is going to destroy this country. But I think he is capable of doing both. And that's what makes him dangerous. And while he will be under scrutiny, his anonymous sometimes violent base will not be. And he has proven that he has the power to activate them and will say things that do just that, even if they are unintentional (which I don't believe is the case.) 

I think that anybody who has the power to make a violent mob commit crimes is dangerous. Trump is that person, but if he's reelected he will have one of the loudest microphones in the world and millions who are willing to commit violence after hearing him speak. Setting aside the power he will have, setting aside intentions, setting aside whether he wants the capability or not he has the capability and is either reckless or ruthless. 

I don't see how anybody can argue that he isn't extremely dangerous, but I'm curious to hear other points of view and maybe change my view. "

Let us start with the objective fact that the second amendment is outdated and not compatible for modern times, as the supreme court said in DC v Heller with the line of ""the second amendment has limits"". Semi auto guns? Multiple states and a Vermont senator (love me some GOSAFE Act! Can't wait for it to pass!) have said no thank you with very extensive assault weapon bans. More are coming and your conservative court isn't going to stop them. If your precious court was willing to protect your gunny gun guns, why don't they just take a case, say (insert moral n' good gun law) is unconstitutional and be done with it? The don't, because they won't.

Next, the amendment is dangerous, as it gives power to extremists like the proud boys and other incel groups. Allowing just anyone to access a firearm is pure folly, as the smarter countries in Western Europe know. Thankfully, we will see these groups lose members as America becomes brown and beautiful.

Third, the amendment will be gone or severely neutered within the next ten to twenty years or so. A mixture of the climate crisis, microplastic crisis, and the beautiful browning of America (BIPOC (other than grifters like colion noir) objectively don't want or own guns 😁) means that more than likely, the next five or so years are the last few years of flailing by ammosexuals until we just ban and take em federally!

If you argue that ""Russia isn't a liberal democracy,"" I would counter that: 1. There are liberal democracies that aren't considered part of the West. 2. You can't just cherry-pick and say, ""This is the real West,"" so it follows that not all Western countries are liberal democracies.

Hey, I’m 29 and bearing 30 in about 8 months. Dreading it. 

I’m not sure where this fear comes from, but I always think that it’s after 30 that you start being less employable, less desirable, have less energy to do things, I don’t know just have “less” of everything except responsibilities. 

I’ve gathered this because my energy levels, mental health, and just a general desire to do things has plummeted rapidly since i was 24. While my stress and overall anxiety about everything has just skyrocketed. 

What would potentially change my view is people in their 30s, describing how wrong I am. I’d like them to also be open to follow up questions if they arise. 

I would like Reddit to respectfully change my mind! I wish I did not feel this way! "

It’s just the followers mindset; the same one that hitler manipulated and exploited with his own conspiracy theories.  It’s an absolute shame that people have such a feeble understanding of the American government, that they actually believe it’s even possible for them to do the things that trump accuses them of.  Joe Biden does not have the power to “steal the election”, nor does he have the power to legally persecute trump.  It’s literally impossible, thanks to the checks and balances, and the division of power in America.  The classified documents, the hush money, the election fraud; all illegal things that trump objectively did, and now he is being rightfully punished.  If you disagree, then I’m sorry.  I’m sorry that you have so little faith in this great country, and I am sorry that you’ve allowed one man to completely detach you from reality.  Learn about history, and learn about the government.

The United States was worrying about supreme power vested in a single individual BEFORE it even became an actual country. Ever since the inception of the nation, the power of the executive has been widely scrutinized and watched over, I truly believe that if there's one nation on the face of this planet which will never succumb to a dictatorship, it's the United States for that reason. For 250 years, the idea of a Republic and the limited power of the executive has been drilled into the American culture and ideals which are now deeply woven into the minds of the people, and the government.

Now, I'm not saying Trump wouldn't do it given the opportunity, but the fact that that's THE talking point against Trump makes me believe he never will have the opportunity. For him to become a dictator, he'd need to miraculously gain a super majority in both chambers of congress, and to start having 3/4ths of the states bend to his will to be able to pass some new amendments and make himself a dictator. Simply put, that will never happen. Arguably the closest the US has ever come to having a dictator is in the 30s and 40s with FDR and his astonishing 4 elected terms and complete and utter domination of congress. Trump will never have the support FDR had, not even close to it, and if FDR wasn't a dictator by the end of his life, then I think that means Trump certainly won't be either. 

I think Trump would seriously cut back on funding for some federal agencies, stuff others with his lackies, and maybe even dismantle one or two. I think Trump would do everything to give the Republican party more lasting power, but at the end of the day, that's generally one of the goals of every president: to extend their party's power to make legislation and enforcement of the law happen more in a way that aligns with their personal and their party's opinion. I don't think he'd do anything new. He'd do plenty of controversial things, sure, but nothing unheard of, nothing that would make him a dictator, maybe not for a lack of trying, but certainly for a lack of ability to.

Even if the prospect of him becoming a dictator wasn't THE talking point against him, I doubt it could happen. Even if people weren't worried about it and he tried to do everything in his power to become a dictator, he just wouldn't have the support. I honestly believe that if he tried, it'd end up hurting the Republicans more than it would help them, because it would just push away more moderates and swing state voters who hold American ideals and ideas of government very dear.

I know it's a bit weird to claim that he won't become a dictator while expressing my belief that he may try to become one, but still, I don't see it happening, ever. The only way I could see it happening is via a civil war, but we really are nowhere near polarized enough as a nation for a majority or even just a large minority of people to be willing to send their children and even themselves off to a bloody civil war.

I believe our democracy would benefit from a specific public area where registered voters can discuss the election, or at the very least, indicate candidate selection. Our media cycle and two party system seems to intentionally disregard any third party candidate, and almost actively discourage collaboration amongst voters lest we choose someone who isn't prescribed to us to fit the current ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that has become so pervasive in this county. 

I believe the media intentionally exacerbates tensions for views and monetary incentives for ad revenues, which leads to beliefs about the ""other"" becoming more and more entrenched. I believe that most people in this country, left and right, have similar goals of making a good living and taking care of their families, having well rounded positive lives. I see media organizations that completely disregard this reality because it isn't as attention grabbing as the most extreme People on either side, right or left. 

I would hope that a public forum could be useful to the public to find consensus on a reasonable third party candidate to avoid the shit show that is unfolding before us in real time. Collaboration in terms of information sharing would allow the general public to choose someone who actually represents the people in this country, who isn't the frontrunner that media will focus on, and I'm not using the post citizens united definition of ""persons"" here either. 

I understand there would be challenges with such a system, I think commentary and posting would need to be severely limited for all participants, the primary value would be derived from information sharing, preferably something like ranked choice polls to reach consensus on a truly respectable alternative candidate for the presidency. 

Maybe this wouldn't work at all, change my view."

We know that Trump, like a lot of rich and powerful people, was pretty chummy with Epstein and went to parties. According to Trump, he broke of the friendship before three scandal broke, and I haven't seen evidence otherwise. 

Alex Acosta gave Epstein a sweetheart deal when he first got busted. Epstein got a few weekends in a Club Fed jail, and kept on offending. This deal was kept very quiet. It also protected powerful people such as Prince Andrew. 

After that, Trump appointed Acosta Secretary of Labor. They must have known of the Epstein settlement. That was such a risk. But, Trump was more interested in protecting powerful monied interests then he was in preventing sexual crimes. "

His opinion is that a country sees better outcomes if a political party has a physical overpowering majority in a countries parliament (>60%).

My opinion is that while I want the political party I voted for to have the majority, I have always thought that unchecked authority over any system is bad for a country overall and hence other parties being in parliament is a benefit. The way I see it, the voices of dissent force the leading party to consider possibilities from all viewpoints when introducing policy, leading to a balanced political landscape. "

But we are now seeing stuff like HRT and transitional surgery being promoted. There are younger people nowadays that choses to be LGBT much like a lifestyle and its not helpful to society

Biologically no other species practice LGBT, I'm no biologist but I can guess it doesn't get along well with natural selection. There are some known negatives of LGBT like reducing birthrates and its apparently causing a bunch of confusion in sports. Bottomline is, I don’t think LGBT itself has contributed anything to society that’s not its own self promotion or some form of sexual degeneracy.

LGBT should be in the same category as smoking/gambling, let it be legal but people need to be warned about them"

0,2024-07-05,"CMV: Liberals are hypocrites that decry violence when it suits them and turn a blind eye to state violence against the left, which enables fascism in the end.",u/Eldritch_Raven451,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dvsh6b/cmv_liberals_are_hypocrites_that_decry_violence/,changemyview,"It seems to me that anytime leftists engage in any political activism, they are met with violence by the state, which liberals seem to take no issue with, or at least simply engage in vague gesturing and give mere sympathies. When leftists defend themselves against police violence, the liberals decry them as thugs that should be obedient to the law. This seems hypocritical to me. Why is only the state allowed to engage in violence?

Liberals claim to be in favor of liberty, but when leftists make pushes for exactly that, the liberals are quick to support them being repressed by the state. So are liberals fine with the state exercising its authority against ""people they don't like,"" which they claim leftists do? If so, can they not understand how this worship of state authority inevitably enables fascism? History shows this as well, liberalism has always made concessions and allied with fascists to elimimate leftism because they threaten their monopoly on power.

Contrary to popular belief, anarchists do not want a society devoid of rules, they want a society where power is equally distributed to as many people as possible rather than monopolized by an entity such as the state.

We are seeing this happen in both Europe and The U.S. Liberals would rather allow fascists to take power and blame leftists for not being good little drones for it.

Ultimately it just seems like liberals hate us leftists more than anything and want us to die. If I can be disproven in this, then wonderful. But as it stands, I struggle to find a place in this world when it seems like 90% of people want those that share my ideology dead."

Since its maps are made in a 2d plane it just uses smart ways to render those 2d planes in a 3d view. I know that infinite height and no looking up or down was intentional so I'm not going to get into that here. In Doom if you don't see an enemy the code doing the binary space partitioning does not render the map or the enemies. Instead the enemies remain unrendered if you dont currently see them and the most common argument for Doom is 2d or 2.5d is that THERE ARE NO ROOMS ABOVE ROOMS.

People aren't campaigning for popular vote, it's like having an apple eating contest and then complaining you didn't win because while you ate less apples, you did eat more oranges.

If popular vote was important it would completely change how politicians campaign. If there is no chance a party wins a particular seat then currently  they won't put much effort in, it doesn't matter if you lose by 1 vote or 1 million votes. However if popular vote was important you would have more parties putting effort into places they are unpopular, they would allocate money and time differently and this would change the election result.

Development should be stopped.",u/Creative_Board_7529,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dvtinh/cmv_sam_altman_and_openaior_equivalent_will/,changemyview,"AI is in it’s infancy right now, and is already having deep effects on several economic sectors, and as it gets better trained and more focused on sectors such as customer service, media and journalism “creation”, and automation of simple digital tasks, it will only eat up a larger and larger share of human jobs and industries. It’s proven at this point, that while AI “can” be used as a tool to enhance someone’s jobs, corporations are not using it for that, and are dead set on replacing those jobs entirely or mostly with AI models.

If that is where AI stops, as being a means to cannibalize human jobs, then it will ruin and torpedo the global economy in multiple sectors, if not nearly all.

If AI, and stuff like the theorized AGI become a reality though, the worst case scenario becomes much more horrifying, anything from near complete replacement economically, to “I have no mouth and I must scream” levels of horrifying. 

I see no use purpose of AI that isn’t outweighed by its psychotically huge downfalls and even more crazy huge risk factor.

The development of AI will make Microsoft a much more rich company and make a few hundred thousand jobs, and some really bad Pixar rip off animations, but will the LEAST lead to millions of jobs lost, economic collapse, and a broken system, or at the worst a doomsday scenario."

0,2024-07-05,CMV: Stan Edgar is more evil than Homelander and deserves to die,u/JoshuaKpatakpa04,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dvud7y/cmv_stan_edgar_is_more_evil_than_homelander_and/,changemyview,"Yes I know I am literally saying that Stan Edgar a brutal business is more evil than the sinister supe Homelander. While this may seem like a stretch but after watching The Boys for four whole seasons and observing the characters and Stan and Homelander I 100% believe Stan is more evil and I am going to state my reasons why. 

1. In Season 3 of The Boys we learned that in back in the 80s Stan Edgar had the knowledge Homelander was going to be created by Vogelbaum. Homelander was experimented by The Vought corporation which had made him into the tragic monstrous Supervillain he is today. Never once did Stan Edgar ever try to stop the suffering that Homelander was going through. Stan is always depicted at being smart but to me he is not, if he wanted the perfect ‘product’ he would not made Homelander go through all of that but no he screwed over the world and Homelander. 
2. What helps solidify Stan being more evil that Homelander is that recently in Season 4 that Stan Edgar actually ordered the experiments to be carried out on Homelander. The evidence for this that Barbara one of the scientists responsible for the scientist literally said that Stan Edgar wanted the experiments done. This shows how Stan Edgar tortured Homelander and is ultimately responsible for Homelander becoming the person that he is. 
3. Stan Edgar has also worsened Homelander as well. Evidence for this is for all the numerous, countless crimes and screw ups Homelander has committed Stan Edgar has always been there to cover Homelander up. This is absolutely dangerous because it gives Homelander no room to learn responsibility, accountability and growing from his mistakes, which could have made him into a hero. Furthermore this causes Homelander to develop a superiority complex which makes him worse that he can do whatever he wants and faces no backlash for it.
4. Stan Edgar literally hired a Nazi aka Stormfront on the Seven. Before anyone comes at me about Stormfront and Homelander yes I know people they had a relationship. But at least Homelander at Season 3 outright rejected Stormfront’s Nazi ideals. Stan literally kept Stomfront who was committing hate crimes across America towards POC people which is downright evil and was perfectly comfortable with it. 

Whenever throughout the series, Stan Edgar is ‘owning’ Homelander I always scoff at the pompous prick. People love to cheer on Stan Edgar for belittling Homelander well I don’t in reality it is a narcissist abusive father (Stan Edgar) belittling his narcissistic rapist abusive son (Homelander) even tho the narc father is reason why Homelander is the villain. Like Stan berates Homelander for his failings when he forgets Homelander is evil because of Stan. With that it’s one of the many reasons why I deeply empathise with Homelander as much as I want Homelander to face justice. I really hope Homelander one day kills Stan Edgar for all the evil that he’s done to the supe as it will be a way for Homelander to find some level of closure.

Some polls have placed him at number 1! He’s seen for guiding us the WWII and the Great Depression. 
I think we should see him as a borderline fascist president that America should be actively condemning. 

Exhibit A and really the best evidence: Japanese Internment Camps. America’s own concentration camps, and we do a very good job as a country of forgetting about it. 

B: He tried to pack the Supreme Court to get his policies passed. It is believed (though the truth is hard to confirm), that the Supreme Court changed its stances on the New Deal to avoid getting packed. If that is the case, he effectively intimidated the court. 

C: forced nationalizing of gold. 

D. Censorship of anti war media. 

E. The National Recovery Act (of which he put massive pressure on SCOTUS to allow) was designed to put massive additional power into the executive branch. 

F. Breaking precedent by serving four terms. Not a terrible red flag in itself since it was legal, but in combination with other things, it is supportive to the claim. 

G. War crimes. Namely firebombing Tokyo and killing 300k civilians.  

H. Drafting soldiers. In 1940, he did the first peacetime draft and created the selective service act. 

There are also arguments that he prolonged the depression, and while I agree with that, I also recognize that it is far more political. I’m less concerned with his policies than with what he did with his presidential power. 

I’m not saying that he was a fascist dictator. I am saying that history should look back on him with shame rather than the admiration he tends to get. He got a lot of people killed, imprisoned people based on race, consolidated a lot of power under himself, and strategically misled the Americans through censorship and propaganda campaigns. If a modern president did half of this stuff, he’d be labeled a fascist. "

I think one of the biggest issues with many societies is that the population doesn’t understand that we are interacting on a conceptual level with non physical things just as much as we are interacting physically. I don’t think the majority of people (including myself if im being honest) genuinely understand how to analyze their beliefs and opinions, analyze arguments or positions presented to them or grasp the subjective nature of the non physical realm we play in.

I don’t see why we learn things like Shakespeare and the water cycle before we learn how to think clearly and understand the conceptual reality we live in. It seems like it would be something fundamental to a successful society."

810,2024-07-05,CMV: Imprisoning CEOs of companies that hire illegal immigrants would effectively end most illegal immigration. The fact that any policy like this hasn't been proposed is proof that neither American party wants to actually address the issue. ,u/b00tcamper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dw7szc/cmv_imprisoning_ceos_of_companies_that_hire/,changemyview,"Here is how you end illegal immigration in the US. 

You don't build walls. You don't increase border security funding. 

You curb people's desire to come here. 

Why do they come here? Despite being illegal, thousands upon thousands of American businesses hire illegal labor and pay them cash under the table. 


ICE could be converted into a Labor Auditing department (we may already have one but since it's obviously not effective, I'll refer to making a new one) that is funded effectively and whose goal is to audit all business employees to make sure they are legal. Not only will NEW-ICE conduct audits, they can conduct undercover operations on large organizations to find out if they are hiring illegals. 

If a business is found to be employing illegal labor, the hiring managers and CEOs could face 2-3 years in prison. This will encourage business leadership to heavily audit themselves and ensure that when NEW-ICE comes investigating, their books are clean. 

It wouldn't address the illegals that already live here. But when these people can't find work anymore, word will spread and they will stop wasting their time crossing into a country where businesses are too scared of imprisonment to hire them.

Thats my proposal. 

Here's the thing, I don't want you to CMV on why that proposal is a bad idea. 

I know it's a bad idea. It's a great solution for solving the issue Trump brought up after every question during the debate. (migrants flooding in). 

People truly don't understand how ingrained illegal labor is in our society. Do you know how much of the food you get from grocery stores has been handled and processed by illegal labor? It's one of the reasons prices are so low. 

People would freak out if produce prices doubled over even tripled because companies have to pay higher wages to American or legal work visa owners to harvest their produce. 

Both parties know that actually fixing illegal immigration would be a disaster for their reelection chances. As we've seen, rising food prices, gas prices, and inflation are most people's top priority politically. 

Is it right that companies exploit cheap labor? No. But since when has the American voter cared about morals? In our individualistic society, we care far more about our bottom lines than ethics and working conditions for non Americans. 

Nobody wants to fix illegal immigrants coming in because we need them to sustain our 1st world lifestyles. 

And yet, we fight over it and catasrophize it because most people are dumb, uneducated, and do not understand the complexities around it. 

Which is why you shouldn't vote for either party based on their border policies. Look at other policies they propose because they are straight up lying to you about the nature of immigration in this country.

In fact, I think his absence is actually strange.

**Kirby is a property of Sakurai**

Sakurai is the primary developer behind Smash Bros and he is the primary developer behind Kirby. You can kinda see his favoritism come into play when Kirby is the only one who survives Galeem's attack in the beginning cutscene of Ultimate. So they have complete access to the character. Bandana Dee is even a Spirit.

**Lack of Kirby**

Ever since Brawl (16 years ago), we have only had 3 playable Kirby characters. Bandana Dee is one of the most important characters in Kirby. He has been the main sidekick in many games and is pretty well-known. To add, Kirby is one of the most popular franchises that Nintendo has. Players will know and love Bandana Dee unlike another damn Fire Emblem character - which we have 8 of. We have nearly 15 Mario characters, 10 Pokemon, 3 versions of the same character (Link), and a partridge in a pear tree. Yet we haven't seen any new Kirby characters. It's not like Kirby is a niche franchise (unlike Fire Emblem).

**Already perfect for Smash**

His moveset in Kirby games is usually very great. In Kirby's Return to Dreamland, he wields a spear as if his character was made for Smash Bros. His controls would only need slight adjusting. He has all sorts of great moves like the spear helicopter could be up + B, the triple spear throw could be holding down B, and his Final Smash could be having an army of Waddle Dees and even Waddle Doos attack you like King Dedede's Final Smash in Brawl.

**They literally added Piranha Plant**

You're gonna tell me they got PIRANHA PLANT, EIGHT FIRE EMBLEM CHARACTERS, DOCTOR MARIO, THREE LINKS, and not even this HUGE sidekick from Kirby? The Fire Emblem characters play very similarly to each other and no one outside the Smash community has heard of those games. At least with Doctor Mario they had him in Melee and Ultimate was trying to bring back every character that was ever in Smash but there's no excuse for Piranha Plant.

**All in all, Bandana Dee's moveset in Kirby shows significant Smash Bros potential. Despite Kirby being one of Nintendo's biggest franchises, we haven't had any new Kirby characters since Brawl. Rather than choosing obscure characters like Piranha Plant and Fire Emblem fighters, they should add a main character from this huge franchise which the developer of Smash also runs.**"

I think that, even though there might be a sliver of a chance, Trump won't win because of a few reasons:

* Many younger people have grown to voting age since 2016 and 2020, and [they tend to lean left](https://www.prri.org/research/generation-zs-views-on-generational-change-and-the-challenges-and-opportunities-ahead-a-political-and-cultural-glimpse-into-americas-future/), and even though anecdotal social media posts aren't anything to go off of, many of them seem more willing to vote for anyone besides Trump.
* There is a growing group of Republicans that don't support Trump. According to Reuters, [up to 10% of Republicans are less likely to vote for him after the recent convictions](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/one-10-republicans-less-likely-vote-trump-after-guilty-verdict-reutersipsos-poll-2024-05-31/). While I think that they are a bit of an overstated group, they are important to the race overall. I don't think most of them will switch and vote Democrat, but I do think that many of them will vote Independent or abstain entirely.
   * To add onto this, Trump isn't very accessible to moderate voters. He is very alarmist, especially when talking about the 2020 election or his recent court cases, and has publicly falsely stated that he won the election, something that no candidate has done in recent memory. He will probably maintain his voter base, but I don't think many people are going over to him.
* The amount of registered Republican voters is going down, while the amount of registered Democrat voters is going up according to [this survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-partisanship-and-ideology-of-american-voters/) by the Pew Research Center. This might not flip the election results, but it is definitely a huge amount of people.
* The 2020 election, which had the highest voter turnout in American history, was still won by Biden, who got [about 7 million more votes than Trump.](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2020presgeresults.pdf) I think that even with the recent debate performance, Biden still has a lot of wiggle room. In contrast, the January 6th events as well as the recent convictions, could result in him losing support. I don't think it's shifting many people towards his position, just strengthening the views of those who already thought that he won the 2020 election.

I don't think the chances of Trump winning are as big as people want to inflate them into being. While the debate was pretty bad for Biden, I think that there are a good amount of factors against Trump that tip the balance in Biden's favor."

It’s so clear that for years the MSM has been in bed with the left. The bias against Trump and for Biden is so obvious and destructive that the left and right are on two completely different realms of reality at this point.

It’s insulting to my intelligence that the media is really trying to make me believe that they had no idea that Biden was this incompetent. When so many have given their own first person accounts of Biden’s sharpness. How can Joe Scarborough go from saying that this is best Biden ever three weeks ago to now saying that he needs to step down?

How is it possible that so many politicians and media personalities used the exact same verbiage that “Biden is as sharp as a tack”, almost like they’re speaking on talking points of the left?

And now for damage control the media is trying to convince me that he is fine but had a cold, or is it he was tired from travel? Or is it he was overprepared for the debate? I forget. 

The media’s clear and obvious misinformation is so incredibly damaging to democracy. We now have a political climate where one side of the aisle is fully radicalized and believes everything told to them by the MSM and another side of the aisle has a complete and total distrust of the media. 

This has been a thing for years but this incident regarding Biden’s cognitive decline needs to be the last straw. There needs to be some sort of accountability."
0,2024-07-06,CMV: Emotional inteligence is not what people think it is,u/Down_D_Stairz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dwlgra/cmv_emotional_inteligence_is_not_what_people/,changemyview,"I usually browse between dating subs, and when is asked, expecially to women, what is the most important thing in a relationship the answer given the most is basically the following :

Emotional inteligence, which means the **ability to manage** both **your own emotions** and understand the emotions of people around you.

But when people say EI, expecially women, they usually refer to stuff like open up more, **express your feeling more**, comunicate with me. See that's the key part that i don't understand : that's literally the opposite of what emotional inteligence actually means; let me explain :

Almost every time a women say to express your emotion/open up, **she is lying, both to you and to herself.** What she is really asking is for you to TELL the emotion you are feeling, not to EXPRESS it, at least 90% of the time. maybe you can make an argument for happy emotions but even there it's 50-50.

Let me give you some examples, try to put yourself on the shoes of the women in the examples.

1.  Wife cheat, husband finds out. he is feeling negative emotions such as anger, hate and so on. What is the preferred course of action :

* **Expressing** his emotions : leaving aside extreme cases, let's just say he express his emotion by yelling mean stuff to you and punching the wall, without actually touching you a single time. His feelings are justified, maybe not his actions, but he is letting you know his emotions *by expressing them through action,* you can clearly see how he is feeling. That's literally opening up and expressing his emotion, his action match the way he feels in the moment.
* **Telling** his emotions : It would be something like ""Look, you hurted me deeply, and i don't know if i can find the strenght to trust you again after this. It will require a lot of work from your part, and even then i can't promise you things will even be the same"". 

I bet all of you will prefer the 2nd option, but that's bottling up his emotions and pushing them down, quite the opposite of opening up / expressing your emotions. It's anachronistic, The way you are asked to behave to make her confortable and not scared of you it's being stoic on the outside, while inside you are feeling a range of emotions that are the total opposite of what you are displaying on the outside. 

Now i get that this type of situation can lead to assault and similar, so that's why you have to restrain your emotions just in case, so let's look at some other emotions in which no one is actually at risk.

2. Husband is desperate, he doesn't know what to do : he's having an hard time at work, he may be fired and he's barely making ends meet as it is. As his wife, you are not aware of the situation, but you feel something is off. How would you prefer to know about his emotions?

* **Expressing** : He is desperate, and he is actually showing it with his action. you see him sobbing on the couch with his hands covering his face. he notice you, and he say ""i don't know what to do, please help me"" between a sob and the other. His emotions are justfied, and the his action match the one you would expect from someone feeling desperate.
* **Telling :** he is still desperate, you see him with a worried face on the couch and you understand that something is off, so you go ask him, and he say something along the line of ""Look, i'm not gonna lie to you, i don't know what to do with the rent, things at work aren't going well right now and i'm out of option. i need your help, we need to figure something out together""

Again, i think at least 80% of you will still pick option n2, and the rest will pretend to be fine with n1, but same way as before, he is not actually feeling/expressing his emotions, his telling them to you without actually opening the pandora box; at best is giving you a little sneak peak by appearing worried, but that's far away from what he is actually feeling.

Look even good emotions are not totally safe from this situation. yes you are allowed to show more of them, but still only to a certain degree, certantly not to the fullest;

3. Let's say your husband is watching the game, it's an important match like a derby or whatever ( i don't follow sport too much), and he is like an ultra fan of the sport, that means he will feel either great joy or anger depending on the situation.

* **Expressing** : There is a good chance for his team, there's a loud ""GO GO GO"", they miss it's a loud ""FUCK""  referee make a mistake in his opinion, shout something ""THAT WASN'T A FOUL YOU DUMBASS"", gol for his team, loud shout, gold against his, the same; you got the type.
* **Telling** : Basically all mild comment like ""yes, nah, there you go, cmooon"" and so on, but nothing to crazy.

Now maybe the situation doesn't bother you to the point of telling him, but you would like if you said that if given the option, you would prefer the one shouting, but guess what, the one shouting is the one with the action that more genuily reflect how he feel inside, and he is the one opening up/expressing his emotions.  

The only situation in which there is a chance of you being able to open up to the fullest, it's with happiness.

4. Let's say you are out of ideas and you need to find something to gift your husband for his birthday. After giving some thought without coming out with anything, you give up and go ask his sister for advice.               She says she isn't sure, but she seems to remember that you always wanted the star wars lego or something like that, and you could give it a shot. you are not sure either, but you are out of option so you go with it.

* **Expressing** : Well guess what, you nailed it! It's the only thing he always wanted, he is so happy he doesn't even comunicate with your properly, he is jumping everywhere like a little children on christmas day, screaming and everything. he thanks you and then storm out into his roam playing it, he is so excited he can't wait. You didn't know of his passion, you are glad that you got the right one, even if you can't really get why all the hype just for some legos, but you are happy anyway.
* **Telling** : He can't believe his eyes, he is still showing a lot of happiness, but the adult-like one, and most of all despite *his need to play it,* he address you, saying . ""Nooo, how could you know! that the one i always wanted since i was 8!"" you explain, and he goes on ""You are the best honey, thank for putting a lot of thought on my present, you are the best"" followed by a kiss, a hug, anda childing request if he can play it now, which you agree.

You could argue that this is not properly the same comparision because one adress the wife and the other doesn't, but that's exactly the point. You made him so happy that you brought out the child that lies in him, and a child doesn't give you praise about how thoughtfull you were, a child run to play his games, and while some of you could be fine with him actually expressing his childish happiness, and find the whole situation cute, other will prefer the emotion tuned down a bit, at least to the point in which you acknowledge the effort she put in, so i would argue a 50-50.

  
With basically all range of emotions, women never want to actually see you express them through action, they just want to know them; they want a sneaky peak on the pandora box to know what's up, but then you need to close it as fast as possible and keep it to yourself, **just tell me how you feel, don't actually express it.** 

I challenge you to find day to day situation in which you prefer the emotion at 100% instead of it tuned down, and if you are gonna argue this is the same for everyone, well i can agree only to a certain point, it's different for men and women; An ex of mine once started crying because she couldn't pick what to eat, and while i didn't appreciate it for sure, i didn't leave her for that; but i could never find a girlfriend if my level of emotional maturity iwas at suck a level that picking what you have to eat stress you so much to the point you start crying, i would lever be allow to feel that, let alone actually show it.

  
TLDR

>When people, expecially women, refer to emotional inteligence, they usually mean someone who can comunicate, who can open up, who can express his feeling, but in reality, they don't actually meant that. When they say that they actually mean you need to be capable of ***telling me how you feel, without actually expressing it.*** and the quantity of actual emotion you are allowed to express is based on the emotion: The more the emotion is negative, the less you are allowed to express it, but even with good emotion like happiness sometimes you can't always show it to the fullest."

Ginger Ale is tinted sprite. When I was a kid I didn’t understand the difference. But then I tried it and realized I liked it… because it’s just sprite. I can see how there’s a slight taste difference but it’s not a “meaningful” one. So to define “meaningful” a reference is coke and Dr.pepper are meaningfully different. Coke and Pepsi are not. 

Now, with both coke vs Pepsi and ginger ale vs sprite. There IS a minuscule difference in taste. I will admit that. But does it really make a difference? I’d say not. 

I can however say that I prefer coke with a burger and Pepsi with pizza. So I can see why in some instances you’d want ginger ale instead of sprite. Like if you’re mixing an alcoholic beverage. But I don’t drink alcohol so CBA. 

Here’s the ingredients for both Ginger Ale (Canada Dry) and Sprite. I think the biggest difference Is who owns them; and that they changed the order of the last two ingredients. 

Ginger Ale (specifically Canada Dry): carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, sodium benzoate, natural flavors, caramel color
-says, “sodium benzoate (preservative)”
-owned by Keurig Dr Pepper company

Sprite: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate

I am attempting to leave morality entirely out of this.

Israel is a rogue actor who causes instability in the Middle East. They are kind of like North Korea except they aren’t a buffer state of any kind. 

If Israel didn’t exist the United States would be in a much better position in the Middle East. Israel seriously impairs American relations with almost every middle eastern state.

But Israel does exist. It won’t poof out of existence just after America stops supporting it.

I don’t think the American security apparatus is dumb. I think they see Israel as having been a bad investment that they can’t pull out from.  

I think the security apparatus is concerned Israel could go one of two directions if support stops

1. North Korea of the Middle East: a country that basically uses nuclear blackmail against everyone else. Might side with Russia or something like that.

2. Massive collapse. Giant refugee crisis and possible nuclear disaster.

I believe both of these are realistic scenarios. Although I lean towards massive collapse. But I don’t think either one will occur instantaneously after America withdraws support, and I think America will only gain from withdrawing support up until the point one of these two scenarios begins. 

In the short term Israel has nowhere to go, so it not liking America as much isn’t that big a short term threat. It’s not like a country like Turkey that has major leverage playing off powers from each other. 

I don’t think America will be perceived as weak or unreliable for stopping supporting Israel. There was no noticeable negative effects on America’s image for the Afghanistan withdrawal, and I think America will get a soft power boost for being perceived as less hypocritical, perhaps more Democratic too but that’s up for more debate. In the long run Israel not being able to stir up things in the Middle East will be a benefit too. "

But if there was a magical red button that would eliminate Islam from the world and erase the entire culture and memory of it from Islamic people's minds, I'd press it a million times. (note: not suggesting killing anybody, just making them forget entire aspects of their culture Men in Black style. That fantasy isn't the point of this post though). 

I'd also press the same button for most religions, Christianity would be 2nd on my list.

But Islam is, by far, the worst religion. Other religions have extremists but not on the level of violence and disgust as extremist Islamic groups. (can anyone think of the Christian ISIS that caused even 1% the same level of harm as actual ISIS in the last several hundred years? Yes, I'm aware of the crusades but we haven't had a crusade issue in almost 1000 years)

The vast majority of Islamic people aren't extremist though. My issue with the majority is simply the reinforcement of extreme patriarchy and how women are relegated to being just sandwich and baby makers that can't show their face in public.

I believe people born into Islam are victims of that culture, men and especially women. All of them that live in 1st world or non-Islamic government countries would live immensely better lives ditching that religion for anything else.

I don't believe that it is racist for me to not support growing Islamic communities in Western countries. I don't believe their culture adds a net positive to our diversity like most other cultures.

I don't want my future kids exposed to the misogyny, hatred, and mistreatment of women from that culture.

That's not a blanket statement though. I'm aware of plenty of Islamic families in 1st world countries that are Islam-lite. They don't enforce women to always wear hijabs and don't have the same barbaric rules. They are just a different flavor of Christianity, and that's cool.

But just like I'm against extreme Christianity, I'm against basic level Islam.

It's not good for our culture and I don't blame a lot of Europeans for not wanting that culture of hatred and oppression to grow in their countries.

We are lucky in the US because the majority of immigrants here are Latinos, who really aren't all that culturally different from us, at least not in harmful ways. They add value to our society. As a white American male, I'm married to a Latina and so I am very much aware of the outside perspective here.

TLDR: I don't want Islam to grow in western cultures. It's a harmful culture unless it is Islam-lite (meaning no oppression of women). I'm not a racist for feeling that way either because I dislike the religion itself, not the people unless they are actively negatively influencing me and my community.

(note, I'm not really addressing policy here like Trump's Muslim ban. I just want to discuss my mentality and am hoping someone shows me that Islamic people in Western countries are chilling out and that I have no need to feel this way).

I just really don't like seeing women in hijabs that probably feel 0 control over their life. I know there is some variance here but I just can't stomach that kind of culturally reinforced sexism. They should be free to be happy and make their own choices, rather than being a slave to their husband or father."

smoking:
addictive
expensive
slowly kills you in various ways
slowly kills the people around you
terrible for cardio
smells funny (could be a positive)
bad for environment


drinking:
marginally less addictive but still addictive
can be exponentially more expensive but usually not depending on how much/what you drink
also kills you but not as badly
gives you a hangover
impairs judgement, coordination, balance, social awareness, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, reaction time, can make you more aggressive, can alter your consciousness

as you can see in the graph, drinking has more serious negatives (let me know if i missed any). both industries exploit a market of disaffected, vulnerable people who may very well be seeking a crutch for their own problems whatever they may be - but drinking lowers your inhibitions where smoking does not. someone whos already geared towards impulsive behaviours like drinking in excess will also be the kind of person to drink drive or commit acts of domestic violence/be a public nuisance/engage in risky sexual behaviours, and the alcohol does nothing but exacerbate an already existing proclivity. the fact that the alcohol industry is afforded liberties tobacco and nicotine (like snus/zyns etc) are not makes it worse, as does the lack of stigma and its popularity. you may go ""but erm, second hand smoke!"" but theres an easy solution - go outside to smoke. if youve ever been around an alcoholic, youll know its not just as easy as asking them to leave. change my view."

People care about their lives now. Tax rates, crime rates, inflation, cost of living, and so on. No one feels satisfied with their president when their lives are terrible.

But reducing all of those things takes time. Unfortunately, they take more time than is afforded to a president because of term limits. This is what happens:

1) Progressive come into power

2) Progressives start investing into America 

3) Investments increase tax rates, but take several years to complete

4) Progressives lose election because of high crime rates and taxes

5) Conservatives take power

6) Investments finish, so high taxes are no longer needed

7) Republicans take credit for progressive policies. Republican party is now known as party of tax cuts, low crime rate, economic booms and low costs of living.

8) Republicans pass policies that only negatively impact Americans 3-4 years later, when democrats are in charge.

  
Trump is flexing how America was an economic powerhouse during his presidency. But that was the result of Obama's leadership in recovery from the Great Recession (that Joe Biden was a part of). Trump is flexing how America wasn't involved in any wars during his presidency. But that's the result of Obama's proactive leadership creating stability throughout the world. 

  
Trump is accusing Biden of ruining the economy and causing insane inflation. But that is the result of Trump mismanaging COVID so badly that entire supply chains crashed. Trump is accusing Biden of being responsible for the border situation. But that's the result of Trump's aggressive trade policy making Central and South America unstable and encouraging migration. Trump accuses Biden of having mismanaged foreign policy. But that's the result of Trump stoking the flames by antagonizing Iran, empowering the Israeli far-right, making deals with the Taliban, and encouraging Russia.

  
Trump takes credit for Obama's (and thus Biden's achievements), and Biden takes the flak for Trump's policies.

  
Progressive policies directly lead to republican empowerment. It's ironic that investments that help America were directly responsible for many of the issues we face today. Maybe, if Obama pursued short term solutions to the Great Recession, Hilary could've won. We would then still have Roe v Wade, we would still have Chevron, we would have managed Covid better, we would have stable foreign policy, and so much more. America could have been in a better place today if people didn't care.

  
There are so many issues in America that need to be addressed. Over half of Americans are functionally illiterate. But those investments, like in schooling, would cause tax increases now, and would only result in decreases in crime rates and economic benefits up to 18 years after completing the project. What if MAGA ends up in charge when those investments bear fruit? We would be doomed."

Here's my rationale:

# 1. Geographical and Electoral Advantage

* **Swing State Appeal**: Arizona has become a pivotal battleground state in recent elections. Having Senator Kelly, who won a competitive Senate race in Arizona, on the ticket could help secure a crucial state for the Democrats.
* **Regional Balance**: Kelly's presence would add geographical diversity to the ticket, potentially appealing to voters in the Southwest and broader Sun Belt region, which are critical areas for a Democratic victory.

# 2. Background and Experience

* **Military Service**: Mark Kelly is a retired Navy captain. His extensive military background and service bring a strong national security and leadership credential to the ticket, which can appeal to moderate and independent voters.
* **Astronaut Experience**: As a former astronaut, Kelly's expertise in science and technology could resonate well with voters who prioritize innovation, space exploration, and STEM education, areas increasingly important in the 21st-century economy.

# 3. Personal Narrative and Public Image

* **Inspiring Story**: Kelly's wife, former AZ representitive Gabby Giffords, survived a tragic shooting that robbed her of her political career. After her recovery the two  have become inspiring advocates for reducing gun violence, which adds a compelling and relatable human element to the ticket. This narrative can strengthen the campaign's emotional connection with voters.
* **Bipartisan Appeal**: Kelly is known for his pragmatic approach and has garnered support from both sides of the aisle. His ability to work across party lines can attract moderate Republicans and independents who may be disillusioned with their party's current direction.

# 4. Demographic and Voter Appeal

* **Veterans and Military Families**: Kelly's military service can attract votes from veterans and military families, a significant demographic that values strong leadership and national security.
* **Appeal to Independents and Moderates**: Kelly's centrist views and bipartisan approach can help capture the critical independent and moderate voters who are essential for winning a general election.

Convince me there is someone else would be a better choice for VP than Mark Kelly!"

Yes racism and sexism play a roll in white men’s own selection of political bubbles to live in and media they consume, but at its core liberals tell white men and women to “sit down, shut-up and listen to a wise minority tell you how it is”

And if you don’t want to be talked to like that then you’re just another fragile white man to be treated with contempt and disregard. 

Guess what though? White men ain’t going *anywhere*. It doesn’t mean you can’t call them out for blatantly deplorable behavior but if you construct a media environment, which the left has in the last 10 years, where hatred of “whiteness” — by whiteness they don’t just mean skin phenotype but the associated “perks” that go with it — and the ceremonial kneeling and groveling at the altar of black victimization is a prerequisite for being a member of the American Left. 

People might ho-hum this and say it’s a minority of people and that white men need to develop thicker skins, which would be true if the same liberal media spaces allowed them to make race jokes too. But instead they’re required to sit there and smile, laugh “yes, yes I am the white devil and a colonizer” because it’s part of the ancestral debt the Left feels, though they rarely articulate as such, white men “owe” black people. 

But that’s not what human nature is like. No dirt poor white man that struggled to claw his way out of poverty is going to accept being reframed in the “oppression olympics” as being indistinguishable from a Wall Street hedge fund manager just because his skin is paler then some. And the tap-dancing whites, you see them all over the progressive media bubble — The Ringer’s Midnight Boys, Adam Ruins Everything — who’re panting for a minority to come pat them on the heads and tell them they’re one of the good ones are not representative of white men in America. 

And you’re just gonna keep driving them further and further away if you use the tap-dancers as model for how white men should comport themselves. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of very justifiable and volatile anger lurking just beneath the surface of black America when it comes to issues of equity and race. And the antagonistic jokes at the expense of the “Yts” is part of releasing some of that steam. I’m sure many black Americans, reading this post are rolling their eyes into the back of their heads and getting out the worlds tiniest violin to play for white tears, nonetheless I feel it needs to be said.

73,2024-07-06,CMV: the original Star Wars trilogy would be made worse by showing Leia as traumatised,u/ReaperReader,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dwu096/cmv_the_original_star_wars_trilogy_would_be_made/,changemyview,"I've read criticisms of the original Star Wars trilogy for not showing Leia as traumatised by the destruction of Alderaan, nor showing any of her grieving beyond her initial reaction. I think adding such scenes would have made the original movies (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) worse.

I have two reasons for this - firstly it would undermine Leia's character concept, and secondly it doesn't fit with the style of the movie.

Leia's character concept is fundamentally simple - everything about Leia says ""damsel in distress"" except for, well, Leia. The scene on the Death Star where she's escorted in to Tarkin and Vader's presence visually shows her as young and helpless, in a soft flowing dress, towered over by the faceless Stormtroopers, much older Tarkin and the utterly intimidating Vader. Then Leia opens her mouth and starts insulting everyone. She withstands torture. She lies even when Tarkin threatens Alderaan. Tarkin orders her execution, and her response? To insult him. Our heroes free her from her cell and she starts complaining and insulting *them*. She even insults a Wookie and lives. When she gets to the Rebel base and someone offers her his sympathy on her loss, her response? Tells him they don't have time to grieve. ESB - Han barely manages to get her to leave the command centre on Holth on time. RoTJ - she's captured, at the mercy of the foul Jabba the Hutt, forced to wear a skimpy bikini, how will the heroes possibly  ... oh she just strangled Jabba with his own chain and has taken command of a gun to help rescue *them*. She's basically the inverse of the big scary-looking biker guy who turns out to foster orphaned kittens and cries at rom-coms, and I think that's why Leia's iconic. 

I will now hasten to say, before I get lynched by fans of every other female character from Ellen Ripley to Dora the Explorer, that there are multiple ways of doing iconic female characters, just like there are of doing male characters. George Lucas simply choose *this* particular way, and Carrie Fischer absolutely nailed her performance. 

Having Leia be traumatised by the destruction of Alderaan would have taken away from this presentation of her as a person of extraordinary will power and emotional control. Again, it's perfectly fine to have a woman character who is badass while traumatised, I love Terminator's Sarah Connor too, but there are occasionally people in actual history who have [extraordinary emotional control](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-princess-anne-escaped-armed-kidnapper-history-2023-6), so I think it's also fine to have a woman character who is both badass and extraordinary. 

In terms of the style of the movie - the OT is space opera - an exciting adventure story with some deep themes about bravery and love and some great world-building. It's not a harrowing character study of trauma and grief. I have nothing against movies that are harrowing character studies of trauma and grief, least not as long as I don't have to watch them, but that's not what the OT *is*. 

From the audience's perspective, we get that the destruction of Alderaan is bad, we get that Tarkin is evil, but all we know about Alderaan is that Leia's from there and she seems pretty cool. We, well the vast majority of us, aren't emotionally attached to Alderaan. The movie slowing down to show Leia grieving wouldn't have matched with the audience's emotions and it's the audience that the story is written for. Note how the movie spends a bit more time with Luke's grief over Obi-wan, who we the audience have spent more screen time, but then rapidly cuts back to the exciting adventure stuff. 

And I don't see how showing Leia grieving would have added to the plot. Scenes should add something to the audience's understanding of the character and their motivations, like when Luke discusses that he can't kill Vader now he knows he's his father. We know that while Leia is badass, she's not completely unemotional, she does after all react to the destruction of Alderaan in the moment, we also saw that she can be compassionate when she comforts Luke after Obi-wan's death. We know that Leia has ample motivation to be in this war. I think such a scene would be pretty generic. 

None of this is to say that you can't imagine Leia grieving off-screen, maybe she broke down in her cell and only pulled herself together when she heard Luke's footsteps outside, maybe she got counselling in the years between ANH and ESB. Go write fanfic to your heart's content, some great literature has been created that way. 

So, that's why I think the OT would be worsened by showing more of Leia grieving. CMV. "
0,2024-07-06,CMV: pedophilia by itself should not be stigmatized as much as it is.,u/nolifepclir,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dwu1yk/cmv_pedophilia_by_itself_should_not_be/,changemyview,"Now, you’re probably reading this and being like “WTF is wrong with this guy? what is he saying?” Just let me explain.

Pedophilia: Sexual attraction to Pre-pubescent children. (Puberty starts at different times, but more specifically this age range is usually 3-10 year olds) 

Notice how in that definition, no where does it say a pedophile is someone who has harmed children in any way.  And actually, a lot of child molesters *Arent* even pedophiles. Which brings me to my other point:

There are 2 types of pedophiles:

1. Someone who is sexually attracted to children but besides that is a mentally sane person with morals, and would never even come close to acting on their desires in any way.

2.  someone who is sexually attracted to children but besides that is NOT a mentally  sane person and lacks morals and  a sense of right and wrong all together, and more than likely does, or at the very least is extremely tempted to act on their desires towards children .  Such as ASPD or whatever.

Whether you like to believe it or not, there is a HUGE difference in these people. The hate that people have  for pedophiles needs to be directed towards #2. 

I am going to make another point. but please keep in mind the 2 examples are not supposed to be the same, i understand they are different but it is the closest point i can make.

Many people make the argument that Non offending pedophiles still need to be kept away from children completely. 


This is when i make this argument:

Does every straight man need to be kept away from woman purely because of his attraction? Unless he is a serial rapist, no. 

People assume that non offending pedos are just like shaking and waiting to pounce on children anytime theyre in contact with them, but that couldnt be farther from the truth. like i said. they are sane people besides that and understand consequences, their morals, etc. If a sane straight man finds a woman attractive in public, hes not a risk to raping that woman. its the same for mentally sane pedophiles. 

and ACTUALLY, pedophiles spending time with children can actually DECREASE pedophilies attractions overall..  it is assumed that this is because it humanizes children and kicks in the protective instinct to take care of them and not want to see them get harmed. 
 


My point is, Non offending pedophiles (people with sexual attraction to children who are mentally sane / not at risk of harming children) need to be less hated

0,2024-07-06,CMV: We should remove addiction from the gene pool by legalizing drugs,u/SeventeenSeventyFour,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dwujka/cmv_we_should_remove_addiction_from_the_gene_pool/,changemyview,"There is strong evidence that addiction is genetically inherited. Of course some will avoid this, but most will not. Addiction costs close to 500 billion a year in the US alone. If we add on the costs of drug prohibition, the impact on less developed nations, and its funding of terrorism, we are looking at trillions spent per year.

I would argue it makes more sense to legalize all drugs, even make them free, remove treatment services, and let those with addiction kill themselves doing what they do. Eventually the gene will disappear and the rest of us can enjoy our vices and save on taxes.

I am not interested in moral or emotional arguments for why this is not right. You can only convince me with strong arguments based on economic theory showing the benefit of fighting addiction is more cost effective than letting the trait die off."

In fact this will be the first year I’m old enough to vote and I probably won’t vote at all this election. Neither candidate really inspires me at all and neither one seems very presidential at all really.

I see a lot of fear-mongering here on Reddit about how trump is literally hitler and will try to stay in power past 2028 and it gives me similar vibes to your weird uncle who thinks dems are socialists who want to steal your money. To the point where I’m wondering how many of them are bots/trolls and how many people genuinely think this way.

I think trumps an asshole frankly but cmon. This is very boy-who-cried-wolf and regular people stopped taking the doomers seriously years ago.

I’ll address what I think people are gonna say here just so I don’t have to type the same thing over and over again.

-Jan 6: from what I know about it trump offered pelosi national guard troops to which she declined (admitted by pelosi herself), and police let the protesters inside so it’s really hard to see it as an insurrection attempt, and even if you think it was it’s a stretch to say it was instigated by trump. It sure as hell doesn’t meet the legal requirement for insitement.

-Project 2025: I’ve seen a lot about this lately but afaik it was put out by some random conservative think tank, and when trump was asked about it he said he disagreed with a lot of it and that he didn’t endorse it. If some random liberal group said that Biden should raise the tax rate to 90% I don’t think it’s fair to say that we can assume that’s his agenda.

Anyway yeah I know this is the internet and people like to exaggerate but cmon. “Last election we’ll ever have” “fascist America” like calm down with the hyperbole. CMV"

0,2024-07-06,"CMV: The Pro-Palestine movement has unambiguously adopted the ""great replacement theory"" pushed by white supremacists",u/TheFakeChiefKeef,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dwvwoq/cmv_the_propalestine_movement_has_unambiguously/,changemyview,"I'll set my perspective on the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict in very brief terms. I believe Israel should exist, I hate Netanyahu (crook, violent, bolstered Hamas, etc.) and his government, I think many of the West Bank settlements need to be abandoned in favor of building a Palestinian state, Hamas is a genocidal terrorist group, and Israel has not really ever had a partner for peace to negotiate with.

With that out of the way, I want to focus on the similarities I've seen between the Palestinian movement and the white supremacist movement in terms of what they say about Jews and about Israelis. Fundamentally, both consider Jews to be foreign interlopers, thieves of assets, property, and culture rightfully belonging to the favored group, untrustworthy, and unduly privileged. Finally, both see Jews as part of a concerted effort to replace the rightful occupants of the land with colonizing invaders.

In neither case is any of the above true. Whether you're chanting ""Jews will not replace us"" or cramming into a subway car to threaten ""zionists"" to get off, you're bought into the same extreme right wing, blood libel ideology that has required Jewish people to flee all over the world during different historical inflection points. The reason Israel exists now as it does is because Jewish people living in Europe, North Africa, elsewhere in the Middle East, Central Asia, and even the Americas in some cases felt unwelcome and unsafe because of antisemites wherever they lived. This involved both official state actors and non-state militia groups.

There are three main pieces of evidence that demonstrate my point here. They're all kind of related but carry distinct baggage. 

First, there's the false history of modern day Jews in Israel. I think this debate has been sufficiently tortured in this subreddit and other forums, so I'm going to leave this mostly vague and assume anyone commenting has some idea about what narratives I'm talking about. If not, I'm happy to discuss. 

Second, there's the [Palestinian cause's adoption of the Khazar mass conversion conspiracy theory](https://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-ashkenazi-jews-are-not-semites-hitler-killed-them-for-their-social-role/). The essence of this claim is that today's Ashkenazi Jews have no genetic or historical connection to Israel or the Levant, and originated from a mass conversion event of people from ""Khazaria,"" a historical kingdom of nomads loosely stretching from southeastern Ukraine to the Caucasus region and southern Russia. This idea conveniently both disassociates the majority of Jews worldwide from Israel and positions Ashkenazi Jews as historical invaders, of Eastern Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. It also claims that Ashkenazi Jews aren't ""real Jews."" Again, all of this sets up the whole premise of the State of Israel to be a colony of foreign invaders masquerading as natives and replacing them.

Finally, there's a very strong movement online to deny Jews/Israelis' connection to their own cuisine. Because of the history of Jewish movement around the world, Jewish cuisine is a distinct mix of Levantine, North African, Iberian, Turkish, Arabian, Persian, Eastern and Central European, and Balkan. If you follow the last 2000 years of Jewish history, Jews have constantly either (1) fully adopted and contributed to the local cuisines regardless of kosher restrictions or (2) figured out a way to develop kosher versions of the local cuisines. I often see Palestinian flag profile pictures on instagram cooking videos flooding the comments sections saying things like ""better claim this as [insert country] before the Zios steal it"" or ""how can this be Isr**li cuisine if Isr**l isn't a real place?"" or even when two people from different backgrounds (e.g., a Lebanese person and a Turkish person) arguing over who invented some variant of shawarma, both will just greet each other with ""definitely not Jewish though!"" Again, this type of rhetoric borders or crosses the line between claiming cultural appropriation and claiming that Jews are impersonating other cultures as part of a zionist conspiracy to replace natives.

The food thing really bothers me. As an American Jew who grew up somewhere with a lot of various middle eastern restaurants, you could walk into a restaurant owned by a Lebanese family and the whole place would be filled with Jews. You could walk into a Jewish deli and see Arab workers and customers in the restaurant. There's a clear affinity for certain foods shared between Jews of all backgrounds and people from the Mediterranean region and Central Asia. I have many Jewish friends whose families lived in Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, and Yemen for hundreds of years before some relatives moved to Israel while others moved to the US. Their native foods mirrored the ""local"" Arab or whatever populations constituted the majorities there.

To conclude the main point, there will never be any peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict until the global left recognizes the Palestinian movement's link to antisemitic rhetoric and refuses to mimic white supremacist ideology. You simply cannot legitimately separate Jews from Israel or any of the surrounding communities in which Jews have lived in and positively contributed to for centuries. Using great replacement theory rhetoric alienates the mainstream from the *legitimate* goals of the Palestinian movement and puts those already inclined to side with Israel uncritically into a position to double down in the face of hate. With all of the above in mind, it is exceptionally clear that the movement has adopted great replacement theory."

However, now it would appear that Russia is beginning to take the upper hand a little bit, and this raises concerns that Russia will gain momentum and break the Ukrainian frontline. Should this occur, I believe that NATO should intervene militarily and drive Russian forces back to their borders. I am not advocating we march on Moscow, as that would be overkill and would likely trigger a nuclear response. I believe this is warranted because a totalitarian nation like Russia controlling Ukraine would be a massive threat, as Ukraine is a big part of the global food supply as well as a key strategic point on the Black Sea. Additionally, if NATO does not intervene, it will encourage Russia to strike elsewhere, leading to many more European nations falling victim to totalitarianism and the weakening of democracy across Europe.

***My belief is that if there was ever a Republican president who could shift the party to a socially liberal perspective and acknowledge that America needs to find a way to collect more tax revenue, they’d be one of the most popular presidents of all time.***

For example, **federally legalizing recreational marijuana**, **capitalizing on growing legalized sports betting**, and using that tax revenue to fund social programs would attract younger and more diverse voters, broadening the party’s appeal.

Additionally, **reducing defense spending to allocate resources more effectively** would demonstrate fiscal responsibility. Addressing tax revenue realistically, particularly targeting the wealthy and corporations, would further show fairness and economic sensibility.

***This combination could forge a new, enduring coalition, ensuring both economic stability and social progress.***

By embracing these changes, Republicans could frame themselves as **innovators and heroes** for adapting to modern societal needs and economic realities. This bold shift would not only position them as forward-thinking leaders but also as champions of pragmatic solutions. Acknowledging and addressing these critical issues head-on could elevate their status as a party willing to evolve, innovate, and put the country's long-term well-being above partisan divides. This approach could redefine their legacy and inspire a new generation of voters who see them as pioneers of a more inclusive and economically stable America."

This praise of the state translates the fact that the state is subject to legal supervision into protection of the citizens from the hands of the sovereign.

The fact that the constitutional state is constrained by the law is generally thought to be a restraint on the state, because the state’s actions are subordinated to an even higher law, which keeps it in check. However, the state itself guarantees the authority of the law with its power. If, however, it is the state, and only the state, that enforces the law, then the law, and thus its substance, is also its creation. There's nothing ""higher"" about it. The alleged restriction of the state by the law is therefore not a restriction, because the law neither stands above the state, nor is the law independent of the state. Rather, the law results from its actions. Laws are not obstacles to the state, but the way the state exercises its rule over the country and its people.

Here, the state is praised for the fact that it can’t do everything one fears to a person. Something beneficial about the state is not positively emphasized, but the good thing about it is that it restricts a power that not even the state’s admirer is happy about: the state’s power to “do anything it wants” to its subjects. This praise of the constitutional state boils down to the fact that, although it could harass people according to its whims and desires, it harasses them according to certain – self-decreed! – procedures. Somewhat modest praise!

It is also suspicious that this praise of democracy comes about only by comparing it with something “much more terrible,” measuring its achievement as a civilization by what it is not: the constitutional state is compared to “arbitrary government.” If – following the assertion – all the state’s actions are not judged by law, as in the constitutional state, the subjects are mistreated according to the whims and desires of a greedy and power-hungry despot.

 This comparison is nonsense. Every form of rule – from the darkest barbarism to the ancien regime up to democracy – has its purposes, aims, and claims that it forces on the ruled population; these purposes of rule are therefore neither arbitrary, nor continually changing, nor do they constitute a despotism that has no reason other than profound evil. The constitutional state and the methods it forbids itself in exercising its rule are compared to something that does not exist; a straw man. On the other hand, the rule of law, by an absurd comparison to its mere opposite, is given an absurd definition, i.e. it is only the self-restraint of the state and nothing else – as if modern democracy does not have reasons of state from which reasons for constitutional procedures also arise.

Incidentally, democracy is no different from fascist or real socialist states in praising the rule of law. Those comparisons will not help in making the case for the constitutional state. At this point, it is noticeable that a good opinion of the state was held prior to the interest in justifying it, and the praise is owed to a biased point of view.

Anyone who praises the state for the fact that it doesn’t do “anything it wants” to its citizens is not only acknowledging that he is the subject of rule. He is self-consciously acting like the servant of rule that it has made him. The circumstance that one is subjected to rule is considered neither annoying nor criticizable, but is checked off, as if the only question is which type of rule one is to be bound under. And the appropriate answer is: the good person has finally found his proper form of rule; the citizen also has rights!

Rights do not protect the citizen from the whims of the state, but are the way the state exercises its rule. When the state orders a country and people to obey its laws and declares that it wants to judge them only in relation to the law, it documents that it does not want its exercise of rule to serve one particular interest in the society, but to stand above all interests which have to obey its law. It wants to serve the law and the order that it establishes with it."

[Article](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/01/science/effects-of-beauty-found-to-run-surprisingly-deep.html?pagewanted=1)

University professor Ellen Berscheid goes more into depth on how “looks matter” is more than just water is wet. 

“And according to Dr. Ellen Berscheid, professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, these beliefs about physically attractive people, and the preferential treatment that grows out of them, can have lasting effects on an individual's personality, social life, and educational and career opportunities.”
-people underestimate the snowball effect your looks can have on you 

“Dr. Berscheid said the importance of physical attractiveness is growing and will continue to grow as increases in geographic mobility, frequent job changes and divorce subject more people to ''onetime'' or ''few-time'' interactions with others, in which they are judged on the basis of first impressions.”
-predicted before the internet was even a thing, one swipe and you’re gone 

''Genetic determinism is anathema to Americans, who want to believe everyone is born equal, with an equal chance for a happy life,'' Dr. Berscheid remarked in an interview here. ''It's simply not so. The most important factors governing success in life are genetically determined: appearance, intelligence, sex and height.'' 

“University of Minnesota of identical twins who had been reared apart. The study, she says, is showing that ''genetically identical children turn out to be very similar even though they grow up in very different environments.''”

“College students paired as dates at a ''computer dance'' preferred others who were physically attractive; the partners' intelligence, social skills and personality had little to do with the students' reaction to their dates, a Minnesota study by Elaine Hatfield Walster and her associates showed. ''These results gave the lie to what people had said was important to them in previous studies,'' the researchers concluded.”
-textbook example of actions =\ words 

“As women become more independent socially and economically, Dr. Berscheid sees them placing a greater emphasis on the attractiveness of men, ''who are now in the 'meat market' just like women have always been.'' She cited the recent advent of male centerfolds and male nude dancers as examples of women's interests in how men look.”
-looks becomes extremely important if not the only important thing now

“The symposium brought together plastic surgeons, dentists and others who produce facial changes that often affect patients more powerfully than the functional defects they correct. Sometimes patients react badly -''with pain and bewilderment'' - to significant improvements in their appearance, Dr. Berscheid told the meeting at the University of Michigan. This reaction could result from the realization that we are not just loved for ourselves but for what we look like, she suggested.”
-this was a tough one 

“ Dr. Berscheid believes there is a hazard inherent in denying the impact of physical attractiveness: ''Unattractive children who are unpopular may wrongly attribute their lack of popularity to some flaw in their character or personality,'' she says. Such an error, she believes, could result in lasting and painful scars.”
-this was also a tough quote 

Remember this was by a female professor in Minnesota that grew up in the early forties, if this is somehow flagged as “harmful content”, well, dang.

I agree that all of this is deeply immoral. But I also believe that if you were expelled and lose the land for three generations, you should just accept it and go your own way as a nation. 

If someone else settles your territory for so long, most of the current inhabitants are already born there and see it as their home. On the other hand for you, it is the land of your fathers or grandfathers at best. People who live there now probably have stronger ties to the place than you and attacking them can only result in a cycle of perpetuated violence. Almost none of your own who actually rememberd living there is still alive after that much time. 

This obviously doesn't apply if you are colonized, but still live in the respective country. If you were however kicked out from the territory completely, it is necessary to just accept it after some time. 

Countries which accept their territorial losses usually tend to fare much better. From the 20th century as an examples Finland, Romania or Germany swallowed the bitter pill, ended the vicious cycle and thrive now as a result. On the other hand examples like Palestine or Armenia show to how dark ends the opposite decision  typically leads. "

I think Powell is the more consistent composer of the two. He has completely figured his style out and does what he loves and does it great, at the same time that he is more creative in his scores for no reason. He was Zimmer and Williams apprentice, so he used what he learned from both in his works, he can write memorable themes with complex instrumentation like Williams and at the same time be versatile like Zimmer, and is not afraid to change genres and use unusual instrumentations. He somehow seems to seamlessly go both with and at the same time against the 21th century way of scoring, making great use of the old Hollywood mannerisms, he twists them into a new modern way that is distinct and unique."

Multiple studies also back up the claim that the extreme cold/cold snaps have historically killed more humans than the recent extreme heat felt globally.

This is not to say that nothing should be done to mitigate the Greenhouse effect by cutting down on both carbon and methane emissions, but I think people would be hard pressed to know that they are exaggerated when they say that the recent man made global warming felt is much worse than the natural catastrophe that was the Ice Age when cold snaps were a lot more common.

For example, making headway in decreasing digital surveillance through some policy directed at smartphones would not have a lasting effect on human privacy or dignity. The techno-industrial system marches towards complete surveillance through various means. Even if there was a ban on any particular mode of surveillance, it would innovate in others. The system would seek the same ends through the implementation of ubiquitous cameras, microphones, or propaganda campaigns that nudge the population in the desired direction. 

The objective factor here is the techno-industrial system which produces and utilizes the means of surveillance. Without tackling the technology problem, human dignity, freedom, and autonomy can never be restored.

Biden is supposed to be a man for the working man even if he is old and his health is failing but people say, their (liberals) policies are inefficient, bureaucratic and don't work.

Trump oth., is cruel, crude and volatile but he is a shrewd businessman who will do a better job of dealing with the inefficiencies of bureaucracy, however their policies (the right) are outdated and incompetent

Now if Biden won the election, it will be more of the same things as his first term and people will sort of be sad that we don't have a more dynamic leader and will simply ignore things for the most part and probably get frustrated. Under Biden some issues will get better and others will get worse and at the end of 4 years, the US debt will still be really high, people will still pay more taxes than billionaires and industry will continue to do well as it always has so not much will change. Perhaps the right wing extremists will feel less empowered and geo politically the US will be seen as a democratic power. 

If Trump won the election, it will be chaos and everybody will be focusing on Trump as he will be the center of attention. However Trump will still fail to do any good since he doesn't have the patience and his strong arming tactics will only backfire most of the time. Things might get better at the beginning in some areas and in some other areas they will get worse until he is once again impeached a second time. In the meantime, the US debt will probably become even higher under Trump, the billionaires will get even more rich and the jobs and industry will be distracted by him but will continue to trend just the same as they were under Biden.

Either way, the election outcome would simply not matter. You could tell me Trump is far more dangerous and he will create a dictatorship, but that is not really likely in a democracy such as the US. Biden's team may pass some creative and strong policies that will make a big difference but that again is very unlikely. So there you have it.

I'm well aware this could just be some sort of bias, but I've been noticing it a LOT more recently, especially on Reddit and Twitter, with people being completely against compromise in anything that they deem to be important.

You could argue that, technically, everyone has something to hide, but I'm using the word ""hide"" in a bit of a different way; they usually hide in their true selves and what they really think, masquerading as some morally high figure, just to convince other people--or themselves--that they are a good person, and that they are on the right side of history.

All of these styles are vastly different, and I enjoy playing and listening to some more than others, but for each of them I can recognise the appeal for why a musician might be attracted to them and want to work in that field. 

What I appreciate most about modern music is its fluidity. I am both a songwriter as well as a jazz performer, and with both of those pursuits I find the most joy out of the creation of something new. Even though I take inspiration from musicians of the past, when I play music I pride myself in being original and actually creating something. 

Contrasting this is how classical music is treated in todays world. Classical musicians are encouraged to replicate pieces written hundreds of years ago, rather than add anything original. I can’t understand as why as someone pursuing an artistic field, either as a job or a hobby, you would restrict yourself to imitation rather than creation. 

Imagine if you were a painter, however rather than painting anything original, you instead just tried to paint the mona lisa as accurately as possible over and over. I find classical musicians to the same thing, instead of improvising and creating their own music, they simply try to replicate music as it was written hundreds of years ago. 

Personally, I can’t make sense of why anyone with a genuine passion for music would become a classical musician.

While opposites may initially be exciting because they push you to experience something new in the (hopefully positive) framework of a relationship, eventually the juxtaposition leads to annoyance. From annoyance you build resentment until the relationship is finally broken off. The high of opposite pairing is not for everyone and seldom lasts.

Ex. Complementary: Person A is quiet but opinionated while Person B is more social *yet* maintains similar opinions as Person A. Person A benefits from help with socializing and Person B has a calm safespace on their partner.

As a sociologist I’ve been studying on how different regimes have formed and essentially how we’ve gotten to the place we are today. I myself am truly a fan of conflict theory. While I don’t have the answers to how we can progress this country for the better through civilized means, I do know how we can get efficient results at a cost. 

Nobody wants to admit that United States is a country paved off the blood of conquest, slavery, pure violence. Instead, we paint the picture that this country is this perfect place where everybody is able to act out their goals and dreams without much restriction. While that’s somewhat true, we have a tendency to forget the dark history this country has. Unsurprisingly, due to recent times those in power have tried to rewrite history time and time again to forget the sins that their forefathers & ancestors have caused. We’ve grown blind of the history we’ve come from, hence why we are forever going to be doomed to repeat it at some point in which I see said point coming to realization sooner rather than later.

We are now in more modern times where there’s consequences to actions of said violence. In the past, people have ransacked cities & towns, assassinated presidents or large figureheads, and even created groups whose sole purpose is to commit nothing but acts of attrition to others. But we are since beyond that time now. However, in observation of the recent events that have transpired since 2020 till now, this has led me to believe that we might as well be back on track to our old ways. We will not see true change unless we go back to the dark ways even if briefly. The left and right continuously try to put their beliefs on us forcibly, and we are forced to change regime after regime with no real true change coming. It’s been in a stalemate. Of course, I’m not going to edge people to actively go on the streets and commit acts of violence in order to cause a reaction, no. What I am saying is at some point in time we will go back to the ways of violence. The George Floyd protests that eventually turned to riots caused change. January 6 insurrection caused change. The murder of JFK caused change. The Civil War caused change. If we need to cause change politics wise in order to achieve what we as a country need to progress forward, then we must take our power back from those who view all of us as mere sheep to be guided to the slaughterhouse of their own desires. I dare say It’s time that we make use of our second amendment rights. But once again, I’m not edging anybody to go out and commit violence. I’m simply saying, we will eventually go back to those ways, and the clock to that day continuously gets closer to that day."

As such, the idea of free will is merely an illusion. From our thoughts and decisions to our actions and outcomes, everything is predetermined by a complex web of causality stretching back to the beginning of time.

Neuroscientific studies have shown that our brains make decisions before we are consciously aware of them, suggesting that our sense of making free choices is just a trick of the mind. Additionally, considering the laws of physics, every particle and event in the universe follows a deterministic path, leaving no room for true randomness or free will.

While I have been taught the good and bad of Israel throughout my life I have only been looking into a lot of one state solution movements this past year. While I have always seen it as a dumb idea, the more I research the grand plan the more I ask myself what the heck? It seems most people proposing the idea hope for a secular democracy where everyone gets rights which would be better than the real outcome but I feel all you have to do is a little bit of digging to know how unlikely that is to be the final result. 
When you consider the current and historical situations with the Middle East and Judaism it is pretty evident on why this won’t work. The sad truth is that the ideologies that flow through Israel and Palestine are so different that people existing together peacefully is just impossible. While Israel is not a perfect country in any way it still has many values and rights that I fear will be lost if the whole area becomes one state. Palestine sadly operates under a system of Shira law. I’m guessing that most people know that it is one of the most undemocratic ways to run a nation and the idea that democracy can magically exist when you combine your state with a nation with those ideologies is quite insane. While most Palestinian civilians are good people most still hold a distain for Jews, especially for those who live in Israel. Because of that I fear that Jews will quickly become a target and we will be displaced and killed. Keep in mind that other Arab nations have done that to Jews before so we have a reason to be scared. Overall I sadly see this as a one way ticket to another major disaster in the long history of Judaism and it will take a good bit to change my mind. While I do want peace myself I don’t see a one state solution as a path to that in any way. Still if you disagree I would love to hear your opinion and reasoning for why things can work! "
1060,2024-07-07,CMV: It is wrong to refuse service to Israeli tourists solely due to their nationality.,u/LivinAWestLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dx9e4e/cmv_it_is_wrong_to_refuse_service_to_israeli/,changemyview,"There was a video uploaded to r/PublicFreakout and various other subreddits purportedly showing a restaurant in Vietnam having a confrontation with an Israeli tourist. While I agree his behaviour in the video and the context behind it paints him as being a bad-faith actor, I was somewhat and disturbed by the sentiment shown in the comments.

A lot of people in Israel are against the continuation of the war. In fact, there have been constant protests against Netanyahu and his government for prioritising it over other means of freeing the hostages. It should go without saying that not all citizens supp kj
Itbzl
G  ort the actions of their government. This is true everywhere, whether in Russia, China, or any other dictatorship like Iran or Saudi Arabia. Many of which commit even worse human right abuses and are rightfully condemned. Would it be right to discriminate against a tourist from such a country? No, and even if they are in support of their government tons of tourists with objectionable views are served regularly without any problems.

If the tourist was the aggressor and had incited the confrontation it would be right to refuse service to him. But the comments heavily plied that it would be correct to refuse service to all Israelis. I cannot see this as anything other than discrimination based on nationality. It might not be racist as nationality aren’t races, but it would certainly be wrong. And when criticizing someone for their (geo)political beliefs, one should not extend their criticism to all members of a nationality or religion. “Fuck Israel” is often heard due to the actions of Netanyahu’s government, but “Fuck Gaza” is never said even though the comparably vile Hamas is in control of Gaza. To me both would be too blunt.

0,2024-07-07,CMV: President Biden should appoint 3-6 Supreme Court Justices to balance the court and test the Immunity ruling.,u/rokkitmaam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxa5qn/cmv_president_biden_should_appoint_36_supreme/,changemyview,"President Biden should issue an executive order to temporarily install 3-6 Supreme Court justices. By leveraging the new Presidential ""Official Acts"" ruling, Biden would test the checks and balances of the U.S. government, ensuring a more balanced judiciary and promoting accountability within the Senate.

The Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity has sparked significant debate about the extent of executive power. According to this ruling, presidents enjoy full immunity from criminal charges for their official acts but not for unofficial acts. This landmark decision emphasizes the need for a clear delineation of presidential authority and accountability ([Politifact, 2024](https://www.wusf.org/courts-law/2024-07-02/politifact-fl-scotus-immunity-ruling-trump-cases-future-presidents-2024-elections)) ([Wikipedia, Presidential immunity in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_immunity_in_the_United_States)). By using this ruling, President Biden could install additional justices, presenting a temporary measure to counterbalance the court's current ideological tilt.

The Senate would then be required to address the appointments. This would necessitate removing the filibuster, a procedural hurdle that has often blocked significant legislative action. The filibuster has been criticized for stifling discourse and preventing meaningful debate on crucial issues ([Wikipedia, Filibuster in the United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate)). By agreeing to remove the filibuster, the Senate would open itself to a more dynamic and transparent process of judicial review, thus holding the Supreme Court justices accountable. Historically, the Senate has been reluctant to hold the court accountable, partly due to the constraints imposed by the filibuster. Removing the filibuster would facilitate a more open and honest debate about the judiciary's role and the Senate's responsibility in maintaining a balanced government ([Wikipedia, Filibuster in the United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate)).

Temporarily adding justices would balance the Supreme Court along ideological lines. If this measure is not challenged, the court would serve as a proper check against presidential overreach in future rulings. This balancing act would also mitigate the threat posed by future presidents who might attempt to exploit their powers unchecked, as was a concern with former President Trump ([Yahoo News, 2024](https://news.yahoo.com/news/presidential-immunity-extends-official-acts-155447033.html)). If the measure is challenged, it would highlight the flaws in the current system, potentially paving the way for more permanent reforms.

We are navigating unprecedented times, with the President endowed with extraordinary powers. To address these challenges, bold actions are required. President Biden's move to add justices would not only rein in the court but also demonstrate his commitment to maintaining checks and balances within the government. This action would be a significant step in securing his re-election by showing decisive leadership in a time of crisis.

Is this proposal an overreach? According to the current Supreme Court rulings, it is within the President's rights to take such actions. Biden may have reservations about this measure, but it presents a powerful opportunity to enhance democratic security. By temporarily adding justices, the President would reinforce the principles of checks and balances, ensuring that the judiciary serves as an effective counterbalance to executive power. This approach invites a necessary dialogue about the roles and responsibilities of each branch of government in upholding democracy.

In summary, this proposal offers a pathway to restoring balance and accountability in the U.S. government. It challenges the status quo while respecting the foundational principles of the democratic system, making it a bold yet necessary step in these unprecedented times.

However CSAM has actual victims involved and  there's a widespread stigma and recognition of it being wrong and the fact that even viewership and possession (both are often synonymous legally) increases the growth of the industry , would policies used against drug users and producers such as longer prison sentences and registries as well as post sentence restrictions work to curb the supply and demand of CSAM ?

Throwaway account since I don’t want this to be on my main account.

I scroll through the bisexual sub and I hear cases of people coming out to their wifes/husbands as bisexual and them reacting badly to it. But I question, what even is the point? If you feel like they’re going to react bad to it, why would you make that choice? And this isn’t me defending biphobia at all, as they should be supported. It’s just… they’re in a heterosexual relationship. They don’t necessarily need to come out as bisexual in the first place. If you know it’s going to end badly, why still do it? It doesn’t make sense to me in the slightest.

Now before you say that I’m justifying bisexuals being in relationships with biphobics, that’s not what I’m trying to do. I’m just saying that coming out to someone as bisexual in a heterosexual relationship is not required and there is always a risk that your partner is biphobic and breaks up with you. I don’t think that’s a risk that should be explored.

I apologize if I come off as biphobic but I just want someone to explain to me why would you potentially come out as bisexual to your partner in a heterosexual, knowing the risks it comes with it.

Within a ten year span you had the primes everyone from Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, The Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, Otis Redding, The Ronettes, Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, The Who, Bob Dylan, Jefferson Airplane, Creedence Clearwater, The Doors, The Beach Boys, The Byrds, The Monkees, Simon & Garfunkel, the Supremes **(they were arguably one of if not the greatest girl group of all time)** Van Morrison, Velvet Underground, The Monkees, Dave Clark Five, Sam Cook, Buffalo Springfield, Miles Davis, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson and so many other greats that I can’t possibly try to name them all. 

I mean seriously name me a song from the last 30 years that you consider better than Purple Haze. **The Day a mainstream artist nowadays can play guitar with their teeth and write a song as surreal as Angel is the day I take all of this back.**

The sixties had so many albums that had a massive impact like rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper's, Highway 61 Revisited, Pet Sounds **(Which imo is better than almost any album released this century)**, Eletric Ladyland, In a silent way, Oddessey and Oracle etc…etc... 

All of those albums were either building on each other’s innovations, or they did things that nobody else did before or since and that most artists nowadays can’t come close to mimicking.
I genuinely can’t think of any other era that had such a great amount of iconic music in such a short span of time. Not to mention Compared to the 80s and 90s most music from the 60s actually holds up, even compared to music released last year it still sounds fresh

At the same time you have some incredible movies like the good the bad and the ugly, the graduate, the og planet of the apes, how the west was won, fistfull of dollars, psycho, the og James Bond movies and so many others, now the effects might not hold up as well but the way they told stories is arguably superior to what we have now since they had to make up for the limits of what they could actually achieve with special effects.

0,2024-07-07,CMV: The ICJ did find that genocide was plausible in Gaza,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxjafv/cmv_the_icj_did_find_that_genocide_was_plausible/,changemyview,"To preface, this post is not about if there is or isn’t a genocide going on in Gaza. It’s about interpreting the rulings of the International Court of Justice. 

About two months ago, the Ex-President of the ICJ (who was President at the time of the initial January provisional order) made a [statement](https://youtu.be/bq9MB9t7WlI?si=OVrn2X85x-Hw7D8e) that, *“the court decided that the Palestinians had a plausible right to be protected from genocide, and that South Africa had the right to present that claim in the court,…it did not decide… that the claim of genocide was plausible….”*

While many seem to have taken this statement as a write off of a case for genocide being viewed as a plausibility of the conflict by the court, I think that is view is itself a misunderstanding. 

This is because it appears that the plausibility of the rights is itself connected to the prospect of violations of said rights. 

Judge Bhandari noted, *”the widespread nature of the military campaign in Gaza, as well as the loss of life, injury, destruction and humanitarian needs following from it [sic] are by themselves capable of supporting a plausibility finding with respect to rights under Article II.”* 

If the “plausibility finding” only applied to the rights on paper, this statement by Bhandari is nonsense. As would be his statement that *”As part of its decision on whether to grant provisional measures, the Court must, in weighing the plausibility of the rights whose protection is claimed, consider such evidence as is before it... In particular, it must, in this case, take into account the widespread destruction in Gaza and loss of life that the population of Gaza has thus far endured.”*

As a further example of what I mean, in a case brought under the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (ICSFT) and CERD, Ukraine requested the Court to indicate several provisional measures aimed at ordering Russia to prevent terrorist financing. After observing that the ICSFT applies to financing only where there is intention or knowledge that funds will be used for terrorist acts, the Court observed that Ukraine had the right but that Ukraine *”ha[d] not put before the Court evidence which affords a sufficient basis to find it plausible that these elements are present”.* These elements were *“intention or knowledge…and the element of purpose specified…”*. 

Since these were absent in Ukraine, I.e, they couldn’t prove Russia was actually doing anything to violate the rights the court acknowledged they had, the court rejected an issuance of provisional orders as *“the conditions required for the indication of provisional measures in respect of the rights alleged…[were] not met”.*

Applying this to the situation in Gaza, it appears to that the court is only issuing orders in relations to the rights as a result of the rights having genuine potential to actively be violated.

And to me this just makes sense. It’s not as though the court would allow every case on the basis of each state involved simply having the right. That would essentially mean, as an example, Canada could take the US to court for genocide and the court would issue orders on the basis of the party involved having the right. 

Even the Ex-ICJ president in that very interview acknowledged a “real risk” to the rights in question which is itself a statement in regard to plausibility.  

Perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the this topic, it wouldn’t surprise me as international law is very intricate, but from what I’ve gathered, the plausibility of the rights is itself connected to the prospect of violations of said rights. Orders and actions are not taken by the court purely on the basis of rights on paper.

Every math class I had from grades 6-12 (2009-2016) went the same way: go over homework, notes on new concept, start homework before class ends, then finish homework at home. Rinse and repeat. We were given study guides the day before a test to work on and it wasn’t teacher guided. 

Of course, not everyone learns that way. In *MY* experience, the first two years I taught high school the older teachers did the traditional route I listed above. Us newer teachers tried to incorporate activities (even though those 14-16 yo were too cool for school). And many of my students struggled with foundational concepts, so I decided to take a leap of faith and teach middle school math.

Yes middle schoolers are a lot more energetic and wild than high schoolers, but I did try to have some fun lessons. When introducing 3d shapes to 7th grade I was able to get play-doh and let them build the shapes themselves.

This past year I taught 6th grade and I’ve never had so much fun teaching in my life. I had my students use square tile manipulatives, cuisenaire rods, dry erase boards, lucky charms cereal, dice, fraction tiles, math balance scale, and probably more. There was a discovery activity we did when given the diameter and circumference of a set of circles, they discovered pi. There’s even a series on YouTube called Sir Circumference I played as well. Math Antics on YouTube was also played once a week in my class. Notes were short and were guided, fill in the blank notes. Walking into my classroom you could see matching cards, partner work, group work, stations, trashketball, etc.
Homework was 1-2 IXLs and a worksheet, with the IXLs assigned on Monday and graded on Friday.
Math class was NOT fun like this when I was growing up. 

More and more math classes are shifting this way, with it being more visual, hands on, and showing the “why” behind how things work. I think if more of us millennials and older were taught like this, less would not dislike math as much as they do today. 

If you have any kids, nieces/nephews, little cousins, godchildren, or just kids that you’re around, just know there are math teachers like me out there trying to make learning math a better experience for the kids. "

Not all, but a large portion do from my personal experience. I'm not saying that critique is bad, it is very important and very needed when making anything including making fiction such as,stories,worldbuilding, characters, ect.

There are some genuine good faith criticisms of people pointing at the flaws to help you make something better out of what you have. But a lot of times it boils down to “i personally dont like it” where a person says that they don't like the product because it's not what THEY personally would enjoy.

What do I mean?

Let's say you cook a steak, and ask others for advice and critique to make the steak better.

Someone says they don't like it, you ask why for possible improvements.

“I like pizza more, you should make it like pizza”

…this is not advice, this is not helpful critique, this is someone saying they don't like something you have because it's not what THEY enjoy and you should change it to something THEY like. This is not helpful because it's not improving what I have, but wanting it to be different completely for their own enjoyment.

This is really common really from what I've seen. A Lot of people can look at what you have and give solid critiques to help improve it, and some are…like that.

I don't know if im saying this correctly, or if i'm not making sense, but that's a feeling i've had for a while when asking for help for story telling and world building. Am i correct in that assesment? And if so, do yall have experience of that?

And before the dickriders show up, this Soulslike games have existed for a while so relax please. 

Whenever I'm fighting an enemy it feels like I'm compensating for how God awfully and awkward my character moves instead of focusing on the enemy itself. I notices a boss is doing this and I want to act accordingly, but my character moves so painfully bad it makes the game more difficult and I have to compensate for this.

When Trump was elected, many of these same people, including members of Congress, called for Trumps removal, under the 25th Amendment.

When Joe Biden was campaigning for president, his ""gaffe's"" were dismissed by democrats. Excuses were made, calling it a ""stuttering"" problem. Even though he showed no ""stuttering"" problem in earlier speeches and campaigns. Everything was dismissed and swept under the carpet, by democrats and the news media.

As Biden became worse, he continued to fumble his words, make lying and wildly inaccurate claims, had to have the stairs to Air Force One lowered, so he could walk up them without falling. The rumbling continued about his mental competency to be president. Then that clusterfuck of a debate occurred which, for most people, cemented the fact Joe Biden is seriously mentally impaired to be president. In fact, so much so, even high level democrats are calling for him to step down.

Now, if this had been Donald Trump, acting mentally the way Joe Biden has been acting, there would be screams for his removal of office, under the 25th Amendment. It would be on front page news, everyday, all day, nationally and internationally.

The mere fact Biden is not mentally capable of being president and the fact it was glossed over, just goes to show how biased the people of the US are, however, mort importantly, how biased the news media is. Have a ""D"" after your name and the news media looks away and sweeps things under the carpet. Have an ""R"" after your name, and the news media is like a pack of snarling/snapping wolves."

France was seen as one of  the countries where it would happen with the leader of the national rally Marie Lepen, well the elections have just finished and she lost.

 The major assumption a lot of this far right rise narritive was based on was that the corporate elites would side with the far right to avoid letting the left win, the opposite happened. Macron's central neoliberal party withdrew 200 candidates and endorsed the socialist block candidates gaining the socialist block 200 new seats.

This seems like and unthinkable move but it lines up with what I was saying, that being that the current corporate elites are genuine when they say they oppose fascism and racism. so much so they are willing to pay more in taxes or comply with more regulations to stop racism.

I think this is a good thing obviously but it's true.

everyone thought the far right won, I saw all sorts of the sky is falling rhetoric and ironic marie lepen girlboss memes and it means nothing now.

Even if Marie Lepen did win I would be correct because she is a grifter and her party isn't that radical.

People bring up girogia Meloni winning in Italy but I say what about her ?

Meloni proves my point, she is not winning again because she isn't doing anything. I don't know enough about European politics, I think that she was a grifter from the outset and her apologist think that she in her heart wants to do the things she promised but the powers that be whoever they might be won't let her.

I don't know and either way doesn't matter to me. If Lepen wins it will be the same thing, she will whine about migration and do nothing while Black chads live like kings in France at the expense of her cuck voters.

immigration is never going back down, it never will. The powers that be won't let it. Doing so would require violating international law and or the EUCR rules and no EU country on their own is powerful enough to break international law and get away with it.

the far right have a time limit though, that being demographics.

White people are the only ones who are going to vote for Lepen who's big promises center around immigration, well white people tend to be old and no have kids, combine that with already high immigration and the left making immigration and citizenship even easier then the far right is cooked.

this was realistically speaking the NR's best chance at winning and they lost."

Recent events show him clearly unfit mentally and perhaps completely incapacitated. 

1. Joe Biden believes that he is cognitively well and will only step down ""[if the 'Lord Almighty' told him to](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-dismisses-concerns-mental-fitness-hed-drop-lord/story?id=111695174)."" Essentially stating the impossible and that he will not step down. So I am ruling that one out. (This is also proving his dissociation with reality. )

  
2. First Lady's have historically had great power over whether their husband will run again.  Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Bird Johnson. [See here](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/jill-biden-s-momentous-choice/ar-BB1pvORb).

3. Not to mention that when presidents become incapacited, their wives end up acting as president: [Edith Wilson. ](https://www.si.edu/object/siris_sil_1081867)Jill Biden knows this, and her biography suggests that she would not be interested in that. She has stayed clear of politics beyond the realm of any other recent first lady. She does not seem to be motivated by money or power but instead generosity. she is a education major, special needs specialist

  
4. Only Jill Biden and Joes close advisors can speak with the president in any meaningful way. One former Biden aide told[ Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/05/biden-staffs-white-house-dnc-campaign-miserable-2024): ""Annie, Ashley and Anthony create a protective bubble around POTUS. He's staffed so closely that he's lost all independence. POTUS relies on staff to nudge him with reminders of who he's meeting, including former staffers and advisers who Biden should easily remember without a reminder from Annie.""

5.

",u/godlike_hikikomori,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxy3k6/cmv_therapy_wont_help_men_much_in_society_and/,changemyview,"I used to think myself that all men needed was some cognitive behavioral therapy to no longer feel chronically sad or depressed, but I've been realizing slowly that life has just been getting materially tougher and structurally lonelier for people in most developed countries for the past few decades, in general( for both men and women). It's getting to the point where a lot of men, especially young men, find it increasingly hard to meet the social and economic expectations of women at a time when median cost of housing is astronomical, and when there is a lack of walkable neighborhoods, community, & free time for genuine relationships/friendships. This is all the while when the average women have increased their upward mobility, in terms of salary especially in the healthcare and management fields. I see lots of female nurses, dentists, and manager making well over 70K. This is progress, and I do believe that this trajectory should continue to make sure there is equal opportunity for both men and women. However, what has not seemed to change are women's standards when it comes to their partners. The average women always have tended to want to have a partner who at least makes more than them. This becomes a societal problem when a lot of the jobs that pay over 70K are really just available for the exceptional and well- connected segment(maybe 5-10%) of the population. Not every man is going to be that smart above average individual making well over 70K, leaving more and more men feeling alienated and yearning more for genuine relationships with the opposite sex.



Lately, what really led me down this path of thinking was when I watched a really poignant take ""Why Men Think Suicide is the Solution"" by the well known psychiatrist Dr.Alok Kanojia on Youtube. It really shed a tear in my eye. For the first time in a long time, I felt like someone truly understood the social blight that young men face. A concerning statistic he pointed out is that lot of the lonely and depressed men he consults with nowadays don't actually have mental illnesses( pathologies of the mind). What's happening now is a lot of men objectively and rationally are seeing their lives as not worth living and fruitless when it comes to meeting the social and economic expectations that appear less and less out of reach for them by the year. And, there's also no telling what the labor market disruptions via AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) are going to do to the job prospects of both men and women in the next 5-10 years.

So, please. For all the women out here in this subreddit, please try to understand from the men's perspective just how much harder it is becoming in meeting social and economic expectations. Just imagine being in their shoes, being called ""losers and crazy people"" just because they fell short in life. 

What most of them need isn't therapy, but a mix of healthy personal motivation and real societal help. Everyone has both good and bad aspects to them, and their economic successes alone should not define who they are as people. I believe that communication, commitment, & open mindedness are very crucial traits that should be valued in relationships , and they should be valued on a two-way street basis.



There are simply lots of young men who really do feel like losers right now. And, I don't think this economic and social trend will help women down the line either. As they are collectively making more money and are aging into their 30s-40s, they will likely find themselves to have a lot less options romantically and to feel more lonely since less men in their 20s have met their economic and social expectations. In short, this will only worsen the loneliness epidemic that we all face, especially in the years during and after the COVID pandemic and/or lockdowns.



I'm open to any additional insights or anything that challenges my rationale, regarding the state of male loneliness and the loneliness epidemic as a whole."
0,2024-07-07,CMV: Having Kids is Selfish and here is why that is ,u/raggedyyew,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxy6lh/cmv_having_kids_is_selfish_and_here_is_why_that_is/,changemyview,"I am convinced that having kids is inherently selfish and here are my takes as to why that is.

I am a high functioning autistic person but growing up I was a slow learner, as it was inherited from my Mom, Grandma (My Mom's Mom) and my Dad's Mom (My other Grandma). There are instances to I wish I wasn't Autistic and a slow learner, as people have been dismissive to my weaknesses and just assumed that I could do anything. It sucks that there won't ever be a cure for Autism as I have to accept that fact that I do have it.

I have chosen not to have kids, as I worry I will pass on my Autism to them or they could be severely Autistic and have a range of issues to suffer from. Do people not worry about this and not really be thinking about a chance that their child or children could end up on the Spectrum?.

Now people can be dismissive or brush things off by saying well anything can be selfish or that as humans we are supposed to reproduce. Like people say all the time ""Don't Shop, Adopt"" when it comes to pets and animals but yet we don't apply the same logic, when it comes to children and babies already in the foster care/orphanage systems.

 My point being is that people need to start be thinking about the ramifications of having children when it's a big gamble to procreate and they could have Autism or grow up to be a serial killer or worse. People are selfish because THEY WANTED to have kids. You are passing down genes that can be shitty and give your child a life full of depression and sadness because of any condition.

I know that if someone tells you that the poor can't have children, you will definitely think that this is a violation of the human rights of the poor. Especially for those from Europe and the United States, you will think that my thoughts are very extreme.



But I hope you think about it carefully. Do you think that the children of the poor are human beings? The children of the poor suffer many troubles brought by poverty since childhood, so are the children of the poor worthy of care? Are only their parents considered human beings, and the poor children themselves are not human beings?



The children of the poor will suffer troubles that the children of the rich will not suffer from the day they are born. The children of the poor need to help their parents work and save money to go to college. They can't eat good food and live in a big room. And so on, I don't need to list them one by one, because I don't believe that I am the only one in the world who was born to poor parents. If you were also born in a poor family, you must understand what I am talking about.



What kind of life do the children of the poor live? I come from a Chinese working-class family. I have liked computers since I was a child. My childhood dream was to be a programmer. When I was in middle school, I just made MODs for some games on an old computer. I was completely self-taught, no one taught me. Later, I wanted to make an independent game, and I needed a computer with slightly better performance. I asked my parents to buy a computer, which cost about $700.



Then my father slapped me and told me that I should study hard instead of thinking about playing games.



Why did my father beat me?



Was it because I was a bad student? In fact, my academic performance has always been very good. When I say very good, I mean I was the first or second in the whole grade. I ranked in the top 0.5% of the college entrance examination in China, and there were 10 million people taking this exam.



Was it because $700 was too much? $700 is indeed not a small amount of money, but $700 is only his monthly salary, not the money that can be saved by working hard for a lifetime.



The only reason my father beat me was that he was poor. He didn't have money in his pocket, but also in his head. He was just a factory worker who didn't know what a computer could be used for, so he was poor all his life, and he has been dragging me down.



I am not here to share how miserable my childhood was. I just want to use my story to tell you that poor parents have no knowledge, no wealth, and the most they can do is ""not to burden their children."" However, most poor parents cannot do this. In fact, poor parents will ""intentionally"" or ""unintentionally"" burden their children.



If you still think that poor parents can have children after hearing this, then I would like to ask you a few questions:



If you were asked to choose, would you like to be born in Africa or Europe?



Would you like to be born in Italy or Switzerland?



Would you like to be born in a worker's family or a doctor's family?



I think you have the answer in your heart. You know very well how terrible it is to be born in a poor family. But you hypocritically support poor parents to have children. Do you know that your behavior is harming those poor children? You are all hypocrites.



I am about to graduate from college, but I still don't have a high-performance computer. I didn't choose computer science. In fact, my childhood dream of ""being a programmer"" can only be a dream. I don’t want to say how pitiful I am, but I do think every day that if I were born into a doctor’s family or a factory owner’s family, my fate would definitely be very different."

0,2024-07-08,CMV: Liberals care more about use of the term 'inflation' than they do about inflation itself,u/Shamus248,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dy2u7t/cmv_liberals_care_more_about_use_of_the_term/,changemyview,"So the cost of consumer goods has visibly skyrocketed in recent years. U.S. inflation in 2021-22 saw its highest increases since the early 80s. Gas, eggs, milk, you name it; everything is more expensive than it used to be. And working class people are really struggling. This is on top of rising interest rates, rising credit card debt, and more

In my experience, across various social media platforms, conservatives' response to this is a mixture of lamenting that they can't afford basic groceries anymore (perfectly valid complaint) and putting all of that at the feet of Joe Biden. Now, I despise Biden, believe he's too old and unfit, and won't be voting for him. But we all know he didn't wave a magic wand and make prices go up overnight.

When liberals talk about this issue (again, going off my own experience), they get VERY caught up in the use of the word 'inflation.' They clarify that this is actually ""corporate greed"", that corporations are artificially raising prices. I don't summarily disagree with this, but they seem to be, as mentioned, caught up in clarifying that ""its not really inflation"", and often express no sensitivity or empathy to the people being hit hard by this corporate greed/inflation/whatever you wanna call it

So, my questions are: what is the legislative solution to this corporate greed/inflation/whatever? Sweeping tax increases on the 1%? Massive redistribution of wealth? Keep in mind, we had a presidential candidate (Bernie Sanders) arguing for these things to one extent or another, and the DNC *rigged 2 primaries against him*.

So what are the legislative solutions? And why is the use of the term 'inflation' more of a sore point than the inflation itself?"

Alot of people are rejoicing, saying that a miracle happened and it was a surprise loss, even claiming that voters were ""tired"" of the far right (although they never even been in government).

Now I understand why people are happy. Frankly, even I don't want a bunch of radical racists in power. However, saying it's a surprise victory is such a long shot. First of all, the two main coalitions (liberals and left) banded together to basically sabotage the RF by withdrawing their third place candidates. This means that they could consolidate both liberal and left votes in a constituency against the RF, which I find smart but very unfair (and stupid, it will probably cause a hung parliament in France).

Secondly, if you look at the popular vote, most far right voters still voted the far right candidates in the second round (there were 10 million votes in both the first and second round of voting for the RF). This means that the support that the RF had never waivered, it's just that they lost because the votes on the other side consolidated. In fact, the votes for the Liberals and the Left parties decreased (probably because their supporters didn't want the other party to win since their candidate withdrew anyway)."

If this occurs, Russia will dock at Washington State and Oregon. The Chinese will dock along the Californian coastline. The Blues will try to make a stand, but the Reds will destroy them from the rear. China will embargo Taiwan, like a Caesar with Vercingetorix, as they continue their armada to the West Coast. This embargo will halt and limit US trade and create chaos—even more of an incentive to justify coming to the President's aid. The US military will be fractured here because those aligned to their commander-in-chief and others wish to make a stand. This will come down to the subjective reasoning as to why they entered the military. The other Asian nations will condemn with strong words to cease fighting and perhaps join UN peacekeeping. Australia and Canada will go through elections as their main distractions. They will join peacekeeping forces to maintain order in war-torn cities across the US. Of course. Britain may be called upon by the Blue for the East Coast stand, but the French will see that that doesn't occur. Europe may be sparked by this confrontation. The US-Mexican war will kick off again in 2026 (180 years since it first kicked off). The more conservative states in Latin America may go against Mexico, or the latter may negotiate, especially if Russian and Chinese firepower assist the Red militias.

Some may say they’re lost but still, they’re considered to be Jews cos of their ancestry and cultural affiliation which doesn’t necessarily involve worshipping Yahweh.

Depending on whether a country finds itself under political heat for the consequences of its founding or not, we will ignore or intentionally honor its roots. We cannot truly and fully discredit the generational fruits of settler colonialism, such as access to habitable land, generational wealth and military security/acumen - so long as some of the most successful countries in the world today continue to stand.

  
We need to develop consensus that INTEGRATION between fundamentally oppositional communities is the long-term answer to deeply-rooted divisions. This integration can take place on various levels, along racial lines, or religious ones, whatever it is that creates the opposition, needs to be braided together to create a whole new community. 

  
The United States has been considered, up until very recently, the most successful experiment in individual freedoms and access to justice - the country continues to attract people from all over the world, lured by the promise of a high quality of life and access to fairness, efficiency and justice There is only one conundrum for modern discourse - the US was built on the abundance of access to land resources and human capital, made possible by the displacement and subjugation of Native communities, enslavement of Africans and military sacrifice of generations of young soldiers - so much blood. So much suffering. 

The echoes of this kind of suffering are not unique to the US. Australia, another filthy rich, successful nation, boasts a similar settler-colonial history, along with much of the Americas and Southern Africa. England, with its largest city, London, was founded through various waves of invading armies displacing and subjugation indigenous authorities - the city of London itself was founded by the colonial efforts of ancient Rome. Today England is the wealthiest and most densely populated in the UK - being credited with its immense contribution to global culture, industrial advancement and overall human progress.

  
The core view I need challenged is this - it is not enough to discredit settler colonialism from a moral perspective alone, as we have a global history of more military adept societies seizing power and creating exclusive benefits for those deemed as belonging. Many have and continue to inherit land, property and other forms of land or resources which were at some point claimed through conquest. People literally have higher quality of life and security from what we argue was stolen, which only perpetuates the incentive - what stops white supremacist bigots in rural America from changing their views if they see the conquest of the continent as truly manifest destiny and a product of their supposed superiority? What stops Zulu tribalists in southern Africa from reflecting on their own history of displacing and subjugating their neighbors just like the British would do to them? What stops us from rocking up to an alien world and taking said planet to exclude whatever native intelligence from our prosperity there? "

In short, they made light of male sexual assault and used some scenes as comedy. The write contrast how the female sexual assault was serious and dark and this time it was used for humor when a male was involved. 


I personally don’t think anything cannot/should not be made fun of. Humor and writing is a talent. Not all jokes may land but there are absolutely ways to make fun of the most abhorrent and terrible situations for the masses. I’ve heard jokes about rape, genocide, murder, child molestation, theft and so on and they were funny. So I certainly don’t believe subject matter is an issue.


The two scenes between the male and female characters were quite different. The female character thought she got a job with professionals. That she would be saving the world, she is there for good but all of them turned out to be horrible people. One of them raped her. Nothing funny about that and it wasn’t supposed to be.


On the other hand… the male character was disguised as someone else. The 2/3 other people believed they were having a consensual engagement with someone else. He was put into a “hilarious” predicament while trying to complete another task. 



Also… (you can change my mind on this one too) there is quite a difference between you having to do squat cobbler, farting and having someone rub one out while they tickle your feet vs someone forcing you to perform oral. 

In a show that has shown some crazy stuff… that scene definitely wasn’t one that crossed a line.

Not a look of ""oh, I want to see this"", but more a look of ""I wish I could stop seeing that"".

But this is purely anecdotal experience.  It's not like guys can go around saying things like ""you know, I find your tits nasty and wish you would cover them up"".  So it is entirely possible that women with big tits realize a lot of guys find them to be a turn off.  So CMV."

A 2nd round pick in the NFL draft is not a bust, regardless if he ever even plays a snap. C.J. Spiller is not a bust, even if he wasn't a superstar like expected, he made a Pro Bowl and had a relatively long career for a RB. The NBA player picked 23rd overall is not a bust. Worst of all, a highly recruited high school football player who did not have success in college is not a bust. I think the term bust is often just used for someone not meeting expectations, but it's more than that. You have to factor in the magnitude of the expectations. JaMarcus Russell   is a bust because he didn't find success in the NFL AND the fact he was viewed by many to be a generational QB with arm talent the league had never seen which is why he was taken first overall. The 2nd round cornerback's ceiling of ""Potential Starter"" does not make him a bust if he doesn't become a starter. The magnitude of expectations is not nearly the same. I think only people drafted within the top 10 picks overall can be called a bust."

The reasons being:

1. Kids are loud and annoying
2. Kids break things.
3. Kids are expensive.
4. Kids are a burden.
5. Kids don't add happiness to your life.

These are ALL completely fair and valid reasons to be childless. Yet I make this argument for those who dislike the idea of having a child and yet absolutely MUST live with a dog...

1. Dogs are ALSO loud and annoying, but unlike Kids never learn the meaning of the words ""Timmy shut up and go to bed."" Don't even get me started on folks who let their dog bark outside until midnight while trying to sleep or just let their dog YAP YAP YAP while trying to have a conversation in the living room.
2. Dogs ALSO break things but unlike kids grounding them doesn't change this behavior. My brother and his dog would chew on my toys growing up. Brother outgrew it, but the dog never did.
3. Dogs are expensive depending on the breed, AND you still gotta buy food (and it can't always be the same food you'd eat), plus vet bills which your insurance won't cover unlike a child which can benefit on a family plan.
4. Dogs are a massive burden. You might not have to deal with CPS, but you do still have to deal with Peta, and some apartments will refuse to let you move in if you have a dog. Plus what if family members or someone else important to you has a genuine allergy to dog hair? (said allergy is actually being stigmatized in the modern day, which is frightening).
5. It's fine if having a dog makes you happier than having a son or daughter, but it's CRINGE to call them ""my fur babies"" because it proves my own belief that those who are ""anti-kid"" are unhealthily projecting arrested parental instincts onto a pet.

This is a problem (or is there a better word for this?) because a well raised child will help you during your twilight years instead of damn you to a nursing home, or if you're really lucky will grow up to be Gordon Ramsay or Jeff Bezos and effectively raise YOU for the rest of your life. A dog will die long before that and NEVER meaningfully contribute to your life in a way a child shown the same affection and discipline can't also do in that same time span (I.e., love and affection).

Why I want my view changed: I want to understand the perspective of those who don't think like I do on this manner.  
  
I also want to make a disclaimer: I'm not saying being a parent is an objectively better thing to do than raise a pet nor do I believe children should be a means to an end, but again just wish to at least try to understand a mindset I am unfamiliar with; ""Children bad, dog good"" "

All you really need to do to get love is go online, and man or woman you could easily get someone to fall in love with you and potentially make really major sacrifices for you.

By contrast to get sex it’s a lot harder. You basically need to do one of these three things

1. Get time off work and save enough money to fly over to the person you met online
2. Somehow succeed in the hellish environment of online dating
3. Do everything right with an irl social life for potentially years until you meet someone and have sex with them


I guess you can get love after sex through the last two methods, but the main point is that it’s overwhelmingly easier to do the first method.

I think this is the case for basically every demographic born post-1990 who has internet access. If you want to stretch I think at least everyone born post-2000."

The core of the idea is that the recent immunity ruling from the SCOTUS is perhaps the most dangerous and inappropriate ruling that court has ever made, and is a fundamental threat to our system of governance.  It needs to be completely reversed as quickly as possible.

So what we need is a very public and shocking demonstration that the president is now very much above the law.  A drone strike on a political rival is that demonstration.  As Commander in Chief of the armed forces, ordering strikes is very clearly a core presidential function, and so the immunity is invoked.  Given that the ruling explicitly states that motives cannot be considered, it doesn't matter that this could be viewed as a selfish and politically motivated act if we ignore the wider good being done here.

I had briefly considered strikes on the conservative members of the SCOTUS, but I don't think that accomplishes the goal as well, because that could pretty easily qualify as treason, and thus open up a clear-cut impeachment case.   I don't think that case is as clear-cut with targeting Trump because he isn't currently executing any official government function.  With the ruling in place, it also doesn't qualify as an abuse of power, because it is just using a specifically granted protection to act for the greater good of the USA.

The end result being that even the most conservative members of the court will be forced to see that the power to assassinate political rivals is both horrific and a direct consequence of their ruling, and they'll move to undo it with all available speed.  It might even be enough to actually get a constitutional amendment to clarify that the President cannot be above the law.

So where's the flaw here?"

People who are smarter, more open to experience, and more conscientious are better a adoptinga new culture.

When you migrate/visit another culture and fail to behave within their norms, it reflects badly upon you and that is to be expected.

The caricature example of this would be the ""ugly american"" abroad and the examples of Brits acting with impropriety on holiday.

It is also probably why there is a social friction when societies experience a massive influx of migrants, since insular communities reduce the interface with the existing society.

The fact that some want to ignore legitimate complaints about social friction, or dispose of any and all grievances by claiming that everything is due to abhorrent prejudice is not helpful or realistic. 

There are many reasons why across the world, people become fed up when their homelands are overrun with tourists and or migrants and refugees. Surely some of them are invalid and xenophobic, but ignoring this fact is counterproductive.

230,2024-07-08,CMV: U.S. public schools should not be funded by local property taxes ,u/Prince_Marf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dyfean/cmv_us_public_schools_should_not_be_funded_by/,changemyview,"This is something that has always seemed like a no-brainer to me but nobody seems willing to discuss it seriously:

In the US, public schools in almost every state are funded by property taxes raised from *local* sources. In other words, rich neighborhoods get ample funding from high property taxes while poor neighborhoods are always strapped for cash because property values are lower.

Everybody seems to completely ignore this in political conversations about schools. The conversation is dominated by republican talking points about how our public schools are ""failing"" and how private schools and school choice are the only solution. It really sent me over the edge about a month ago listening to a 'debate' on NPR about private school voucher programs and the anti-voucher side basically just argued ""hey give the public schools a chance the status quo isn't THAT bad. Maybe things will magically turn around."" 

It's not some big mystery why under-funded schools do poorly. The role of funding is patently obvious when you look at schools in wealthy communities of states with supposedly ""failing"" public schools. For example in my state, Illinois, people love to rant about the failing Chicago public school system and how we need charter schools to fix it, but for some reason nobody talks about the ABSURDLY well funded public schools in wealthy suburbs *around* Chicago like Naperville, Hinsdale, or Lake Forest. Teachers at these schools make 6 figures. Kids in those schools have every program under the sun and more and still go home to expensive tutors and extracurriculars.

To me, it is wildly insulting to insinuate that Chicago Public Schools and similar districts that are constantly strapped for funding are somehow mismanaged or incompetent when you see extremely wealthy schools in the next community over thriving. It's all about funding. It's not some big mystery why under-funded public schools fail. And pretending private schools are magically better and will solve these problems is absurd. Advocates for ""school choice"" just want to be able to save a buck sending their kids to expensive private academies and leave poor kids to underfunded public daycares.

The solution, to me is clear: make school funding uniform throughout the state, or even better, the nation. Schools are funded solely based on how many students they have, and amenities are distributed evenly across the system. This would result in adequately funded public schools across the system. No public school has teachers making absurd salaries to teach rich kids and nobody has teachers making 30k teaching 35-kid classrooms. The wealthy can still send their kids to elite private schools but they have to do it on their own dime. This seems like a no-brainer to me for anyone who isn't in the top 10% wealth bracket. Why should anyone else be against it? Change my view."

So the court created basically three buckets: absolute criminal immunity for things outlined in the Constitution, presumptive criminal immunity for powers related to the first but not actually in the Constitution, and then no immunity for things unrelated to Presidential actions at all. But the Court now has to define what actions are Presidential when they aren't outlined in the Constitution.

That seems quite bizarre to me since it seems to go against separation of powers by letting the Judicial define Executive actions in a manner that doesn't rely on the document that grants POTUS their powers. Which also seems against the 10th amendment's doctrine of not trying to infer powers that aren't defined.

Plus this SCOTUS has perfectly demonstrated how their own rulings can just be overturned. Give it 10-20 years and suddenly an Official act becomes Unofficial and vice-versa.

To me the solution should have just been creating two buckets: 

1. Core powers as outlined in the Constitution, (which will still have cases brought up in SCOTUS to clarify) and they get full immunity because they're enshrined in the highest law of the land.
2. And then there's every other action and they're all fair game for criminal prosecution.

If a Presidential power is not important enough to make it into the Constitution or its amendments then it's not worth giving any immunity to and the Judicial shouldn't be playing whack-a-mole with trying to shape those powers. 

If our government doesn't want an action being constantly litigated, then Congress (or the states though that's highly unlikely) should be amending the Constitution to further define Presidential powers. If they don't do that, then apparently that Presidential action is not important enough to get immunity.

The need for the bucket of liminal Presidential powers is lost on me."

I’ll skip over the animal welfare argument cause I think it’s pretty self explanatory.

Working at a slaughterhouse is an incredibly dangerous and psychologically damaging job and it’s not worth forcing people to put up with now that we have alternatives.

Slaughterhouse workers have one of the highest rates of workplace injury of any profession, with serious permanent injuries like amputation being alarmingly common (according to [this](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant) piece from a few years ago there’s an average of two amputations a week performed on slaughterhouse workers in the US). They also have incredibly high rates of mental health problems like PTSD and significantly higher rates of violent crimes and sex crimes compared to the general population.

This is also an industry that’s infamous for relying on undocumented immigrant workers, as well as minors, and there’s many, many documented instances of worker protections being ignored, including some important public health related ones. The conditions of slaughterhouse workers in the US have been labeled a [human rights violation](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/11/rights-line/human-rights-watch-work-abuses-against-migrants-2010).

In addition, some practices of the large scale meat industry have been directly responsible for outbreaks of animal-borne diseases like avian flu and mad cow. And there’s the environmental and land use impact of raising, feeding, and transporting all those animals.

Until the last few years I could’ve maybe accepted that these are all just unfortunate but necessary side effects of feeding people en masse but we now have the ability to produce cultured meat (not to mention other meat substitutes) with far, far fewer negative consequences. As this technology becomes cheaper and more common it should be common sense to phase out large scale commercial animal slaughter entirely and eventually make it illegal. I understand this will probably cause a crisis in the price and availability of meat, at least in the short term, but I don’t think that in itself is a significant negative.

I don’t have a problem with slaughtering animals for meat on a smaller scale, such as for religious reasons or on farms."

I also think Biden is very old and rlly not with us anymore (mentally) and definitely wont be with us for his entire term.  

**HOWEVER**, I also think Biden is correct that the Polls really don't show a real picture anymore and that 2016 really showed that.  Secondly I think the lawfare strategy the DNC has used has been effective (despite me hating it).  I think it has been really successful in getting it in the subconscious of many independents/undecideds who don't care about politics the only thing floating in their heads when they go to the ballot/send in their mail will be ""eh.... guess I wont vote for the criminal I think I heard he was convicted"".

Mexico and the US are very similar in terms of values and attitudes, so while there may be a language barrier it's not as though illegal immigrants coming in from South America and Mexico are going to try to impose their own vastly different set of laws or rules on others or even believe that should happen. 

But when I look at Europe and the migrants entering Europe, that's completely different. Islam does have its own rules and laws and many citizens of these countries believe that these rules and laws were created by God and therefore they automatically transcend any legal system created by mere mortals. 

I'm not saying most Muslims feel this way. Islam has many different sects, with different views. But if even a small % of the migrants coming in- an unknown number I might add- believe that they have the right to impose their way of life on others because it's the word of their God, I completely understand why people would be concerned.

psychotherapy is a biased and weighted practice.

psychotherapists give more inherent grace to the following people:

- female

- pretty

- demure

- chirpy

- smiley

  
anybody else is fucked.

they give them the greatest life grace.

they give them the biggest allowances.

they don't force or cajole them to be religious.

As people who study the human mind and help people, they have patently weak comprehension of people overall. 

For instance, take two younger people. One is a hot female who is white, the other is a tall and large Italian dude. 

Say the young woman says she gave her bf a bj in the uni library in a secluded area. and she said this just to get it off her chest. the therapist would excuse it. ""oh you're only young!"" or ""We all like sex!! bless you!!"" if the guy said this, it would be ""why?!!"" or ""like what the fuck?!?!"" sorry, but same act requires the same treatment. There should only be mitigating factors based on clinical points or symptoms,and not looks or demeanour. 

Or if one likes video games or seeing violent films. Neither are symptoms of mental illness alone. But the leeway is given to the hottie girl cos she has a nice smile and little else. It seems therapists don't even know what their DSM contains or even the spirit of such. Like a mental illness is abnormal thoughts or behaviour that causes emotional distress and bad functioning. Seeing a violent film doesn't do that. playing a video game doesn't do that. sex acts in a secluded public area don't do that. what a bunch of RETARDS!! 

I can't take therapists seriously since they're thoroughly unprofessional and lack and scruples or thoroughness. Even people doing supposedly ""shitty"" retail jobs can do that. They know where to stack the cereals, or lay out the fruit and veg. Therapists go for a degree and extensive training to be that fucking SHODDY haahhaa. HOW? it makes NO sense! 

I suspect therapists think like Hitler. they want to crush people down based on some inner hierarchy. any egalitarianism offends them. yes, others having what they do is offensive to them. weird feelings and emotions. I don't even tolerate therapists when I meet them, since they are that shoddy as people and lacking in any integrity and scruples. If I were at a dinner party, and i met a doctor, a psychotherapist, a teacher, a marketing professional, and a personal trainer, i would frankly IGNORE the psychotherapist. treating the sick, teaching people skills and knowledge, helping organisations conceptualise and promote products, and making people fit are all more noble deeds than being a shoddy and scammy prick who doesn't even know or abide by their own professional guideline!!!

People who go to a third-world country or another as a ""mission"". To me I just see white girls go to these third-world countries to ""help"" but just do it to post about it on Instagram.

1. Most of these people just want to travel but are not brave enough to travel by themselves. I'm talking about those girls who post all the sites of the country they are doing their ""mission"" in on Instagram. They always wanted to travel abroad, but are too scared to go alone and their family will not travel with them so instead they just go with their church as a ""mission"" trip, which comes with the benefits of having people donate to your vacation.

2. If people actually wanted to have an impact or make a difference in countries that need help as an act of God, then they would simply put large amounts of money into nonprofits or donations. There is no need for some girl to spend thousands of money that her family has donated for her to go a third-world country, take pictures with low-income kids, volunteer for a couple of days, and then go back to her nice suburb in the US. Instead, you could donate that money to a village so they can buy water, food, furniture etc. 

3. If you actually felt called to help abroad for Christ then you should go on a long-term mission trip. Long-term mission trips accomplish all the ""goals"" of a short-term mission trip, while making way more of an impact. Im sorry but these kids who see you come to their village for a week are not going to remember you vs people who leave their nice home in the US to come help them for two years straight. The problem is that most short-term mission trip attendees don't want to spend more than a week in a third world country, which just proves my point that short-term mission trips are BS."

Sometimes it's just down to a case if they just weren't that into you. I know it hurts hearing that, but whenever someone actively really loves you and ""wants you"" their behaviour will stay consistent, and they just weren't that into you. The next person gets treated better because you weren't compatible or they just weren't fully interested.

Even my ex **let's use them as an example** they've been with their new girlfriend together for 4 months maybe 5 now, posting how happy they are and her girlfriend brags publicly how well she treats her, while my ex says they're so happy. Photos of them kissing as their profile pic, etc. They're thriving, and clearly changed immediately. They use to treat me perfectly well too (besides the end) but it's clear it's cause I meant toning to them/they weren't interested or invested.

It hurts knowing I got treated and discarded like I was nothing, and this new girl gets this perfect individual who treats them perfectly, but clearly as down and simple; they changed because I just wasn't what they wanted. That doesn't have to do with me. 

So mind you if someone gives you the bare minimum it has nothing to do with you, it's just they're not that into you.

Any novel element introduced to society will be used and misused indefinatel or unless freedom is totally removed. 

Personal temperance is the only important factor in determining whether use, misuse or avoidance strategies are used. 

Drugs, weapons, belief systems, deviant practices, etc. are all elements of society that must have a time and place of appropriateness  for a free society to flourish. The absence of taboo elements is not a realistic goal. 

The obvious example is America's prohibition laws from 1920 - 1933. The 18th Amendment of the constitution was ratified in 1919 and repealed 13 years later after a signicant increase in related crime and no signs of success in anything but making criminals of otherwise decent citizens.

The subsequent War on Drugs likewise criminalized activities that people of every class were going to do anyways. 

Ideological elements like xenophobia and racism have had a presence in every culture, in varying degrees, but  becomes most problematic when directly challenged. 

Two iconic symbols of the industrial revolution, guns and cars, have had an important influence but are increasingly inefficient and unnecessary. Varying attempts to encourage changes in their usage have seen dramatic reactions and even a ""doubling down"" and even fanatical behaviors from a significant portion of the population.

Morality laws such as encouraged by conservative ideologies often result in increasingly deviant behaviors within that same group.

1. they commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens, decreasing the overall crime rate in america

2. they occupy almost all of the non-union labor in america that no one would even be allowed to do without changing the industry entirely with safety and insurance regulations (cleaning services, gardening, kitchen jobs,  etc. you guys think they're taking your jobs? go swap with them for one day. go wait in front of home depot for your job security, or pay the handyman who's price is going to skyrocket when he gets the chance. 

3. the low cost from occupying these jobs trickle down into the economy, making all your grocery store shopping and hotel rooms much cheaper than if they we'ren't here among others 

4. the cost of deporting migrants

* task force must be trained
* an entire slew of lawyers need to get ready since the only way to really deport them would be to physically remove them from their homes. not saying it can or can't be done, but the lawsuits following is costly. 
* you're up against the lobby of some major corporations which benefit from their  low cost of labor in some direct or indirect way. 
* you have to pay for housing and food while you have them in custody
* you need to pay to actually find every single one of them. how much security are you willing to let go of as a citizen so that drones or more paid officers have to randomly and regularly check where you are going, who you relate with and identify you. maybe im being a bit extreme with all those things, but its just to make a point you have to sacrifice some amount of security and freedoms. 
* in america we have a justice system (as corropt or not as it may be), generally crimes and punishments are fair to each other meaning you can't be given 2 life sentences for jwalking. as long as you're within a few standard deviations even, (in my mind its not even close), the crime for illegally crossing a border isn't that serious. how are you going to pay for pretty much a warzone keeping them 100% from being able to cross a piece of land. similar to what they have in north korea i beleive for a crime that really isn't that serious. its a lot of money to spend to fight a war that really isn't a huge deal.

5. remember its double bad value because if you're going to deport them, and need to give them shelter and food ANYWAY, then the cost of housing and feeding them cancels out, and its not even worth it to detain them, let them work and commit fewer crimes than citizens who can

6. it is in the best, literal number 1 interest of the republicans as a political party (any political party, the democrats do this too) to get as many votes as possible. illegals as a constinuency don't vote for republicans, so making it difficult to vote, and to come into and stay in this country seems like a very cheap and easy to identify political tactic that turns (sadly), the goodwill toward it by its base into manipulation. and the base is either too loyal to be able to see the tree for the forest, or fox news litearlly thinks you're all that stupid. it makes sense to me that this whole war on illegal immigration is a political tactuc, and not a real problem. 

  
im not sure what could change my mind. 

some common arguments that I hear and cannot express that easily or isn't really logical so i won't include them in the main part of the post

  
1. you're separating families. I know its easy to sweep this one under the rug, but really its a nasty thing to do. 

2. ""they're taking classrooms from my kids, and benefiting from our tax dollars"" essentially - okay but once they're here, contributing to society, then who cares. the difference in being a citizen officially or not, i mean who cares? they're your neighbor now, they're human beings, usually peaceful ones statistically, and whatever they work really hard and try to make a life better than what they had in whatever shithole they tried to escape from. obviously they didnt make the deciious lightly. give em a chance to fuckin survive. you think they wake up in the morning and do what? look at their citizen card and htink ""oh shit, im not a citizen, better do XYZ??"" theres nothing intrisitc about the nature of beinbg a citizen or not that promoites and is related to anything.

And how this, combined with Project 2025, would make Trump a dictator and destroy democracy in America. 

I'm not a republican, and I don't sympathize with Trump one bit. But I want to see how easy or hard it would be for Trump to dismantle american democracy in 4 years as president.

Let's assume that Trump enacted Project 2025, fired thousands of federal employees and replaced them with loyalists. Now let's say Trump started ordering his DOJ to do illegal things for him, like assassinations, arresting people without a warrant, or threaten people with violence. He would do this against his political opponents and maybe even against judges and members of Congress to expand his power.

It would be very hard for Trump to pull that off for the following reasons:

* The recent Supreme Court ruling does NOT make officers acting under the president's orders immune from prosecution. So Trump's henchmen could still be criminally liable for assassinations, violence or arresting or searching people without a warrant. Those kinds of crimes carry heavy sentences and are hard to get away from. Most of Trump's henchmen wouldn't risk going to prison for that. Even if they are loyal, most of them would refuse or resign.
* Presidential pardons only extend to federal crimes, not state crimes. So even if Trump pardoned them, Trump's henchmen could still be charged in state court, even while Trump is in office. 
* Even if the Supreme Court said federal officers were immune from criminal prosecution when following a presidential order, they would need to say that *after* the crimes have already been commited. They can't make a decision on a case that doesn't exist yet. Trump's henchmen can't predict the future to know if the court would rule in that way. Or if democrats would later expand the court to reverse the ruling.
* So Trump's henchmen would need to risk doing the crime first and then praying the Supreme Court saves them and the democrats don't expand the court. Which most wouldn't have the courage to do so when going to jail for a long time is a significant possibility.
* Even if Trump could somehow protect his henchmen from prosecution, that protection would cease to exist the moment a democract became president. So Trump's henchmen would also need to be sure a democrat would never be president again. 
* Even if preventing a democrat from ever becoming president again is possible, it's still very hard to do so and it's unpredictable. It would require either electoral fraud, throwing out votes, overturning an election or a coup, all of which could go wrong and fail. Most of Trump's henchmen wouldn't be willing to commit crimes that could lend them in jail with so many uncertainties."

However, I've watched all but the latest available episode. The show doesn't capture the magic of the original Star Wars trilogy, but then again almost nothing does. Those films are legendary and have gone down in history as some of the best ever made. While The Acolyte fails to live up to those old movies, it's by no means a show worthy of a mere [3.5 on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12262202/) or a paltry [14% on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star_wars_the_acolyte).

For perspective, Tommy Wiseau's The Room gets a [3.6 on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/). That movie is so bad it's widely regarded as one of the worst ever made, though it still has a ""good bad"" thing going for it. Even still, it has an ultra-low score, and deservedly.

Some of the Acolyte isn't great. The child actors are bad, for example, but that's pretty common for child actors. Some of the dialogue is cliched. Without spoiling anything, some of it also doesn't completely make sense. That isn't the worst critique though. Plenty of great sci-fi and fantasy doesn't really logically hold up if you take a bit of time to think about it. That doesn't automatically make it bad.

Apart from that, it's a perfectly competently made show with decent entertainment value. It has well-choreographed fight scenes, a reasonably interesting plot that makes you interested in finding out more, terrific special effects, and well-made set pieces. Musically and in terms of sounds, it maintains the flavour of the original movies. 

It puts forth some perspective about the lore that might be controversial to some fans, but so far I haven't found it to be clearly contradictory to the established lore from the movies. Besides, it's good that the shows writers have taken some risks. The failure to do that with other Star Wars shows or movies is part of what's made so much of it mediocre.

Plenty of people have suggested that the hate for it is politically motivated. Right-wing critics, primarily on social media, have lambasted for plenty of reasons, always avoiding saying the quiet part out loud. Namely, that the show has too many BIPOC and female characters. I can't help but think this is a big part of the hate because what else is supposed to explain the disproportionate score when compared to the show's actual quality? I have no quarrel with anyone who wants to say the show is a 6 or even a 5/10. But 3? And 14%? No way.

If there are contrary perspectives that can explain it to me, I'm all ears."

4. Gender Stereotypes - most trad gender roles defines a women's value is based on her physical appearance/attractiveness.

5. Economic Factors - industries like modeling and beauty entertainment focuses on objectifying women. (I'm not saying that this only happens to women. But there's a reason why female models are well known and make 75% than male ones, highly demanded)

6. Intersexuality - women of color, LGBTQ+ women faces a lot of objectifications and sexualizations. (hence why they're more accepted than men of color and LGBTQ+ women.)

7. Online Harassment - both women and men experienced a lot of harassment. but women face a lot of harassment just because they are a WOMEN. (Especially Video games. many people seen this played before where a woman just wants to play a game and there will always be an a asshole bashing her.)

8. Sports - female athletes face a lot of objectification based on their physical appearances. Sometimes people even focus on their physical look rather than their athletic achievements.

9. Ageism - there are a lot of hate for older women. (And that a woman is more attractive when she is young) 

10. Dismissal Of Women's Voice - ignoring and underestimating women's perspectives and experiences. (law and politics)

11. Language/Slangs - chick, doll , bimbo, dumb blonde , temptress , seductress, (using chick to describe a woman is way too normalize and as a man i can always see that through my male friends 🤦🏻) 

12. Magazines - frequently used highly sexualized pictures of women. (Example Playboy. Victoria's Secret) 

13. Historical Context - women were potrayed sexually in arts and paintings. during war. Asian Women were used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers (they're known more as ""Comfort Women"" as the Japanese government still won't admit their faults.

14. Pornography - in many forms of pornography, it's normalize how society reduced women to body parts. (especially breast.)

15. Street Harassment - many women face a lot of harassment in streets (cat calling, getting groped, stalked) 

NOTE: I just wanted to talk about how society normalize these kind of behaviors. It's so sad to see how many women fear for there lives everyday and having to worry about what's going to happen to them 🙂 both men and women's problem should be equally recognized.

0,2024-07-09,CMV: I am not worried about this election,u/TrueSmegmaMale,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dyvzro/cmv_i_am_not_worried_about_this_election/,changemyview,"I do not have much reason to care about the outcome of this election. I've been viewing it from a historical/observant standpoint as if it's a sports game but nothing more. I have very little passion or motivation to vote one way or the other nor care about who is voted in. I live in an extremely deep-colored state that has been set in its ways firmly for decades politically. My vote has zero power by every metric available and things will not change no matter who takes power of the executive branch.

As long as more issues keep arising that are left up to the states to decide, my state will continue to make the same decisions it always has. All I can do is vote for change I want to see and if my state decides to implement a law I disagree with, I can ignore it and continue to exist. Though if it is a law that restricts me so heavily that it gets under my skin, I can move to a different state with different laws and legislation.

Things also won't change much because both candidates are ideologically very similar - as much as they claim to not be. The two parties are capitalist, constitutionalist, and democratic. Each may have slight deviations from these but there's little to no major societal shift from president to president.

Both candidates have each had one term and neither candidate has done anything historically relevant. Both sides tout the other candidate bringing forth fascism and fail to remember the system of checks and balances does not allow for that. 

If they implement something I don't like, I deal with the consequences like everyone else. Nothing either candidate plans to implement threatens my life or even my way of life. If I worry about things beyond my control, I lose control of myself. All I can do is vote. I'm not worried. If something is bad, the public will come to realize and vote against it in the next election the way they always have. It's the cycle of any democracy."

A spectrum is defined as: ""a continuous sequence or range \[as covering all possibilities\]"". Most learning and behavioral disabilities are characterized by a spectrum of intensity. For example, anxiety, ADD and bi-polar.

So everyone is ""on the spectrum"". When you think of a very autistic person (which is hard to do because the concept is absolutely diluted by everyone saying they are autistic), they have a high intensity case of autism. On the other end is the low intensity. For practical purposes, there should be a cut off where even if you have some traits of autistic tendencies, the effect is so little as to be meaningless to your behavior and life. One way of labeling this case is high functioning autistic.

These people want the excuse of saying they are autistic when something bad happens in their life, but they also want people to know they are not disabled and just normal functioning adults.

0,2024-07-09,CMV: The Vietnam War was Necessary,u/FemboyFinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dyzw6v/cmv_the_vietnam_war_was_necessary/,changemyview,"Most people think the Vietnam War was a stupid, easily avoidable conflict. But it wasn't.

In the 1960s, the global landscape was drastically different. The Soviet Union was a formidable competitor to the United States, and it was by no means certain that the US would “win” the Cold War. At the time, the largest country (Russia) and the most populated country (China) were both communist and spanned vast regions of the globe, posing a significant threat to democratic nations.

Our first line of defense against the Soviets in the West was a depleted West Germany, which had lost two world wars in the last 40 years. The country was still recovering from the devastation and was not fully capable of mounting a strong defense against a potential Soviet invasion.

France, which was losing its overseas possessions, saw the writing on the wall. If the Soviets crossed the Rhine, their T-60 tanks could drive straight to the English Channel. This threat was real and immediate. ***France, recognizing its precarious position, left NATO in 1966 and adopted a stance of neutrality, further weakening the Western alliance.*** For West Germany to have any chance of repelling a Soviet invasion, France's support was absolutely necessary to help plug the Fulda Gap, a critical corridor for any potential advance by Warsaw Pact forces. The US engagement in Vietnam was largely a strategic move to signal to the rest of NATO that America was committed to standing and fighting the expansion of communism wherever it emerged.

At the time, the domino theory was a prevailing belief. The theory posited that if one country fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow, much like a row of dominoes. Vietnam was seen as a crucial battleground in this context. The fear was that if Vietnam fell, other countries in Southeast Asia would also fall, ultimately strengthening the global communist bloc and threatening US interests and global stability.

50 years later, it's easy for millennials to dismiss the Vietnam War as a bad war (all wars are indeed tragic), but the reality of the time was very different. The Cold War was marked by intense fear and uncertainty. People were genuinely terrified leading up to events like the Cuban Missile Crisis because they knew the world was teetering on the brink of nuclear annihilation. The stakes were incredibly high, and decisions had to be made in that context.

The US also sought to prevent the spread of communism in Vietnam as part of its broader strategy to contain Soviet influence. The Truman Doctrine, established in 1947, asserted that the US would support free peoples resisting subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures. This policy was a cornerstone of US foreign policy during the Cold War and was a driving force behind US involvement in Vietnam.

Moreover, the US was committed to supporting South Vietnam under the SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) alliance, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. The commitment to SEATO reflected the broader strategy of containing communism and supporting allies in the region.

It's essential to judge the past not by our contemporary morals but by understanding the context of the time. The Vietnam War was part of a larger struggle against the spread of communism, which was perceived as an existential threat to democratic nations and global stability. While the war was costly and its outcomes are debated, it was driven by the strategic imperatives of the Cold War era.

In conclusion, the Vietnam War was a complex and multifaceted conflict shaped by the geopolitical realities of the time. It was not simply a “stupid” war but a necessary part of the broader strategy to contain communism and demonstrate the US commitment to its allies and the defense of democratic values."
0,2024-07-09,CMV: Positive thinking is ineffective and potentially harmful. Choiceless awareness is a better alternative. ,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz0anz/cmv_positive_thinking_is_ineffective_and/,changemyview,"The technique of positive thinking is not a technique that transforms you. It is simply repressing the negative aspects of your personality. It is a method of choice. It cannot help awareness; it goes against awareness.

Awareness is always choiceless.

Positive thinking simply means forcing the negative into the unconscious and conditioning the conscious mind with positive thoughts. But the trouble is that the unconscious is far more powerful, nine times more powerful, than the conscious mind. So once a thing becomes unconscious, it

becomes nine times more powerful than it was before. It may not show in the old fashion, but it will find new ways of expression.

So positive thinking is a very poor method, without any deep understanding, and it goes on giving you wrong ideas about yourself.

Positive thinking was born out of a certain Christian sect in America which was called Christian Science. To avoid the word 'Christian', so others can also be allured to it, they slowly dropped that old label and simply started talking about the philosophy of positive thinking.

Christian Science - which is the original source - proposed that anything that happens in your life is nothing but a thought projection. If you want to be rich, think and grow rich. It is by thinking positively that you are rich, that you are getting richer, that dollars will start coming towards you.

Christian Science was a superficial way... it may help in a few things; particularly those things which are really created by your thought can be changed. But your whole life is not created by your thought.

Positive thinking came out of Christian Science. It talks now more philosophically, but the base remains the same - that if you think negatively, that is going to happen to you; if you think positively, that is going to happen to you. And in America that kind of literature is widely read. Nowhere else in the world has positive thinking made any impact - because it is childish.

""Think and grow rich"" - everybody knows this is simply foolish. And it is harmful, and dangerous too.

The negative ideas of your mind have to be released, not repressed by positive ideas. You have to create a consciousness which is neither positive nor negative. That will be the pure consciousness.

In that pure consciousness you will live the most natural and blissful life.

If you repress some negative idea because it is hurting you.... For example: if you are angry, and you repress it and try to make an effort to change the energy into something positive - to feel loving towards the person you were feeling angry with, to feel compassionate - you know you are deceiving yourself.

Deep down it is still anger; it is just that you are whitewashing it. On the surface you may smile, but your smile will be limited only to your lips. It will be an exercise of the lips; it won't be connected with you, with your heart, with your being. Between your smile and your heart, you yourself have put a great block - the negative feeling that you have repressed.

And it is not one feeling; in life you have thousands of negative feelings. You don't like a person, you don't like many things; you don't like yourself, you don't like the situation you are in. All this garbage goes on collecting in the unconscious, and on the surface a hypocrite is born, who says, ""I love everybody, love is the key to blissfulness."" But you don't see any bliss in that person's life. He is holding the whole of hell within himself.

He can deceive others, and if he goes on deceiving long enough, he can deceive himself too. But it won't be a change. It is simply wasting life - which is immensely valuable because you cannot get it back.

Positive thinking is simply the philosophy of hypocrisy - to give it the right name. When you are feeling like crying, it teaches you to sing. You can manage if you try, but those repressed tears will come out at some point, in some situation. There is a limitation to repression. And the song that you were singing was absolutely meaningless; you were not feeling it, it was not born out of your heart.

It was just because the philosophy says to always choose the positive.

I am absolutely against positive thinking. You will be surprised that if you don't choose, if you remain in a choiceless awareness, your life will start expressing something which is beyond both positive and negative, which is higher than both. So you are not going to be a loser. It is not going to be negative, it is not going to be positive, it is going to be existential.

So if tears are there, they will have a beauty; they themselves will have a song. You need not impose any song on them, they themselves will be out of joy, out of fulfillment - not out of sadness, failure.

And if the song bursts forth, it is not against tears, despair; it is simply the expression of your joy...

not against anything, not for anything. It is simply the flowering of your own being; hence I call it existential.

Positive thinking has led America into a very wrong path; it had made people hypocrites. It is the most influential philosophy in America, and in fact, it is not even a philosophy, it is just rubbish. It does not understand the psychology of man, it is not grounded in the findings of psychology; it is not grounded in the deeper findings of meditation. It is simply giving people hope - people who are losing all hope. It is giving people ambition.

The poor man thinks that if he goes on thinking, then suddenly out of the blue, a Cadillac will appear in his porch - although right now he has no porch. First he has to think of a porch! Positive thinking will create a porch, then positive thinking will bring a Cadillac. And even if it happens, please don't sit in such a car; it is dangerous. There is no car, and there is no porch - that man is hallucinating.

He is not in his senses.

Everything has to be earned. There is a famous book by Napoleon Hill, THINK AND GROW RICH, and his whole emphasis is that if you think really hard, you will become rich. Millions of copies have been sold because he is a good writer, one of the best that America has produced. He writes well, convincingly.

But before that when his book was first published, he was at the bookstall so that the publisher could introduce him to the customers, and he could put his signature on the books.

And it happened that Henry Ford just came in - he was looking at books, he loved books - and he inquired, ""What is happening? What is this man doing?""

He found out that this was Napoleon Hill, a great writer, and his new book was just published. ""He will be very happy to be introduced to you."" So Henry Ford went to him. The publisher introduced Napoleon Hill, saying, ""He has written this book, THINK AND GROW RICH.""

Henry Ford looked at the cover, at the title, and asked Napoleon Hill, ""Have you come in your own car, or in a public bus?""

It seemed so irrelevant, but when Henry Ford was asking, Napoleon Hill had to say, ""Yes, I have come in a public bus.""

Henry Ford returned the book and told him, ""When you have thought enough about a beautiful car and it appears in your porch, then bring this book to me. I am Henry Ford - I don't need this book.

I know you cannot grow rich by thinking. You can cheat poor people by this book. Everybody wants to become rich, so the book will sell well, and perhaps by the book sales you may become rich, and you may purchase a car. But remember, that is not the condition. I will accept the book if the car appears by your thinking.""

The car never appeared, he could never go to Henry Ford. And that old man was very strange; he used to call once in a while on the phone and say, ""What happened about the car? If it has not appeared yet, withdraw the book from the market. It is sheer cheating!"" And the whole book is about positive thinking - only think positive thoughts.

And you can see the difference: all thoughts are useless - positive or negative. They are two sides of the same coin. You are not to change from the negative to the positive; you have to go beyond both. You have to drop them both, you have to become a thoughtless consciousness. And out of that consciousness, whatever you do will be right. Whatever you do will have tremendous beauty. Whatever you do will be satisfying."

Well, they lose it and their punishment is even harsher in my idea. For even the tiniest infraction, they will be decimated (1 in 10 of all personnel in the precinct to be killed for the slightest screw up) with the cops to be condemned drawing lots and whoever draws the short stick will be shot by their fellow cops and the public outside a public area (and their remains displayed outside their precinct as a warning) , scaring cops in being nice to the community together with them knowing that one of them will be next if they screw up again and allowing the public to know that to join the police means that the punishments will be exceptionally harsher on them for even the tiniest abuse of power and that the cops will take care of their own. No one is immune, not even the chief as well.

Well, what if we have a dearth of people willing to join ? Press gang. Who needs minimum age and qualifications to be a police officer? Just grab some living bodies, throw them in the nearest gang hotspots after arming them and wait for a few days, then come back and get the survivors for advanced training and initiation into the police force. Oh, and this means that rank would be positional rather than awarded for merit to prevent old boy networks that tend to lead to corruption.

0,2024-07-09,"CMV: The creation of the state of Israel was strategically engineered by Western powers, particularly the United States and Britain, to perpetuate the suffering of Jews rather than provide them with a homeland. ",u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz0skf/cmv_the_creation_of_the_state_of_israel_was/,changemyview,"I would like to share with you my perspective on the entire human situation, since the conflict between Jews and Arabs in Israel is not new. Under various names, it is taking place all over the world—between Christians and Jews, between Muslims and Hindus, etc.

Given that Muslims make up the majority of the Middle East, the issue has particularly heated up in Israel. However, Christianity is two thousand years old, and Mohammedanism is only fourteen hundred. Thus, Jews had already arrived in the Arabic world and established their own settlements before Mohammed was born. After that, Christians arrived and began to establish their own settlements.

The source of the issue is this unique rock, which is purported to be the main component of the magnificent Jewish Temple of Solomon, which was long since destroyed by anti-Semitic forces. All that's left is the rock that served as the centrepiece; it's known as the ""Rock of the Dome.""

Jews now assert that because their large temple is located there, it is their sacred site. Furthermore, Christians assert that this location—which is not Jewish but Christian—is sacred because it is where they believe Jesus was crucified. And after that, another competitor appears, and in an odd manner...

Mohammed founded a new religion six hundred years after Jesus because the Arabs lacked a national religion. 

And when he passed away, he left the biggest issue behind him—the narrative is incredibly funny. He developed his own style despite the fact that countless prophets, saviours, avataras, tirthankaras, and Buddhas had passed away before him. Actually, he lived forever. He just made it to heaven while still riding his horse, not by himself! And as he was riding towards heaven, he came to rest for a little while on that rock while perched on his horse. There was nowhere else he could find to rest.

Thus, the rock is now the source of conflict for three different religions. It is claimed by Judaism. Millions of Jews have died for it, and Jews are willing to kill for it. Christians have been occupying the Rock of the Dome by sending out crusades and fighting religious wars nonstop. The entire region is teeming with Mohammedans, who assert that this is their sacred rock since Mohammed rested there before ultimately riding off into heaven.

There has been war nearly every day for the past fourteen hundred years. Furthermore, America and Britain—both Christian nations—played the dirtiest game against the Jews at the end of World War II. Among the races that have suffered the most are the Jews. It goes without saying that they have contributed to their suffering. Since they were the first to assert, ""We are God's chosen people, and it is our fundamental right to rule over the world,"" they have suffered the most. People who are not like you are not worthy of respect.""

Everybody was irritated by this idea, which is why Jews have been killed and butchered repeatedly. Six million Jews were murdered by Adolf Hitler alone, and the list goes on. However, America and England have committed the ultimate act of cruelty, and even Jews are unable to comprehend their plan.

Following World War II, the United States and Great Britain seized control of Jerusalem, the location of the rock, as well as the tiny nation of Israel, which had never existed before. It was a part of Palestine, where Mohammedans had lived for many centuries. However, American and British forces ruled Jerusalem and Palestine following World War II, and America engaged in the most heinous political behaviour imaginable. It established a new country for the Jews under military rule. For the Jews, it was named Israel, the new nation.

It had been extinct for several centuries. It was once a land belonging to the Jews during Moses' time, but the Mohammedans lost it for centuries after that. It was something that neither the Jews nor the Christians had been able to successfully reclaim! The Jews owned only six percent of the land, while the Mohammedans owned ninety-four percent. How can Israel become an independent country? But they succeeded in establishing a new territory through force of arms. It was a very clever move, and maybe no one else has noticed it.

According to what I understand, America and Britain plotted to establish the Jewish state, meaning that Jews will now face eternal difficulties. This diplomacy is extremely advanced. The Jews were overjoyed, believing that America and England were providing them with the homeland they had been longing for for centuries, as well as helping them and being favourable to them.

Furthermore, America had accomplished two goals at once. Jews hold significant influence over the US Congress because they are among the wealthiest people in the country. They have their own lobby, and politicians are unable to stay away from the Jews because they rely on wealthy donors to help them win elections. Their existence is too crucial to ignore, and they are well-funded. Thus, this was an excellent opportunity for them to give money to American politicians.

The state of Israel was imposed on the Mohammedans by force, although American politicians succeeded in creating it for the benefit of the Jewish people. There is constant fighting because they can no longer stand it—Muslims are deeply fascist, and this insult is intolerable to them.

Israel needs to buy military supplies from America, and American Jews must constantly send Israel millions of dollars in order for Israel to survive. Thus, America has exterminated more Jews than Adolf Hitler did. It has also brought about a situation that will persist for centuries until there are no Jews left in Israel. This is not a one-time slaughter.

Furthermore, American politicians are always free to withdraw their backing. That is what they did in Taiwan. They were defending Taiwan from China, and Taiwan was totally dependent on US assistance, but how long would that last?

China is currently exerting all of its might to reintegrate Taiwan into its territory, but Taiwan lacks the ability to resist. Israel will experience the same thing at any time.

Even the greatest Jews, like Martin Buber, could not have suspected that they were creating a hell for the Jews in Israel with such elegant tactics.

Politics done with guile.

For Jews, America and England are not friendly places. 

Christianity, then, does not recognise the nation on the one hand, but it also created the nation in a place where Muslims surround it on all sides and threaten to kill and crush it.

For a mere act of crucifying one man, Jesus, millions of innocent Jews have been executed on the cross for the past two millennia; similarly, Jesus was innocent but killed by his peers. After two millennia, these people are no longer associated with the individuals who crucified Jesus. That being said, they have been tortured everywhere they have gone—in Germany and Russia, among other places. And Israel is now the ultimate tactic: they will endure eternal torture until Israel vanishes once more.

Israel is a political tool used by Christians to destroy Jews. Not directly, but by setting up conditions that allow Mohammedans to carry out the task while Christians can continue to wear the mask of being helpful even to their adversaries. They have adhered to the teachings of Jesus:

Show love even to your adversaries. Money and assistance in the form of obsolete weapons, which must be disposed of either in Israel or the ocean, have been freely given by them.

Simultaneously, American Jews continue to support American politicians on behalf of Israel. Thus, American politicians take advantage of their resources and their backing.

Individuals shouldn't be forced to endure needless suffering, killing, massacres, or constant terror. And now it's much riskier because Mohammedans everywhere have turned into terrorists, destroying the Jewish state's basic foundation in every way they can.

I think this is a bad idea because it creates degrading and fundamentally worthless work, and also doesn't solve any of the problems it is supposed to.

1. Degrading work

The Netherlands has recently followed Germany in introducing deposits on most aluminium cans and plastic bottles. Just like in Germany we now have lots of poor people rummaging through public waste bins bare handed looking for deposit bottles that someone else missed. This is demeaning and degrading work. We have recreated the job of 'waste-picker' from poor world slums. It also often leads to trash strewn on the street. 

2. Worthless

The reason a deposit is required to be charged is that the actual economic value of the materials concerned is so low or even negative. (Otherwise capitalism would already have spontaneously created a recycling industry, as it does for some items like newspapers.) Most of the bottles and cans turned in are never actually recycled because it would never be worth doing so. (Or if they are, it is in unsafe toxic ways in poor world countries.)

3. There are real solutions!

1. If you want to fix the problems of excessive resource consumption, charge more for using those resources and companies will find ways to use less, and to make their products more recyclable
2. If you want less trash to enter the ocean, invest in better waste-management systems (and fund their development in poorer countries)
3. If you want trash not to persist in the environment, require containers to be made of biodegradable materials

58,2024-07-09,CMV: Trump should drop out of the race more so than Biden,u/Affectionate-Ice3145,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz37gm/cmv_trump_should_drop_out_of_the_race_more_so/,changemyview,"Obviously this post has the potential to be inflammatory but I don’t mean it that way.

I am a Democrat and I think Biden should drop out to make way for a younger and more electable candidate. There are two reasons: most importantly, it’s genuinely not clear that he is up to the task of running the country, reputedly the most stressful job in the world; and also, voters are making it very clear that they want someone else. 

That said, I do believe that Trump is a unique menace to the American system of government. The biggest reason he should be disqualified is that he tried to stay in power illegally after losing a free and fair election. (Note: I won’t engage with anyone who tries to claim J6 was “peaceful” - it wasn’t, just watch the footage, or with anyone who tries to say the election was rigged - it wasn’t, there were 61 lawsuits and no evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome was ever produced) In my opinion, the peaceful transfer of power is the most important American tradition and it is shameful that after 250 years he broke that tradition. 

He is also a criminal. Even if you think there was political motivations behind some of the cases against him, he is getting due process and his day in court. This is how our system works - once a jury hears all the evidence and unanimously vote to convict, you can’t claim there wasn’t at least a reasonable case that he is a criminal. Even if you don’t care about those convictions, don’t you agree we could do better than someone who is a convicted felon?

He also has no policy ideas. He mainly wants to cut taxes, despite a massive and growing budget deficit, which isn’t much of a platform. He may withdraw from NATO, which would bring the Pax Americana to a definitive end. 

In the end, Biden being old and maybe relying on the people around him for decisions is less bad than having an active menace holding the reins of power. 

Instead of Democrats standing down on trying to push Biden out, Republicans should start trying to push Trump out. "

Most of my white friends assume I've faced some form of discrimination at some point in my life due to my skin color. It's true I have. However, I know some black people that can't relate to experiences like that. My dad for instance has only been pulled over by the police a handful of times despite, driving for decades. Conversely, those same white friends refuse to make an assumption of someone's economic class based off of their race/gender when there are well known statistics showing a clear correlation. 

Why do people feel this need to validate their individual experiences with statistics that aren't made for their individual experiences. Statistics are for urban planners, politicians, industry professionals etc. I want to understand if it's okay."
0,2024-07-09,CMV: Unqualified hatred of landlords is either hypocritical or impractical,u/badass_panda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz40b2/cmv_unqualified_hatred_of_landlords_is_either/,changemyview,"First of all, I'm not a landlord. I don't own any rental properties and haven't ever purchased real estate as an investment, but I've never seen anything intrinsically *wrong* with doing that.

However, over the last couple of years I've seen an increasing amount of redditors arguing that there *is* something intrinsically wrong with being a landlord ... that the basic idea of ""real estate as an investment"" is wrong, and that people who do it are fundamentally immoral. ""I wouldn't date a landlord"", ""landlords shouldn't exist"", that sort of thing. To me, that position is either hypocritical, fundamentally impractical, or nonsensical.

Now, to be clear: I'm not saying that all landlords are moral, or that there are no circumstance where ""property as an investment"" *is* immoral. I'm not arguing with people who have a problem with slumlords or predatory real estate companies or individual landlords that do everything they can to screw tenants out of money while never meeting their own obligations ... I've dealt with these people, and they suck. 

I'm focused on people that think the very idea of a landlord is wrong, which seems to boil down to one of three positions:

* **""Housing is a basic necessity of life, you shouldn't be able to profit off of it!""** OK... but the builder who builds the house wants money, the bank that pays the builder makes money off the loan... zooming out, you'll die a lot quicker without food than housing, yet people aren't claiming that farmers are evil or grocery stores are evil or chefs are evil. You'll die even faster without water, but folks aren't saying the utility company is evil for charging you for it. Why is charging people to live in a house they didn't build on land they didn't buy wrong? *This is a hypocritical position.*
* **""There's not enough housing -- landlords compete with homeowners to buy up houses and that drives up the cost of housing!""** If you think about this for a couple of minutes, you can see that landlords can't be the root cause of the problem here. There is a finite amount of people who need housing in any given market; prices go up because demand for housing outstrips supply of housing. Landlords buying up housing does nothing to decrease the supply of housing ... in fact, if it outpaces the growth of renters, it means rental rates go down, which reduces the value of rental properties. The issue here is that housing supply isn't increasing to meet demand. *This is a nonsensical position.*
* **""All property is theft. The only value comes through labor.""** From this perspective, ownership can only come through direct labor; your farm is yours because *you* work it, the food it produces is yours because it was created with *your* labor, and so on. Any form of capitalism is wrong; inheriting a house from your parents is wrong, having a 401k is wrong, opening a local bakery and paying employees is wrong ... etc. This is internally consistent, but requires a fundamentally different society than the one we live in -- and one that seems to produce much worse results. Yes, yes, ""real communism has never been tried"" and so on, but a capitalist-socialist hybrid seems to produce the best outcomes for the average person of any human society, so pragmatically I'm not trying to blow it up to be the next society to prove that real communism has never been tried.

Fair warning: I'm not super eager to debate with people who want to debate point #3 based on the belief that communism is the best economic model. If you're doing your best to actually live by these economic values I give you credit, but you will have to be *wildly* convincing if you want me to adopt a purely communist worldview."
1,2024-07-09,CMV: The best outcome between now and November for the Democrats to give them a good shot at beating Trump would be if Joe Biden passed away suddenly and peacefully from natural causes,u/forbiddenmemeories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz40md/cmv_the_best_outcome_between_now_and_november_for/,changemyview,"Okay so this is a pretty bleak one but... well, hear me out.

Joe Biden won in 2020 and until the last few months it seemed the expectation was that he would probably win again. The Republicans did poorer than expected at the midterms in 2022 and there probably weren't that many people who didn't vote Donald Trump in 2020 who would have been likely to switch to him at that point. However in the last few months it seems a lot more people have become worried that Biden is no longer up to the task of being president; I don't think people are especially down on his administration's policies and I think most swing voters probably think he's a decent man, but worries about his frailty seem to be the biggest factor driving an increase in support for Trump of late.

Running with Biden is a big risk for the Democrats given this, but replacing him would also be a big risk given how soon the election is, the potential uncertainty of fielding a new candidate and the challenge they'll have getting their message out there and enthusing swing voters, along with the fact that there's no obvious pick for the candidacy who is particularly popular. The best possible outcome I can think of for the Dems' electoral chances then, as sombre as it is to say, would probably be if Biden were to suddenly and peacefully die of age-related natural causes. No vice-president who succeeded a president to die in office lost the subsequent presidential election in the twentieth century - Teddy Roosevelt in 1904, Coolidge in 1924, Truman in '48 and Johnson in '64. Biden would be fondly remembered by the average voter for his lifetime of political service, and it's poor form to speak ill of the recently dead so taking shots at his policies and administration's record in office would come across as in very poor taste. Finally, whoever replaced him - probably Kamala Harris were it to happen suddenly and this close to the election - would benefit from being seen to have had their hand forced and stepped in to fill the candidacy out of obligation/duty rather than with a cynical eye on their chances of victory, and this would also serve to make them more electable. So all in all I think it's very likely that were Biden to pass away tomorrow, the Dems would have a significantly better chance of winning the election than they would otherwise.

Of course, there are probably other events that could happen which would boost their chances even more - say, if Trump were to drop out of the race and not endorse any other candidate - but working within the realms of things that conceivably might actually happen between now and November, this I think is the one event that would give the Democrats the best shot.

The two party system is fake and has always been fake. The Civil War was a masquerade; nobody ever intended to end slavery or separate the union. They put on a show, killed everyone capable of taking up arms with a war, drummed up a bunch of industry for times of prosperity, and while we all weren’t looking, they installed a central bank, removed the gold standard, and opened a new type of slave market. A lease based one, where the money was completely irrelevant, so long as it could be used to string wage slaves along so they might barely live and still produce taxes.

All of this is a show and everyone’s so distracted by which celebrity they want to puppet that it’s going to get us all killed. I can’t go back to work because I know the only thing it’s preventing is starvation; I get to pick which half of rent to pay this month and Trump raped a 13 year old.

356,2024-07-09,"CMV: The United States' lack of labor market regulations is a stain on the nation, benefiting neither workers nor the economy.",u/Current_Working_6407,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz4rd7/cmv_the_united_states_lack_of_labor_market/,changemyview,"For context, I was born and raised in the USA and have worked for international HR companies. One thing that becomes very obvious once you start researching regulation in other markets (e.g., in Europe, Japan, South America) is that the US is... particular.

Some of the major things that differentiate US labor law from most other countries (not just OECD ""developed"" ones):

* We are the only country with at-will employment, meaning your employer can fire you without notice or pay in lieu of notice (except in Montana!).
* Only government workers are guaranteed paid time off (PTO) on public holidays. There are no bank holidays for private sector workers.
* Work hour limitations don't cover a huge part of the population. They usually come from the bottom (e.g., in Colorado 32 hours makes you a full-time worker entitled to benefits) and don't act as a cap unless you're in specific safety-regulated industries.
* Private health insurance is linked to your employer, meaning that you lose health insurance if you lose your job (I know that temporary programs like COBRA exist).
* There is no such thing as mandatory parental leave, whether maternal or paternal leave for new parents.
* Employers aren't mandated to give us any PTO except for sick leave in some states and cities.
* We are not entitled to any bonus months (e.g., Christmas bonus, 13th/14th month bonuses).
* Our pensions are usually tied into 401(k)s, and employers aren't required to contribute a match towards these or even offer us one. We have social security, but it is very low and not income replacement for many workers.
* Although we are protected against retaliation for organizing, a very small segment of the US population is covered by labor unions or any type of collective bargaining representation.
* The federal minimum wage is not linked to inflation and is a poverty wage in many states (if the state or city doesn't mandate a higher wage, which many don't).

I also acknowledge that some states have much better bargaining power for workers, but that in the US this is a race towards the bottom, and massive proportions of the US population are not protected by these enhanced regulations.

This is a complex topic, but my point is basically that **people only defend this system out of ignorance, and there are no significant economic benefits to having such lax regulations on the labor market**. Nobody should be proud of this system, and the only people I've ever met who are proud of it are just ignorant. They see these laws as ""fancy European privileges"" and don't realize that Mexican and Brazilian workers have better labor market protections than American workers do.

The only benefits of this system that I can think of are:

* We probably have lower structural unemployment because our labor market is so flexible.
* We get more done as seen through our GDP per capita (though if you adjust for the hours we work, it's basically the same as compared to similarly developed economies).

I understand that some countries can ""take it too far"" to the point where they actually suffer from higher structural unemployment and a more rigid labor market. But I feel like there is a massive gap between where the US is now and where it should be. CMV!

**Edit: I need to get back to my little American job with no notice period and stop being on reddit, so this is how my view has changed. Thank you to everyone who engaged constructively and provided informative pushback. This is a complex issue and I've come away with a more balanced perspective.**

1. We should all dig into the data more. I feel like I needed to reference some econometric studies here. That's where we need to go to learn more about that actual impact specific regulations would have, instead of hand waving and being armchair economists (my specialty)
2. I didn't state clearly enough that there are trade offs with every system and regulation. I wasn't claiming we would have some utopian world, or that western european countries are somehow these magical places where workers are super taken care of any happy. I think we can improve our system with what we learn from other places, but that doesn't mean we need to or should just *copy* *everything*.
3. Common practice often goes beyond (and far beyond) the bare minimum requirements in the U.S., with many employers offering benefits like PTO, sick leave, and parental leave even without a statutory mandate. The ""bottom"" workers may be harmed more than average compared to other countries, but the average U.S. worker is doing better than I initially gave credit for. You can sum this up as ""the floor is lower, but the ceiling is higher"". We can disagree if that's good, but I'm convinced it's true.
4. I now see that there are benefits to workers from the flexibility and dynamism of the U.S. job market. The relative ease of finding a new job provides a safety valve and bargaining power to employees, even if it also means less stability. Some basic regulations to make employment more stable and predictable could be positive, but this is what the main tradeoff would be."

If rioters make it to the center of the capital, is there a flag they can capture that gives them full control of the Federal Government?

Is there some process by which flooding the courts with frivolous complaints about the election results in the courts granting you the presidency?

Overall, I don't see any mechanism attempted by which Donald Trump could have successfully maintained the presidency in the face of the election results. I view this as a deeply embarrassing event on behalf of our country and the mother of all political tantrums but not as a genuine threat to our democracy or established processes.  I think that attempts to characterize it as one are just political fearmongering meant to motivate the sluggish American public to vote."

I hate trump. 

That said, I really hate the Democrat party. I think not only are they duplicitous in their messaging compared to their actions, but they are quiet literally a horribly run organization. Corrupt, ineffective and literally just idiotic. It's actually infuriating as someone who considers themself liberal in many ways that this is the option I have as ""my side"". 

So why have I voted Dem? In 2 of the 3 elections I've been able to vote, literally, just they weren't Trump. I hate Hillary Clinton and like Biden the person but could see how his age/moderate stance was not going to work for a second term. But again, no matter how much I disliked them, they weren't a guy who....literally all of it, I don't need to explain. 

But I told myself in 2020: this is the last time. You know what voting for the lesser of two evils get you? A race to the bottom. I'm tired of the DNC acting they get my vote despite doing everything wrong simply because I'm supposed to feel guilty that THEY produce shitty candidates. And why do I say ""they"" not ""us""? Because the architecture of who they pick as candidate has been blatantly clear. Hillary was so clearly primed to run, that virtually no one else challenged her, and when Bernie did and *almost won*, what did they do? Fucking tried to torpodoe him so hard with media blackouts and establishment endorsement so hard that their [literal DNC chair had to resign](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/wasserman-schultz-wont-preside-over-dnc-convention-226088) when it became how clearly she was biased.   
  
So they do everything in their power to sync what appeared to be the perfect match to Trump in Bernie Sanders and lose by backing the [unpopular candidate in U.S. history.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/31/poll-clinton-trump-most-unfavorable-candidates-ever/89644296/) What do they learn? NOTHING. They decided after Hillary, you know what we need? Another old, establishment Dem. F\*\*king idiots, I literally cannot. Literally remember how bad Biden was doing in the primaries? Until Pete Buttigieg dropped out while leading him in the polls only to swiftly get a position in his cabinet? And how Biden's ""lead"" apparated only through Black voters in South Carolina largely after Obama's endorsement even when we know those states will never actually go Democrat in the general election? They ignore what Dems want across the country, and game the primaries to get who they want elected. 

Despite this, I not only voted Dem but *I phone banked Dem.* I saw the existential threat that was Trump and I said we need to do anything to put this fire out. And during that phone banking I learned one verrrrry important thing: Swing voters largely don't exist. The amount of people who swing between parties is neglible. **The real winner is voter turnout.** 

So the DNC's only currency for their candidate is will people actually show up to vote for them. And so they rig the primaries, nominate their establishment pick, and then hammer the message ""THEY ARE NOT THE OTHER GUY! YOU OWE YOUR COUNTRY TO SAVE US FROM *THEM""*. And then what do we get? The same horrible picks, getting worse and worse each cycle, and a guilt trip if we don't vote because it's somehow our obligation to choose between treasanous sex offender or feeble minded foreign policy hawk. 

I helped elect Biden. The Dems had 4 years to find a suitable replacement. What happens if I vote for the lesser of two evils again? Hope and pray next cycle will be better? Honestlyyyy f\*\*\*k right off with that logic. 

Don't vote, or better yet, show up and vote no confidence. Fuck partisan agencies who engineer our choices and then tell us we have to help them. "

But the thing is, all these are meant in a completely casual tone and manner, e.g. What up, ni\*\*a, ""You're such a retard"" etc. within the friend group where no one takes offense to them. There were many such conversations in a class-wide server with those not within the circle getting offended by these use of words, and this sparked a debate: Should casual use of slurs be fine?

My view on this is: Yes, they should be. Think of the ""fuck"" for example. You can use it to be rude to someone, or casually for whatever reason be it listening to a song, or joking with friends. The core idea being that while it is not acceptable to use a word in a rude manner, it should be fine in a casual tone.

""The gendered symbolism of the urban built environment is one reminder of who built the city. Feminist architect Dolores Hayden’s explosively titled 1977 article “Skyscraper Seduction, Skyscraper Rape” rips into the male power and procreative fantasies embodied by the development of ever-taller urban structures. Echoing the usual male monuments to military might, the skyscraper is a monument to male corporate economic power. Hayden argues that the office tower is one more addition “to the procession of phallic monuments in history—including poles, obelisks, spires, columns and watchtowers,”(..)

73,2024-07-09,CMV: There is no excuse not to support a substantial minimum wage increase in the US,u/MitchTJones,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dz8xl8/cmv_there_is_no_excuse_not_to_support_a/,changemyview,"The federal minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.25/hr, unchanged from 2009, despite **46%** inflation and [**152%** increase in total household wealth](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/) since. 

**Lagging behind the developed world**

* Germany, the world's third-strongest economy, and Australia (13th) have minimum wages over double the US's both by direct conversion and by [PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity).
* The UK (6th), France (7th), Poland (21st), and Belgium (23rd) aren't far behind that.
* The US's closest minimum wage peers by PPP are Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia; all far poorer with far weaker economies.
* Despite being by far the world's richest and strongest economy, the US's poverty rate is [6th worst in the OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/poverty-rate.html?oecdcontrol-0ad85c6bab-var1=AUS%7CAUT%7CBEL%7CCAN%7CCHL%7CCOL%7CCRI%7CCZE%7CDNK%7CEST%7CFIN%7CFRA%7CDEU%7CGRC%7CHUN%7CISL%7CIRL%7CISR%7CITA%7CJPN%7CKOR%7CLVA%7CLTU%7CLUX%7CMEX%7CNLD%7CNZL%7CNOR%7CPOL%7CPRT%7CSVK%7CSVN%7CESP%7CSWE%7CCHE%7CTUR%7CGBR%7CUSA&oecdcontrol-9f300511bc-var6=_T), beaten by Turkey, Lithuania, and Slovenia, along with all of Western Europe.

**Subsidizing poverty wages with taxpayer dollars**

* [**70%**](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-45) of federal assistance recipients in the US work full-time jobs.
* [**56% ($153 Billion)**](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-high-public-cost-of-low-wages/) of spending on federal assistance programs goes to full-time workers.
* [**81%** (**$54 Billion**)](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-high-public-cost-of-low-wages/) of the Earned Income Tax Credit cost goes to working families.
* Walmart workers *alone* costs taxpayers an estimated [**$6.2 Billion/yr**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/04/15/report-walmart-workers-cost-taxpayers-6-2-billion-in-public-assistance/#2fb08b41720b) in public assistance. Walmart has also captured 18% of the SNAP market, receiving **$13.5 Billion** in food stamp sales in 2013. The Walton family is the second-richest on the planet with a net worth of **$293 Billion**.

Not only does the government recognize that $7.25/hr is simply not enough to live on, it uses our taxpayer dollars to subsidize poverty wages from multi-billion-dollar corporations. This benefits corporations over the people two-fold: in allowing them to maintain a workforce of fed, able workers without paying them enough to be, and sabotaging federal assistance policies, causing them to seem unduly ineffective. A $15 minimum wage would put full-time workers well above the income limits for assistance programs, raising millions of people's income, cutting government welfare costs, and reserving assistance for those who need to rely on it.

**Addressing Counter-Arguments**

The corporations that benefit from low minimum wage often argue that:

* They will be forced to employ fewer workers due to increased cost. research and the 45 states + countless counties that have raised the minimum wage have shown this to be categorically false: [increasing minimum wage is correlated with an increase in employment](https://www.restud.com/1511-2/). These companies already complain of a ""labor shortage"" while posting record profits, so it's evident that they do need more employees and certainly have the money to pay them.
* They would be forced to raise prices, fueling inflation. [Renkin et al. (2020)](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research-and-impact/publications/the-pass-through-of-minimum-wages-into-us-retail-prices-evidence-from-supermarket-scanner-data), [MacDonald et al. (2016)](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/260/), and [Lemos (2020)](https://docs.iza.org/dp1072.pdf) all agree that a 10% minimum wage increase correlates to a **0.36%** price of goods increase. That means more than doubling the minimum wage to the Democrat Party's proposed $15/hr would increase prices by a maximum of just **3.85%** in the regions that currently operate under a $7.25 minimum, while more than doubling the income of their poorest workers.

The most common arguments used by lawmakers who oppose a minimum wage increase have been repeatedly proven to be categorically false or vastly overblown, and the lawmakers that do are doing so not out of interest in the wellbeing of the American people, but in the profits of corporations."

Restaurants should list two times: one time for when the last order will be taken, and one time for when the restaurant fully closes.

During that window, it should be expected that the staff can clean the kitchen and unused tables in any way that they can while the remaining customers eat. The window should be large enough for a large party to receive their food and have a reasonable amount of time to eat. Once they are past the cutoff, they cannot order anything other than more water.

After closing, their tables and anything else gets cleaned. Hopefully the head start would make that process easier on the staff.

Is this solution perfect? No. Is it better than listing a closing time and expecting customers to be polite and not come in too close to that time? I would say so."

-Look no further than Reddit. Ever since the Obama-era, this website has been non-stop pro-Democrat anti-Republican propaganda that bleeds into every sub.

-Look no further than Reddit shilling of Biden when the man obviously is cooked

-Look no further than shilling of Kamala when she dropped out of the last race with single-digit polling numbers. No one asked for her

-Look no further of the constant shaming of anyone that does not vote Democrat (remember Reddit cheering Hillary calling half the nation ""basket of deplorables""?)

-Look no further than they keep saying Jan 6th was a ""coup"" attempt, when in reality there were geriatric protestors present in the crowd, and an unarmed protestor got shot and killed.  

-Look no further than Reddit constantly body shaming non-democratically aligned individuals involved in politics, such as Charlie Kirk (I'm not a fan of his, but I don't body shame him)

-Look no further than every subreddit during election season needs to be saturated with pro-Democrat anti-Republican postings. 

We can also take a look at other platforms. X, back when it was called Twitter, was totally infested with bots. But because it was pro-democrat, Reddit didn't care. Right after Elon assumed control of X, everyone on Reddit suddenly starts talking about how many bots there are as if they weren't present all along.

People love to make fun of Trump voters. Whether it is news anchors or reddit memers. Nothing seems more common and easier these past years than elevating one's own superiority by pointing out Trump supporters' supposedly limited ways of being. 

To me this is lazy, hurtful, and stupid. Simply because such mean-spirited efforts lack curiosity and empathy as to why people like Trump. There is a world out there that is different from your own, and if you truly consider yourself a rational person, you should make every effort to understand it. I think that in order to do this, you have to acknowledge that you are also human. This means acknowledging you are irrational, emotional, and ignorant.

 We all are. This should tie us together, not separate us. Most of our reasoning and choices are not based on some enlightenment idea of logic and reason, but on fluctuating mental states and group identity. One of those irrational states is the need to separate us from other people and promote our little group as key holders and crown wearers. 

Every time I see someone utter some vitriolic spew or misinformed argument, I try to remind myself of a quote by James Baldwin: “I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.” This pain connects us, and it should be our compass for rationally understanding people who differ from ourselves. So, make fun of Trump supporters, but not because you are smarter, but because you are also an idiot.

But please, I am very open to changing my mind. "

Anyone who responds ""don't kill yourself the world is a better place with you"" and talks about how much they care, that it gets better, etc, most of all from strangers (and yes I say the same thing to my friends/family who are struggling while I don't actually believe it myself) is just saying those things because they don't want to feel bad if it happens and want to feel like they at least did something to try to stop the person. I guess it's a guilt thing.

If you Google ""how to kill yourself"" they just give crisis numbers and hotlines or articles on why suicide is bad, nothing useful.

I'm 24 and from the ages of around 11-12 until 17 I promised I would kill myself before my 18th birthday. I ultimately decided against it and now I'm more on the hook - there are more people that know me and care about me (mostly superficially no doubt, with the exception of a few people, mainly my parents who paid for my college tuition) that would be sad and so much time and money has been invested in me both by myself and others so it would be more of a waste now than before.

I often regret not going through with that promise.

There should be an easy, legal, and guaranteed way to voluntarily kill yourself. My main obstacle is the fear of failing and causing permanent damage such as paralysis or brain damage. I've considered using a gun, putting my neck on train tracks as a DIY guillotine, hanging, or hiring a hit man on myself. All of which are ideas that are either impractical, costly, and/or risk damage without fatality.

I won't be doing it anytime soon but I wish it was easier to do it. Would save a lot of stress for me and resources for others. I'm aware that I am a bit of a nihilistic Gen Z doomer but I just don't see it getting better and many people feel this way. I feel hopeless and useless and life literally has zero point.

Photo ID is required for such a vast number of everyday things in the US, from buying alcohol to driving a car, and the process of obtaining one is never considered too burdensome to be a reasonable demand.  Yet when the subject is voting, this calculus drastically changes and...frankly some of the arguments against it sound suspiciously like ""getting ID is too complicated for black people to manage"", which would be a racist argument in and of itself.

Am I missing something?  Would there be some hidden cost or tradeoff to getting your picture taken so the government can issue you a voter ID card like we do with driver's licenses, passports, and many other things?  Who would this disenfranchise?  You have to register to vote anyway, and voters are often registered at the DMV where they're getting a photo ID for a different purpose regardless.

Who benefits from not having such a system except for people and parties who actually do want to cheat?  And even if it did nothing, if there's no real down side, wouldn't it be worth it just for the placebo effect of rebuilding trust in our electoral process?"

This post isn't a list of reasons why I like Andrew Tate because I don't. 

This post also isn't a list of reasons why I think he did nothing morally wrong because he most likely did.

What I am saying is that do to the grey area in various laws he is likely not going to jail for anything he did or even paying fines and the like. Let me run down the list as to why.

1: He won a case getting his seized assets unfroze

2: He recently got his travel restriction lifted and is probably going to flea. Tate doesn't have the same restrictions that some blue collar guy working at the gravel pit do. He doesn't have a family and a job tying him down. He is rich and his job allows him to make even more money online so he can just leave to somewhere else and the courts in Europe can't touch him.   What incentive does he have to stay ? Worst thing the European court could do is take his physical assets like cars, houses, jewelry and cloths. I think he is rich enough he could get that shipped out of the country before the authorities knew he was fleeing but even if he wasn't what use do those things have if you are in jail ?  Tate thinks that the justice system is a scam and the charges a trumped up so he has no honor to uphold and doesn't care if he looks guilty. 

3: He has been accused of charges before and been found innocent, IIRC it was a domestic violence case from back when he was on big brother. "
0,2024-07-09,CMV: A Straight Cis Man’s Value and worth is derived from his ability to attract women,u/SmallBallsJohnny,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dzkck4/cmv_a_straight_cis_mans_value_and_worth_is/,changemyview,"Humans are literally the most sexually active creatures on Earth. Other than a few species of ape, no other animal on Earth engages in sex for enjoyment or any reason other than procreation. Sex and relationships are shoved in our faces 24/7 by entertainment and social media. Movies, tv, books and video games are all filled with conventionally attractive people in relationships and having sex. Hundreds of popular male and female pop and hip hop artists are producing dozens of songs about how awesome sex and drugs are. Porn has been an extremely popular and lucrative industry for centuries and we now live in an age where there is lots of money to be made from selling your body online, and the list goes on. Sex is fundamental to the human experience, and we all have a tendency to view it as the absolute pinnacle of personal achievement. There absolutely has to be some truth in the stigma surrounding men who are romantically/socially unsuccessful. Men who get laid and have done so regularly since they were teens are viewed as extremely desirable and successful people, since it is literally biologically wired into us to be sexual creatures like all other mammals.

I am compelled by the belief that a straight heterosexual man’s value and worth is tied to his ability to attract women, and that those who can’t are failures. To me, a normal good looking guy who has been getting attention from women since he was in middle school, went to parties and experimented in high school and now enjoys a regular love and sex life in and out of college is **objectively** superior and more valuable than an ugly socially awkward weird 30 year old guy who hasn’t seen a vagina since he was born and has never even held a girl’s hand in his entire life. It really isn’t that hard to determine which one women flock to and which one women avoid like a leper. Even a teenage fuckboy who had super awkward sex once after a party is vastly superior to that guy, since he is actually appealing to women. That kid is a real man and a winner; he is attractive, has the acceptable male personality and actually has the ability to attract the opposite sex. There is an extremely limited view on what makes a man attractive and valid; he **must** be at least 6ft, be athletic, be neurotypical, have a six pack, have a chiseled jawline, have a large penis, be flawlessly confident, funny and interesting, be a party animal, have a lucrative career with a big salary and have had lots of romantic and sexual experience to be considered valid and a real man. Anyone who does not meet these qualities is a loser. There has to be truth in that, it has been hardwired into us since the beginning and sexual success has always been an indicator of male worth.

If you are a straight cis gendered guy in your mid 20’s or even early 30’s and have never gone to a party or had any sort of attention from women whatsoever, there is something profoundly and deeply wrong with you and there is nothing to be felt but shame and regret . I understand this because I am that guy. I am the undesirable who has never had romantic or sexual attention from women in his life. I am very clearly not a man. I was born male and I identify as male, but I am not a *man*, I am a overgrown boy cosplaying as an adult male with none of the necessary requirements to be one. The average teenage boy who has more social, romantic and sexual experience than I do is far superior to me and his life has far more value than mine. I have failed my one biological purpose as a man. I don’t want to think like this but I see no reason not to."

Even if they say something like “this painting is objectively bad”, they have no ability to make that determination so what they’re really saying is “I immensely dislike it and I’m kind of overly egotistical because I think I’ve uncovered an objective definition of ‘badness’ and I think it should be universally recognized.”

Therefore, when you reply with “well that’s the great thing about art, it’s subjective” or “no art can be good or bad, it’s just in the eye of the beholder”, you’re adding nothing.

Maybe the original person should have been less absolute about what they said, but you’re not adding to the conversation by stating the obvious.

Just explain what you like or dislike about the art or what they’re saying. No big deal."

I beg to differ. Hammurabi (the originator of the eye for an eye saying) wrote the principle of an eye for an eye to prevent intergenerational feuds from occuring at the time whenever justice and retribution were done. I think such a principle could be brought back to act as a deterent to crime especially with the current mood of defunding/abolishing the police.

  
Basically, the police would be scaled back to an axuliary role and just investigate the crime (the don't arrest criminals here) with the courts not being places where trials are held, but where permissions for revenge are granted. Once investigations by the police are concluded, the victims of the crime are granted the power to conduct their revenge onto the perpetrators of the crime. To prevent violent intergenerational blood feuds from happening, the revenge permit only applies to the perpetrators and any accomplices and the family of the perpetrator has to accept the results and cannot take revenge unless a crime has been done onto them. This would cut down on acts of legal revenge spiraling out into intergenerational feuds that would last for many years to come as the family of the perpetrators are'nt legally allowed to take revenge unless a crime has been commited on them.

If we are going to defund or abolish the police, then let the people themselves take the law into their own hands. Let them be judge, jury and executioner and dispense out instant justice. It will make criminals think twice about victimizing the innocent, knowing that their victims are legally allowed to take revenge on them for their misdeeds.

Plus, my experiences with them as a Black woman have been mostly negative, and a large majority of Black men seem to dislike if not strongly resent Black women, and view us as inferior to women of other races. 

I believe Black men are part of the reason Black women have such a bad reputation and are looked down by other races. most men of other races protect, provide for, and promote the image of the women of their own race, yet Black men do not do any of the above as a collective and instead publicly denigrate the image of Black women in favor of other races of women. 

Many Black women are abandoned and traumatized by the men in their lives and develop stereotypical tough personas to protect themselves. Black women are unfairly masculinized and never given the space to be soft or vulnerable because of this. Women are seen as a reflection of their male counterparts status in society. Women are seen as trophies/prizes and Black men are at the bottom of the male hierarchy, so Black women are seen as worthless. 

Black women are no different from any other race of women but we are othered and treated terribly by all, and our male counterparts lack of care and support for us has resulted in men of all races viewing us as scum as well. "

On the contrary, every time I did try to initiate contact with someone, suggested we hang out (or even actually got to hang out a few times), it led to nothing in the long run. Other efforts such as asking them questions, paying compliments, talking about topics you both enjoy etc. never helped. All in all, being proactive didn't land me any friendships.

Help me be less close minded about feminists. I'm trying to keep an open mind here and not just label feminists as man haters but the complete lack of considering the perspective of men I have seen in most feminist circles makes it hard for me. I hope these comments open my mind that these people are actually just the minority of the group. 

I am a black man so I am on both sides of the “oppressed line”. I consider a lot of the perspectives of white people and women and have found in both areas that I have been right and wrong about a lot of perspectives. Considering that not all white people or women have it easier than me just because I'm a black man has helped me to see the nuance in life and question why I don't see many women considering the perspective of the average man. 

I remember at a college party years ago, a group of white women asked me what it's like to be a man and I said it can be really difficult sometimes. All 3 of them literally laughed in my face. The implication being “you're a man of course your life is easy” which is obviously absurd. No different than me thinking all white people have easy lives JUST because they're white. 

Even through this, I am willing to have my beliefs challenged if some open minded people are willing to do the same and help me to be less close minded about this group of people who, to me, seem to hate and blame men, project their own issues onto men and then disguise it as “activism”. 

Help me be less close minded about feminists. I don't want to be. I would like to see that there are actually reasonable people who have well thought out perspectives that consider both sides and not just the loud hateful “men are the only problem” type.

277,2024-07-10,CMV: Microsoft Excel is not Outdated,u/amortized-poultry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dztxpj/cmv_microsoft_excel_is_not_outdated/,changemyview,"Hey everyone,

I am an accountant. I periodically hear about how MS Excel is a ""dinosaur"", how there are ""better applications/programs"" and that we should have largely moved on from it by now. The ""we"" who should have moved on from it being accountants and business professionals in general.

There are four main reasons I think calls to move on from Excel are misguided or naive:

1. User-friendliness.

Excel uses formulas which are reasonably easy to learn and use. In recent versions of Excel, it will basically spoon-feed you with what you need next within a given formula. I've heard people suggest that Python would be better for data analysis or manipulation, and maybe it is, but it isn't on the user-friendliness level that Excel is for a non-programmer.

Additionally, it is reasonably easy to format Excel in several ways for practical or aesthetic purposes.

Also, as an accountant, it is very useful to be able to very *quickly* and *easily* add rows or columns to a table or worksheet with custom notes or calculated fields.

2. Versatility.

Let's say Excel may have been replaced by a program, app or programming language for something. By and large anything that is better than Excel is better than Excel at *one thing* and substantially worse or else not competing at all in others.

Does a program allow for prettier visualizations? It usually isn't as easy to manipulate the data.

Does a program allow for easier data manipulation? It usually has a higher learning curve or barrier for entry.

Is a program easier for beginners? It usually doesn't have the same useful formulas.

In other words, to replace the functionality of Excel, you'd typically need two or three different products and they may or may not easily interact with each other.

3. Usefulness with other programs.

This point may seem contrary to my overall point, but the fact is if you like something else better than Excel for some function or other, you can usually import an Excel file into it. As an example, I've recently gotten into Power BI and most of my visualizations start with an Excel file.

The fact is if you want to use another program for something, it's usually fairly easy to start with an existing Excel file and port the data over, or to download data from something else into Excel, there aren't many, if any, other products that allow you to easily transfer your work into most other data manipulation/visualization applications.

4. Programmability.

In spite of the relatively low barrier for usability, Excel has the ability to add programmable functions via VBA macro functionality. You can either record your macro by pushing a button and going step-by-step through the process you're trying to program, or you can step directly into VBA and write the code yourself.

What would get me to change my view?

This is a high threshold, but someone would need to make a compelling point that you could get all of the key benefits of Excel from just one application, or even maybe two in combination with each other. As much as I would love to be a generous OP, my view is that Excel *as a whole* has not been replaced, and that there is no other program that can do what Excel does with the same level of ease of use and user friendliness.

For purposes of this discussion, I won't consider substitutes like Google Sheets as different from Excel unless you make a point that depends on something different between the two."

This does not apply to criticism of communism/capitalism in theory. The two ideologies serve a different class people, so their theoretical critiques cannot be the same.

My hypothesis is that this happens because people in the West are braindwashed to fear communism. This means they are willing to go throuth the mental hoops to attack something when communism does it and justify it when capitalism does it.

Please try me. I'd love to change my mind and hear a critique of communism in practice that doesn't apply to capitalism in practice. I'm sure there are some out there"

Kosovo: Genocide being carried out by the Serbs. Justified.

Afghanistan: Taliban aided and abettet AQ. Withdrawing from Afghanistan was a big mistake though.

Iraq: This one is tricky because the intelligence was wrong. However, no one knew that at the time and had it been right it would have been justified. Given the information he had, bush did the right thing.

In his famous essay ""The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits"" really pushed forward the agenda of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism.

In my opinion, this idea is what has led to a lot of the economic, social and even governmental problems in our country over the last 50 years.

A corporation's sole goal should be the betterment of society, the improvement of the lives of its consumers, and being ethically, and socially responsible for the health, wellbeing, quality of life and wealth of its employees and consumers. Corporations never focus on profits or what shareholders want when it means that it will screw over consumers and employees.

I also believe that this philosophy is what has partially led to the rank corruption in the American Government. Corporations spend millions of dollars in bribes (""Lobbying"") to government officials in order to avoid regulation and restrictions that could hurt their profits. Even if such regulation would result in a healthier, happier and safer society.

The economic inequality in our country is far worse because of this philosophy. It allows big businesses and corporations to rake in profits, while putting small companies out of business. Corporate leadership teams continue to make more money each year, while laying off hundreds to thousands of employees who live paycheck to paycheck. These same corporations also continually charge more money for their products that are sold to the same people who are being laid off, despite already being in financial trouble.

I believe that if there is any hope for the United States and its future, it is through the abandonment of the Friedman Doctrine, and the institution of strict regulations and restrictions on Corporations. In honor of full disclosure, I will also acknowledge that I am a Democratic Socialist. So I already have an ingrained bias and mistrust of laissez-faire capitalism as it currently exists. But I'm also willing to acknowledge the good things about it, and am willing to listen to good reasons why Milton Friedman's philosophy isn't as bad as I might think."

0,2024-07-10,CMV: Conservatives Act Like ‘Snowflakes’ by Banning Dissenting Opinions,u/hockeynomics_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e00azd/cmv_conservatives_act_like_snowflakes_by_banning/,changemyview,"In my recent experience on r/conservative, I was banned for presenting a critical viewpoint on recent Supreme Court decisions. This raises the question of whether conservatives are behaving like ""snowflakes,"" a term often used to describe individuals who are overly sensitive to criticism or opposing views. Here’s why this approach to dissent is problematic:

***Explanation of My Post***

I can’t post screenshots but here is an overview of my comment.

My comment highlighted significant recent Supreme Court decisions:
1. **Reversal of Roe v. Wade**: Highlighting the rollback of constitutional protections for abortion rights.
2. **Emboldening Frivolous Lawsuits**: Noting how recent rulings may erode the authority of federal agencies.
3. **Reversal of Bump Stock Ban**: Addressing the implications of lifting the ban on bump stocks.
4. **Expansion of Presidential Powers**: Critiquing decisions that have potentially increased presidential powers to an unprecedented level.

### Why This Reaction Reflects a ""Snowflake"" Mentality

1. **Sensitivity to Criticism**:
   - **Avoiding Debate**: By banning users for critical viewpoints, it appears that some conservatives are unwilling to engage in meaningful debate. This reluctance to confront opposing ideas head-on suggests a sensitivity akin to the ""snowflake"" label often used to criticize others.
   - **Circlejerks**: Creating an environment where only one perspective is tolerated stifles discussion and growth. If conservatives only want to hear affirming opinions, they are demonstrating the same hypersensitivity they often accuse others of.

2. **Fear of Opposition**:
   - **Avoiding Discomfort**: The unwillingness to allow dissenting views can be seen as an avoidance of the discomfort that comes with being challenged. For any normal healthy individual person, facing and addressing criticism is crucial for growth and improvement.
   - **Shielding from Reality**: By banning dissenting opinions, the community shields itself from the reality that not everyone agrees with their perspective. This bubble mentality can lead to a distorted view of public opinion and policy impacts.

3. **Missed Opportunities for Growth**:
   - **Constructive Criticism**: Criticism is not inherently negative; it can highlight important issues and areas for improvement. By silencing dissent, conservatives miss the chance to address legitimate concerns and refine their positions.
   - **Strengthening Arguments**: Engaging with opposing views can strengthen one’s own arguments by addressing and countering criticisms. Avoiding this process weakens the intellectual rigor of the community.

4. **Inconsistency in Values**:
   - **Free Speech**: Conservatives often champion free speech and criticize ""cancel culture."" However, banning users for expressing differing opinions contradicts these values and suggests a double standard.
   - **Accountability**: Criticism of powerful institutions, including the Supreme Court, is essential for accountability. Silencing such criticism undermines the principles of transparency and accountability that conservatives often advocate for.

**Conclusion**

By banning users for presenting critical viewpoints, some conservatives are demonstrating a ""snowflake"" mentality, characterized by hypersensitivity to criticism, avoidance of opposition, and inconsistency in upholding free speech values. Encouraging open and respectful dialogue is crucial for a healthy democratic society. Embracing criticism and engaging with opposing views can lead to stronger, more informed positions and a more vibrant community."

People will spend to much money on their homes. Obviously a home is a necessity, so this makes sense. But we don't just spend money to have a roof and safety and privacy. People want large homes, pretty homes, attractive landscapes, etc. People will spend immense amounts of both time and money on acquiring and maintaining such a home.

On the other end of the spectrum, look at peoples bodies. If we were to analogize them to homes, most adults in America (and other first world countries) have bodies that are the equivalent of run down, dilapidated shacks. Most people are tremendously unfit and overweight but will not put forth anything even approaching the money, time, or effort they do into maintaining their home.

But you live in your body to a much deeper degree than you live in your home. Any reasonable person would understand that having a well functioning, attractive, body is at least equally (if not much more) as important as a functional and attractive home. Likewise, a muscular and attention grabbing body seems at least as appealing as a large and attention grabbing home.

My opinion is that the fact that most people ignore very basic needs (like physical fitness) and are willing to accept atrocious quality of life decreasers like nagging joint pains, obesity, muscular atrophy, constant fatigue, poor sleep quality, etc. but are not willing to accept things like a small home, or a vehicle with visible paint chips, etc. shows a senseless an irraitonal overfocus on material goods and underfocus on more practical things that affect our lives.

0,2024-07-10,CMV: Extreme introverts and extroverts both suck,u/Intelligent_Wind3299,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e01rqx/cmv_extreme_introverts_and_extroverts_both_suck/,changemyview,"I'll explain why:

  
- Extreme extroverts are selfish. They want the world to recognise them and their ""needs"".

- If a person in a group is contributing to the conversation, but isn't as hyper-loud, it spooks them. 

- Why the fuck should it ""spook"" you? The world isn't about you. Don't extreme extroverts get that? don't they get they're not that special or things and people don't have to fall into line?

- Extreme extroverts don't get, most likely due to arrogance or just a garbled mind that can't think at all, ""oh well, i shouldn't engage with said person"". They're narcissists or just masochists then, since they engage with people who they don't feel comfortable around.  Extreme extroverts are just people who narcissistly think EVERYTHING should fold to them. Like if they go into a cafe before closing hours, they probably expect the workers there to prepare the full menu for them just as they're cleaning up and packing up to go home to their families. 

- I've told extreme extroverts that if they don't like me being as loud as them they can not engage with me. pretty simple! but no....they take that as an insult and get even more attached. they're insufferable as human beings. 

  
Similarly, extreme introverts suck:

  
- they reckon they can just be silent and never contribute. they never can steer a conversation, and if even if they're asked ""what do you think?"" it's about ""mmmm...i dunno"".

- Extreme introverts want others to be like them. they want others to be as passive as they are. people cannot even be loud around them, because they are too timid to handle it.

- extreme introverts want the world to not like lively things. why? who are you to say what is acceptable or not? the world isn't your brain, sir or madam!

  
- extreme introverts often lack rudimentary social skills. sure, not everybody has to be lively. but they don't even say hello or smile when greeting. and often this is the first time one meets another. and they get annoyed when other people dismiss them. they might ""dismiss you"" since they think you're rude and they don't want to engage with you and move beyond you. again, bad social skills and awareness. if you present negativity, you get negavitity. it's not that difficult to comprehend. If a person hasn't done anything to you, then it can be strongly argued that you shouldn't fuck with them. You don't go to a randomer in a supermarket you've never seen before and may never see again and shout in their face. 

- I told an extreme introvert once, after I didn't select her for a volunteer session, that i thought she was rude asf and why must i tolerate an abrasive person on a trip. I was managing a group of volunteers, and she was shocked because she said ""she didn't realise"" and ""i didn't get it"" and other such dumb crap. They live in a bubble and think everything is about them. 

  
Both don't get give and take in life. they all think it's about THEM. nothing is just about THEM in life or for anybody. 

People have a right to be themselves. but this applies to ALL. not assuming the world MUST conform to you!

If a person is genuinely neurodiverse or has a mental disability, then fine, they cannot help it. But if not, there is no excuse IMHO. I'm not that much of an arse to condemn somebody for a genuine medical condition. 

All human actions are on a spectrum, and even if a person is neurotypical, extreme introverts and extroverts are in the cringe/abnormal ends of said spectrum.

Not going to be highlighting the positives of either because this is an election of who's the least bad. Positive qualities are few and far between

Biden's Cons 

1.) Screwing over the Rail Union. It is my genuine belief that most of this country's economic problems can be solved by More Unions and giving them more power. In 2020 I voted for him because he was pro union. He lied about that

2.) Free College. Why should I making 42K a year have my taxes increased so some accountant making $90K a year not have to pay back a loan HE TOOK OUT! I don't want a subsidy for the upper middle class

3.) Playing golf While we pulled out of the Middle East and left so many women and children to be subjected to torture for working for us. Impeachable offense in my opinion 

4.) He clearly is in some sort of mental Decline. And with nuclear codes that's a bad combination.

5.) The general distain the democrats have for the Police Department. While working in the field I've had 2 patients pull a knife on me. If it wasn't for The police I would've been dead. Voting for an Anti Police party is a no go for me.

6.) The general Disregard he seems to have for the fact that we're in a K Shaped Economy.

7.) Woke Policy's. Let me explain. I'm all for inclusion. But I work for a liberal State's EMS division. Here's an example of how bad it's gotten. We had 2 EMT's get in trouble. 1 EMT forgot to bring The AED to a heart attack. Killing the patient. He was sent to 1 day of retraining. Another EMT made a Monika Lewinsky Joke. He was suspended 28 days no pay, missed a rent payment and is fucked financially 

Trumps Cons

1.) A long history in NYC of fucking over construction Unions. There is no greater Economic issue this country has then the lack of Powerful unions.

2.) Giving this loose Canon the nuclear codes again. Granted he did meet with Kim Jun Un & never did anything

3.) Pathological lying. All the fucking time with everything

4.) The lack of respect for the military. Draft dodging and insulting gold star family's & The McCains

5.) He is also showing signs of mental decline.

Very torn on who to vote for.

1,2024-07-10,CMV: the mental health profession is inherenlty biased and are bullies,u/Intelligent_Wind3299,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e027aj/cmv_the_mental_health_profession_is_inherenlty/,changemyview,"Mental health people are bullies who think like Hitler.

If you're not in their concocted ""rank"" you're fucked. 

They never learnt any real professionalism. Professionalism at the root is ""I have a job to do. I will do it to the best of my ability"". they lack this in spades.

I'll give an example. There is a ""therapist"" on YouTube called Sadia Khan. She represents ho most therpaists are. She openly admits that her Islamic upbringing informs her worldview and actual clinical practice and has said that without Islam she'd be ""deeply depressed"". So when she treats her clients then, it's not on any objective clinical basis but her own cultural biases. Moreover, she's also very pretty, and she most likely like most pretty women has been spoilt asf and does not have a thorough conception of the world around her. As some cultures spoil women more than men, which is common in South Asia as she's Pakistani, then she's probably had family, friends and her community let her off for stuff and thus it's clouded her judgments and appraisals. What's more is that she claims to be very Muslim but doesn't even wear a hijab. So then she has this holier-than-thou attitude whilst not following her own religion properly. 

Most mental health pros are exactly like her - shady, shoddy, and hypocritical. yet, they tell others to be ""normal"" when they don't espouse ""normalcy"". And like her, they are highly religious and think life can ONLY be seen through a religious lens, when clinical practice and basic common sense and observation says differently. If a person isn't religious at all, this doesn't alone affect functioning in society or one's emotional state. In short, it doesn't cause mental distress. So it's not a clinical issue and thus NOT in the strict purview of psychiatry.

IMHO at least, if you give instructions, then walk the walk and talk the talk, or own it. If a person claims to be highly religious and doesn't follow it, then don't ""demand"" clients do. who are you anyhow? It's funny that clinicians have these abnormal cognitive states. False authority based on some inner dumb psychology is a bad cognitive state. 

What's more is that they reckon they can ""beat"" people who ""look smart"" because their God tells them to. Yet they would say bullying is wrong, when what they call for is bullying, this shows they're mentally fucked up. They're actually cowards since they never follow up on it. 

They also openly flout their own guidelines.

It's a fact that gives more grace and leeway to somebody who looks pretty or has a chirpy demeanour. They KNOW that they shouldn't but they do. it's their bad cognitive states that do this. little kids can follow instructions well. you tell a six year old ""don't wear your dirty shows inside the house!"" and they will do it. Yet a supposed ""normal"" grown 35 year old man or woman who is seemingly ""well-trained"" cannot note that how somebody looks should affect treatment procedures? 

They are a shoddy profession and I genuinely despise them. It's amusing when I dismiss them when meeting in non-clinical settings, since apparently if they're so ""confident and normal"" they should handle people not greeting them well. right?

0,2024-07-10,"CMV: Looking back on it, the mask policies during COVID didn't make a lot of sense",u/ToranjaNuclear,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e06tk1/cmv_looking_back_on_it_the_mask_policies_during/,changemyview,"First off, to clarify, I'm NOT saying that masks aren't effective, this isn't the point here. My view is more like this: even if there was absolutely no controversy on the compulsory use of masks and everyone wore them, it still wouldn't have been as effective as it should because of how lax both the policies and ourselves were about it.

I remember back in 2020 when the first thousand cases started popping up. I had an acquiantance in the medical field who worked as a volunteer in one of the first makeshift testing centers in his city. I remember how talking to him it looked like a battlefield, and how tight the protection they were had to be: he had to cover himself from head to toe, a cap, glasses, gloves, **TWO masks** (one N95 and one surgical mask), an apron, etc. I remember he describing how horrible it was to wear them because they couldn't in any way loosen or fix it after they wore it, and all of it had to be taken off and scrapped only at the end of the day and he had to take a bath before leaving the testing center.

And he still got covid. Like, a week later. As well as pretty much everyone who worked there.

Compared to this, the way people used masks against covid, even the ones that did in fact worry a lot about it and wore them religiously, seemed...almost useless. And I'm not even thinking of the knit masks or the way people used it under their noses, nor the fact that many people still had to take public transport to go to work, because this wasn't their fault.

But people would take their masks off to fix them in the middle of others, would fix their masks with their hands (without even properly cleaning them). They would also go days or weeks at a time without changing masks, even surgical ones which are supposed to be completely disposable (I heard that N95 could be used for at least 3 days, but I'm not sure how truthful that is).

As early as 2021 things started slowly opening again, and then people would go to restaurants and take their masks off to eat, to talk with waiters, would keep their masks off even when they were just talking and not eating. And even if they did put them back after properly washing your hands, this would deem the mask useless since if your mask is contaminated, you've already contaminated your hands.

People used masks made out of random cloth they found in their house, even when surgical/N95 masks started becoming available again. And it was fine, because the important thing was just using a mask, any mask, even if it obviously wouldn't be effective at protecting themselves or others. 

So yeah, I'm not disputing the efficacy of masks themselves, *but* considering how lax the policies were and how virtually nobody used them the way they should have, I have to wonder if the mask mandates everywhere were actually effective, or if they were just a palliative measure to make it seem like there was something being made in the way of preventing the spread of covid.

Is there something like a study showing that mask mandates actually helped?"

When I’m referring to expectations I am more so saying that if the expectation of decency being low is there, people are going to be less inclined to do anything to improve it. This can be applied to a lot of things where the more inaction there is on fixing something the chances of people collectively caring to do anything will lower.

People blasting their music or doing dances in such a tight confined space when people are coming back from their 9 to 5, and just being a general nuisance makes transit seem like a last resort that you only have to do if you don’t have the money.

Highest example is people doing hard drugs on the train. The fact it’s somewhat expected to see people injecting or smoking hard drugs in a train station or on the train is not going to make it appealing to the average person and it makes it look gross.

Simplest answer? Don’t be super individualistic. It’s a public space and those people are guests. If you contribute to the problem, stop and be considerate. If you’re bothered by people doing those things, do not be afraid to call them out and tell them to stop.

I realize my view may be a bit aggressive and there are more problems with transit not being taken seriously, but I do think the standard of decency is a major contributor."

Today it’s predators getting beat up, tomorrow it could be someone of a marginalized status being falsely accused of being a predator but because the ground work of dehumanizing marginalized people(lgbtq, people of color, disabled people, homeless people, etc) has already begun. who is going to believe them anyway???? 


Am I thinking too deeply and should we allow these guys to keep beating these people mercilessly or does the law need to step in and step in quickly

Change my view, help me be okay with this. I have a big heart, but I absolutely hate predators. I guess I’m really asking for a justification for the violence other than the fact we despise these people."

European countries such as Spain, Italy and others that are geographical entry points have difficulty securing their borders which only encourages more illegal immigration.

Unfortunately these migrants oftentimes do not respect the local culture and commit crime at all much higher rate than their native European counterparts.

They also tend to come to Europe with little to no marketable skill so they stay relatively poor, form their own enclaves, displacing the native French, Spanish, Italian communities and replace them with dangerous ghettos.  Since they are often stuck in these poor ghettos they do not assimilate to the local cultures even from one generation to the next meaning that all the problems the first generation brought will only be passed down to the second generation.

This only exacerbates the issue which even right now is a complete crisis.  To be frank even just looking at the situation now, I have no idea how any natives of Spain, Italy, Germany etc could possibly be living decent and safe lives much less feel confident that their own children will be able to enjoy anything resembling safe urban/suburban life in the majority of European metros."

# The Israel-Palestine Conflict, a Tale of Unfree Migration

# Zionism Reborn



	The story of the Israel-Palestine conflict begins with the end, not the beginning, of Zionism. For more than a thousand years, Jews all over the world would prolaim “next year in Jerusalem” at the end of their prayers. When the Messiah finally returned, held traditional Jewish theology, the Jews would return triumphantly to the Temple Mount and rebuild the Temple of Solomon brick by brick, heralding the kingdom of God. 

	But by the early 1800’s, this idea was starting to fade from common practice. A conference of rabbis held at Frankfurt am Main over July 15–28, 1845, removed all prayers for a return to Zion and a restoration of a Jewish state from their rituals. Meanwhile across the pond, The Philadelphia Conference of 1869 followed the lead of the German rabbis and decreed that the Messianic hope of Israel is ""the union of all the children of God in the confession of the unity of God"".

	Yet others were letting go of Zion by looking for a new one. American Jews carried out experiments in settlement building in Mississippi and Grand Isle, NY during the 1840’s, but met with failure due to lack of demand. The Jewish people, it seemed, were uninterested in Zion. As far as anyone could tell in the early 1800’s, the Jews would remain in diaspora forever, having forever renounced their claim to Palestine. 

	Thoughts of this future kept a young man by the name of Theodore Herzl awake at night. Seeing rising antisemitism, pogroms, and hostile racial thinking, he believed that a Jewish state would eventually become a matter of Jewish survival. Taking a queue from the sporadic and tiny groups of Jewish immigrants who began immigrating to Palestine in the 1880’s - the first Aliyah (a term referring to Jewish immigration to Palestine) - He would go on to found the Zionist Organization, the premier advocate of Zionism in the world, and set in motion the chain of events that would lead to the foundation of Israel. 

	Even though Herzl had an obvious strong preference for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, he worked other angles as well. International support was sought for an Argentinian solution to what was now referred to as “the Jewish Question”, and Herzl was also intimately involved in the “Uganda plan”, which would have involved seeking British support for a state there. 

	While Herzl never lived to see it, the Balfour Declaration would eventually put an end to the debate about where a hypothetical Jewish state would be. The result of years of diligent lobbying by the fantastically wealthy Anglo-Russian chemist Chaim Weizmann, much is made of Balfour and its consequences, belying the brevity of the document itself:

	*""His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.""*

	The document, simply put, was just a piece of paper. But in the wake of events to follow, it would take on a life of its own. Note the use of the term “national home”, a concept that had no legal precedent, as well as being composed of more exceptions and conditions than not for this national home to be established. As Herzl predicted in one of his many papers on the issue, the British would have no intention of seeing the project through the awkward phases that would come, and abandoned it as soon as it became inconvenient.

	This breaking point would, however, take a while to arrive. While the Zionists now had their political ideology and their location, they still lacked one very critical ingredient - Jews. Numbers on this issue are somewhat difficult to come by, but on the eve of Balfour, [~1% of Jews~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Peace_to_End_All_Peace:_The_Fall_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_and_the_Creation_of_the_Modern_Middle_East) belonged to a Zionist organization. Hardly the makings of the massive waves of immigrants Herzl imagined would be necessary to make the Jewish State a reality. The numbers of immigrants themselves bear this out - from 1904-1914, just 40,000 Jews made Aliyah, or immigrated to Palestine. The eventual president of Israel, David Ben Gurion, who arrived in Palestine during this wave, would claim that of this number, “90% left” after a few years. But the Third and Fourth Aliyahs saw significant increases, bringing 120,000 more immigrants between them through the 1920’s. Then came the fifth in the 30’s, bringing 174,000 over three years. These immigrants would not leave, and would become the core of the eventual state of Israel. 



# Visa Denied - The Jewish World in 1939



	The reason why comes down to two answers - Hitler and the United States. Anti-Jewish pograms across Eastern Europe in the 20’s gave way to wholesale persecution by the Nazis in Central Europe in the 30’s. By now it was clear to most Jews that they needed to escape those regions. But to the surprise of the Zionist Organization, the average Jew looking to make a getaway from Central Europe had their eyes set on New York, not Jerusalem. But the United States operated under a number of quota systems to determine how many people would be admitted each year. Throughout the 30’s and 40’s, the number of Jews on the waiting lists for entry was [~more than ten times larger than the number of visas actually granted~](https://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-10-2-a-united-states-immigration-policy-and-hitler-s-holocaust). Seeking freedom from what was becoming an intolerable situation in Europe, it rapidly became apparent to many Jews that their only option was Palestine. 

	But that option was also beginning to fade away - Arab anger was rising in Palestine, with many identifying Jewish immigration with the British colonial administration, and fearing the consequences of further inaction in the face of massively growing immigration. The spark that lit the match became known as the Cement Incident of 1935. As Arab dockmen unloaded a ship full of cement crates in Jaffa, now a southern suburb of Tel Aviv, one of the crates burst open - a full search revealed a panoply of hundreds of Lewis machine-guns, rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition - all bound for a pseudonymous Jewish merchant in Tel-Aviv. Arab militias rapidly formed, buoyed by now legitimized fears of a Jewish armed takeover of Palestine. The Israel-Palestine Conflict had begun.

	While the conflict pitted the Arabs against the British and Jewish militias simultaneously, and hence weakened them greatly in the future Arab-Israeli war, it appeared to result in a victory for the Arabs. The British, annoyed at the inconvenience of the revolt, fulfilled Herzl’s predictions and issued [~the White Paper of 1939~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939). It restricted Jews from owning more than 5% of Palestine’s land, heavily restricted immigration, and furthermore indicated that after 5 years, the Arab majority would get to decide whether any more could come at all. The Jewish State, it appeared, was dead. 



# The Birth of Israel



 	World War 2 would come along and change all that. While the events of WW2 are well-known to most and therefore won’t be dwelled on here, the aftermath left the 33% of Jews who remained alive with a very important question - “What do we do now?” There wasn’t much of a question in the framework of the time. America wasn’t exactly about to extend an open hand unless the Jews in question had degrees in experimental physics, and the thought of remaining in Central Europe, having witnessed the complete destruction of their communities and homes, was a non-starter. They no longer had anywhere to go, and the Allies were more interested in reconstructing their own countries than helping people who weren’t French, British, or American. And an honorable mention can be given to the Soviets, who simply abducted any Soviet Jews they could find back to labor camps in the USSR, only letting them leave beginning in the 1960’s.

	But Palestine wasn’t an option either, at least not legally while it was still controlled by Britain and the White Paper. Thus began *Aliyah Bet,* the plan B to get out of Europe. Jews packed onto illegally chartered ships and sailed for Palestine in the hundreds of thousands, only to be turned around by British warships more than half of the time. In one famous case they were forced back into Hamburg harbor - 4500 Jews disembarking into a city of people who were busy burning their Nazi party membership cards. The majority though were stuck in British “internment” camps in Cyprus, once again reliving their recent past of confinement, food shortage, and disease. The experience strengthened the resolve of many of the people who found themselves in these camps - there was nothing behind them in Europe. They would make it to Palestine or die trying.

	Meanwhile, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, convened at the request of the British, was busy making recommendations that would result in Resolution 181, the partition of Palestine. Jewish interests were heavily represented to the committee by the Jewish Agency and Jewish National Council, while the Arabs boycotted the deliberations entirely, asking “why would we help you decide how much of our own land to give away?” Instead, they repeated a four point demand of the UN:

1. A complete cessation of the Jewish migration to Palestine.
2. A total halt to the sale of land to Jews.
3. Cancelation of the British Mandate in Palestine and the Balfour Declaration.
4. Recognition of the right of Arabs to their land and recognition of the independence of Palestine as a sovereign state, like all other Arab states, with a promise to provide minority rights to the Jews according to the rules of democracy.

 	Unsurprisingly, the eventual plan voted on and adopted by the UN followed largely along the lines that the Jewish Agency and National Council was proposing - Palestine would be split. The new state of Israel would receive 57% of the land and 2/3rds of the coast, Palestine would receive the rest. Every nation in the newly-founded Arab League voted against. The President of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, [said ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azzam_Pasha_quotation)shortly after the Resolution’s adoption ""Personally I hope the Jews do not force us into this war because it will be a war of elimination and it will be a dangerous massacre which history will record similarly to the Mongol massacre or the wars of the Crusades.""



# The 1948 Palestine War



	Arab opinion was set - they believed that the resolution necessarily entailed that the 400,000 Palestinians living in the Jewish partition would be dispossessed under the plan. This was not an unreasonable belief considering the now longstanding animosity between the two groups, and the influx of ever-increasing waves of immigrants from Europe. Violence began to surge - Arabs and Jews began to attack one another in ever-escalating skirmishes that eventually broke down into a full civil war. The fighting on both sides was merciless - Jewish and Palestinian militias engaged in massacres and counter-massacres, but overall, significant Jewish military success meant that they began to execute Plan Dalit, a military operation that would push the borders of Israel significantly beyond the lines of the partition agreement into something roughly recognizable as the modern borders of Israel and Palestine (though Palestine would go on to lose much more later). 

	The nations of the Arab League would eventually join the war after the British finally declared an end to their control over the region, but their intervention didn’t change the outcome. For Israelis, this fact can be considered nothing short of a miracle - their tight military relationship with the West was only a dream for the future, and they were largely on their own. It was only through secret arms purchases smuggled out of a willing Czechoslovakia that they were able to keep their military afloat until the war broke down into a ceasefire at the end of 1948.

	After the war, roughly 80%, or 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes and forced to flee into the remainder of Palestine or into other Arab countries. This process, known as the “Nakba” or “Catastrophe”, was marked by significant brutality on the part of the now Israeli forces, many massacres were carried out, and a policy of systemically poisoning wells was designed to prevent any possible return to the villages the Palestinians were fleeing. While many primarily Israeli historians argue that this somehow did not constitute an ethnic cleansing, it solved two problems for the new Israeli state - what to do with hundreds of thousands of people who had every intention of continuing to struggle for their land, and what to do with the 700,000 Jewish immigrants who would arrive in the first three years of the Israeli state’s existence. The euphemism of “population transfer” was accomplished - it is unlikely that the number expelled and the number arrived is simply a coincidence.



# Israel-Palestine: the Conflict that Keeps on Giving



	The remainder of the conflict remains locked in the framework that was defined in 1948 and earlier, and doesn’t change the considerations or motivations of the parties involved. Palestinians in alliance with the Arab League would continue to launch wars with the aim to take back all of Palestine and implicitly kill all the Jews within, the Israelis would win, and then quietly take an extra settlement area, remove a few rights from the Palestinians under their control, and flatten a few more villages. This was repeated during the Six-Days War, the Yom Kippur War, and the many Initfadas and informal acts of resistance both before and after. 

	Throughout this story there are clear cases of mistakes, atrocities, and outright brutality attributable to both sides of this conflict. But taking a step back, one can ask “What could they have done differently?” Could the Jews have found a path after World War 2 that didn’t involve fleeing to Palestine? Should the Arabs have simply waited for some kind of solution as to what a partition would look like in practice while Jewish immigrants and weapons flooded into Palestine? Could Israel have chosen not to expel Palestinians from the areas it controlled? What would that have looked like? It is easy to point to a single massacre, terrorist attack, or bombing and argue that it was unnecessary or unjustified, but it is much harder to identify where one side could have foundationally veered off its course and charted a wholly, not just cosmetically, different path. 

	An even better question to ask might be: “Where was everyone else while this was going on?” The first finger falls on the United States. As of 2021, more than 1.5 million immigrants arrive in the US each year, significantly more than would arrive in Israel over the first three years of its existence. Considering the size of the waiting list for Jewish immigration to the US before and after World War 2, it is not just likely, but almost certain that had the US opened its borders to those refugees, Zionism would have died on the vine. 

	Immigration restrictions weren’t just a problem for the Jews, however. Palestinians fleeing the Nakba arrived in their brotherly neighboring countries only to be packed into cramped refugee camps and be told by their new overlords that their freedom would come next year in Jerusalem. Generations of Palestinians would grow up in these camps, unable to build lives for themselves that did not revolve around one day returning to a homeland that grew ever more distant year after year. Old Palestine became ringed with refugee camps from Lebanon to Egypt, turning it into a Colosseum for two peoples barred by circumstance from moving on from the past.

	Lastly, we can look at our overall international diplomatic regime, a system defined by unfree migration, a focus on freezing conflicts in place rather than resolving them, and a myopic view of conflict that is more interested in the latest story than its true nature. There is plenty of money to spare for temporary refugee camps, temporary peace agreements, and temporary governance, but nothing to spare to encourage Arab countries to allow their Palestinians populations to further integrate, as many Palestinians desire to do. Likewise, there is no effort to spare to cut down the ever-growing waiting list for refugee visas, the same lists that forced the Jews to travel to Palestine and begin the conflict. A conflict begun by the refugee waiting list can now be ended by clearing it. Isn’t it time we did?

0,2024-07-10,CMV: It doesnt make much of a difference who wins between Trump or Biden,u/sufinomo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e0cp3p/cmv_it_doesnt_make_much_of_a_difference_who_wins/,changemyview,"This post is mainly focused against Democrats because reddit users are convinced that this is the more favorable choice. 

Both parties do a poor job of really changing much in their targeted areas. Each party has made the same types of promises for over a decade. Neither of them have developed much in the process of implementing these targets. For example health insurance is still very weak in the United States. The democrats now take away peoples ability to even decline having health insurance. You either pay way too much for poor insurance or you have to pay a penalty for not having insurance. Atleast with the Republicans you have the option to just not pay a penalty or not have insurance. Some people simply cant afford either of them. In the end I feel like most of the benefits people can get only go to people who have an extremely low income. The income you have to have is very very very low, like 15000 a year. This system clearly doesnt reward most people. IIn order to qualify for actually good health insurance you need to have that level of income, which essentially makes it useless for most people. 

Another issue with Democrats is that their regions have extremely high taxes, yet they seem to do a poor job of managing their budgets properly. The places with high taxes tend to have housing issues. What purpose does raising taxes to very high levels achieve if people are struggling for housing? Atleast the Republicans tried to do something about housing, for example [Abbott Takes Aim at Corporate Investors Purchasing Single-Family Houses](https://thetexan.news/issues/texas-taxes-spending/abbott-takes-aim-at-corporate-investors-purchasing-single-family-houses/article_914c6b2a-e638-11ee-916d-17c5e69a56fd.html). As for the crime fighting inititive it seems to be quite low for the Democrats, as c[rime is Making Americans Flee Democratic States](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography/news-events/department-announcements/crime-is-making-americans-flee-democratic-states.html). 

As for the Republicans, they clearly have no interest in laws that benefit workers. Their goal is to take all power away from workers, and give more power to owners. The problem is that this is also generally true about Democrats. I havent heard anyting about benefiting workers or unions from the Democrat side. As far as I see it the Democrats are Republican in what they can get away with. The republicans want to cut taxes, but realistically speaking im not convinced that Democrats raising taxes will benefit me individually.

I believe that Haliey Welch, the girl who has gotten famous for her “Hawk Tuah” phrase on a microphone, only went viral and became famous because of her looks.  

A lot of guys probably took a look at that clip of her simulating spitting on a penis and visualized this good-looking, slim, young, blonde girl doing that to them.  I firmly believe that if she was not attractive or if she were obese or what have you, the clip would not have gone viral, she would not have signed with a management team, and she would not be close to getting a reality series.  To me, the clip is only viral and famous, and so is she strictly because of her looks and not what she said.  If she weren’t attractive, this would be a nothing burger."

I am speaking from my heart.

I am a woman in her thirties. I have noticed that the attention I get from random men has significantly gone down (just fyi, I am not ""looking for attention from men"" - I have been happily married for 10 years - I just have passively noticed I don't really get hit on like I used to). I used to get hit on all the time when I was in my twenties, from men my age well into their fifties and up (ew), and back then I look way younger than my age. 

I got a haircut the other day, and my hairdresser was like ""wait until you hit your forties, and become practically invisible to men"". I was like wtf, ew. It turned me off the idea of men.

I'm not bisexual or lesbian, but the idea of my husband always secretly visually preferring the 23 version of me he dated, versus the aging me, is repulsive. My husband is a sweetheart and says he thinks I'm beautiful, but part of me still is paranoid. It makes me wish I was a lesbian, because (okay I can't speak for all women), but I myself find aging to be actually quite attractive. I think it adds to attractiveness - not detracts (up until you become elderly). From what I am seeing with my own eyes, what I get fed by society, and from what other women tell me, men clearly prefer younger women. Like, basically 18 year olds. 

I remember having male coworkers my age who were like ""I would never get with a 19 year old - that's way too young"" or ""she's like a little sister to me"", but then I see with my own eyes them blatantly acting like perverted creeps towards these very young women. These men are l.y.i.n.g. 

I wish I was a lesbian. But I'm not. I want a partner who finds the idea of aging to be attractive (but not in a creepy way). From what I see, it's only women who have that mindset. For men, if they prefer women that are 30+ then immediately it becomes a whole ""mommy fetish"" thing that I find repulsive."

When getting into a relationship for both men and for women communication is essential. Good communication involves setting boundaries and standards clearly towards a prospective partner. For example, a man who choses to get into a relationship may say look I am looking for a partner who is a virgin like I am. If that is his preference/standard. Likewise a woman can say look I am straight I am looking for a guy who is straight and has not previously engaged in bisexual activities. If that is her preference/standard. I think this is fine and should be encouraged. What I would say is however it is not the duty of the man to do disclose that he is bisexual before getting into a relationship with a woman as it is not his preference/standard. The man’s moral duty is to answer the question truthfully. This a similar situation to the first example. It isn’t the woman’s duty to admit to sleeping with however many people she has slept with because it is the man’s preference. Instead it is the woman’s duty to tell the truth of the man inquires.

About the STIs: anyone who has an STI is morally required to disclose this information before sleeping with someone either man or woman. This is no different for bi men.

The reason for this post: communication on relationships is key and sometimes the responsibility of communication falls on a particular person. Also having preferences and standards out in the open is helpful for everyone.

I am obviously looking for people to try and change my mind. But also reply if you agree with me but using an argument that I have not mentioned so I can get a different perspective."

I’m not a Ben Shapiro fan or hater but it’s ridiculous how redditors think they could easily stand up to him in a real life debate setting. People (typically those from the left) don’t realize you don’t get to browse the internet for counter arguments. Instead they automatically bash people on the right for different views. The dude went to Harvard Law and is clearly educated regardless of whether you agree with him or not. 

A great example of his debating skills is the Ben Shapiro vs Destiny debate on Lex Friedman’s channel where Destiny, a popular liberal streamer, stood his ground but never had the “upper hand” in the debate. I can almost guarantee 99% of reddit could not do what Destiny did and would just end up on another Youtube compilation “Ben Shapiro owns triggered liberal”.

* There would be common sense exceptions such as its OK if your artillery shell lands on a weed or if your tank accidentally runs over a rodent

* War is environmentally destructive. It brings sadness to the heart to see animals destroyed or 100 year old trees burned. Even the soldiers who do the killing feel sad about it. We should get rid of this and spare innocent beautiful nature from our destruction 

* War would still be permissible and it would still occur, but it would be less destructive in terms of human life. It would be illegal to cut trees down and also illegal to use trees as cover to block enemy attacks (as this would harm the tree). Therefore no combat would take place in forests or wildlife areas, and combat would only take place in plains or deserts or in roads that travel through the forest. This would limit the scope of combat   and lower the amount of fighting that can happen. This will result in less soldiers KIA and wounded

0,2024-07-11,CMV: True friendship is different from mere companionship,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e0hfcx/cmv_true_friendship_is_different_from_mere/,changemyview,"Almost all philosophers have neglected friendship as one of their main topics. Maybe we take it for granted that we know what it means, so we haven't learned about its depths, potential for development, or its various hues and their respective meanings.

The most crucial thing to keep in mind is:

One cannot survive alone, so one needs friends. Furthermore, one cannot be very friend as long as they are in need of one another, as the need turns the other person into an object. The only man who can be both a friend and a solitary person is that man. However, what he wants to share is his abundance of love, not his need or thirst, but rather his joy.

When this kind of friendship occurs, it no longer belongs under the term friendship—rather, it has assumed an entirely new meaning that I refer to as ""friendliness."" It has transcended relationships since, in one way or another, all relationships are bondages; they enslave both parties. Being friendly is just the act of sharing without asking for anything in return, without expecting anything in return, and without even feeling grateful.

It is the purest form of love to be friendly.

It is not required, nor is it necessary:

It is utter abundance, euphoria overflowing.

The DNC has lost touch with its base, and it’s time we show them we won’t be taken for granted.

1. Ignoring the Base
The DNC keeps pushing Biden, an incredibly unpopular and extremely old candidate, on us. They think we’re too stupid to notice and that we’ll vote for anyone with a ‘D’ next to their name. It’s insulting. We deserve a candidate who truly represents us, not just the party elite.

2. Kamala Harris
Kamala Harris as VP was a blatant DEI pick, and it’s backfiring. Her record on incarcerating African Americans and her inability to connect with the voters is glaring. We need someone who’s competent and can lead, not just check a diversity box. It’s frankly insulting.

3. Lack of New Leadership
The DNC has completely failed to groom new, inspiring leaders. Instead of bringing fresh faces and ideas, they keep recycling the same old candidates. It feels like they’re stuck in the past, while we’re the ones suffering the consequences.

4. Out-of-Touch Policies
Biden’s policies, especially on foreign affairs, have been nothing short of disastrous. He’s more of a warmonger than a peacemaker. The DNC's support for these aggressive stances is pushing us further away from the values we once stood for.

5. Time for a Wake-Up Call
We need to send a clear message to the Democratic Party: We won’t just fall in line. Our voices matter, and we need to show them through our votes that they can't keep ignoring us. Voting for Trump is about making them realize that they need to change, listen, and start representing the true interests of their base."

I think that bullies who are school jocks physically bully students as a type of reward for winning their team a match. Which is why the bully’s friends protect the bully when the victim (or a witness) reports the bullying.
As for bullies who are not school jocks, they physically bully students for either laughs or to take out their frustration (most times due to bad parenting) on weaker students.

I’ve seen lots of discourse about this topic stating that restricting scholarships for a certain minority is racist, especially after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action. I don’t 100% believe it is. 

There’s no debate that with how expensive tuition is in the United States that scholarships are pivotal for many low income students to pay for their higher education. However there’s also differences among students in this country, and race or gender or other factors that make students minorities are undoubtedly factors that can inhibit academic success. I don’t agree that minority scholarships should be a form of “reparations” for the historic racism towards minorities in this country, but I think that it’s perfectly fine for a member of a community to want to give back to their community. I’d like to know what you think.

I’m Latino, born and raised in South Florida to immigrant parents who had to work their butts off to provide a good future for me. Im not saying that White students and parents don’t work super hard too, but I believe there’s a different playing field. The majority of White students born here didn’t have to struggle with learning a whole new language at a later age, or having to work jobs to help their immigrant parents. I think having minority only scholarships acknowledges that these struggles exist, and provide for students who need the aid, and have worked so hard to get to the same level the other students started at. 

One of my goals for if I ever become successful financially in the future is to give back to my community, and help other students of immigrants or latinos who could use an extra leg up to further their education. Does this make me racist too? I don’t think it does, I just want to give back to my community.

The majority of people complaining or purporting that it’s racist, from what i’ve seen, is white people themselves. They say that they’re just as poor or as deserving as minorities. Some of my friends are in this country because they were threatened with death from their countries of origin. I have friends who’ve had to learn English from the ground up while also expected to take state level exams. To me, this doesn’t seem the same. 

I’ve read claims that it’s impossible to find scholarships they qualify for because they’re all for minorities. In my opinion I don’t think this is true. A study conducted found that white people received nearly 70% of total scholarships awarded, and 30% being minorities. 38% of the student body earned 30% of the scholarships awarded. I guess you can say that this is because there’s more white people, but 70% is still a disproportionate amount. A newer study by the Department of Education found that, excluding any federal/state aid, 46% of white people received some sort of scholarship (2015-2016. They also received the second highest scholarship award average at $7,400, second only to Asians who still overall received less aid at 42.6% of students. 

White people were also the second least likely (behind only pacific islanders) to receive need based state aid, at 13% of students. These are scholarships based on NEED, and not exclusive because of racial biases.

In my opinion, it’s not racist to want to benefit a community of people that have had to work twice as hard to be on the same playing field. No, all the scholarships aren’t only for minorities (the statistics prove otherwise). If the scholarships isn’t for you, my belief is that you can move on and find one that is. After all, 1.7 million scholarships were awarded last year. Scholarships shouldn’t be for everyone, if money is free speech then I should be able to decide who I want to give it to, right?

I want to know what other people believe, and I know statistics or my own perspective doesn’t account for everyone’s personal struggles or opinions. Thank you for reading"

Most people don’t understand economics, foreign policy, immigration, social solutions, etc. at the level they need to vote in their best interest. Voting should be left with those who are experts in politics.

Let’s be honest, most people are just voting on who they like more and have only a vague understanding of their policy. Most people don’t have enough time between their work, kids, and life to dedicate to researching and studying history/ politics. I’ve spoken to my family and they all say they’re voting for Trump because the economy was better when he was in office. When I ask what his economic policies are, they have no clue. The average person is voting on feelings because that’s all they have to go off of.

You could argue that this is a rights violation as citizens are guaranteed the right to vote under the US constitution. However, it was a different time back then and the issues weren’t nearly as complicated and as numerous as we have now. It served us well at the time, but shouldn’t be allowed now.

Ultimately, we have experts because they are the best and most qualified people to make decisions. Why have unqualified people dictate the fate of a country? Change my view."

While I believe Biden has done a respectable job in his term and did a lot of good things, I cannot ignore reality. He is behind in the polls, including in most to all of the swing states he needs to win.

This should be the easiest race for Democrats to win, but here we are. The damage of Trump’s term will affect us for years but it will be even worse if he wins again.

If Biden stays in the race, as he has insisted he will, he is likely to lose. And I doubt he seriously understands the stakes because he said in his interview with George Stephanopoulos that if he loses, “at least I gave it my all.”

However, if Biden does step aside, that would be a legal clusterfuck.

As far as I’m concerned, his best course of action is to use the presidential immunity that the “Supreme” Court granted to Trump.

3,2024-07-11,CMV: Biological sex isn’t really a spectrum,u/Life-Cantaloupe-3184,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e0omi1/cmv_biological_sex_isnt_really_a_spectrum/,changemyview,"First off, I’d like stick an immediate disclaimer on this post. I’m not really arguing against the legitimacy of trans people or trans rights. Being trans, nonbinary, or some other flavor of the gender identity spectrum is perfectly valid, and I very much disagree with the current eroding of trans rights in many parts of the U.S. and other countries. 

However, I’ve always taken some issue with the argument I often see in support of trans rights that biological sex is a spectrum. The most common argument I see for this has to do with things like intersex individuals or variations that can occur in human sex chromosomes. However, from a medical standpoint these variations are probably best described as disorders of human sex development. They aren’t all necessarily harmful, but some variations of human sex chromosomes can cause developmental issues or be outright fatal for fetal development. As such, it doesn’t seem very accurate to me to argue that human sex development naturally falls along a continuum. The most common sex chromosome variation in humans is still an XX or an XY combination. 

The other reason why I take issue with the argument of humans falling along a biological sex continuum is because there are real and measurable health and physical differences between biological males and females. Even putting aside obvious differences like the average difference in strength, there are still noticeable differences in things like the brain. There are differences in lung capacity, average heart size, blood volume in the body, etc. Men and women also react differently to medications and each are more susceptible to different health conditions. There are outliers to all of this, of course, but I don’t think there are enough to outright state these differences are meaningless. "

She's too unpopular to win, but she has enough clout to make a mess of whomever the DNC prefers would be the new nominee.

The best move at this point is for Biden to step aside.  He needs to do so admitting that the turmoil that is about to unfold is entirely his fault.  He needs to say that he should have properly set the stage for succession years ago.  In stepping aside, he then hands the baton of power to Harris.

Harris would then need to say that she cannot accept the DNCs role as the nominee without being properly vetted against the best candidates.  She pushes to have a contest at the Convention, in which she will participate, but also states that she would actively support whomever is the nominee.

In this scenario, all of the chaos can be blamed on Biden and not on DNC leadership.  Harris gets a huge boost of likeability for potentially acquiescing to the principles of democracy (maybe even securing another VP pick at worst).  The DNC gets a break and turns all of the media's momentum towards themselves and away from Trump.  There's a huge surge in interest in DNC policies between now and November.

There will be limited time to do dig up dirt on whomever the nominee becomes or create counter-narratives from the RNC.  The nominee will be seen as someone who was properly vetted, albeit in an untypical way.

I have yet to hear of a better, more cohesive plan to replace Biden that factors in Harris or the need for a democratic process."

* There would be common sense exceptions such as its OK if your artillery shell lands on a weed or if your tank accidentally runs over a rodent

*  It would be illegal to cut trees down and also illegal to use trees as cover to block enemy attacks (as this would harm the tree).

* No ""collateral damage"". No SONAR to torment the poor whales and no dumping sewage in the lake



* War is environmentally destructive. It brings sadness to the heart to see animals destroyed or 100 year old trees burned. Even the soldiers who do the killing feel sad about it. We should get rid of this and spare innocent beautiful nature from our destruction 

* War would still be permissible and it would still occur, but it would be less destructive in terms of human life. No combat would take place in forests or wildlife areas, and combat would only take place in plains or deserts or in roads that travel through the forest. This would limit the scope of combat   and lower the amount of fighting that can happen. This will result in less soldiers KIA and wounded


* Soldiers would need to use less powerful weapons to avoid harming plants and animals. Less ugly stuff like cluster bombs and landmines 🤮

* There are few things that almost every culture on earth agrees with. One of those things is that  nature has value


* All major powers (US, China, Europe, Russia) would need to agree to the treaty. The proposal would be tuned in a way that the strategic powerbalance would be as unchanged as possible to get all major powers to agree to the treaty

On the surface, perhaps this seems like the right thing to do as it is very true that hate and abuse only breeds more of the same, but the lack of nuance is my point.

Violence is not inherently bad, is just the use of physical altercations to try and solve a problem/inconvenience. When you leave this decision to individuals, of course they will try and justify all their violent acts as deserving and that's why society needs to establish ethics and moral codes for all to follow (without being despotic).

Unfortunately, people who are in the position to set these rules, regulations and codes do not have the character to do so, as they sought positions of power instead of being literally elected (""You have the freedom to choose your representatives!.... From these selected few!). Them selling out is inevitable.

So, abusers, thieves and all kinds of criminals end up co-opting morality and ethics, stablishing what seems to be ""holier than thou"" BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE PERPETRATORS AND ENABLERS THAT SHOULD BE PUNISHED AS HARD AND SWIFT AS POSSIBLE.

By pushing the ""holier than thou"" attitude they are telling victims to take the high road whenever a transgression is committed against them. Some institutions will promise afterlife, reincarnation for the good guys and eternal damnation for the Bad guys, others will tell you that repercussions will come in one way or another, but that is far FAR from the truth as most w**mongers, PDF files and murderers are living their best life without consequences and most honest, good people have feeble existences, afraid of setting off the first group.

Heck, even denouncing/accusing/snitching has been culturally set as something to frown upon and if you do it you become a pariah and prosecuted by the same people you denounced.

It is no suprise that, in school, the best way to deal with bullies is to fight back, but Even then you're punished.

Some people will read this and say ""you're calling for violence against another group"" but that's another co-opted POV: justice against abusers is not violence per se.

If a person doesn't speak as much, then it could be:

- they find the conversation boring

- they are naturally more timid

- they just don't feel like talking

- they may not like the people

  
Asking them continually ""why don't you talk?"" shows a lack of confidence. because one can always not engage with said person. that's a simple solution. they'd be out of sight and out of mind. Confident people don't need to engage with other people for their own sense of validation. One should validate themselves, and not rely on others for this. 

It further shows a lack of mental control. Like, can one just THINK ""I don't like this person, as they are not engaging enough for MY standards. then I won't engage with them."" simple. even in groups of friends, there are some who get on better with others, for good or ill. Some people who are hyper-extroverts are egocentric and narcissistic, and see interaction as a means to have an internal ""notch"" on who connects with them. it's not about a human connection but an internal ego boost. 

And it's not really your business why people ""don't talk"". Again, who says you need to be around everybody? Surely good ""social skills"" is filtering around people, isn't it? social skills are broad and not just about chatting in groups like a motormouth. It's also about knowing how to engage in most nay all social scenarios and how to handle different kinds of people. If a person is trying to rough you up, you fight back. But what if YOU said something to him to make him more aggressive to you? that's a YOU problem, since it's a consequence of your own actions. I get the feeling this will trigger people, but it's a basic fact and reality. We all have the options with whom to associate.

For everyone else: Crunchyroll has recently gotten rid of the ability to comment on any episodes, as well as removing all previous comments, and the ability to write reviews of shows. Their stated reason was because there was too many hateful comments and trolls, especially after the release of their newest bl anime, which received tons of malicious comments and rating bombs from homophobes.

And I get it, I am gay, and it also bothers me when people write this crap, but removing the ability to comment was a mistake imo.

It seems like the best solution would be just to have moderators that can look at comments that are reported, plus some bots that can do basic filtering. I assume that they're not doing this to save money. However, in the long run I think this could cause them to lose subscribers. Crunchyroll was actually my favorite streaming site because they allowed coments. It's nice to be part of an anime community, and I know other people feel the same. It's also nice to be able to read reviews of shows, and to see notes about a show to know if I will like it beforehand. 

Crunchyroll is also not accounting for the fact that many of their top shows are also on other streaming services, so the comment feature was one of the perks of theirs alone. Most of One Piece can be watched on Netflix or Hulu, but Crunchyroll had a large advantage because people could discuss the show and also give timestamps for when the episode actually started. Plus, even now with comments turned off, people can still review bomb the shows by giving one star to them. Perhaps if they're really strapped for cash to moderate, Crunchyroll could provide different grades of subscription, where for a dollar more you could comment, or something like that."

0,2024-07-11,CMV: Most Millennials Financially Struggle Due to One Main Reason: Purchasing Overpriced Vehicles,u/Disastrous-Push7731,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e0unw0/cmv_most_millennials_financially_struggle_due_to/,changemyview,"

I firmly believe that the primary reason why many Millennials are facing financial struggles today is due to their habit of purchasing overpriced vehicles, often under less-than-ideal financing options. This behavior leads to a significant drain on their financial resources, which could otherwise be directed towards more beneficial investments or savings.

Firstly, let’s consider the sheer cost of modern vehicles. Over the past decade, the average price of new cars has steadily increased. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new vehicle in the United States hit an all-time high of around $40,000 in recent years. This figure is staggering, especially when compared to the median annual earnings of Millennials, which hover around $50,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. When you factor in the high cost of living in many urban areas where Millennials often reside, the financial burden of an expensive car becomes even more pronounced.

Many Millennials are not just buying these vehicles outright; they are financing them. And herein lies a significant part of the problem. Car loans have become longer and more expensive. It's not uncommon to see 72-month or even 84-month loan terms, which can seem attractive due to the lower monthly payments but ultimately lead to higher interest payments over time. According to Experian, the average car loan term for new vehicles has increased to around 70 months, with an average monthly payment of over $550. 

These financing options often come with high-interest rates, especially for those with less-than-perfect credit scores. Younger Millennials, who might still be building their credit history, are particularly vulnerable to these high rates. The combination of a long loan term and high interest means that many Millennials are paying significantly more than the vehicle's sticker price over the life of the loan.

Moreover, vehicles depreciate rapidly. According to CarFax, a new car loses about 20% of its value in the first year and about 60% over five years. This rapid depreciation means that Millennials are often left with an asset that is worth far less than what they owe on it, leading to negative equity. Negative equity, or being ""upside down"" on a car loan, can be financially crippling. If they need to sell the car, they may find themselves owing more on the loan than the car is worth, trapping them in a cycle of debt.

The financial implications of this go beyond the car payments themselves. High monthly payments reduce the amount of disposable income available for other essentials, such as housing, healthcare, and food. This lack of disposable income can also mean fewer opportunities to save or invest, which are critical for long-term financial stability and wealth-building. Additionally, the stress of managing high debt can lead to mental health issues, which can further impact one's financial situation through medical bills or reduced productivity at work.

Critics might argue that vehicles are a necessity for many, especially in areas with limited public transportation options. While this is true, the choice of vehicle and the financing method are crucial factors. Opting for a reliable used car with a shorter loan term or even exploring alternative transportation options, such as carpooling, biking, or public transit, can significantly alleviate financial pressure.

Additionally, there's a cultural aspect to consider. For many, cars are not just a means of transportation but a status symbol. Social media and societal pressures can lead to the desire to own a flashy, expensive car to project a certain image. However, this mindset can be financially damaging in the long run. Shifting the cultural narrative towards valuing financial stability over material possessions could help alleviate some of these pressures.

In conclusion, while there are multiple factors contributing to the financial struggles of Millennials, I believe that the purchase of overpriced vehicles under suboptimal financing conditions is a significant and often overlooked factor. By making more financially prudent choices when it comes to vehicle purchases, Millennials can potentially improve their financial health and build a more secure future.

killing rape survivors is wrong and has always been wrong. 

A) In the Bible, Deuteronomy 22:22-29 it says that if man is found to be lying with a woman they are both to die. AA) How was this right to stone someone to death for that?

B) 23 a man finds a betrothed virgin and lies with her. BA) 24 you shall in all cases when this happens as you are command to bring them both out of the city “and you shall stone them to death with stones” because “ the young woman because she did not cry out in the city” so she is being stoned to death for not crying out. BB) In some cases it will be sex (see AA)) but there are still the cases where it’s rape because she **wanted to** cry out but couldn't BC) because the man was gagging her, drugged her or because of psychological dissonance. BD) So she didn’t cry out and she is to be stoned to death for something acting upon her against her will. And the Bible says she is evil. BE) This is victim blaming. Why is she evil for having something acted of upon her such as rape? 

C) a man comes across a “betrothed young woman” in the countryside and “forces her and lies with her” “then only the man who lay with her shall die” (see (F)). CA) And now that she is not a virgin she cannot marry anyone as in Deuteronomy 22:13-21 say that is a man finds that his wife is not a virgin, he should bring her to her father and as she was raped before she is not a virgin, so it is “shall stone her to death with stones”. CB) This means that marriage is out of the question. 

D) As you can see from (BC) no scream or a struggle doesn't mean it isn't rape. DA) 27 is saying that if they are in the countryside when the rape happens she is okay as there is no one to hear her scream. DB) She should be okay regardless of if she “cried out” as for what I said in (BC) being that she may be gagged, drugged or otherwise incapable of screaming.

E) 28 If a man rapes a woman who is not betrothed and is found out, he is command by God’s breath to marry her and pay 50 shekels of silver to the father of the woman raped. EA) So the woman is forced to marry the person who raped her. EB) I can’t imagine what that must be like to marry to the person who has raped me and what’s more have no grounds for divorce ever until I die. Can you?

F) in Exodus 20:13 it says you **“shall not kill”**. So the stoning people to death is killing them, someone or a group has to kill them in order for them to be stoned to death as ordered by Yahweh FA) this is in direct contradiction to the “you shall not kill” commandment. FB) This means that it is wrong to stone to people death. FC) But the Lord your God cannot do wrong. FD) So Which is it? Is stoning people to death a good moral action as God ordered you to do or is it not killing people that is a good moral action?

G) Jesus said on his sermon on the mount that he's not there to overturn old testament law. GA) Nothing should be change GB) until having and earth is destroyed GC) and anyone who tries to minimize any of the old testament law will not get into heaven. 

# Scripture 
## Exodus 20:13

## Deuteronomy 20:13-29

And she shall be his wife; he cannot divorce her all his days.
> 20 “But if the thing is true, and evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman, 21 then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house.

# Summary 
So in Summary (A) looks at two consenting adults having sex but being stoned to death because of it. And how did Yahweh thought that this was a good idea just stoning people to death for having **consensual** sex 

In (B) we looked at how not all people cry out when being raped and how stoning someone for not crying out is unjust and is just stoning innocent people for actions taken out of their control.

 In (C) we talked about how 20:17 only allows virgins to marry, excluded any rape survivors from being married this will deprive them of a family and love. 

With (D) shows just because they didn't cry out doesn't mean that when they are not crying out is them enjoying it or they want it.  As shown by psychological dissonance.

(E) brings us onto why rape survivors shouldn't be forced to marry the rapist.

In (F) you shall not kill and you shall stone people to death. Which one is right and which is wrong as they are both mutually exclusive.

G look at Jesus saying  that old testament laws does  still apply and he is not there to overturn it and anyone who doesn't follow it isn't getting into heaven.

# Conclusion
At some point Yahweh thought it was a good idea to kill raped survivors. God, being the definition of morality. This meaning that anything God does is moral therefore it's moral to kill rape survivors. Even if you say that Jesus changed it. There was still a point where it was moral to kill rape survivors. But as you can see from the sermon on the mound Jesus says to follow the old testament law in order to get into heaven. Why is a just god rewarding people with eternal paradise for killing in rape survivors?

So how can Yahweh be a good moral agent if God condones the killing of rape survivors and rewards people for doing so? Or how can the killing of rape survivors be a good moral action? "

75,2024-07-11,CMV: Young Americans believe their political system is broken. The Democrats are proving them correct.,u/BumpyCunty,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e0x2tt/cmv_young_americans_believe_their_political/,changemyview,"Since 2016 there has been a range of focus on American institutions, the idea of reform, and debate about what that would look like. Regardless of one’s views of specific policy, people largely recognize one indisputable truth: the tides of change turn slowly. 

The American government is designed to, as some say, “fight the tyranny of the majority” which is why we have institutions like the electoral college, the Senate, SCOTUS, etc. which are meant to ensure change happens at a sustainable rate.

This is not an op-ed about whether the rate of change is currently too fast or too slow. This is about the rapidly decaying trust in the two-party system and a system of governance that thrives on inertia when the times of today call for effective decision-making at unprecedented speed. It’s the same inertia permeating throughout much of corporate America and driving away the next generation of the workforce. 

Again, regardless of one’s policy views, many young Americans feel their elected representatives and faceless bureaucrats are not serving their best interests. They’re also seeking alternative ways to earn income outside of traditional corporate hierarchies and 9-5 jobs. This all stems from a lack of trust in the system: many people no longer feel safe buying into the conventional wisdom of yesteryear. 

The strength of the USD? Geopolitical position and alliances? Your retirement savings? Ability to buy a home? Domestic social contract? Many have lost faith that’s attainable for them or stable enough to plan a life around long term. There’s a reason Elon Musk and others are beating the drum about having more kids… these are just a few reasons people are not doing that. 

In today’s social climate, there are relatively few topics where Americans share a consensus view. Individuals are so entrenched in their own echo chambers and feedback loops, that it can be challenging to cut through the noise and have a “real” conversation with those who think differently about certain things than themselves. Even more challenging to agree.

Young Americans are seeking what Obama promised them in 2008: change. But in 2024, it should be clarified, they seek: meaningful change. It’s already been established that doesn’t happen quickly. 

So how do you move forward as a society, especially at an inflection point like this election? To win the public buy-in for accelerated speed in decision-making (when older American voters are largely comfortable with the status quo/prefer the predictability of doing things how they’re “supposed” to be done)…. there usually has to be a watershed moment. The civil rights movement had several. Watergate made history and Nixon is still the only president to resign from office. If the Democrats were actually strategic, they’d have capitalized on the opportunity to create a new one. 

But again, it’s 2024. The never ending news cycle and influence of social media has left many desensitized or disinclined to engage on certain topics. 

There are perhaps two topics that - even in today’s tenuous and charged environment - most all Americans can actually agree on. And both are represented in this presidential election. That’s right: every American can agree that abuse of elders and children is patently wrong, sickening, and unacceptable. It’s criminal. 

To force Americans to choose between Biden (clear case of elder abuse) and Trump (likely child predator amongst other things) is to essentially dare them to vote 3rd party or accept the lesser of two evils. There is a rising perception among younger voters that there is little to no meaningful difference between the two. Even if the perception is not technically correct, it exists, and is alienating to many demographics that make up the Democratic Party base…

To force Americans to choose between the lesser of two evils is, at face value, absurd. The Epstein files that were recently released are allegedly riddled with references to Trump. Biden struggling on stage during debate night exposed Americans to the reality of his current state. It wasn’t a pretty picture and it can’t be glossed over like it could for Reagan. We will likely never have any visceral imagery of Trump’s alleged acts, but the evidence of Biden’s decline is plain to see and only those arguing in bad faith can dispute that or attempt to downplay its importance. 

The polls are clear enough: Biden will very likely not win this election. No Americans (young or old) want to vote for an old grandpa, who should be in bed resting - not trusted to lead on the global stage. To stick with Biden as the candidate is essentially a smack in the face to voters (Democrat or Independent) who want better for their country than either is capable or willing to offer as POTUS. 

Had Biden stated from the outset he would be a one-term president, the current electoral picture would look drastically different. His legacy would be remembered much more fondly for ending our longest war, the infrastructure bill, and his unprecedented support for labor. Instead, his presidency is shaping up to end with a whimper as he hands the reigns back to his political rival following a decisive victory. 

The Democrats have been relentless in their messaging: “Donald Trump is the greatest threat to US Democracy. This is the most important election of our lifetime.” If that’s true, why are you voluntarily running a candidate that the vast majority of the electorate does not believe is cognitively capable of handling another four years? 

It’s time for the Democrats to be who they proclaim to be. Where are the adults in the room? When our parents become too old to drive, we sit them down and take away their keys. It’s not fun, but it’s necessary. We can’t look backward, only forward. And the current trajectory is a race to the bottom. 

There are better options. It’s time for a new generation to lead. The Democrats would be incredibly foolish to prove cynical young Americans correct in their belief that our system of governance is irredeemably broken, unresponsive, and unreliable. 

Enough is enough. The Democrats should run Kamala Harris and a swing state governor as VP on the ticket. It’s their best chance of invigorating enough of their base to turn out on Election Day and will be a breath of fresh air for the millions of centrist Americans begging for common sense to prevail.

238,2024-07-11,CMV: DNA tests for paternity should be required to put a father on a child’s birth certificate. ,u/Sicily_Long,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e0zbhu/cmv_dna_tests_for_paternity_should_be_required_to/,changemyview,"For starters, I believe the requirement of DNA testing for men to be on a birth certificate is necessary to protect all parties involved; mothers, fathers, children. 

The idea of men getting a DNA test for paternity can be tricky subject for lots of potential fathers. For obvious reasons, many women could take the idea of a man asking for a DNA  paternity test as a slap in the face because it can be viewed as an accusation of infertility. I fully understand why a faithful partner might feel this way and think it’s a fair view. 

Unfortunately, there are other women that use the first scenario as a way to emotionally manipulate men into NOT getting paternity tests when they know that there is a chance the person they want to be the father is not. This can result in horrible outcomes such as emotional devastation, financial loss, and embarrassment for men as well as alienation, resentment, and the destruction of the family for children. All of these situations could be avoided with DNA testing requirements. 

To cover the costs of such testing, there are several options. 

1. Fathers with financial means pay out of pocket or through insurance. 

2. Fathers without financial means could request government assistance.

3. Fathers that try to use this to avoid taking responsibility could be court ordered and charged/fined to cover the costs (only if they are the father). 

Obviously, there are situations where a man is willing to take responsibility for a child that is not their own. For these situations, the option to adopt exists. 

Bottom line, FNA is a small price to pay in the big picture of raising a child. It makes far more sense to spend a few hundred dollars up front for a DNA test as opposed to paying the emotional and financial costs that could arise years down the road.

I’m sure some people think this is a crazy take. Tell me why I’m all wrong.

what we call kids can be resposible and do anything an adult can do if it weren't for hindrances in our society that makes it hard to have access for resources, and culture that prevent people from growing up young.

people in the past didn't live that long, being married and having kids well before age of 18 is normal, yet we look at it now as if it is tabo. and this is against human nature which def contribute to bad mentality nowadays.

yes, most people under 18 now are stupid and can't do what an adult can, but that is all due to the society we built which doesn't let them grow up because supposidly they would live to +60 years, so it ain't a big deal?

there is a reason why a boy/girl can jack off early, yes it is to reproduce. it isn't some kind of decoration.

but thanks to what kids watch nowadays on social media, and the culture that tell them be stupid until you turn 18. no wonder why they are immature and stupid and struggle with things people didn't struggle with in the past. and seriously you can't start a life before 18 due to laws, and this is completely stupid, and against human nature. it shows that the people who make laws and the general public opinions are quite stupid. school system should change, this is all bunch of bullshit, and no one has to go through this.

about 10% of the humans who ever lived are living now today. we should have a better system than before, cuz time and situation changed and neither rules nor leaders became any better. so we might had incompetent people leading 1million, we now have incompetent people leading 8billion which worse than what you think."

islam positions itself as a correction to all these previous religions and harbors a historical and doctrinal insistence on its absolute truth and finality, which results in a heightened display of agression, defensiveness and self entitlement among many muslims. 

this manifests in a resistance to criticism and further insistence on the primacy of islam even when its principles clash with modern values or other people's beliefs (i noted that many muslims are not respectful towards other people's beliefs, and if they are it tends to be a feigned respect) 

in contrast, i feel like other religions tend to follow the same developmental trajectory and have a certain complementarity to them that allows for flexible interpretation. but islam's distinct approach resists such integration aiming instead to establish its supremacy.

this intrinsic defensiveness leads to intra-community conflicts, and muslims tend to monitor each other's behavior as well (im thinking of the 100 monkeys experiment) which brings me to my next point which is that islam incorporates values that can be seen as mechanisms of control. like the strong emphasis on obedience to parents (which we know can be harmful), the punitive measures for apostasy and blasphemy and the authority of religious leaders and scholars (literally every king of a muslim monarchy claims descendance from the prophet even when it doesn't make sense from an ethnical pov, im from a country like that and i can assure you that it works in maintaining the status quo) and their interpretations are accepted without question, stifling critical thinking and personal interpretation. 

i feel like islam encourages adherence through fear and hate. like i as a child, at school or at home i would get told a lot of scary stories to justify what should and shouldn't be done, and i always lived in anxiety bc i interpreted stuff literally, that was probably due to my autism. but i digress. 

anyways change my view.

10,2024-07-11,CMV: America is not a Christian Nation,u/hockeynomics_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e11v6g/cmv_america_is_not_a_christian_nation/,changemyview,"Senator Josh Hawley's [recent speech](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/07/09/sen-josh-hawley-america-founded-on-christian-nationalism/) asserting that America was founded on ""Christian Nationalism"" raises several significant issues that merit critical examination. This claim conflicts with the historical understanding of America's founding principles. The United States was established on the basis of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the First Amendment. This constitutional provision explicitly prohibits the establishment of a national religion, reflecting the founders' intent to ensure religious liberty and prevent government interference in religious matters. As the [Constitution](https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/constitution.htm) states, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof” (U.S. Const. amend. I). Moreover, the founding fathers themselves held diverse religious beliefs and were influenced by Enlightenment ideas emphasizing reason and individual rights over religious orthodoxy.

Promoting ""Christian Nationalism"" inherently excludes non-Christian citizens, which undermines the pluralistic foundation of American society. By suggesting that national identity is tied to Christianity, this rhetoric risks alienating people of different faiths or no faith, creating an environment of intolerance. Such a stance can deepen societal divisions and foster an ""us vs. them"" mentality, which is detrimental to social cohesion and unity. This principle is further reinforced by the Constitution’s assertion that “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States” (U.S. Const. art. VI).

Hawley's rhetoric could potentially influence policy-making in ways that favor one religion over others, infringing on individuals' rights to practice their religions freely or to live free from religious imposition. Mixing religious doctrine with governance complicates policy-making and could lead to laws that are not universally applicable or fair, thereby undermining democratic principles and the ideal of equal treatment under the law.

Furthermore, the advocacy of ""Christian Nationalism"" challenges the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state. The Establishment Clause of the Constitution prohibits the government from making any law “respecting an establishment of religion.” This principle is fundamental to maintaining a government that treats all citizens equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.

In summary, while Senator Hawley's speech may resonate with certain groups, it poses significant problems related to historical accuracy, social unity, legal principles, and the inclusive nature of American democracy. This rhetoric could lead to policies that undermine the foundational values of religious freedom and equality in the United States."

I see this as a similar act to JFK visiting the Berlin wall, or Nixon visiting China. I think it combines some aspects of both these events. Similarly to JFK visiting Berlin, it accomplished little on paper but had a substantial impact worldwide on a social and propaganda level. Many would argue that JFK's visit started/helped along the path to the fall of the Soviet Union and the US winning the cold war. Granted that didn't happen for another 30 years, but I don't think the goal of the North Korea visit was to immediately dissolve the state at that point either. It's similar to Nixons visit as it was a first for any president to enter north korea, and arguably the first real effort from both sides to talk things out. 

I think this also negates what a lot of Trumps critics said, especially before the election, which is that while he might be an experienced businessman, he would be useless at foreign policy. Not only did he set some groundwork for future negotiations with North Korea, Russia didn't try to pull anything during his term, and he didn't have any military blunders, unlike the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Furthermore South Korea largely applauded this action, which speaks volumes. And in researching some more about this topic, I read that some North Korean top brass might look down on Kim if he doesn't play ball with the US after these talks, which might have been part of Trump's plan all along. 

Quid pro quo deals are much more likely to be effective than what other presidents have done, by simply denouncing North Korea at every conceivable opportunity. It worked pretty well with the Soviet Union, and is a great compromise between doing nothing and a military invasion.

I think these lead into my second point, that the medias refusal to acknowledge some of Trump's genuine accomplishments simply feed the fire for people who want another excuse to support him. Now whether that would actually sway people one way or another is a debate in itself, but there is an undeniable double standard. 

The only arguments I see against my point is that 1. Trump has done a lot of bad that outweighs the good. I won't argue that point here, but I think my statement about the double standard from the media isn't helping. 

The other argument many have made is that Trump was the first to in some way legitimize the DPRK. I disagree, if that is the case then JFK and Nixon legitimized the USSR and China respectively too. The fact is that the DPRK does exist and as I stated above, the quid pro quo approach will be the most effective in the coming decades. "

The Arena for the audience to watch should be up high and a glass to protect people from falling over or trying go into the arena and it should also be aired on TV only for 18+ to watch.

0,2024-07-11,CMV: Trump's Pro-Crypto Stance is a Very Smart Political Move,u/simmol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e13mhn/cmv_trumps_procrypto_stance_is_a_very_smart/,changemyview,"To clarify for this CMV, I am not interested in debating about whether Trump truly is pro-crypto or not.  I recognize that he talked trash about Bitcoin a while ago so this type of inconsistencies from his past doesn't really change my view on anything.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A couple of days ago, it was announced that Trump will speak at the Bitcoin conference this later this month.  I believe this is an annual conference where the likes of Michael Saylor, Winklevoss twins, etc. pretty much take turns essentially saying Bitcoin is great, and buy Bitcoin.  Basically, the type of people who give talks at this conference are pretty much all in on crypto.  

I think Trump (or his team, it doesn't matter) has correctly identified that to establish himself as the extreme cryptocurrency advocate has much more of an upside than a downside.  The reason being is as follows.   

1.  The number of people who own crypto in the United States is a significant number.   According to this link (https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/), 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in 2023.  That is 93 million people who own crypto can potentially vote in the upcoming election.  Now, obviously, for majority of people crypto will not be the #1 issue for this election.  But what is interesting is that cryptocurrency really has its own advocates such that for many people (especially young people), it can really be argued that crypto is the #1 issue for them as they are heavily invested in this asset class and as such, their own livelihood depends on whether Bitcoin goes up or down.  So there might be few millions of people where crypto is the #1 issue in the upcoming election (money talks).  Also given that cryptocurrency is not really a partisan issue, there are both people on the left and the right who love crypto.    So there might be legitimately few people who would vote differently based on the issue of cryptocurrency (again, money talks). 

  
2.  On the flip side, while there are some people who are anti-crypto, hardly anyone who is anti-crypto will view crypto as their #1 political issue.  Moreover, the number of people who are hardcore anti-crypto are far less than those who are pro-crypto.  In other words, crypto has its fanatics but anti-crypto do not have fanatics.  So with Trump siding with the pro-crypto crowd, it is just not going to cost him that many votes.  People who have no opinions about crypto (or who are anti-crypto) are not going to be persuaded or disuaded to vote for him because of his issue on crypto.   So combining #1 and #2, Trump has everything to gain and not really much to lose based on his pro-crypto stance. 



3.  Key figures in cryptocurrency have money.   The chart in this article (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-industrys-lobbying-hit-a-record-in-2023-and-is-off-to-a-strong-start-in-2024-fa740b43) suggests that the lobby money in crypto is growing every year.   The Winklevoss twins recently stated that they donated 1 million dollars in Bitcoin to the Trump campaign the Kraken co-owner also recently donated 1 million dollars to the Trump campaign.  Before the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried was known to be one of the largest donors in Washington.  There is big lobbying money here and it seems to be going to Trump.  

  
In summary, Trump made a big calculation that extreme advocacy of crypto is a low risk high returns move.  This election can be decided by a few swing voters in some of the key states and young adults (20s and 30s) who do not have much interest in politics might vote due to their passion for crypto.  And Trump will capture a lot of these votes, which can decide this election.

The way I see it, You have a group of people who have spent heir formative years being blamed for the sins of the father and being collectively punished and pushed to the side while being told about their privilege, I think what most people seem to forget is that most young men today did not experience the peak of the male dominated world, they just grew up hearing about it.

Now onto my next point, as I mentioned most men today were raised to believe that the world would be at their shoulders as it was with their fathers for the most part, which is far from reality, and this has created a conflict. Many can't reconcile their anger at being unable to be in power and they believe they must regain power as men.

Dew point has several advantages:

* It's stable with temperature changes, if you heat up air without replacing it, the RH changes but the dew point doesn't.
* It more accurately represents the 'feel' of how humid it is as it measures our ability to cool down by sweating. 
* It represents an actual physical phenomenon - the temperature at which something contacting the air will get precipitation on it.

Relative humidity isn't something I can really see much advantage too. I mean sure, 100% RH = fog, but it doesn't really help all that much because the fog generally forms as air moves around and changes temperature anyhow, for example ascending air expands and cools as it moves over a hill and fog comes out.

The RH changes a lot during the day as the temperature fluctuates, while the dew point doesn't. It's really only helpful in reference to the temperature of the air.

I'm open to being convinced, but I can't see too many reasons why RH is better."

But other then that, I'm just not convinced dramatized live action type shows should really go beyond 5 seasons. Most actors may get burnt out doing more then 5 seasons and want to move on to other projects. This may carry over their performance on the show itself. Also story lines tend to be stretched apart and may lead to bad pacing issues or just straight up bad story telling after 5 seasons worth of content. 
I'll use Lost as an example. Lost started off insanely strong, but after 4 seasons it kinda seemed like they were just throwing in random things to keep going. Remember that tattoo episode with Jack? Yea that was kind of stupid and even the writers were trying to tell the networks its time to end it. Another example are the CW hero shows like Flash and Arrow. Both lasted way passed their prime and the story was only getting worse by the season (And dont even get me started on each one having 20+ episodes with 4 of them being the only ones that mattered.)


Anyways, as the title says, live action shows should never go past 5 seasons max due to the above mentioned. Comedy shows can get a pass because you can just do random story lines and not really follow a proper long term plot. Animation is very different compared to how live action is produced and can also get a pass as well in my opinion."

0,2024-07-11,CMV: Nobody can see pictures in their mind,u/MicroneedlingAlone2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e17zn1/cmv_nobody_can_see_pictures_in_their_mind/,changemyview,"We've all actually got aphantasia.

Oh yeah, I already know this is going to be controversial. I want to be convinced that people can see pictures in their heads, because so many people say they can. But I can't do it, and recently I've presented my friends with a few tests of their visualization skills, which they all failed miserably.

I am left concluding that either nobody can really visualize, or a lot fewer people can visualize than what is claimed. I dot think visualizers are lying: I think they are thinking of a mere description of an object or scene - accompanied by no actual imagery - but describing this experience as an image, or actually believing it is an image when it's not.

Let's start with a classic argument that I did not come up with.

Argument 1: The zebra

Visualize a zebra. Got it?

>!How many stripes does it have?!<

If you can't immediately respond to that question, then I am confused how you can say that you had an image in your brain.

>!Because if I had an photograph in front of me, it would be easy to count the stripes. But all my friends say ""It doesn't work like that,"" or ""It's too blurry."" But even on a blurry picture of a zebra, I could count the stripes, unless it was SO blurry that I couldn't even recognize it as a zebra. It sounds like whatever representation is in their mind is fundamentally different from an image.!<

Argument 2: What people say

Many people are not artistic, but can copy from a reference image.

Also, many people say ""If only I could draw what I see in my head, then I would be a good artist!""

But how can both statements be true? If you can copy from a reference image, and you can see an image in your brain, then you can copy from what you see in your brain. I know people who make both of these claims. I don't see how they can both be true! My explanation? They aren't really seeing an image in their head.

Argument 3: Shape visualization

I'm going to ask you to visualize a solid 3 dimensional shape. Imagine you draw, on paper, two triangles, and 4 rectangles. The triangles are made of wood and painted yellow. The rectangles are made of smooth red plastic. You cut the 2d pieces out of the paper and you attach them together to form one closed 3d shape - the top and bottom are the yellow wooden triangles, and the front, back, left, and right are made up of the smooth red plastic rectangles. Alright, are you visualizing it?

>!Hopefully, you said no, because such a shape is geometrically impossible. Now, I'll admit, a few of my friends recognized that this shape was impossible - but so can I, and I can't see it. But more than half of my friends claimed that they could ""see"" this shape in their mind. I asked them to draw it, and then they realized it is impossible. This proves that they *thought* they were seeing something in their minds, but they couldn't have been. I believe this is what all visualizers are doing, every time.!<

Acknowledgement of bias:

Now, I'm clearly biased because I openly acknowledge that I cannot visualize. I also know I am in a minority of people who claim this. And finally, all of the arguments and tests I have put forward are designed to *disprove* visualization. But I haven't put forward any tests to *prove* visualization, mostly because it's actually very hard for me to think of any. So if you can launch any arguments back at me, or tests for other visualizers that could provide evidence one way or another, I'm ready to be convinced."

It’s important to distinguish between hard sciences and soft sciences though. A lot of times people are using soft sciences to hold a position of authority in an argument when soft sciences are so inconsistent. 

I agree with the sentiment that science changing is a feature of science and not a flaw because it’s good that it will accept new conclusions, but just because that’s a good thing, doesn’t mean it should be absolutely adhered to. 

Imagine if I said there is a study that if you invest $10,000 with me you will make $20,000 in 6 months. But you do more research and find there are more studies that show you will lose your 10k. You would obviously be like woah woah woah. This is way to inconsistent make such a financial risk. Yet, when people reference research with existing contradictory research they default to you should adhere to the current research we have.  I disagree. It should absolutely be taken into consideration, but not hold a position of authority whatsoever.

I see this in fitness all the time and I can’t help but laugh at people that obey poorly done research like it’s gospel. Studies use to say greater stretches produce more muscle, newer ones say partial reps do. You can draw conclusions from such small sample sizes and different individuals. You could have 2 identical twins do the same thing and they will yield different results because they are different people. Fitness is an example of a field where science is not the cutting edge of the industry. It should be considered absolutely and when experience and research meet that should be the gold standard.

This applies to other fields lie psychology, sociology, politics, etc… I’ll be debating sometime and they reference a study and act like the argument is one. I’m just like… I don’t give a shit about a study.

1,2024-07-12,CMV: Positive thinking is hypocritical and ultimately ineffective in achieving true personal transformation. ,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e19b33/cmv_positive_thinking_is_hypocritical_and/,changemyview,"The practice of positive thinking does not change who you are. It's just that you're suppressing the bad parts of yourself. It's a preferred approach. It works against awareness, not in favour of it.

There is never a choice in awareness.

To put it simply, positive thinking is conditioning the conscious mind with positive ideas while driving the negative into the unconscious. The issue lies in the fact that the unconscious mind possesses nine times the power of the conscious mind. Thus, when something loses consciousness, it

increases in power by nine times over its previous level. It will find new ways to express itself even if it doesn't show in the traditional manner.

Therefore, positive thinking is a very bad technique that lacks depth of understanding and keeps giving you false self-perceptions.

The origins of positive thinking can be traced back to the American Christian movement known as Christian Science. They gradually abandoned the term ""Christian"" and just began discussing the positive thinking philosophy in order to avoid attracting others to it as well.

The original source, Christian Science, suggested that all that occurs in your life is merely a projection of your thoughts. Think and grow rich is the way to become wealthy. Positive thinking will attract money to you by making you believe that you are wealthy and that your wealth is increasing.

Christian Science was a superficial approach. It could be helpful in a few areas, especially with changing the things that are actually created by your thoughts. However, your thoughts do not create your entire life.

Christian Science gave rise to positive thinking. The basic idea is still the same, even though it now discusses philosophical topics more: if you think negatively, bad things will happen to you, and if you think positively, good things will happen to you. And a lot of people read that kind of literature in America. Positive thinking hasn't had any effect anywhere else in the world because it is naive.

""Think and grow rich"" is a ridiculous idea, as everyone knows. It is also dangerous and harmful.

It is necessary to let go of your negative thoughts rather than suppressing them with optimistic ones. It is necessary to cultivate a consciousness that is neutral. The pure consciousness will be that.

You will lead the most effortless and contented life possible in that state of pure awareness.

If you suppress a bad thought because it is causing you pain, then... In the event that, for instance, you suppress your anger and attempt to channel it into something constructive, such as compassion or love for the person you were upset with, you are lying to yourself.

You're whitewashing the anger, but it's still anger deep down. You might smile on the outside, but that smile will stay on your lips. It is going to be a lip-synching exercise; it has nothing to do with you, your heart, or your essence. You have placed a strong block between your heart and your smile, which is the negative emotion you have been suppressing.

You have thousands of negative feelings in life, so it's not just one feeling. You dislike many things, including the person you are with and the circumstances you find yourself in. After all this junk accumulates in the unconscious, a hypocrite who declares, ""I love everyone, love is the key to blissfulness,"" emerges on the surface. Yet you don't see that person living a happy life. The entirety of hell is contained within him.

He is capable of lying to others and, given enough time, even to himself. However, nothing will change. It is just a waste of life, and life is very valuable because it cannot be replaced.

To put it correctly, positive thinking is just the philosophy of hypocrisy. It teaches you to sing when you feel like crying. Even though you can handle it, there will come a time and place when those suppressed tears will leak out. Repression is limited in some way. Furthermore, the song you were singing had no real meaning at all; you weren't feeling it, and it wasn't something that came from your heart.

It was only so because the philosophy always advises choosing the good.

I vehemently disagree with positive thinking. You'll be shocked to learn that your life will begin to express something that is higher than both positive and negative, if you remain in a state of awareness without making any choices. That way, you won't be a loser. The nature of it will be existential rather than negative or positive.

They will therefore have beauty and a song of their own if there are tears. They will be singing on their own, not because they are depressed or feeling unsuccessful, so you don't need to force them to sing anything.

And if the song starts to flow, it's just your joy being expressed; it has nothing to do with despair or crying.

neither in favour of nor against anything. It is merely the expression of who you are, which is why I refer to it as existential.

America has gone down a very bad path due to positive thinking, which has turned people into hypocrites. It is the most popular philosophy in America, despite the fact that it is complete garbage and not even a philosophy. It is not based on psychological research, it is not grounded in the deeper insights of meditation, and it does not comprehend human psychology. It is merely providing hope to those who are losing hope altogether. People are becoming more ambitious as a result.

The impoverished man believes that if he keeps thinking, a Cadillac will one day materialise in his porch, even though he doesn't currently have one. He needs to come up with a porch first! Thinking positively will build a porch, and thinking positively will bring a Cadillac. Please avoid sitting in such a car even if it does happen as it poses a risk. That man is having hallucinations because there is neither a car nor a porch.

He's not thinking clearly.

Everything must be merited. Napoleon Hill wrote the well-known book THINK AND GROW RICH, in which he emphasised that you will become wealthy if you think hard enough. He is one of the best writers America has ever produced, and millions of copies have been sold as a result. He writes with conviction and skill.

However, prior to that, on the occasion of the first publication of his book, he was present at the bookstall so that the publisher could present him to the patrons and he could sign the books.

And so Henry Ford, who was perusing books because he was a bookworm, happened to walk in and asked, ""What's going on? ""What is this man up to?""

He discovered that this was the renowned author Napoleon Hill, whose most recent work had just been released. ""He will be very happy to be introduced to you."" Henry Ford then went to see him. Napoleon Hill was introduced by the publisher with the words, ""He has written this book, THINK AND GROW RICH.""

Henry Ford asked Napoleon Hill, ""Have you come in your own car, or in a public bus?"" after glancing at the cover and title.

Napoleon Hill had to answer Henry Ford's question, ""Yes, I have come in a public bus,"" even though it seemed so insignificant at the time.

""When you have thought about a beautiful car enough, and it appears in your porch, then bring this book to me,"" Henry Ford said, returning the book to the man. Henry Ford here; I don't require this book.

I am aware that thinking will not make you wealthy. With this book, you can con impoverished people. Everyone aspires to be wealthy, so the book will likely do well on the market. If the book does well, you might even become wealthy enough to buy a car. But keep in mind that's not the situation. If you think that the car will appear, then I'll take the book.""

He was never able to visit Henry Ford, and the car never showed up. The strangest thing about that old man was that he would occasionally call and ask, ""What happened to the car? Remove the book from sale if it hasn't already appeared. It is blatantly deceptive."" Additionally, the entire book focuses on thinking only positively.

And the difference is evident: all thoughts, whether favourable or negative, are meaningless. They are the two halves of a single coin. You must transcend both the negative and the positive; you cannot shift from one to the other. You must let go of them both and transform into a mindless awareness. And whatever you do will come from that awareness with integrity. Everything you do will be incredibly beautiful. You will feel fulfilled in whatever you do.

I understand her point, but I disagree. She claimed, ""It's never been this bad, and it's because of social media,"" citing January 6th as an example. However, history shows that similar events have happened before, such as the Business Plot and presidential assassinations. It's the same issue with a different appearance.

Prince’s catalogue is wayyy stronger. Especially in his underrated mid 2000’s era which beat MJ’s by a mile. Prince is a far more talented musician and songwriter. 

But none of that matters when you compare Off The Wall to Prince’s For You or his self titled. Part of the reason for this is, in part because of Prince’s aforementioned musicality and ego, is he worked alone in the studio. No songwriters, no band, nobody else but him. And he was marketed that way too in part. But you’re only one man and MJ just happened to have some of the best musicians in the industry available and happy to work with him on his record. And you can hear it in the fucking drums and killer bass lines all over the album. 

Don’t get me wrong. Prince is an overall better musician, but he isn’t a god. He was not the best drummer in the world. He’d never make it as a session drummer. Which is fine! Because he wasn’t trying to be. But you get a totally different vibe in the song when you put a session musician who spent his whole life playing drums behind the kit versus a singer songwriter, who mostly plays guitar. 

That triple kick-snare combo to open up Rock With You isn’t his wheelhouse. I *can* see Stevie Wonder doing it however lol

Off The Wall has Girlfriend, Don’t Stop Till You Get Enough (whose needle-drop moment at the end of Rush Hour 2 alone makes justifies my CMV), Rock With You and Off The Wall. The last 3 are like the platonic ideal of disco to me. Prince has some great disco tracks. Don’t get me wrong. Just As Long As We’re Together is a fucking banger and I Wanna Be Your Lover. But for a guys first two albums, released back to back in 78’ and 79’, it’s a tall task. 

Put Prince, like Paul McCartney, doesn’t really work well taking advice on how to write songs. MJ on the other hand kind of acknowledged, at least in the beginning of his career, he wasn’t that strong of a songwriter, so he was willing to work with guys like Rod Temperton or take advice from Quincy Jones and that spirit of collaboration allows Off the Wall to sound both incredibly accessible but not slick. 

It wants to be catchy but the seasoned hands behind it never let it cross the line into being thirsty for audience attention. This isn’t an album that was audience tested before release.

0,2024-07-12,"CMV: most of the criticisms Islam you hear are criticism salafism, not islam",u/IP1nth3sh0w3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e1aha5/cmv_most_of_the_criticisms_islam_you_hear_are/,changemyview,"I think most of the criticism of Islam are actually criticisms of Salafism and Wahabism, which are very strict interpretations of Islam that used to be fringe, with more moderate schools like Anafism being much more prominent. 

Western countries have had interactions with Islam since the first caliphate. Modern views on Islam during the 18th, 19th and 20th century actually seem much more respectful and less fraut than today. When you here writers like Lord Byron, various governors of India or TE Lawrence talk about their interactions with Islam, they at vest have great respect for it, or at worst don't see it as any different to other faiths. There's no implicit idea that devotion to Islam is something that comes with war, moral strictness and all the stuff you here about today, often the opposite.

But ever since the 1980s, power in the muslim world shifted from the old muslim powers with arguably more moderate theology, sometimes even having secular governmens(turkey, Egypt, Iraq) and towards 2 sides in this on and off war in the middle East. The first side is wahabist countries in the gulf (Saudi, UAE, Kuwait) who have used their endless money to set up Wahabist schools that brainwash children from a young age to not associate with children who follow more moderate schools of Islam, that have had a huge impact in countries with huge muslim populations like Pakistan and Nigeria. The second is iran and irs Proxy organisations, that have made a hard-line, militant form of Shia Islam the dominant force in countries with significant Shia populations, obviously including Iran, but also iraq, yemen and lebanon. 

These twin forces paint both sects of Islam in the worst possible light. By leveraging their economic and political power to force Islam into one standard form, rather than the much more diverse and varied worldwide culture it's bee historically, and by making that form as repellant to outsiders as possible. I use salafism as a catch all term for both sides, as they lead to a similar place. "

Even as a child, I never really believed in it. I know this is going to sound incendiary but church is just so dreadfully *boring*. It was to the point of driving me to atheism.

Honestly, I think this is the real reason why newer generations are more irreligious now. It's not because they don't suffer as much existential threats as their ancestors nor is it the proliferation of science and atheistic philosophies. Simply put, it's because religions are just incredibly dull. 

My case is simple, kids want to be stimulated and church is arguably one of the least effective ways of doing it. Sitting still silently having to hear some adult drone on and on about the same topic is hell for any child. Exacerbating this is the subtle psychological pressure that kids must not fidget or be noisy during sermons. This subconsciously primes them to associate church with boredom. Eventually, this could solidify into full-on atheism as they grow older and continue engaging in it.

Back then, there weren't as much options for entertainment so young people had to make do with church participation. The modern world is different now with the existence of the internet, offering a near-infinite source of fun. "

0,2024-07-12,CMV: People who call Abstract Art pretentious are just mad that they don’t get it.,u/CoffeeElectronic9782,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e1b9is/cmv_people_who_call_abstract_art_pretentious_are/,changemyview,"(This is from a few months back). I sometimes go to Museums when I’m feeling down or want to see something nice. There’s a few paintings at SFMona by a painter named Cy Twombly. I’ve watched videos on YouTube calling him bad, his paintings being fronts for money laundering, being liberal arts garbage etc. and that it doesn’t deserve to be called art, let alone be in an art museum.

I decided to challenge myself when confronted with one of them. This is one of his paintings with a series of coiled “C” letters. This time, I took some time to observe. It took me a while, but the more I looked and followed the “C”, I began to notice that there was much more thought and deliberation put into this. There were entire pairs, mazed sections, repeating loops. These were really complex, but from the outside looked like dirt simple scribbles. There’s a larger “black board” painting which I then looked at and was truly blown away this time by the amount of things I was seeing. I had been to an aquarium recently, and thought how, if this was called “jelly fish movement patterns”, no one would criticize this.

At that moment, a man on a date came into the section and said to his date, “I hate Twombly”. His date tried to look at the paintings, but he just whisked away super quickly. I heard again 2 sections down, saying - “I don’t really get it”. But… there was a description next to this painting about what it exactly was. In fact, this painting was a whole rabbit hole of awesomeness.

And that’s when it began to hit me - the reason why I never appreciated Twombly’s painting was because I, just didn’t get it. And I didn’t get it because I never gave it the time it deserved, because I had let my own feelings be dictates by someone else (YouTubers). 

The points on the art market, liberals ruining things, all were destroyed when the artwork suddenly clicked with me. And in an afternoon I went from being the Twombly hating guy on a date, to so eone reading and defending Twombly.

I think we need to give museum curators and durectors more credit than we do. Maybe letting ourselves “get it”, might actually help us appreciate the art more.

Change my view please - is it all just pretentious crap?"

A thinker who studies the most fundamental questions of nature and reality is called a philosopher (philia=love, sophia=being smart), or a lover of Wisdom.

Philia"" is the Greek word for friendship, it's Platonic love, the purest form of love. It's companionship, not sexual.

Therefore, pedophiles, by an etymological definition, are simply people who adore children: school nurses, pedetricians, mothers (except those who abort/murder their own babies), teachers, child psychologists, clowns...

We should not confuse this term with pedoSEXual. Those who want to have intercourse with kids.

0,2024-07-12,CMV: Positive thinking is hypocritical and ultimately ineffective in achieving true personal transformation. ,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e1c1kv/cmv_positive_thinking_is_hypocritical_and/,changemyview,"The practice of positive thinking does not change who you are. It's just that you're suppressing the bad parts of yourself. It's a preferred approach. It works against awareness, not in favour of it.

There is never a choice in awareness.

To put it simply, positive thinking is conditioning the conscious mind with positive ideas while driving the negative into the unconscious. The issue lies in the fact that the unconscious mind possesses nine times the power of the conscious mind. Thus, when something loses consciousness, it

increases in power by nine times over its previous level. It will find new ways to express itself even if it doesn't show in the traditional manner.

Therefore, positive thinking is a very bad technique that lacks depth of understanding and keeps giving you false self-perceptions.

The origins of positive thinking can be traced back to the American Christian movement known as Christian Science. They gradually abandoned the term ""Christian"" and just began discussing the positive thinking philosophy in order to avoid attracting others to it as well.

The original source, Christian Science, suggested that all that occurs in your life is merely a projection of your thoughts. Think and grow rich is the way to become wealthy. Positive thinking will attract money to you by making you believe that you are wealthy and that your wealth is increasing.

Christian Science was a superficial approach. It could be helpful in a few areas, especially with changing the things that are actually created by your thoughts. However, your thoughts do not create your entire life.

Christian Science gave rise to positive thinking. The basic idea is still the same, even though it now discusses philosophical topics more: if you think negatively, bad things will happen to you, and if you think positively, good things will happen to you. And a lot of people read that kind of literature in America. Positive thinking hasn't had any effect anywhere else in the world because it is naive.

""Think and grow rich"" is a ridiculous idea, as everyone knows. It is also dangerous and harmful.

It is necessary to let go of your negative thoughts rather than suppressing them with optimistic ones. It is necessary to cultivate a consciousness that is neutral. The pure consciousness will be that.

You will lead the most effortless and contented life possible in that state of pure awareness.

If you suppress a bad thought because it is causing you pain, then... In the event that, for instance, you suppress your anger and attempt to channel it into something constructive, such as compassion or love for the person you were upset with, you are lying to yourself.

You're whitewashing the anger, but it's still anger deep down. You might smile on the outside, but that smile will stay on your lips. It is going to be a lip-synching exercise; it has nothing to do with you, your heart, or your essence. You have placed a strong block between your heart and your smile, which is the negative emotion you have been suppressing.

You have thousands of negative feelings in life, so it's not just one feeling. You dislike many things, including the person you are with and the circumstances you find yourself in. After all this junk accumulates in the unconscious, a hypocrite who declares, ""I love everyone, love is the key to blissfulness,"" emerges on the surface. Yet you don't see that person living a happy life. The entirety of hell is contained within him.

He is capable of lying to others and, given enough time, even to himself. However, nothing will change. It is just a waste of life, and life is very valuable because it cannot be replaced.

To put it correctly, positive thinking is just the philosophy of hypocrisy. It teaches you to sing when you feel like crying. Even though you can handle it, there will come a time and place when those suppressed tears will leak out. Repression is limited in some way. Furthermore, the song you were singing had no real meaning at all; you weren't feeling it, and it wasn't something that came from your heart.

It was only so because the philosophy always advises choosing the good.

I vehemently disagree with positive thinking. You'll be shocked to learn that your life will begin to express something that is higher than both positive and negative, if you remain in a state of awareness without making any choices. That way, you won't be a loser. The nature of it will be existential rather than negative or positive.

They will therefore have beauty and a song of their own if there are tears. They will be singing on their own, not because they are depressed or feeling unsuccessful, so you don't need to force them to sing anything.

And if the song starts to flow, it's just your joy being expressed; it has nothing to do with despair or crying.

neither in favour of nor against anything. It is merely the expression of who you are, which is why I refer to it as existential.

America has gone down a very bad path due to positive thinking, which has turned people into hypocrites. It is the most popular philosophy in America, despite the fact that it is complete garbage and not even a philosophy. It is not based on psychological research, it is not grounded in the deeper insights of meditation, and it does not comprehend human psychology. It is merely providing hope to those who are losing hope altogether. People are becoming more ambitious as a result.

The impoverished man believes that if he keeps thinking, a Cadillac will one day materialise in his porch, even though he doesn't currently have one. He needs to come up with a porch first! Thinking positively will build a porch, and thinking positively will bring a Cadillac. Please avoid sitting in such a car even if it does happen as it poses a risk. That man is having hallucinations because there is neither a car nor a porch.

He's not thinking clearly.

Everything must be merited. Napoleon Hill wrote the well-known book THINK AND GROW RICH, in which he emphasised that you will become wealthy if you think hard enough. He is one of the best writers America has ever produced, and millions of copies have been sold as a result. He writes with conviction and skill.

However, prior to that, on the occasion of the first publication of his book, he was present at the bookstall so that the publisher could present him to the patrons and he could sign the books.

And so Henry Ford, who was perusing books because he was a bookworm, happened to walk in and asked, ""What's going on? ""What is this man up to?""

He discovered that this was the renowned author Napoleon Hill, whose most recent work had just been released. ""He will be very happy to be introduced to you."" Henry Ford then went to see him. Napoleon Hill was introduced by the publisher with the words, ""He has written this book, THINK AND GROW RICH.""

Henry Ford asked Napoleon Hill, ""Have you come in your own car, or in a public bus?"" after glancing at the cover and title.

Napoleon Hill had to answer Henry Ford's question, ""Yes, I have come in a public bus,"" even though it seemed so insignificant at the time.

""When you have thought about a beautiful car enough, and it appears in your porch, then bring this book to me,"" Henry Ford said, returning the book to the man. Henry Ford here; I don't require this book.

I am aware that thinking will not make you wealthy. With this book, you can con impoverished people. Everyone aspires to be wealthy, so the book will likely do well on the market. If the book does well, you might even become wealthy enough to buy a car. But keep in mind that's not the situation. If you think that the car will appear, then I'll take the book.""

He was never able to visit Henry Ford, and the car never showed up. The strangest thing about that old man was that he would occasionally call and ask, ""What happened to the car? Remove the book from sale if it hasn't already appeared. It is blatantly deceptive."" Additionally, the entire book focuses on thinking only positively.

And the difference is evident: all thoughts, whether favourable or negative, are meaningless. They are the two halves of a single coin. You must transcend both the negative and the positive; you cannot shift from one to the other. You must let go of them both and transform into a mindless awareness. And whatever you do will come from that awareness with integrity. Everything you do will be incredibly beautiful. You will feel fulfilled in whatever you do.

0,2024-07-12,CMV: paternity uncertainty has shaped a misogynistic society and a communal family would stop society from catering to this insecurity,u/imnowonderwoman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e1cnyl/cmv_paternity_uncertainty_has_shaped_a/,changemyview,"The concept of paternal lineage has been very important throughout human history as a way of consolidating families and inheritances.

However, there was no way of being certain of paternity before paternity tests, which were invented very very recently. Paternity was mostly ensured through societal pressures like virginity, marriage, turning sex into “duty” for women instead of pleasure.

I just want to take a moment here and highlight that tracking a maternal lineage would be very much easier, as you don’t need proof of maternity, pregnancy and childbirth are pretty in-your-face about it. Women are also most likely to remain close to their children, as hormones influence their behaviour after childbirth. 

This deep rooted insecurity in men to be the ones in control when it comes to sex, pregnancy and childbirth has been allowed for far too long. The deal seems to have been that women get to be certain of their maternity at the expense of their body whereas men get to decide the fate of the woman and her child depending on how he feels about them. Men also experience a change in hormones after becoming a father but in order to get it they need to feel a bond (ownership?) over the baby.

I think we can all agree that regardless of how crappy adult women and adult men can be, all children deserve to grow up in a healthy, stable, loving household.

I don’t believe that the current model of the nuclear family is optimal. By current nuclear family I mean the family in which the mother and father of the baby are both responsible for the baby, regardless of the actual situation in which the baby is being had. It places way too much emphasis on paternity/maternity and not on childcare. All parents are flawed, you won’t be a better or worse one depending on if you have a biological connection to the child or not. And when a baby is around, singing songs about how they have the same ears as you is not the important bit, parenting the kid is. And that is a hell of a job for just one or two people.

I believe that a healthier version of the nuclear family would be a communal family. The more people around you who you trust and are childrearing around you, the better. Sometimes that can include your biological family, sometimes it’s your chosen family. Compatibility is important.

The concept of family would change to people who are in it together for the same goal of raising children in a healthy way. What would keep families together would be parenting styles/ communication styles/ interests, not blood, shared experiences and tolerance of differences.

Forming a family would mean finding likeminded people, not just getting someone pregnant. You can meet with a family that’s already formed and see if you are a good fit to become an aunt or uncle if you’re craving parenting but are infertile or not interested in having your own kids.

This would not really affect people who date casually and are not looking to be part of a family. Dating would stay largely the same as it is now i would say. 

Some disclaimers:

I am not advocating for cheating, poly relationships or some sort of female supremacy in the family. Men have an important role in parenting and it’s extremely important that they are active in the family.

*I am advocating to bring the focus of the family to childrearing in a communal way, regardless of if it’s your kid, the kid your loved one had in a past relationship, an adopted kid, your sister’s kid, your neighbour’s kid, a foster kid, etc.*

While mental health awareness has increased, leading to more diagnoses of conditions like depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD etc. A lot of individuals on reddit I've observed even seem to prefer having these labels than not.

However, the hidden cost of being diagnosed is it can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Individuals see themselves as permanently flawed with the knowledge that any period away from the symptoms is only temporary and that their ""chronic condition"" will come in another wave leading to a hopeless / pessimistic outlook and a hyperfocus on any symptoms which *may be* quite ""normal"". I.e mild anxiety that everyone goes through in unfamiliar situations (my anxiety disorder is acting up!), typical sadness (my depression is back!) or typical distractions / boredom (my ADHD is taking over!) etc. Of course, these things are NOT the same as the actual problem, but a person who is diagnosed can have a serious, dysfunctional issue **and also** have periods where their symptoms are more like a ""normal person"" .. however even if the symptoms are like a ""normal person"" they may still be seeing it as part of ""their issue"" because it's all they identify with at that point and they can't see themselves as normal anymore .. it would be like an elephant who was tied to a post his whole life, but then one day released from it and not realising he can leave the post because he had identified with that spot for so long as his ""new normal"" - he wouldn't be able to see he is free.

Focusing on addressing specific issues of the problem (i..e the symptoms) I think is more effective and prevent the self fulfilling issue of identifying with the diagnoses / label. Of course, there are times diagnoses IS helpful like for a family of a person who is having hallucionations or something severe that required medication, but other than getting medicine, the hidden cost I mentioned above of the self fulfilling prophecy is pretty bad and I don't think this gets talked about at all which leads me to believe people are unaware of it or dismissing it."

Lemme get it out of the way: I’m strictly focusing on the music here. Prince’s catalogue is wayyy stronger. Especially in his underrated mid 2000’s era which beat MJ’s by a mile. Prince is a far more talented musician and songwriter. 

But none of that matters when you compare Off The Wall to Prince’s For You or his self titled. Part of the reason for this is, in part because of Prince’s aforementioned musicality and ego, is he worked alone in the studio. No songwriters, no band, nobody else but him. And he was marketed that way too in part. But you’re only one man and MJ just happened to have some of the best musicians in the industry available and happy to work with him on his record. And you can hear it in the fucking drums and killer bass lines all over the album. 

Don’t get me wrong. Prince is an overall better musician, but he isn’t a god. He was not the best drummer in the world. He’d never make it as a session drummer. Which is fine! Because he wasn’t trying to be. But you get a totally different vibe in the song when you put a session musician who spent his whole life playing drums behind the kit versus a singer songwriter, who mostly plays guitar. 

That triple kick-snare combo to open up Rock With You isn’t his wheelhouse. I *can* see Stevie Wonder doing it however lol

Off The Wall has Girlfriend, Don’t Stop Till You Get Enough (whose needle-drop moment at the end of Rush Hour 2 alone makes justifies my CMV), Rock With You and Off The Wall. The last 3 are like the platonic ideal of disco to me. Prince has some great disco tracks. Don’t get me wrong. Just As Long As We’re Together is a fucking banger and I Wanna Be Your Lover. But for a guys first two albums, released back to back in 78’ and 79’, it’s a tall task. 

Put Prince, like Paul McCartney, doesn’t really work well taking advice on how to write songs. MJ on the other hand kind of acknowledged, at least in the beginning of his career, he wasn’t that strong of a songwriter, so he was willing to work with guys like Rod Temperton or take advice from Quincy Jones and that spirit of collaboration allows Off the Wall to sound both incredibly accessible but not slick. 

It wants to be catchy but the seasoned hands behind it never let it cross the line into being thirsty for audience attention. This isn’t an album that was audience tested before release. It’s confident enough in the hooks and musicianship that they’re sure the audience will meet them on their terms. 

And we do! "

Anti-Atom bomb sentiment, the idea if we just disarmed, the world would get better and safer, boy am I hear to tell you it's not that simple for several reasons 

1. Who manages it? Who will make sure nukes are being decommissioned? The UN, the UN and ICJ have shown they have no power, in the US has an Hague break-in act that allows them to rescue prisoners from the Hague or any other International prisons. Other powers? If the US or China whomever manages to dearm gets to take away everyones nukes who takes away their's? Enforcement is very much a nightmare having to manage dozens of countries and that many bombs.

2. The Military budget will explode and the size of it too. Without the security/semi-compaclency nukes have leered us into, the military budget would explode, so would the size of the military as the threat of War would loom heavy and peace through strength surges in popularity 

3. War. There will be more Wars cut and dry. China or whomever without any sort of nuclear detterent would feel they can just overrun their enemies convientoally leading to more violence worldwide as conventional wars over say border disputes explode like in the old days, and without the spectre of mad looming war would rage on.

4. Humans keep on innovating. Okay, there's no nukes what next? What if America decides they have a ODIN system that can lug tungsten rods capable of destroying whole cities, what if Russia comes out a Wolfenstein style sun-gun that can burn whole cities whole and melt nearly anything and evaporate lakes. Banning Nukes does nothing if cities are being leveled with space based superweapons or some nation finds a loophole 

Afterthoughts

The Environment would suffer from all of the wars caused as blown stuff hurts the atomsphere and climate

Research into clean nuclear energy about to stop climate change crashes 

What is a nuke? Could nations just wiggle around and use dirty bombs

117,2024-07-12,CMV: If a car starts chasing you it's safer to slow down vs speed up.,u/ImmodestPolitician,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e1m4q4/cmv_if_a_car_starts_chasing_you_its_safer_to_slow/,changemyview,"My friend was driving his Suburban with his family in the car on a curvy 1 lane highway up a hill. There was pickup truck hauling lawn mowers and such up a hill.

My friend, who I often call Speedracer,  tends to drive 10+ mph faster than speed limit in most places (85 or 90mph on a 65mph highway), so he passed the pickup. 

The pickup truck started tailgating the Suburban so my friend sped up to 110 mph. Well the pickup truck still kept tailgating.  Eventually the pickup turned off at an exit ramp. 

He thought he was real smart by trying to outrun the pickup truck because he was worried the pickup truck guy might shoot at his car. 

I think the smarter thing would have been to slow down and let the pickup truck pass or if he did point a gun at him,  you could attempt to run them off the road. 

Going faster just increases the chance of everyone in the Suburban dying in a crash via accident, even if the pickup truck had started shooting, a well placed shot would have been pure luck. 

I'm not saying you should stop if you are being chased, but going faster increases the risk dramatically.

EDIT: My title was worded incorrectly, I meant slow down to a reasonable speed from the 100mph speed and allow the pickup to pass."

I've watched some of them. I don't think they helped me or other viewers understand the issue better, challenge our preconceived notions, or change our view if it was based on faulty reasoning. 

I certainly found some online debates entertaining, such as when Norman Finklestein made Destiny look foolish in their debate on Lex Friedman's channel. Or a few years back when Slavoj Žižek debated Jordan Peterson on Capitalism vs. Marxism and it became clear in the debate that Peterson didn't know what Marxism was and hadn't read Marx's work. It was funny. But I don't know how much it helped anyone understand the issue. 

When I watch online debates I find myself fast forwarding through the side I disagree with. It's boring. Usually I can predict 99% of what they are going to say, and I've already dismissed those arguments. 

Youtube debating is usually about who can talk the fastest, talk the loudest, or make cool soundbites. Complex issues that are worth debating cannot be understood in 2 minute chunks.

I certainly believe that it is important to go outside one's own bubble, and challenge one's viewpoints with the strongest arguments from the other side. The best way to do this is reading or listening to their point of view outside of a debate context when they can calmly and methodically lay out their arguments and evidence. Debates don't leave time for that. 

Just for example I have strong views about Israel/Palestine. I formed those views by reading about the topic and listening to speakers (and visiting Israel). I have several Zionist books which I strongly disagree with on my bookshelf right next to me as I type this. No debate on the topic has really helped my viewpoint, and I cannot foresee a debate changing my viewpoint in the future. Every point brought up by a Zionist in a debate I view I've already heard or read in a more elegant form outside of the debate and dismissed.  

Most currently hot political issues I have strong opinions about, so i will admit I might not understand the perspective of someone who doesn't have strong views like me. "

In my view, white people cannot experience racism within a country where they are not a minority (e.g. Western Europe, Canada, USA, Australia, NZ, etc.) - so called 'reverse racism'. This view is coming from the understanding of racism as systemic and institutionalised; defined by Oxford Languages as

""*discrimination or* *~unequal~* *treatment on the basis of membership of a particular ethnic group (typically one that is a minority or* *~marginalized~**), arising from systems, structures, or expectations that have become established within an institution or organization.*”

You can have racial prejudice against white people - already forming a judgement about someone based solely on the colour of their skin - but I'd argue that by equating racism to racial prejudice is inherently harmful, because it equates centuries of discrimination and oppression with simple playground jokes made about someone's race; 'oh he's white, he can't handle spice' ≠ racism (in my view), but it is still racial prejudice. Racial prejudice isn't going to block you from opportunities and access to higher learning (e.g. apprenticeships and university), it isn't going to tangibly affect you or your life's progress (excluding extreme circumstances, such as hate crimes).

Here's an article that clearly lays out my viewpoint; [https://www.aclrc.com/myth-of-reverse-racism](https://www.aclrc.com/myth-of-reverse-racism), but I would be very interested to hear counter arguments to the statement

Additionally, I would argue that things like affirmative action aren't inherently *against* white people, they just give more opportunities to minorities, which, in my eyes, is a good thing; as Martin Luther King put it: ""*For it is obvious that if a man is entering the starting line in a race 300 years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.*”"

During his presidency, Biden has spent a substantial amount of money, particularly on Ukraine and various other projects. A situation can be that: individuals within Biden's cabinet or close to him may be receiving kickbacks from those who benefit financially from these expenditures. Wild imagination: Zelensky to someone who has significant influence over Biden: ""Secure $250 million in aid for me, and I'll give you a $25 million cut."" The public would be left in the dark about the true destination of their tax dollars. Ultimately, the blame would fall on Biden, as he is the one approving these expenditures.

On the other hand, Trump, at least would still be concerned about his legacy and would likely avoid approving reckless spending."

Part of the reason is poor economic performance, which is contradictory: how can every country's leader be responsible for their poor situation when everyone else is doing just as bad? Which is why I think people need to look outside of their local bubbles.

Especially in the US, with the fastest-growing economy in the G7, people still whine about inflation and high gas prices, even though gas prices are much higher almost anywhere else and inflation has stabilised a year ago. They should realise it's not just them: there are wars happening, Covid still has a lingering effect, etc. none of which the government had anything to do with."

It seems to me that whenever there is an issue in the world it is comparatively wealthy students who, rather than help the situation, turn it into some kind of fashion trend and push it to a ridiculous extreme. This in turn stokes an equal and opposite reaction in the wider public.

With my limited knowledge of global politics, I would personally support a ceasefire in Gaza. I believe this view has pretty broad support (at least in the U.K.) The scenes coming through from the conflict are just too horrific to continue. 

This view is made controversial by calls for a ‘global intifada’ or ‘from the river to the sea’ of such other euphemisms for the destruction of the state of Israel (which I definitely do not support).

I suspect some might argue “when people say global intifada it just means ‘rising up against oppression’”.

I believe students know this phrase is incendiary and intimidating, with global connotations of violence. They deliberately stoke tensions by not simply calling for a ceasefire, but scaring people with divisive rhetoric. The aim being more about showing off to their friends, than affecting peaceful change.

This is then seen and broadcast by news organisations that are already unfriendly to minorities. Viewers see this rhetoric and conflate it with the views of ordinary Muslims in the west. 

The net result is it feeds into pre existing fears about Islamic extremism, and pushes people further into full blown inslamaphobia. Which we can see evidenced in the elections across Europe (Reform U.K., French National Rally, AfD in Germany all making huge gains). 

As usual, poor minorities get hurt, whilst wealthy students get likes and shares.

0,2024-07-13,CMV: Israeli Defense Force’s “Hannibal Directive” is a departure from Western Morality,u/FemboyFinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e26rfq/cmv_israeli_defense_forces_hannibal_directive_is/,changemyview,"

\*\*Background Info:\*\*

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have a doctrine called the [Hannibal Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive). This directive states that if soldiers or civilians are captured, the IDF should engage terrorist targets regardless of the risk to the captives. For example, if a terrorist captures an SUV full of a family, the Hannibal Directive suggests that the IDF should destroy the vehicle.

The idea behind this is rooted in game theory. The objective is to deter hostage-taking by ensuring that the captors gain no advantage, even at a high immediate cost. The theory suggests that this will result in fewer civilian deaths over time.

On October 7th, there were allegations, initially dismissed as conspiracy theories, that the Hannibal Directive was used. Reports of missile strikes from helicopters and vehicle graveyards with hundreds of burned-out cars suggested advanced weaponry was used that Hamas didn't possess. Last week, a major Israeli news outlet confirmed some of these fears:

\[Haaretz article\](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-07/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-ordered-hannibal-directive-on-october-7-to-prevent-hamas-taking-soldiers-captive/00000190-89a2-d776-a3b1-fdbe45520000).

The reports claim that the directive resulted in a dozen or so deaths, but it’s likely higher. Of the 1,100+ people killed on October 7th, many could have been victims of these tactics. This high death count was then used to justify the military action in Gaza.

The aftermath of October 7th has now resulted in at least 25,000 violent deaths and up to 125,000 non-violent deaths in Gaza (\[The Guardian\](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/12/gaza-death-toll-indirect-casualties)). With a population of 550,000, this means that between 4% and 22% of Gaza civilians are now dead.

\*\*Change my view.\*\*

One of the fundamental principles of American military and political ethos is the sanctity of human life. This principle is deeply embedded in U.S. military doctrine and the rules of engagement. The United States Armed Forces are guided by stringent rules designed to protect civilians and prevent unnecessary loss of life, even at the risk of mission failure or higher casualties among soldiers. This is evident in various military operations where extraordinary measures are taken to avoid civilian casualties.

For instance, during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has often refrained from using overwhelming force to prevent civilian casualties, despite the risk to American soldiers. The emphasis has always been on minimizing harm to non-combatants, even when facing complex and dangerous situations.

Moreover, U.S. military training places a significant emphasis on the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and the rules of engagement that mandate the protection of civilian lives. These rules are not just theoretical but are actively enforced, with numerous instances where military operations have been aborted or adjusted to avoid civilian harm.

The American ethos also extends to the handling of hostages. The U.S. policy traditionally prioritizes the safe recovery of hostages without resorting to measures that would harm them. This approach reflects a broader commitment to human rights and the value of each individual life, aligning with international humanitarian standards.

In contrast, the Hannibal Directive's acceptance of collateral damage, including the potential sacrifice of hostages, starkly departs from these principles. This doctrine undermines the very essence of what many in the West consider just and humane conduct in warfare. The idea that the end justifies the means, especially when it involves deliberate harm to civilians or hostages, is antithetical to Western military ethics and the broader values of human rights and dignity that underpin them.

When I see people on reddit saying ""you all say you hate ubiost and EA, why do they still still sell so well?"" insinuating that people hate but still somehow buy the terrible product is insane to me. The people spending time talking about how bad things are aren't the ones buying these things, it's the casual group that we don't see that make up the majority of the console market and they don't seem to care about how bad things are getting with EA saying they'll put ads in their games, Ubisoft charging ludicrous amounts for special editions and trying to get people to buy their subscriptions

There are still great AAA games, fromsoft is doing the lord's work and it's crazy to me that more companies don't see how much money there is to be made in great single player, no bs, games

The layoffs after companies declare record profits, the crunch culture will only make talented developers less likely to commit to the industry and i can't blame them for it which makes games worse in the end.

Please change my mind and tell me why AAA gaming can get better, for now, indie all the way

2- you're not actually talking or spending a lot of time together, pricey food has to be appreciated fully and it's a waste to talk while you eat, so you're spending two hours at most togheter 

3- men usually have to pay which is dumb because it sets up expectations for both, some women think that a dinner is owed and some men think that, after paying for dinner, sex is owed which is uncomfortable for both parties.

1,2024-07-13,CMV: I don't think Sexual Orientation/Attraction is set at birth,u/Accurate-Albatross34,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e28ekz/cmv_i_dont_think_sexual_orientationattraction_is/,changemyview,"Let me say right of the bat, that I don't think you just consciously decide who you are attracted to, nor is this some conservative think piece explaining why being gay is a choice.

I think that on some level, genetics does play a role on who you are attracted to, at least during the early stages of life, but imo, so does, the culture you grew up in, the media/books/games you consume, the people you meet, random experiences/encounters you have, all of it has a level of influence as well, to cut it short, I just think it's very complex and somewhat fluid.

[Is Our Sexual Orientation Determined by Biology? | OpenMind (bbvaopenmind.com)](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/bioscience/is-our-sexual-orientation-determined-by-biology/)

This is kind of a short summary of a pretty massive study that was done in regards to finding the link between genes and homosexuality, it's a short summary, but what you will conclude, is that there certainly seems to be some link between genetics and sexual orientation, however you'll see that that link only affects a persons sexual behavior at about 25% at most, as I said at the beginning though, the main researcher concludes, that this does not mean that sexual orientation is completely disconnected from biology and it certainly doesn't mean, that being gay is a lifestyle choice.

Another aspect pf this is the societal repercussions of making a statement like this. In regards to this study, (quoting from the article that I linked) Vitti, an activist with the LGBTQIA+ community, wrote on the Broad Institute blog: “I have yet to see a compelling argument that the potential benefits of this study outweigh its potential harms.” and I do agree with this 100%, in terms of the practical consequences of a study like this, it can increase stigma for LGBT people and give ammo to certain political groups to misuse this information, so I'm not arguing about how saying this would be some net positive about humanity.

I also admit that all of this could just be coming from my personal experience, considering that for about 20 years of my life I just thought I was 100% straight, and then thanks to some events/encounters, (won't go into details) I found attraction towards the same sex as well,(definitely didn't feel it before). At this point in my life I just identify as pan, as in sex and gender really doesn't play any role in terms of my attraction to people anymore. So yea, all of this did come from a personal bias of sorts, though of the research that I've done, I haven't found anything conclusive that it is 100% biologically influenced.(or even that biology is the main factor.)

It also doesn't make sense to me on an intuitive level, because a ton of things go into who you are attracted to, not just genitalia. If we say that it's all set at birth, then genitalia would have to be the deciding factor, because every other characteristic can be found in both males and females(I'm not talking about hermaphrodites, they have both genitalia,) If a straight man sees another person and is attracted to their slim body, long pretty hair, and a ton of other stereotypical feminine attributes, but it turns out that they are a man, is the attraction just automatically gone after revealing the genitalia, what about if it's the most beautiful and most feminine man on earth, literally having every characteristic of a stereotypical 10/10 woman, but also a flat chest, and let's say a small penis, would the attraction automatically just disappear? it's not a yes or no question, as I said, I just think all of this is very complex."

I've talked to many atheists regarding this matter about objective and subjective moral frameworks, but so far, I've not come across an answer to this question.

How would an atheist possess any type of objective moral framework without a belief in an infallible, all-knowing lawgiver?

For example, in japan, a 50 year old man could marry a 16 year old, but the moment he enters the US, he's a paedophile.

How would you navigate such an issue.

As a religious muslim man myself, I've always found it strange that atheists would use arguments such as such and such religious figure in history killed x amount of people, or married such and such at such an age, yet when you ask them why that is wrong they would stumble. 

Some try and use science to justify the liberal worldview in which pleasure is maximised and pain minimised but as we know science is merely an iterative process through which empircal observations of the natural world can be explained through the development of theories.

These theories can then be tested when new observations are discovered through the advancement of technology and the theory can then be updated.

But how does this process relate to morality at all?

You could try and question my morality and why would believing in God make my values objective but that doesn't absolve atheism of the issue on subjective morality.


So how would you tackle this cmv?"

Black slavery was part of the culture of the time, and it was not right, and I think we can all agree on that. This is something that silently bothers me so I would like to hear the other side to see if I can understand it. If it's religious I could understand it, even when I'm not religious myself, because from a religious person's perspective, it is the indisputable word of God and cannot be doubted.

The argument I see the most often is that some women choose to wear the hijab, I'm obviously not talking about these cases, please refrain from bringing this up. 

I find the idea that women should cover themselves in restrictive clothing in order to ""protect themselves from lewd gazes and abuse"" ridiculous and kinda like victim blaming, why is the victim forced to forfeit her liberties instead of the abuser learning to not...abuse. And yeah I understand the Quran is also sexist with men, but then again, it doesnt make it right.

""It helps control how sexualized women are, and keeps beauty standards down to earth"" Again, the victim shouldnt change for the abuser's sake, and if the natural standard is men so lustful they can't see a woman's hair, I prefer sexualizing women.

""It's like women being required to wear a bra"" It totally isn't. Women, at least currently, \*choose\* to wear a bra for comfort, and sometimes even to make their breasts look better. And wearing a bra is not mandatory.

""It's the same as having to cover your genitals in public"" No, there is a biological imperative, mating instincts, that makes us specially attracted to genitals, also our primary genitals are not only for reproducing but also for excreting, so it's also considered unhygienic. And it can be disruptive.

""You just think that way because of traditional western values"" Yes, yes I do. I don't agree with with everything in traditional western values, but generally I do, and that does not, in any way, affect the validity of an argument, I stand by what I believe because I see logic in it, not because the TV or my parents told me to. And it's why I'm eager to hear the logic in the counter-argument to update my own.

Again, before we discuss, I want to stablish that I do not hate Islam."

0,2024-07-13,CMV: Mr beast would be a good president in 10 years when he’s able to run,u/snuggie_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2bkcj/cmv_mr_beast_would_be_a_good_president_in_10/,changemyview,"So I’m sure you’ve all seen that Mr beast tweet probably largely sarcastically saying he would run if they dropped the age requirement. I’ve seen it go around a lot so I wanted to talk about it. Most people agree he’d be a bad politician and while some people think he would be good but I haven’t actually seen a real discussion about it so that’s what I’m doing here. I’ll list a few reasons why I think he’d be a good president (in 10 years) or at least why I think *he’d be better than most candidates we actually get.*

First of all I want to address the point that most people go “just because you’re a good person and famous does not mean you know anything about politics” and I’d come back and say I think even most conservatives would agree that trumps isn’t a particularly great person, nor did he know anything about politics when he ran, but now people view him as a politician way before a businessman. Regardless of what you think of his policies, I don’t see how someone can think that trump is an adequate politician while also thinking Mr beast is unable to do politics. Trump pretty much ran on the fact that he was outside the norm And the fact he WASNT a politician was a specific reason a lot of people liked him. People would say “well he’s a great businessman so it’s different” and to that I’d respond that Mr beasts companies are worth more today than trumps were when he ran for president. Not to mention he didn’t have wildly rich parents and connections to assist in his growth. 

Now on to a standalone point. This one is pretty simple. Mr beast is a genuinely good person who also cant be bought. This already puts him above most candidates we’ve had in my book. It’s a low bar but it’s still a bar that I think holds a lot of value in today’s political landscape. He obviously lives an incredibly modest life for someone who was offered a billion dollars for his companies. And it’s hard to deny how much time, effort, and money he puts into charity. We’ve also had plenty of rich presidents who in theory couldn’t be bought but I don’t think being rich completely solidified that point. I think being rich while also not really using much money on personal things is what truely shows that money isn’t a big driver of anything.

Lastly a point that I don’t think many people have mentioned: Mr beast has a wildly obsessive personality which also gives him a crazy work ethic. Sure maybe he doesn’t know much about a lot of political stuff as many presidents don’t, I have no idea. But I’d think he’d be a lot more inclined to actually learn them compared to most. If you’ve ever watched him in any interviews you’d know that he pretty much thinks anything is a waste of time when he isn’t actively learning something new. I can’t think of a better trait for a position that just inherently can’t know everything they’re going to be managing. For instance obviously every president has areas where they know nothing about and they just refer to others who may. 


It goes without saying that most of my points can’t really be proven or disproven. For all we know he’s just been faking being nice to gain power. There are kind of two arguments I’m putting forward. If we assume everything I said is true, does that make a good president? Or also you can obviously argue that my statements are not true."

I am a college student. I am really really not a fan of capitalism, and more often than not think more socialist aligned ideals would benefit my country (USA). 

However saying this, it genuinely blows me away to hear other college students say they’re “communist”.  To anyone who has spent any time looking at history I don’t think I should have to explain myself. Tens upon tens of millions of deaths at the hands of dictatorships. All of them either through famine, war, political violence, disease etc.. Beyond that there quite literally are no more major communist nations left…they ALL failed on the largest scale and are now only a collection of 3rd world nations (none of which truly communist) with one of them being North Korea. 

This is clearly an economic system that doesn’t work. You could argue that capitalism itself contributed to the downfall of communism, or that capitalism has killed as many people; so communism is such a weak and non-hardy ideology that it collapses in the face of others? So you believe that Mao ZeDong’s famines in China or Stalin’s in Ukraine is equal to what? American poverty?

Saying you’re a communist in 2024 has some weird connotation that you’re better than everyone else- that you’re the most progressive in the room, when in reality you’re just virtue signaling with an ideology deadlier than Nazism. Communism in its short 150 year~ (1848-1991) lifespan did nothing but destroy the world’s political climate and kill millions of people. There is no evidence to the contrary, and the “it works on paper!” Argument is stupid. Having an imaginary ideology doesn’t count as having an ideology. I would like to hear a coherent argument that’s based on the real world advocating for communism without sounding brain dead (I.e. entirely hypothetical thinking, ignoring historical precedent, etc.)"

89,2024-07-13,CMV: There is no ethical reason to enable mass immigration*,u/budedussylmao,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2e0ju/cmv_there_is_no_ethical_reason_to_enable_mass/,changemyview,"\*Moreso posting in the context of the Canadian flavor of this, where we bring in (en mass), Indian students who're generally just here for low-skill work (we have a massive problem with diploma mills). I am perfectly fine with economic migrants that have skills we'd otherwise lack in the country, or migrants to supplement a struggling labor supply in a high skilled (and high pay) enviroment. But said migrants should *always* be more expensive than a usual citizen.

However, I'm firm enough in my stance that I think it'll apply to most situations. What I'm against is the usual economic suspects (ae, low skill workers- in Canada's case, usually ""students""), mostly for the following reasons:

* It's a shit solution to a poorly implemented system.

One of the arguments I see towards mass immigration (at least in the Canadian context), is that it props up our social security via a short term influx of tax income. This, obviously, doesn't work long term. as it's literally a ponzai scheme. Patching the issue now via mass numbers of (generally low earning) tax payers (if they're a net positive at all, I'll get to that) is just going to make the issue exponentially worse as time goes on, especially because birth rates ""normalize"" to the rest of the country pretty much instantly.

* They aren't a benefit.

In the case of Canada, immigrants are a net negative from a tax perspective due to low earnings, burden on social services like health care (especially due to their family being brought over as well). They're an overall fiscal burden to our society, and as such, don't benefit society - and are a drain on the average taxpayer.

* Too many cooks.

Especially a Canadian issue here, but we don't have enough houses for the amount of people we're bringing in, and the benefit brought by said people (as discussed) are already negative. this is a double whammy. Supply and demand is an incredibly simple market force, and one that's being pumped into overcharge here.

* Too Many Cooks: Intentionally.

I'm a firm belief that one of the driving factors of immigration is wage suppression. if it's not an intended goal, it's a clearly visible & easy to predict side effect. Canada's economy is already bad enough without a significant surplus of low-skilled labor for the lower end positions. This would be less of an issue if we prioritized the import of otherwise impossible to fill positions (ae, niche engineering fields, software dev, silicon fabrication, etc), but for the most part we're getting timmies workers.

* A dilution of Values.

We're proportionally speaking bringing in too many people to properly integrated them with ourselves, leading to cultural enclaves, increases in crime (tends to happen when importing low-class, generally poverty-bound workers from low trust societies) and overall societal malcontent. This obviously isn't a good thing, and has lead to a rapidly rising discontent towards them (which also obviously isn't a good thing). 

This is farther compounded via factors like wage subsidies (for some reason?) for companies hiring immigrants, offering explicit encouragement to hire ""non Canadian"" people (it's cheaper!) - in addition, immigrants are also more prone to being unfamiliar with their rights as workers, and are more prone to abuse as a result. it's unhealthy, manipulative, and overall a negative for all involved (asides the corpos, of course)

* For the people?

Our current immigration policy doesn't prioritize the economic and societal wellbeing of people born here, and offers subsidies, societal benefits, and other ""carrots"" to people who will never give more than they take. this isn't something I'm morally for. The goal of the government should be to prioritize and optimize the wellbeing of it's people, which mass immigration almost never does.

* Diversity isn't our strength.

This is noted almost globally. the most high trust societies are homogeneous, and while I won't make assumptions as to the how, it's hard to not notice that countries like Japan have more societal cohesion than we do in Canada nowadays. In addition, I'm a firm believer of the belief that cultures are at their best when given time to develop, with minimal influence from outside sources. while this is obviously impossible nowadays due to Pax Americana being the global default (which was always an issue for Canada), I fail to see how we're better off inevitably forming a grey sludge of cultures over time. 

In ages past, this was used to justify how the US and Canada were built (generally ignoring the horrendous conditions), but I feel the dynamic is different enough nowadays that the same concept no longer applies the same. they're not risking it all to come to a developing country, they're working minimum wage in a drive through & using social benefits.

* Not our problem

I've noticed a few go ""Uh h well colonialism"" or whatever to justify it (ignoring the above points regarding how a country should only do things beneficial to it's populace) , and - no. Colonialism doesn't justify it, especially because Canada didn't colonize india in the first place lol. And even if they did, I don't buy any ""Sins of the father"" BS.

* Who's values? not ours!
Minor point, and related to the above ""Too slow in regards to cultural assimilation"" - we're bringing in people who conflict with otherwise popular ideological viewpoints like 2SLGBTQAA+support, farther dividing our country.


* I had one harass me to get a master card credit card at walmart once.

I'm sure there's actual benefits I missed beyond the usual economic excuses, and I'm open to alternate viewpoints, but I struggle to understand the progressive reasoning behind this as a policy (or open borders, for that matter). It's not a situation where they give more than they take. I'm a firm believer that it's just a band-aid fix over an infected wound (that being Canada's complete lack of actual industry/economy, we pretty much just export virtue signalling and houses to investors) that'll come back to bite us in the ass later, both from an economic, societal, and cultural point."

United States case, SCOTUS has set a precedent opposed to the ideas of the Founding Fathers and the ideas of originalism, of which they followed for the longest.

The power of the president to be immune in official acts makes it impossible for the Senate to initiate an impeachment case over the aforementioned official acts, and is staunchly against what Alexander Hamilton said in The Federalist Papers, no. 77, of which he stated:

""The answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics, and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances; from the election of the President once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other, and to forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law. But these precautions, great as they are, are not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security. In the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared, the Chief Magistrate of the United States would, by that plan, be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body. What more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people?""

Not only this, but the SCOTUS ruling overrides a core element of Article 1 of the Constitution where it states the Senate will have total power to try the President in an impeachment case.

It is obvious that SCOTUS, composed of primarily conservative judges, are corrupt in the favor of Trump to such an extent as to practically override a core element of the Constitution, oppose what the Founding Fathers ever believed in, and give absolute authority to the President for zero reason in law."

0,2024-07-13,CMV: It is unreasonable to think that the US shouldn't have invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and any other country would have done the exact same thing if they had the means to do so.,u/The_Naked_Buddhist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2fozx/cmv_it_is_unreasonable_to_think_that_the_us/,changemyview,"So I will preface this by stating that I am not an American and while technically alive at the time was young enough that it's not really relevant. As such I have no skin in the game whatsoever, as such consider this CMV not being to convince me that the invasion of Afghanistan was wrong but rather that it is reasonable to think it was wrong. Note as well this is only about the invasion of Afghanistan and not Iraq, I see that as a separate matter entirely.

This post is made in response to seeing numerous times now individuals, mostly Americans from what I've seen, describe the decision to invade Afghanistan as wrong, immoral or unreasonable. This to me sounds like an absolutely insane perspective to take. Based of all information I have as a non American the invasion was not only reasonable but quite literally any country with the means would have also invaded Afghanistan. I struggle to think how anyone could look at the sequence of events and think invading Afghanistan was the wrong move. I will lay out the facts as I understand them.

1. Prior to 9/11 Bin Laden became more and more radicalized and joined numerous extremist circles. While aware of him at the time US intelligence agencies did not perceive him as a threat and so were not alarmed when he joined yet another extremist group; Al-Qaeda. Unknown to the states this is when the plan for 9/11 began to be formulated.
2. On 9/11 the 9/11 attacks happened resulting in the deaths of numerous civilians and untold damage and injuries to the others and the city of New York as a whole. At the time the event was totally unexpected and no one knew immediately who was responsible.
3. Later, (I believe even the exact same day,) Al-Qaeda took credit for the attack, Bin Laden a few months after the attack also shared a letter he wrote explaining why 9/11 was done that can be read [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20231116112651/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gwwRw1--gfMJ:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver&hl=en&gl=us) The reasons he gives is due to US opposing different Islamic countries/forces around the world, for ""prevent\[ing\] our people from establishing the Islamic Shariah, using violence and lies to do so,"" for ""surrendering to the Jews,"" and that attacking civilians is fine since they're American citizens and thus responsible for the governments actions. He also states that the aim of the attack was to call for America to convert to Islam, make illegal the LGBT community, alcohol, gambling, enforce Sharia law exclusively, end the separation of religion and state, end opposition to all Islamic countries and groups, and to stop supporting ""the Jews"" who he accuses of secretly controlling the US government.
4. Due to the above taking of credit, and the rightful dismissal of those insane demands, the US looked into removing Al-Qaeda as a group who were currently based in Afghanistan. At the time the force essentially in control there was the Taliban who refused to hand of Al-Qaeda; as such the US began the invasion of Afghanistan.
5. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda quickly fell and collapsed turning into a disparate fighting force. Due to the total lack of government the states spent the next 20 years in the country propping up a new more secular democratic government and fighting off these remnants. This was clearly necessary as clearly illustrated by the fact said government collapsed immediately upon the states leaving.

From this I can't see how anyone could reasonably hold the view that the war was somehow started on the wrong terms. It started when forces that Afghanistan was sheltering attacked unprovoked, and then publicly gave a series of insane demands as well as revealing that their reasoning behind their decision was equally unhinged. Said group also made it clear they planned to continue attacks such as this so long as they existed. In order to stop this the US had to invade Afghanistan, the following occupation also in turn had to follow logically and is best illustrated from the fact that the Taliban took control again immediately upon their leaving.

To address two things first, neither of the following two points will CMV on this; firstly the idea that somehow the point of the US intervening with other Islamic nations and forces justifies these attacks. No they do not, unless you want to convince me that right now Italy has just cause and is a-okay morally and logically making attacks today against Chinese, Japanese or Korean citizens over tensions they have with other non-Italian Christians then this argument falls apart. It's just clear insane talk since the US didn't start intervening in Afghanistan until AFTER 9/11. Secondly an argument that because the States ultimately lost Afghanistan to the Taliban again also won't work, that doesn't mean the war was unjustified, it just means they lost. If Ukraine lost the war tomorrow that doesn't mean they were wrong to defend themselves against Russia.

In order to CMV just try and explain why any reasonable person could hold the view that the war was wrong and that the US should never have invaded Afghanistan. You can do this by explaining some sort of error in my understanding of events (such as the Taliban willingly handing over Al-Qaeda) or some sort of aspect I missed (such as the US already having started an invasion of Afghanistan prior to 9/11), or some sort of other alternative that was never tried. Again you don't have to convince me this war was wrong, just that a reasonable person could think it was wrong despite the nature of the war from my current understanding."

As such I regularly stumble upon Serena Williams being referred as ""the greatest female tennis player of all time"", ""the greatest tennis player of all time"" or even ""the greatest athlete of all time"". I am always quite surprised by these claims, because I don't really see her fit to either of them.

I know it's hard to define greatness, but there are some important aspects. You could say that the greatest tennis player is the one with most Grand Slam titles. But then strictly speaking, it is Margaret Court with 24... I don't think this is a good metric though. You have to factor in the manner in which the titles were won. 

But how can then Serena with 23 titles spread over 18 years rival Steffi Graf, who did 22 in 11 years. Most would probably say that Graf was much more dominant. She even won all the Grand Slams and Olympics in the same year (1988).

One thing Graf lacks is the success in doubles. However, if you start factoring doubles in, you must necessarily arrive at Martina Navratilova being the all-time greatest with her ridiculous:

* 18 singles GS titles
* 8 singles Tour Finals titles
* 31 doubles GS titles
* 13 doubles Tour Finals titles
* 167 overall singles titles (Serena has 73)

You could perhaps say that the best player is the most consistent one, but who can then rival Chris Evert, who reached semifinals on all of her first 34 Grand Slams which she entered? Career statistics of Evert cannot be rivaled by Serena in terms of consistency in any way or shape. 

Of course all of them played in different eras and one can say that the field had different depth. But we also have a tool to compare this. We can borrow the well-known probabilistic ELO metric from chess. This should indeed account for changes in the structure of the competition field. And people calculated this [viz. article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/). All they came to is that Serena peaked lower and for shorter time than Navratilova, Graf and Seles and she was even outplayed by Henin for quite some time. 

Lastly, one could factor the behaviour of the player into greatness. On this level, Serena truly fails. Her on court antics were sometimes abysmal (e.g. US Open 2018). On the other hand, most of the other players including Graf and Navratilova were rather classy.

I believe that there is hardly a serious argument for her being better than 3rd best female tennis player of all time and she is just popular in the US. Change my view!"

In short almost all of the developed world would require such fundamental changes to how established entitlement programs work that would be exceptionally unpopular but require such radical reformation that doing so democratically would be near impossible.

In short I believe this is the biggest, most likely threat to Western Govt stability over the next 20-30 years."

But I think a lot of people have just jumped on the bandwagon and started yelling about it without ever knowing what they really are standing for. 

Most people chanting ""From the river to the sea"" or other phrases like this do not even know the meaning of what they are saying. Not to mention that these statements are usually inflammatory coming out of these people's mouths. People scream these at protests but refuse to acknowledge any other point of view as having a sliver of validity, because a different opinion just equals wrong here. All this does is create more hate between the two sides when both sides can't talk about it without being accused of any number of hateful words. If on average more people were tolerant of people with different views on this subject, and tried to educate, the divide in countries beside Israel/Palestine wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Most people on both sides also don't hope for the possibility of a cease-fire. They want the eradication of a state, one way or another. This has become a war of hate, both in those countries and in others.

Furthermore, the age demographic I am referring to has completely forgotten about the Russo-Ukrainian war. Months ago, it used to be all about saving Ukraine, and now I have not heard a single word about it out of anyone's mouths in months besides during presidential address'/ the debate. Keeping this trend, I would say it isn't out of the realm of possibility that they also abandon this Issue if/when something worse comes along.

On the opposite end, a sitting president deciding not to run, and there being a contested party primary, has never gone well.

People bitch about his health, but people said the same things about FDR and Ronald Reagan, both of whom won in multiple landslides. The concerns for all of these people are valid, but thinking someone is too old does not mean you will not vote for them. If you think it means he can't govern, I mean, the country isn't a disaster. Wilson was braindead near the end, and FDR won WWII from his deathbed. Explain what is so different now compared to then.

Biden's favorability or approval is low; people compare it to Carter. But Trump's ratings are also historically low. Carter ran against Ronald Reagan, a historically charismatic candidate. Moreover, these fluctuate with time, and in the mind of someone with an actual spine, you would work to move those up instead of just dropping the only person to ever defeat Trump.

Anyone who says ""it is different now becuase X"" (social media, or populist moment, etc) needs to provide some evidence that whatever factor they think is important has actually changed the historically fact that incumbent with no primary almost always win."
88,2024-07-13,CMV: Designer babies are inevitable and I see no reason to prohibit it,u/Suitable_Ad_6455,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2jb9r/cmv_designer_babies_are_inevitable_and_i_see_no/,changemyview,"We already have ways to screen embryos for disease-causing single gene mutations by In Vitro Fertilization and Pre-Implantation Genetic Testing. It's even recommended to some parents who carry a genetic disease. I see no ethical reason why IVF + PGT shouldn't be used to select for not just the absence of disease, but the presence of other desirable traits in embryos. When people choose sperm donors for IVF, they already use information about the donor's health history, career, intelligence, appearance, etc. to find the best possible donor for their child. What's the difference between that and IVF + PGT that selects for desirable traits, such as low susceptibility to mood disorders and high intelligence? 

As our understanding of the genetic links to these traits grows, and if CRISPR editing of embryos becomes safe and effective, it will be easier and easier to perform this practice. It is inevitable that people will seek out the procedure, and if it's banned in their country, those with enough money will go abroad.

Some common objections are:

1) Socioeconomic divide: Yes, the rich will be the first to have access to IVF + PGT embryo selection. This is the case for every technology that has improved our lives on this planet. This will also be the case whether this technology is legal or not (rich people will find a way to do it internationally). Economies of scale will eventually reduce the costs and give the poor access to the same genetic panel testing as the rich. There won't be a ""$5,000 premium version of IVF + PGT"" and a ""$100 base version."" Rich people in rich countries already create significant advantages for their kids through proper nutrition, advanced medical care, private education, career networks and connections, etc. 

2) Appeal to nature fallacy: It's no more unethical to genetically select for intelligence and low susceptibility to mood disorders than it is to send your kids to school or pay for access to therapists and mental health services. Just because one is ""unnatural"" doesn't make it wrong."

",u/LuxembourgsFinest,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2jr0o/cmv_october_7th_was_an_attempt_at_a_genocide_and/,changemyview,"Let’s start with the numbers:

In just one day, Hamas killed 1200 Israelis. If they were somehow able to repeat 10/7 for a month straight, which they’ve vowed to do until Israel is destroyed, that death toll would have turned into 37,200, at the very least. The current Gaza death toll is about 38,000, and it took 10 months to get there. The rate of Hamas’ attack could have done the same toll in just 1 month. 

Now let’s look at the intent: 

Genocide is defined as, **“the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.”** 

Hamas went into Israel and started deliberately and indiscriminately killing anyone they encountered, whether it be a civilian, police officer, or soldier. Even a few Gazans working in Israel and non Israeli tourists were killed. And as I said earlier, [Hamas has literally vowed to repeat 10/7 over and over again until Israel is destroyed.](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/hamas-official-vows-to-repeat-oct-7-attack-repeatedly-to-teach-israel-a-lesson/amp_articleshow/104903949.cms), which is quite literally the definition of genocide. 

Their intent isn’t secret, they’re not ashamed to tell the world that if they can, they *will* genocide every last Israeli man, woman, and child(though probably only the Jewish ones). And their charter doesn’t hide it either. October 7th was their way of showing that they are ready and willing to bring about another Holocaust, and yet, millions of pro-Palestinian-Leftist activists
- [excuse it,](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/fringe-left-groups-express-support-hamass-invasion-and-brutal-attacks-israel) 
- [celebrate it](https://www.timesofisrael.com/pro-palestinians-celebrate-hamas-attack-as-israel-supporters-rally-in-new-york/amp/), 
- [and parade Hamas as saviors](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/anti-israel-activists-celebrate-hamas-attacks-have-killed-hundreds-israelis)

And that’s where the complicity and hypocrisy comes in. They claim they’re against killing & genocide, but not against the one that started this current war in the first place.

0,2024-07-13,cmv: I believe communism is a morally bankrupt ideology.,u/Lord_of_Creation_123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2kgns/cmv_i_believe_communism_is_a_morally_bankrupt/,changemyview,"I believe that the democratic ownership of the means of production will always lead to totalitarian dictatorships because of the fact that it results in a purely democratic society in all ways, which is bad, because then the majority can vote to take away power from the minority. Mob justice is democratic rule after all. Marxism is incredibly logically consistent, but I really don't like its axioms. Value is derived from the labor of the person, material conditions cause marxism to be inevitable, and the moral critique of the virtues associated with communism.



Fundamentally, I reject all axioms within the context of marxist theory. Value does not derive from the work put into a thing, if that were true, if I were to work on painting a piece of a rock for 20 hours, the labor would be worth the same as a doctor who saved lives. Marxists try to get around this by describing socially necessary labor as the important thing, but that is false. If we only did socially necessary labor, there is no separation between the socially necessary labor of the laborer and the labor of a bill gates who created the personal computer. The value is the same, which is absurd to even think about. The thing about marxist labor theory of value, is that it postulates that because in order to have any form of exchange, a commodity must have some metaphysical property in common with another commodity that makes it exchangeable. Which is already a metaphysical leap that there must be a common element in order to exchange, but ok. Why then, is the metaphysical property of the commodity labor? There are many other things that make commodities have metaphysical things in common with each other in the abstract. Like the order and information a commodity represents. Why can't the commodity have a metaphysical value in the sense of the information it represents, which includes labor/energy, ideas, mass, and other things like aesthetic value? Why is the unifying metaphysical link specifically the labor of a thing?



Next, and I got majorly yelled at for posting this on a communist discord asking questions, because apparently I don't understand what dialectics are. But second, from my understanding of marxism and hegel, history has progress that can be ascertained via a dialectic process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This is also I believe, false. History does not have a progress to it, where we learn wholeheartedly from the mistakes of our ancestors via culture. The progress of history depends on us never forgetting things through our culture. We have to retain the lessons of history in some sort of metaphysical implicit memory, which is not something that I agree with. History repeats itself because we do not learn, there is no implicit memory. It is also important to point out that there is another dimension where communists say marxism is inevitable, because capitalism will destroy itself. The reason they say that, is because Marx said that over time, the profit margins of capitalism will decrease because companies will be stuck in a sort of game theory prisoners dilemma whereby the rational thing to do is to not innovate or compete in order to maintain your profit margins. A japanese economist by the name of Okishio mathematically proved this impossible (although he did prove fundamental marxist theorem whereby the laborer is never paid the full value of their labor by capitalists, which is the only point of marxism I agree with, it is better to exploited by a capitalist than not to be exploited at all). The only situation in which companies will actively sabotage their companies for profitability is in a gold standard system, which in some ways, does make marx correct about capitalism. But we have since moved on to fiat currency.



Thirdly, the moral virtue of communism. There are numerous times where Marx's critique goes from a critique of the material conditions to a critique of the moral ones. He was a great materialist philosopher who just worked from false axioms, but a horrible ethical one, and it shows in his critiques. He regularly says that the reason capitalism is bad is because it produces vice. He critiques the the lumpenproletariat and the bourgeoisie as being 'creatures without virtue' who live their lives by not holding to the value of hard work and laziness. It is actually quite victorian in its moral sensibilities, and it shows. But the thing about virtues is that they are not objective morality. What do I mean by this? Well, it is a moral sensibility that goes back to Aristotle. In essence, virtues are the things that allow for eudaimonia, which is a greek word that translates very poorly into english, but basically means the ability of a thing to do its function, like the sharpness of a knife allowing it to cut. Aristotle told us that it is virtues that allow us to be moral by allowing us to best live up to what it means to be morally fulfilled. But there is a second order thinking problem. Why is it good to be virtuous, and isn't moral fulfillment something that is culturally defined? Many psychopaths throughout history have felt morally fulfilled at being serial killers. Therefore, by saying that the goodness of a thing is dependent on the virtue, what one is actually saying without realizing it is that morality is dependent on the culture describing whether a human being is a knife or hammer, which would require different properties to be virtuous. Virtues can lead to consequences where evil emerges. If you have bread but not enough bread to feed a lot of people, if you treat them all as human beings with a degree of empathy, you will all collectively starve to death because there is not enough bread for everyone. This is why I ignore all forms of virtue ethics. Liberal tolerance is not good, libertarian greed is not good, communist empathy is not good, fascist loyalty and violence isnt good, christian conservative chastity and charity isnt good. What is in fact morally real is the reality of the consequence that comes with it. That is what makes morality objective. Murder is not bad because one is stealing the objective value of a person's life, which is utilitarianism and is a whole 'nother rabbit whole which if you go down justifies fascism, but rather because of the pain of the consequences that the murder represents. By prescribing to the idea of virtue ethics, communists who say that it is objectively moral because of its virtues, are actually saying that they are moral relativists who don't believe in the objective morality of consequence. No virtue or vice is immune from the reality of the consequence it causes. And to go a bit more into depth of what consequentialism entails, it is not morality by pain avoidance, because sometimes there must be pain in order for a certain consequence to play out. There is no situation in which your choices do not have consequences. I've run into hypotheticals like 'what if you rape someone and they are asleep and you don't cause any pain to them actively, that would be moral under consequentialism' But I would argue, it is not. There is never any situation in which you can choose which will cause no pain, it is pointless hypothetical I believe. When I brought this into the conversation with marxists, they said he never said this, but quote 'the dangerous class, (lumpenproletariat) the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.' 



I can elaborate more if anyone asks, and will do so in the comments. Just my thoughts."
242,2024-07-13,CMV: There is no reason to boycott McDonalds and Starbucks because of the Israel vs Palestine war and it’s a trend done for moral high ground,u/Alert-Challenge-7064,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2l4uo/cmv_there_is_no_reason_to_boycott_mcdonalds_and/,changemyview,"I see people all over social media saying to boycott McDonalds because they “support Israel” and that if you don’t, you are a bad reason who supports kids getting bombed.

Now me personally, I’m neutral on this as I don’t really want to delve into politics too much but from what I actually researched, the reason why people are even boycotting McDonalds is because ONE single franchise in Israel gave free meals to the IDF. 

The problem with this is that, it was one franchise, not the company. Just because one franchise did something that was pro-Israel doesn’t mean the entire company is pro Israel. And even then, no money was going to the IDF. 

Additionally I feel like people are boycotting Starbucks because it’s a trend again. The actual reason why Starbucks is getting boycotted is because they sued their union for posting pro-Palestinan content and people took that as them supporting Israel or whatever. But I understand why they would do that. I mean I don’t think any brand would want their name to be attached to politics.

In the end I think boycotting Starbucks and McDonald’s for the Israel vs Palestine war is absolutely ridiculous and it’s only done because it’s trendy and they don’t want to get shunned for not doing so.

Boycotting Starbucks because you don’t want to pay an 8 dollar latte? That’s great! Boycotting Starbucks because they support Israel? You’ve been fed misinformation lasagna.

Left wing Political ideologies values the collective over the individual, so much focus on non existent social issues. And an Illusive egalitarian delusion that a society can be Equal despite the fact that everyone is different and has different capabilities and earning potential. 

Character focus is the most important thing in life. Not boring irrelevant social issues or, delusions of an egalitarian paradise.

The only part of it I would accept as useful is free medical care like we have here in the UK. 

Give me some evidence that an egalitarian society as proposed by the left, such as a version of communism would actually work and is not at all dangerous ; like the almost undeniable and irrefutable evidence that the fantasy communism like the leftist wannabe intellectual types try to reason out and picture, is actually both likely impossible & dangerous as it as been demonstrated to be. 



Now the left is infiltrating the school and teaching the most useless subjects I've ever seen or heard of : social sciences and gender studies.  Many places in America this is mandatory for what I understand & we now have trillions of genders that don't exist. 

Beside the one good point I made for left wing ideas about free healthcare. Try to convince me the opposite of the above?

How would a classless, no currency society work? Where working is a optional? Where is the motive? To contribute to society because we naturally want to work? But what about for the people where that's not enough exactly? 

We will all have the same house or similar house for free? Food is free? We all get the same cars? Why would the manufacturers work hard to produce the best if there is no difference in pay? 
We can walk into a cinema without paying?

I honestly hope that we’re as unified with the idea as we were with all political parties being for politicians no longer being able to trade.

To start off this brief rant, of course I’m gonna reference the most recent election & this current re-election being our two candidates on the Democratic & Republican side. Both of them are over the age of 75. We’ve seen the deterioration from when Biden first took office up to his most recent debate and regardless, if you believe he has dementia or not, you cannot deny that he is old and it’s taking a toll on him. Emphasis on OLD. We should be ashamed of ourselves for allowing this to happen. The same can be said for Trump as well except I’m leaning on the idea that he’s one of those old people that doesn’t know how to shut up and likes to keep rambling on with his golden days repeatedly till he spontaneously changes the topic, but eventually, I believe we’ll see the deterioration as well overtime. You see how much of a stressful job it is to essentially run the entire United States and I wouldn’t wish that type of stress on the average elderly American. In my observation if you run a Google search on majority of Presidents when they go into office and when they come out of office, they come out looking stressed with gray hair than my grandmothers beard and I doubt it’s just because of age. 

But aside from my above rant, let’s keep it honest. I’m tired of politicians on either or side, being extremely old to the point that we have to worry about them dying on us while in office. Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old currently and at one point she was speaker of the house.  For people in Congress honestly, I don’t want old people like Mitch McConnell (who is 82 currently btw) going up to the podium and freezing for five minutes straight because they’re having some random episode or seeing the ghosts of their past coming to haunt them. Like that stuff is painful & embarrassing to see in real time. I will give it to the Supreme Court, however since that is a very imperative part of our American political society. I am fine with them living their terms for life. Of course, because there’s not too many of them, I would ideally like whatever Supreme Court nominee to be young all the way up until it’s visibly obvious that the age is getting to them then replace them accordingly. 

While i’m sure at this point, you believe me to be an ageist, I just want to reiterate that I just have the strong belief that we should let younger Americans, (and when I say younger, I don’t mean 20 to 30-year-olds I mean like mid 40s and early 50s) take the helm and drive the growth of the American society on issues that they truly stand for. I want semi-youthful individuals in office, who aren’t too young, but yet also aren’t 1 foot in the grave. If we could just limit age on politicians to a max of 60 yrs (I’ll give 65 max) before it’s deemed you should not be in office then I believe regardless of what side you are on the political spectrum you will see significant progress within your political party. I think it’s just always so hard for older politicians to 
pass the torch to a younger generation because of the amount of power they’ve seen or money they’ve gotten I don’t know really, but I do know that it gets frustrating to witness. It’s because of things like this is why we are stuck with two damn near 80-year-old men ranting off on each other for 2hrs and calling each other Dunderheads. I might be opinionated on this & of course there might be holes to my argument. But this has been on my mind for a good while now. Please do give me your thoughts on this.

Right wing figures such as libsoftiktok are often accused of stochastic terrorism because their posts about schools and hospitals sometimes are followed by a bomb threat at said locations.

I’m a bit mortified by how cavalierly people will expose themselves on the internet. Not to mention disgusting sites like onlyfans where people will literally defend online prostitution. We went from “don’t share your name or any personal information with strangers online”, to “ it’s okay to sell picture of your butthole to creepy stranger online”. 

There is a significant study by J.D. Unwin that examined the relationship between sexual chastity and societal advancement. Unwin, an anthropologist, analyzed various societies over 5,000 years and concluded that societies that practice strict prenuptial chastity tend to flourish culturally and economically. He observed that once these societies became more sexually liberal, they experienced a decline in these areas within a few generations. He wrote a book called sex and culture.

I know many people on Reddit from what I’ve examined are not religious, and in fact mock god. Whether you believe religion or not I think it’s interesting to examine something. Whether they are fairy tales or not they all in attempt to guide society on how to live properly. Something that is expressed in many religions is the concept chastity. A majority of religions all express the importance of sexual chastity. I mean just think about it logically. Do you think sex is meant for casualness and lust or love and reproduction? What is the function of sex meant for? Not to mention there is plenty of research expressing how hook up culture is terrible for relationships, and pair bonding.

I believe this society we live in is deranged and sick. It is ideologically demented and I think it could benefit from a bit of stoicism and emotional control. There needs to be parameters around certain ideals and if everything goes we will lose all morality.

In Trump's second term, I am scared that he will dismantle America's democracy, and possibly just give himself a third term, and that he will avoid prosecution for any and all crimes because of that recent Supreme Court decision. On top of that, Democrats seem like they are going to lose control of the Senate and not regain control of The House.

How many times have we heard Donald Trump call Joe Biden sleepy Joe or call Bernie Sanders crazy Bernie or call Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton nasty women and it’s not only Donald Trump many people in the Republican party like MTG, Lauren, Boebert, Matt Gatez etc. have constantly insulted Democrats calling them a multitude of insults like calling the squad (a group of progressive house members) “the Jihad squad” , “baby killers”, “ traitor” the list goes on and on

I remember a speech, Michelle Obama made in 2016 talking about  “ when they go low, we go high” and most of the Democratic Party pretty much sticks to that which there is nothing wrong with that but still sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire

It was honestly so refreshing when Jasmine Crockett called out Marjorie Taylor Green for talking about about her fake eyelashes, and Crockett responded with the famous  “ bleach, blonde, bad built, butch body” it just felt refreshing to see a Democrat throw insults back at a Republican and MTG was silenced and stunned. A Democrat actually insulted her back.

What I’m saying is that Democrats really need to gain a backbone against Republicans they need to stop laying back and letting Republicans insult them left and right (and before some of y’all say that Democrats call Republicans fascists and dictators Republicans have been insulting Democrats for being liberal and using liberal as a dirty word so in a way that doesn’t count)  I understand that it would make both parties look silly, but sometimes taking the highroad can’t be the option every time sometimes you have to get your hands dirty sometimes you have to go lower than someone’s going low or at least as low I know some people will say that it won’t make Democrats any better than Republicans, but are the two parties really that moralistic think about it"

I don't think it's correct to see women as lesser because they've fucked a bunch of dudes. What I am saying is only about a positive perception of people, not a negative one. 

So I think that if you are going to compare men it women, it makes a lot of sense why men are seen as cool for sleeping around where women are not. This is simply because of the difficulty that each side has.

Let's face it, dating is a man's game. Men are more often than not, at least in my country are the ones investing the most in dating and pursuing women/sex. They are pursuing, asking, paying, organizing, taking risks and adding pressure, women are typically behaving more passively. That's because for most men, there isn't a sea of attention waiting for them when they open their phone.

For a lot of women, it's very different. If your average looking woman wanted to sleep with a different guy every night, she probably could find a guy who is at least a 6 and willing.

So this leads me to my main point. For women, it's a participation trophy. Notches on the bedpost don't have to be earned. Sure some are, but for most, if the woman had outright said ""Will you come home with me"" a man would. 

For men, seducing a woman is like winning a game of chess. Even if you are attractive, you are still competing. Not only with more attractive men, but with a good book and an early bedtime. Men desire women way more than they desire us, so we are actively fighting uphill to get laid. So when a man succeeds constantly, it makes more sense for it to be seen as an accomplishment."

I remember this AskReddit post where people talked about how online social media sites are mostly a minority opinion, and does not represent what people are like in real life.

But online social media sites enable people to share their unfiltered opinions, and the majority of people online are anonymous. Remember that the Buffalo shooter posted his manifesto online and the Uvalde shooter posted violent threats online and posted a wish list of the guns he purchased. Unfiltered, truest reflection.

However, when I go meet people in real life, they carefully choose what to say to keep up polite appearances.

So to say that meeting people in real life because their online opinions don't represent them is disingenuous. How people act online tells me more about them than meeting them in real life does.

I have seen many comments about it being a shame the assassin missed, or that this is a false flag operation. The conspiracy theories that are being brought up seem to be endless. 

Not only this, but this is the first time I’ve witnessed the left acting so much like the people they despise. Alt-right individuals are characterized as Nazis, dangerous individuals who are motivated by conspiracies. 

Seeing so many people on the left promoting conspiracy theories has only enforced the idea that the alt right has so much in common with the alt left. I never believed the alt left held some moral high ground compared to the alt right as many people believe here. However, I believe the behaviour we are witnessing online today only enforces that the bad actors on both sides are equivalent in potential for danger. 

My view has always been that the alt right poses just as much threat to democracy as the alt left. So many on reddit have attacked me for this opinion, so I’m of the impression this isn’t the popular opinion. I’m open to understanding where I may be wrong, but I can’t really see how."

The UK has a first past the post election system (FPP) is the most basic and worse form of any election claiming to be free and fa

For those unaware, FPP means that the person with the highest vote gets elected, REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY VOTES THEY GET. 

Let me give a hypothetical example:

There are 10 candidates in an election, and they get the following vote percentage:

A: 9%
B: 9%
C: 9%
D: 9%
E: 9%
F: 9%
G: 9%
H: 9%
I: 9%
J: 19% 

In this scenario, candidate J would win in a FPP system despite less than 20% of the population voting for them. It’s honestly mind blowing how people are ok with this system.

As we just saw in the recent general election, the Labour Party won a “landslide win”, which leads you to think they got the vast majority of the votes. 

However you couldn’t be more wrong. Despite winning ~60% of the seats in the House of Commons, Labour only got around ~30% of the general votes. So less than a 3rd of the population voted for them, but they were still able to get twice as many seats compared to votes, which no democratic system should ever allow. 

Additionally Reform UK, a smaller party managed to get ~14% of the vote, but ONLY 4 SEATS! A mere 0.2% of the parliament. How on earth does that work?? 

It get worse when you look at the liberal Democrats who got less votes than Reform, but over 70 seats. How does this make any sense??? 

And to make matters worse for the UK, there is literally an entire house of parliament which is made up of non elected people. So it is very likely for a bill to not be made into law based purely on how unelected people vote in the upper house, which is entirely wrong! 

So to summarise, the UK has an outdated voting system where currently the ruling party had less 1/3 of the general votes, but an absolute majority. Parties people want to be elected get close to nothing, and an entire house of parliament is made up of non elected rich people who can stay there for pretty much life. 

There is no way that the UK can claim to be a modern democratic nation, and why there aren’t protests is beyond me.

",u/Grand-Tension8668,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e2uxyl/cmv_philosophy_is_inevitable_but_professional/,changemyview,"This post is fucking insufferable, I know. It is the embodiment of the Dunning-Kreuger effect, I know. That's why I'm posting it here.   
  
By a ""pure philosopher"" I mean people who are simply called philosophers, whose life work is primarily the development of the field of philosophy (and are probably paid by a university to do this). People like Nietzsche and Kant and anyone sitting in academia hammering out their own ideas.  

Most of the time when people make posts like this, they go ""philosophy is useless!"" and it's immediately pointed out that they're currently engaging in philosophy. It's pointed out that it is with the methods of philosophy that we *interpret* human knowledge, it's how we sort of ""compress"" all that raw data into something we can understand. It's the stories we create to summarize what we know to be true, and what we *suspect* to be true.   

That is all well and good, and I find it frustrating that the people who post these sorts of rants fall apart at the seams when the inevitability of philosophy is presented to them, because I don't think that's what they were actually trying to get at.   

I think what these people are actually trying to point out is that **philosophy with** ***no objective data to interpret*** **is useless.** Philosophy where most or all of an arguments' building blocks are pulled out of someone's ass. Let's call it ""pure philosophy"".   
  
Yeah, yeah, I know, the argument I'm making is itself not an interpretation of objective data because usefulness is subjective. So maybe if I define what I mean by useful first?  

Pure philosophy is art for art's sake, or demonstration at best, let's put it that way. A skilled philosopher can write something ""beautiful"" or at least impressive in the sense that they prove their ability to construct an argument. Cool! It might sway some people. But it isn't *useful* unless it pushes someone to apply it, to engage in scientific study, to come up with *proofs*.

Philosophical discussions of ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, that sort of thing... These are fields of philosophy with (almost) no objective basis. Everything within them, barring exceptional developments in data-driven fields like neurology and sociology, can be countered with ""well that's just, like, your opinion, man."" That wouldn't be a very *good* counter-argument, but any counter-argument you construct ultimately boils down to that. **You aren't operating off of the same assumptions** and that's all you have, assumptions.  

This is where I want to be proven wrong. It seems to be that academic philosophers, generally speaking, engage in exactly this sort of verbal sparring when they aren't teaching students how to think for themselves (which is a very important skill). It seems to me that the best they can do, as far as coming up with ""useful"" philosophy themselves is concerned, is to interpret the discoveries of others. I believe we'd be far better off if it were the scientists making those discoveries doing the philosophizing. They're actually sure to understand their own data and it's implications. The only issue is that most of them fall in the ""philosophy is useless"" camp, and THAT'S what philosophers should focus on fixing.

Let me stary by saying there  is no benefit to being fat accept diabetes, heart disease, and increased risk of stroke. Being fat just shouldn't be encouraged. It's not cute. It's not pretty. If it was, fat people would date other fat people except they don't. Isn't that also fat phobic? Why expect us normal weight people to big but not fat people to date you if you won't date yourself? I'm all for not caring what people think and living your life but you guys gotta admit this is not healthy. I think you guys are tricking yourself because then you would have to take responsibility for your own life.
Body positivity is embracing burns, stretch marks, freckles etc not being a fatass.


2 being fat is a choice. In 99% of cases, a person is fat because they eat too much and don't workout at all. Only a baby, toddler, or little kid have excuses because they don't know any better. They eat what their parents give them or whatever is in the pantry or fridge. I saw a video of a couple in Africa and they had a child who was normal and one that was fat. He kept on gaining weight and they didn't know why and they took him to doctors. He was like 60 pounds at one. That's an exception not the rule. Stop using medical reasons,  diseases, or prescription drugs as an excuse. Those may be an excuse but most times they are not. "

All women are different and some may have pretty different preferences for how long they want to wait for sex with you. But I think if a woman makes you wait longer than other men, it indicates she is less attracted to you, so it is right to be offended over that. She essentially sees you like a beta provider only most likely."

Women are trying to be superior to men as they were to women decades ago. Yet neither the men responsible or the women who suffered are part of it. Equality was reached years ago. Gender pay gaps may still exist, but men can be thrown in jail because a woman was bored. We can’t stop objectification, but it does both ways. The K1LL 4LL M3N movement on TikTok started the bear or man debate and many more. Women can vilify their partner for the fun of it and he’ll receive hate purely for being a man. Men and women are supposed to live in peace and life life like it’s like, short.

I have seen less qualified males be promoted over a woman and it seems like a method of self-preservation in those situations (There are cases where the man is most qualified and deservingly received the promotion). 

I'm a hard worker and received so many opportunities for advancement from my male superiors. I say this as an average face and overweight body so these men aren't after me for my looks.

I had been to strip clubs before and wasn't opposed to them, but my main reasoning for being there that night was to drink alcohol somewhere walking distance from my hotel. I had also been there the night before, for the same reason. It seemed like the people there were reasonable and harmless, so I didn't feel like it would be a risk to be there again.

I was approached by a worker there. I was already slightly tipsy and she succeeded in convincing me for a lap dance. At this point my memory is blurry, but I do remember her asking me to do coke with her in this VIP room. I foolishly agreed and I was very stupid for doing so.

I think what happened is that she lined up the coke for me and I snorted it, but it was not coke. It was some type of sedative and possibly pcp.

Yes, Israel is marginally more tolerant of LGBT people than many other MENA governments. But this argument completely ignores the history of MENA and why it is the way it is.

What do these zionists think happen when a region of the world has resources valuable to the west? 

There were absolutely secular and progressive MENA movements/groups, but they all got wiped out or couped by the west.

It's not that Islam and MENA are inherently right wing. It's that any MENA group that isn't (such as the PLO, soviet Afghans, 50s Iran, etc.) gets a visit from the CIA, and the MENA groups that are (the Saudis, the Shah, Syrian rebels, and al-Qaeda) get funding and guns.

Not to mention, doing numerous war crimes in the name of ""anti-terrorism"" and then leaving all your guns behind once you get tired is a very good way to radicalize all the children you orphaned.

Israel has none of these issues working against them, and they still can't be assed to allow gay marriage or make transition care accessible. 

The dominant understanding in the west that Muslims are all barbaric savages is monstrous not just because it's racist and incorrect, but also because they are the #1 supporters of terrorism in MENA. They are the reason for most of the instability in that region. They are the ones propping up dictators and giving guns to religious extremists. 

It's insane that so many people ignore this history when discussing homophobia and transphobia in the middle east. Yes, it's horrible, and yes, it needs to be fought against, but it didn't appear out of thin fucking air and slaughtering innocents is not going to solve it."

Tipping culture as an obligation should totally end.

I know that in some places not giving a tip at the end is considered rude and impolite. 

I do appreciate a good service, but it is up to me to tip at the end or not.
Perhaps I’m going out to eat at a restaurant or whatever, but that doesn’t mean I’m in a good financial condition to be tipping everywhere I go.

I shouldn’t feel obliged to tip at the end and when I’m in countries that tipping in deeply ingrained in the culture I feel pressured and can’t enjoy the ambience.

First because that puts pressure on the attendant as well, and depending on the place I go to they treat me overly friendly if u know what I mean.

I’ve been to hotels where the same waiter was serving me one can of coke per day (that is what I’d order only) and when I was doing my check ou (I was trying to run away from him, because I knew he’d be expecting a tip at the end, and I didn’t want to be manipulated by that) someone went downstairs at the restaurant and told him I was leaving, so he came to the reception to talk to me, but I didn’t give him anything extra because I don’t need anybody being nice to me expecting to get something out of me at the end.

That is what I’m talking about, servers, cashiers, people who works with customer services shouldn’t have to put a mask on all the time to deal with the public.

If they are more friendly, okay! If they are more assertive, straight to the point, okay!
Now, if they’re impolite, rude, lazy, slow, that is something else.

Therefore, tipping culture should end, and would take the weight from both shoulders, customers and staffs. 

Also because the definition of a good service varies from person to person.

For me, a good service that’ll be tipped is when I get into my taxi and the driver says “good morning” and lets me enjoy the view from the window.
In a restaurant, my definition of a good service is someone who is polite, (one greeting will do) and straight to the point.
I don’t like people flattering me excessively, specially when they don’t know me, specially when they are doing that because they have to because the industry obliges them to do that.

This shared danger would push us to work together, using all our resources and knowledge. It would make us focus on survival rather than fighting each other. An alien enemy could also help us improve our diplomatic skills, as cooperation would be essential. This idea, although fictional, shows how a common purpose can bring unity and peace to humanity.

I do realize that the people of earth will not all think the same about the extraterrestrial threat. For example, some may not see them as enemy but as saviors, but the governments of the earth’s nations would come together to solve this crisis. "

This confluence of factors has created a landscape where being a straight man has never been more advantageous in the dating world. The intersection of desires from straight women, gay men, and femboys has positioned straight men in a highly coveted role, making now the best time to embrace this identity.

Straight women have traditionally sought straight men for romantic and long-term relationships. This desire remains strong, fueled by the innate biological and social drives that encourage heterosexual pairings. With evolving gender roles and increased independence, women are more selective and value traits such as stability, emotional intelligence, and mutual respect, which many straight men have adapted to embody.

Interestingly, the appeal of straight men extends into the gay community. For some gay men, straight men represent an elusive and attractive challenge, embodying a form of masculinity that is both familiar and fascinating. This dynamic can lead to strong romantic or platonic bonds, where the gay man appreciates the straight man's friendship, authenticity, and often, the opportunity to experience a different perspective on masculinity and relationships.

The rise of the femboy subculture, characterized by individuals who blend traditionally feminine and masculine traits, has also contributed to the increasing desirability of straight men. Femboys often seek straight men who appreciate and respect their unique expression of gender. The relationship between a straight man and a femboy can be deeply enriching, offering both partners a chance to explore and celebrate their identities in a supportive and loving environment.

The demand for straight men is amplified by the convergence of these diverse groups. As more individuals seek straight men for various reasons—whether for romantic partnerships, friendships, or deeper connections—the competition for their attention intensifies. This high demand is further fueled by the modern emphasis on open-mindedness and acceptance, encouraging more people to explore relationships outside traditional boundaries.

Conversely, the supply of straight men appears to be shrinking. Factors such as changing societal norms, the growing acceptance of diverse sexual orientations, and the fluidity of gender identities contribute to fewer men identifying strictly as straight. Additionally, the modern man's focus on career, personal development, and self-discovery can lead to later marriages and fewer committed relationships, further reducing the pool of available straight men.

Given the increasing demand and decreasing supply, straight men find themselves in an advantageous position. They have more options and opportunities to form meaningful connections with a variety of people who genuinely appreciate them. This unique dynamic allows straight men to experience diverse and fulfilling relationships that might have been less accessible in previous generations.

Moreover, the societal shift towards valuing emotional intelligence, empathy, and mutual respect plays to the strengths of many modern straight men. Those who embrace these qualities find themselves even more attractive to potential partners, further enhancing their desirability.

The current socio-cultural landscape has created a golden era for straight men, where their desirability is at an all-time high. The simultaneous attraction from straight women, gay men, and femboys, combined with a decreasing supply of strictly straight men, has placed them in a uniquely favorable position. As society continues to evolve, the opportunities for straight men to form enriching and diverse relationships will only grow, solidifying this period as the best time to be a straight man."

It is a pure plutocracy, and with the decline in media quality and the constant bombardment by the media, it will end up with a rule by the wealthy over the uninformed.

**Elections and Voting**

First, we have the Electoral College. Due to the winner-takes-all system, entire states and their electoral votes are awarded to a single candidate, rather than distributing the votes proportionally among the candidates. This results in states that predominantly lean toward one political party being automatically secure for that party's candidate, rendering votes for other candidates in those states essentially worthless. Consequently, candidates focus their campaigns on a few contested states (swing states), where only the votes of those voters truly matter in determining the election outcome.

When we examine congressional or senatorial elections, we observe similar issues. The winner-takes-all principle is applied to electoral districts, meaning whoever wins the district gains the seat in Congress. Gerrymandering exacerbates this by manipulating and redrawing districts to provide a political advantage to a particular party, distorting fair voter representation. Additionally, each state, regardless of size, has two senators, which results in voters from less populated states having disproportionately more influence.

Moreover, the U.S. engages in voter suppression. Strict ID requirements can prevent certain groups, especially minorities and low-income citizens, from voting. The requirement to register to vote, rather than being automatically registered, creates another hurdle. Furthermore, restrictions on early voting and mail-in voting make it harder for people, particularly those who cannot be present on Election Day due to work, to participate in elections. Poorer and predominantly minority neighborhoods often have fewer polling stations, leading to long wait times and lower voter turnout. Additionally, many states permanently disenfranchise individuals with felony convictions, excluding millions from the electoral process.

The winner-takes-all system also leads to a political landscape dominated by two major parties, limiting voter choices and often forcing them to choose between two similar options. Both parties are aligned on many political and economic issues, constraining political pluralism. Left-wing or social-democratic positions, common in Europe, are scarcely represented in U.S. politics.

The lack of public campaign financing and regulation exacerbates the issue of campaign finance in the U.S. A good candidate can easily fail simply because they cannot afford a campaign. The immense influence of money in politics, particularly after the ""Citizens United"" ruling, means that wealthy individuals and corporations have disproportionate influence on political campaigns and decisions. Political action committees (Super-PACs) can spend unlimited amounts of money to support candidates, leading to an unequal distribution of power. 

Furthermore, media partisanship and the spread of misinformation and disinformation campaigns can manipulate voter opinion and undermine the democratic electoral process, worsening the situation further. The fact that the USA lacks neutral media and during election seasons, every medium is hijacked for months for campaign propaganda, hardly gives Americans the opportunity to make a reasoned and thoughtful decision when voting.

**Government** 

The bicameral system with a President theoretically allows for meaningful representation of the country's political interests. However, the two-party system penalizes cooperation, as fundamental opposition and blockades weaken political opponents, thereby benefiting one's own chances in the next election. Polarization, partisan divisions, and ideological differences have exacerbated the inability to pass laws. These blockades not only delay progress on urgent matters but also deepen societal divisions and political frustration.

Mechanisms of direct democracy, such as referendums and initiatives, allowing citizens to directly participate in the legislative process by proposing and voting on laws and policies, are scarce, and if they exist, they are only at the state level.

Furthermore, lobbying and special interests exert significant influence on the legislative process in the United States. Wealthy individuals, corporations, and interest groups spend billions annually on lobbying efforts and campaign contributions to influence lawmakers' decisions in their favor. This influence often results in policies that prioritize corporate interests or the preferences of affluent donors over the broader public interest. (See: [Martin Gilens, Benjamin Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig))

Key government positions, such as federal judgeships, cabinet members, and agency heads, are frequently filled based on political loyalty rather than merit. This practice allows presidents and political leaders to appoint individuals who share their ideological views and policy agendas. While political appointments are a longstanding tradition in American governance, the increasing polarization of politics has intensified the partisan nature of appointments. Partisan appointments jeopardize the independence and impartiality of government agencies and undermine public trust in the neutrality of decision-making processes, as seen in the Supreme Court.

Executive orders and emergency declarations give presidents the authority to implement measures and policies without congressional approval, bypassing legislative debate and potentially democratic oversight mechanisms. In the past, these powers were used in crisis situations, but they also give the president the authority to govern the country alone."

  I am talking about the people who do sex work not out of high poverty nor out of coercion, some people argue that no prostitution is voluntary, but I disagree, for example in Germany prostitution is legal, salaries are high, and unemployment is very low, I just checked is 3.3% that means is very hard not to find a job, and even if you don't find a job there is this thing called harz4 which basically mean that you get paid by the government until you find a job, so for me is very hard to find a reason why someone would end up in prostitution out of just poverty unless they are like illegal migrants, which is possible, but sex workers also need to be registered at the Job Center, and there are a lot of sex workers registered, and therefore legally living in the country, so prostitution out of poverty would be a fraction and not all.

  Sugar babies could also be an example of voluntary prostitution because their profile is not extreme poverty, there may be exceptions but it is not the usual case, the difference here is that çsugar babies are being kind of romanticized in modern times, but at the end, it is a form of prostitution, but it is fine, I don't see anything bad about it

  Another thing would be people who say it sexualizes women and that may be true, but that is a problem that also happens outside sex work as well, in my question, I am not referring just to female-to-male prostitution, but prostitution in general, for example, gay prostitution which has similar implications, also high demand for example.

  For me sex work is just fine, as long as it is legal, is agreed upon by both parties, the worker is offering an entertainment service, and even more, because it is a natural desire, that a lot of people are not able to fulfill, maybe they are too shy, too ugly, work too much and don't have time for a relationship and so on... So I think prostitution is good for society, and laws that prohibit or punish it, are bad because it is exactly like drugs, it won't disappear, it will be carried in the shadows by mafias, and in the end, the people involved will be in more danger.

  If I ever meet a sex worker, I would not have any prejudice, it would be just a normal person for me"

It seems Trump is going to win the election.

He's bankrolled by Russia and supported by fascists - the equivalent to losing WW2, tbh. I know, they're not technically actually nazis, but they're close enough to make the parallel. 

Sure, we have an epic military, but if the guy in charge of it is in Russia's pocket, then it's really Russia's military.

And especially with project 2025, the fascist agenda is laid naked and clear and obvious, yet people will still vote for it.  And bad things are going to happen to anyone who isn't  a cisgender straight able-bodied white christian male who isn't in poverty... so the fascists will definitely get their way.  There are going to be a lot of dead LGBT+ and minorities/POCs, especially muslims.   Immigrants are going to be heavily abused:  republicans/conservatives don't want immigrants to leave, they just don't want to pay them.  Hence the hate.  Keep them terrified so they can continue to be non-objecting slave labor. 

I've already seen quotes from conservatives claiming ""the satanic temple is NOT a religion"" which means they can't effectively protest against christian nationalism.  

They're also going for a dismantling of the establishment clause of the first amendment, so they can circumvent the bill of rights and further screw non-christian religions and force their beliefs on children.  

Conservatives are loving Russia because Russia hates gay people and minorities.  And, of course, it has money. 

America is going to lose it's own identity, it's not going to be its own country anymore. 

Just a country doing it's best to make sure all of Europe speaks Russian...

Just a vassal state for Russia and the fascist ideology of nazi Germany.

I agree that an argument can be made that living conditions have increased but this has nothing to do with humans having become more compassionate, kinder and less bigoted as some of my friends claim.

For example women's rights don't have increased because people suddenly became less sexist but because women have more choice and thus power because of medical advances like safe abortion, contraception and safer childbirth. Another example is that more and more people have access to more products and services not because people are more compassionate towards the poor but because automation and robotization has increased productivity and decreased prices.

I even belief the increased acceptance of things like homosexuality is due to a better scientific understanding, like it absolutely not being a choice and occurring in other non-human animals as well, and not because people became more accepting.

Humanity is still the same hateful, tribalistic, bigoted group we have always been, we haven't changed since we first came into existence, only our scientific knowledge has."

When I saw RRR, I was amazed. Among other things, I loved watching the healthy, emotional relationships on display. I wasn't *surprised* per se by the people who read a homosexual relationship between the two main characters. But I was a little disappointed. It seems that men can't have emotionally heartfelt relationships without people deciding that it's queer coding. Vulnerability is seen as gay. For instance,

Gilgamesh and Enkidu

David and Jonathan

Achilles and Patroclus (yes yes, I know about how gay the Greeks were, but the text doesn't explicitly say they were lovers)

Sherlock Holmes and John Watson

Frodo and Sam

Kirk and Spock

Bert and Ernie

Gon and Killua

Rama and Bheem

Again, I don't think it's wrong for LGBTQI+ people to want to see themselves more in movies and literature. My problem is, this is the stuff that toxic masculinity is made out of. The social conditioning against showing vulnerability, care, or affection, especially towards another man, is a cornerstone of the unhealthy masculine ideals promoted by it. When my friend and I were 6, we would hold hands. When my mom saw us doing it, she told us it was wrong for us to do that. His dad heard from her and got mad at him too. Two men shouldn't have to sit five feet apart from each other in a hot tub because they're not gay. If we perpetuate the assumption that for men to have a strong emotional bond is for them to be in a romantic relationship, we perpetuate that aspect of toxic masculinity.

I'm going to preempt the comments saying that if a male and female character did half the stuff these examples did it would be seen as blatant romantic writing. It would be, and that's wrong too. For a very long time, the primary purpose for female characters in most of these types of stories was to *be* romantic interests for male leads. We need more platonic friendships between men and women in fiction too.

I understand the time constraints of doctors and the problems of the medical system, yet I think it’s very offensive that doctors tend to dismiss legitimate questions like the side effects of medications by implying the patient is too worried , too philosophical etc.
It is striking to me how this profession is different than what is expected from other well educated and well payed professionals like professors, engineers and scientists . You would not expect them to give the kind of hand waving arguments that doctors give to patients when they need to argue and solve an issue at their job. It results in doctors often not giving a clear management and prevention and most importantly improvement plan .

I think the main reason is that doctors have a monopoly on our health, and they answers to bosses who might not have the patients’ health as a first objective .
If we can create a system where doctors get their bonuses from improving patients metrics that could have been a much better incentive .
I would say the problem is also that doctors are really the gate keepers of all health resources - it’s practically impossible to treat yourself outside the bureaucracy of the medical system .

I would say that it is a problem that sometimes people interpret online articles in incorrect ways, so doctors shouldn’t listen to anything patients say, but the feeling I get of many doctors actively calling you out as crazy for looking for information yourself is showcasing an ego problem in the medical profession (that might be on par with politicians ).

What I refer to is of course my overall impression on average, and some medical professionals are truly amazing and caring and are not acting from their egos ."

Granted, Obama would have passed more gun control if he was able to, but due to political gridlock in Congress, he was unable to. The ATF under Trump banned bump stocks (even if the Supreme Court justices he appointed later overturned that ban), and he has likely said “Take the guns first, go through due process second.”

https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/376097-trump-take-the-guns-first-go-through-due-process-second/damp/?nxs-test=damp

The gun that was used to shoot at Trump and ended up killing a bystander is reported to be an AR-15 style rifle. Now that Trump’s ear has been a direct victim of gun violence and he  was just inches away from death, he could be more supportive of banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines because at least one of those items was used to try to kill him (I’m not sure what the round count for the magazine was that was in the gun during the assassination attempt, it could have just been a 10 rounder, which is legal to own in pretty much every US state)

https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/14/ar-15-rifle-weapon-donald-trump-rally-shooting-pennsylvania

Democrats have really been wanting to reinstate an assault weapons ban since the last one that they passed was not renewed about 20 years ago. If they were to bring up an assault weapons ban again in the near future, they could frame it as trying to prevent future political assassinations similar to the recent attempt on Donald Trump’s life, which he and other Republicans could potentially sign off on.

So an assault weapons ban could be fairly likely even with a Republican trifecta or a foregone conclusion with a Democratic trifecta."

All parents have children for selfish reasons, that’s just a fact. whenever you ask a parent why they had a child their answer will always start with ‘I’. they never think about the life they are creating. 

This is in no way a dig at any parents or anyone who wants to have kids, this is just my own opinion. if you want to have children there’s nothing I can do to stop you.

I'm not talking like smoking and stuff cause honestly I don't see that as a bad thing I mainly look at people at their personality and not their habits.

So my friend right she is the type of person that don't want to try anything and if she failed something first time she immidiently drops it, and it got frustrated sometimes cause when I go to encourage her she declined and I usually leaves it at that as I see no point in keep on forcing her it if she doesn't want to and I just let her do her things.

But when I try to go out of my comfort zone (we are both introverts) like me joining a club that I normally won't get into, I would sometimes just tell her about it and how I feel about it just to make some small talks you know, she sometimes would just ridicule me saying I should have done that or say like ""I wouldn't ever do that cause I can't do it"".

And I hear that line so much it annoys me and I don't want to be annoyed cause she's my friend I do in some extent still care for her a lot. When I advice us to join like a corporation she would say ""no there's gonna be a interview and I'm not good at interview"", like ofc there's gonna be a interview her dream is to litterly make a lot of money and just live a comfort life and in order to get a job like that she would need to do an interview, I point this out to her and say joining the corporation would be a good practice but she still refuses.

She is also the type of person that hates water, vegetables, fruits, or anything good for you cause in her words ""anything healthy taste bad"". I advice her to atleast drink water but she won't listen. I normally don't have a problem with this but this girl got low immune system, I don't know if this actually true, she often say about feeling sick and we would usually give her time on her own but even her being sick sometimes feels like just her can't standing to do something and just a bit of a headache and she would want to go sit down and sometimes exaggerated some of them, and this is the things that she likes to boast about too.

I really don't want to think of my friend this way, is really late now and honestly I'm really tired my insomnia is getting worse and I have been trying to atleast attempt to have a good sleeping schedule, but in the morning I'll have school and that would mean meeting my friends again so I've been feeling really guilty again 

I just hoped I could get some insight on this I want to atleast understand my friend more and strangers on the internet is the best bet I have.

I really wish information from you all would make me understand how my friends think and feel so I won't be too upset by her every time she did this things again, I want to understand so I could act accordingly around her cause I can't figure her out at all.

This break stemmed from a misunderstanding of his teachings on magic.  Back then, in my 20s and still a Christian, I viewed magic as not only phony but also blasphemous.  
  
That's irrelevant to my current point, though.  While listening to Watts on headphones, I entertained the idea that he was God, and by extension, so was I.  Since everything was happening because of me (in my mind), his words simply echoed my own thoughts – a way for me to channel information to myself.

Here's where my egocentric thinking took hold.  I believed that ""God"" (Watts) realized I thought he was speaking live and felt ""busted"" or ""caught"" in my mind, making him nervous.  
  
This was hilarious to me then, and it still is.  Listening back with this mindset is entertaining, so I wanted to share this perspective on this particular Watts lecture.

Every year thousands die from lack of organ transplants. Thousands of people could be saved if we had somewhere to get more organs: those who killed others. This would more than account for any shortages in organs due to the excessive amount of homocides there have been.

When someone commits murder, they deprive the life of someone else, essentially depriving that person of their organs. Thus, even ethically by depriving those organs their own organs shouldn’t be their own. Human rights should only go as far as you having not deprived anyone of their human rights, and this is obvious everywhere where criminals are sentenced to death and shooters are shot to death. If this was a matter of human rights we wouldn’t ethically be able to defend shooting a mass shooter during their killing spree because that would mean we would have to deprive someone of their human rights despite the obvious amount of extra damage they cause. 

Thus, the person who committed murder should be obligated to donate their organs upon demand. They gave up the rights to their own organs when they choose to take someone else’s. If we truly cared about bodily autonomy we wouldn’t even be able to sentence them to prison, because that would mean they are bound and lack autonomy in the first place. 

Either way, forcing murderers to donate their organs to people in need seems extremely logical philosophically and ethically. And, ethics are based on utilitarian societal wellbeing, there seems to be no way forcing donations could be worse off for society when so many more people are saved.

The general consensus I keep finding on this issue though still seems to disagree heavily with me, so CMV.

Biden could officially offer the deal from the oval in the wake of this weekends events. 

Such a scenario would be like what the framers intended.

I could get a lot more vicious about my thoughts on Trump, but I know there are people on the other side who think the same horrible things about Biden.

So let's compromise, send them both to the Whitehouse. 

If Biden was VP, then he would have the power to instigate 25th amendment procedures for if Trump went crazy (like was being considered after Jan 6) and also would be a tie breaker vote in the Senate. Also as VP Cheney showed, the VP arguably has quite a bit of power. In any event, it's better than losing to a Trump/anyone ticket and having no power (also he is not term limited to serve a 3rd VP term), including possibly losing the Congress. 

On the flip side, there is precedence for a VP (Spiro T. Agnew) facing legal charges while in office. So Trump could still face justice for any and everything he did.

That would also focus the American people to consider in 2024 who they want as 3rd in lime as Speaker of the House and who would be able to control the process for vetoing a new VP selection if one dies or is removed. If 

I'd rather see a protracted legal battle over who controls the White House than political violence. 

I originally wanted to submit this to r/crazyideas but they bar political content, so arguments about how ""it will never happen"" do not sway me"

For example: A couple of weeks ago there was a dog wearing a service vest running loose around Fred Meyer's because the owner lost the grip on it's leash. A trained service dog is not going to behave like that.

What's the point of requiring that an animal be trained to enter businesses if the businesses are not allowed to verify it?"

The top democrats in charge don’t do that. For all the people who are dead or who have had their lives ruined by Trump across the many decades he’s been a prominent figure in this country, he doesn’t deserve any sympathy. The person who did actually die deserves sympathy 100%, but not Trump. He’s a narcissist. Biden is not a narcissist. Say what you will about Biden, but he’s not as bad as Trump at all.

Now I'm not going to sit here and pretend like Donald Trump is the nicest person on Earth, he insults people and he calls a lot of people incompetent and he promises to remove people that he believes are completely incompetent once he gets into office. He does this all in broad daylight straight to people's faces, so of course he's going to cause issues. However, despite him doing this it has always been angled towards the idea of competency at a job depending on who he was talking about.

Whereas the political left has used all different kinds of really scary sounding rhetoric, whether from official sources or started within communities or said by just random individuals. I've heard people say he's going to be a dictator if he gets elected again, he's a threat to democracy, he wants to kill the lgbt, he's racist, he's sexist, he's basically Hitler, this level of rhetoric is of course going to stir up some extremely powerful emotions, and we've been hearing it for basically 8 years now. If you are constantly hearing that this person is going to do all these horrible things and destroy the country and you just happen to be radical enough of course you're going to do something about it. 

We need to calm down the rhetoric and fast, I want to go back to a time when we weren't so politically charged and so severely divided and I believe the best way to do that is to change the rhetoric. Call Donald Trump out on his bullshit of course I don't have any issue with that, but we need to stop saying he's a fundamental threat and we need to stop this now before it starts affecting other election cycles otherwise this stuff is going to become much more common."

The strongest argument I've heard from this camp is that it is up to Biden to convince them to vote for him. But I don't buy that. If they truly believe that Biden will lose and they believe they know why, then they should be working to fix it. Instead, they are working hard to make everyone else depressed and less likely to vote in an election where they believe the outcome is already decided. Instead of looking for reasons to vote for Biden, they are looking for every reason not to, and spreading these reasons. If Democrats lose in 2024 and P25 is enacted, it'll be the doomers that caused it. Change my view."

This leads to animal abuse and horrible conditions. Lets imagine a world where those horrible conditions do not exist and every single animal lives a perfectly happy life until we kill it for meat.

Since all of these extra animals wouldnt otherwise live if it wasnt for humans eating meat, one could say that we ""gift"" them life (I know it sounds terrible). 

But think about: If you were a chicken that is about to be born and you could choose between not existing and living a short happy life and then be killed, wouldnt it be better to live than to never be born?

In my mind thats always a net win for the chicken.

With that said, the amount of people who support Hamas is absolutely disgusting.

Hamas is a terrorist organization that hides its weapons inside of civilian infrastructure, they slaughter Israeli civilians, and led the invasion of the music festival on October 7th. Despite that, when that invasion happened, a lot of people went to say “Free Palestine” without giving a second thought to the victims of the invasion.

People regularly dehumanize Israeli people by calling them “settlers, not citizens”, and refuse to condemn Hamas’ slaughter.

I hear excuses all the time “what did you expect?” “You can’t just elect your way out of a genocide”, amongst other things.

So are we just supposed to let another genocide happen from a literal terrorist group? Why aren’t people able to accept that the Israel-Hamas conflict is complete shit on both sides? 

I’m seeing justifications for the deaths of Jewish people each and every single day, despite the fact that citizens of Israel are not at fault for their oppressive government’s actions.

By using this same logic… are the Russian people at fault for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Absolutely not.

Do people who support Ukraine support Azov (a literal Nazi-faction of Ukraine’s army)? Absolutely not.

It’s straight up ridiculous to me that people refuse to distinguish right from wrong in this one situation in particular. It’s particularly painful because it feels like so many young people such as me are becoming radicalized to support Palestine’s; and by extension- Hamas’ every move.

The resources on this planet are finite. We've already destroyed or permanently damaged all earth's ecosystems. The fact that our current economic system requires constant growth is absurd.  At some point the population will stop growing whether we like it or not. Why not pull off the bandaid and stop at 8 billion before we make things worse? 

The main concern I see is that a shrinking population means a smaller group of working age people will have to take care of a growing elderly population.  However, the ultra capitalistic system we live in requires most of us to sell our lives to corporations and practically guarantees that the elderly will end up broke & isolated. A shrinking population would break the status quo and allow for a renewed focus on community. Resources could be directed to those in need rather than the ultra wealthy. 

Another concen I see is that a smaller population will lead to less innovation. I'm not a luddite, but most of the innovation in the last 25 years has been marginal tech upgrades that nobody asked for or benefits from. The innovations that created the miracles of medicine & infrastructure we depend on mostly came from the early 20th century, when global population was a third of its current value. 

The transition to a declining global population will obviously be difficult. But I believe it will lead to a healthier environment and happier humanity. 

As an aside, I'm convinced that the current push to remove reproductive rights in the US is coming from the ultra wealthy who recognized low fertility as a threat to the status quo. "

If I suddenly identified myself as a woman, it wouldn't necessarily make a difference to what I am, I'm just trying to fit in with the other people labeled woman, but I'm still biologically a man. Gender itself is just apart of our language, it's a way for us to communicate the difference between what a man is, and what a woman is. The woman creature is a female animal, who is labeled human, and has a few differences from a man who is a male animal. This includes getting pregnant, having hormonal differences, bleeding every month, being able to produce milk in the chest, so that they can feed the baby, and naturally physically weaker than the man, while usually having a difference in skull formation from a man.

A male who identifies as a woman will never have ovaries, and a female who identifies as a man will never have testes. No amount of plastic tits, or rubber dicks will give you that, no amount of makeup, or voice impressions will give you that. You are doing an act, it feels like you are putting on a costume. You can bake a cherry pie, and be disappointed because you kinda want a cake, and try to turn that cherry pie into a cake, but it will never fully get there. 

Identifying as someone who isn't a gender also doesn't make sense, because you translate to one in this language, the word gender is apart of a language, and the word apart of that language has a definition, a definition that describes YOU. Aren't you a living person? Who has certain private parts, genomes, hormones, DNA, and whatever scientific bullshit that has a definition and meaning to it, because it's the only way humans can communicate. We cannot decide that we label ourselves as a being that doesn't consider our bodies to have hormones, because we aren't comfortable with that label. Sometimes things are too simple, for people to try and make them complicated. 

Honestly the people who identify themselves as such, imo trying to fit into what they feel these identities mean, a woman means someone who wears makeup, has long hair, get's their nails done, wear dresses, and speaks in a ""feminine"" way. Whilst a Man wears suits and pants, while having short hair, takes things too seriously, doesn't associate with makeup and fake nails, while speaking in a ""masculine way"".  These two things are what makes a man and woman in society, these are what make people want to transition into the other gender, even though doing so is impossible, because these social constructs don't make a gender."

Yes, 150yds is not a difficult shot with a rifle equipped with a scope when you are firing at a target. As long as the rifle is properly zeroed at the distance he was shooting at, the shot for the most part it is a point-and-shoot shot where bullet drop and wind is negligible.

However, when you are considering Trumps bullet proof vest that he is equipped with, having to shoot only a head shot becomes levels of magnitude more difficult as it is a smaller target and it is a moving target when your target is speaking.

Lastly, if you are considering the possibility that this was staged by Trump, you are now asking the marksman to merely graze Trump from that distance. And you are also assuming that Trump somehow had the cue to turn his head at the exact millisecond where the bullet would just graze him and it would not kill him. That shot is exponentially more difficult and I struggle to believe that there is any marksman in the world comfortable enough to take that shot given the circumstances.

When considering the totality of the circumstances it is extremely unlikely that this assassination attempt was staged in any way. Trump is already ahead in the polls and is looking more and more likely to be the next president before the assassination attempt. The risks of possibly dying compared to the benefits of winning more votes in an election that he is currently leading in makes no sense."

I believe this for a variety of reasons 
For one landlords don't contribute to society on any meaningful way.
They take what is in my opinion a need in housing away from other people and  use it to extract money and make money off other peoples labour in order to provide a living for themselves; essentially making a living off other people while providing nothing in return.
Also many landlords buy property in bulk and raise prices that price people out of the housing market 
Also I've heard many horror stories from renters such as poor conditions and high rents that prevent people from paying into their pensions. 
Also I believe they are better options like in the Uk there are council houses which are housing built by local authorities with a priority in being affordable 
Another better options is to all housing developments be owned by the government 

In short I believe that landlording is a predatory practice that abuses class differences.
I want to hear from people who genuinely don't believe this on why they don't. "

Both sides are merging into the same patterns and tendencies, yet we focus on the particulars and individuals. 

Superficially, words are symbols working within a network of forces, which are only accessible through dialogue and conceptual understanding. 

Both of which are absent in the United States, at least in public discourse. If there is any public discourse at all, as political conversations have been socially tabooed and professionally banned. 

That leaves all sides to fall into disarray. Individuals become more important than the community. Words lose all meaning, while concepts and ideas drift even further away. 

We are all starting to act in similar ways, because we are exposed to the same structure and pattern. This particular toxic environment and socio-economic system outpaces our ability to adapt. 

The wave is more important than the particle, because we are all riding the same one, while arguing and bickering about who gets to stay on, rather than appreciating waves and the ability to ride them. 

Thus, from both sides, the language, rhetoric, and approach start to mirror one another. The heroes lived long enough to become the villains type of thing. I associate many talking points on the left with the same delusions seen throughout the right. It’s starting to blend together.

Sex does not become the Golden Flower until the fourth stage. It is dangerous to not comprehend those four stages, and the entire tradition has been trying to keep you ignorant of them.

AUTOSEXUALITY is the initial stage.

The child is a narcissist from the moment of birth. He knows nothing but HIS body, and he is incredibly in love with it. He's so happy, he's just sucking his own thumb. The child is seen sucking his own thumb and displaying a look of pure euphoria as he plays with his body, attempting to put his toe in his mouth, and creating a circle with the energy. A circle is formed and the energy begins to move in a circle when the child puts his toe in his mouth. The child experiences a natural flow of light, which he finds enjoyable since it brings him immense joy.

Unaware that they are sexual organs, the child plays with his own. He is still unconditioned and perceives his body as a single entity. Of course, the most delicate part of his body is his sexual organs. He loves playing with them and touching them so much.

This is the point at which the child's psyche is invaded by the poisonous society: ""Don't touch!"" The first filthy four-letter word is ""don't."" From this single four-letter word, numerous others follow: can't and won't are also four-letter words. When the parent tells the child, ""Don't!"" and those eyes look back at them with anger... And the child's genital organs, which are naturally highly pleasurable, are deprived of his hand. He is not being sexual or anything, but he is really enjoying it.

That is all—it is simply the most delicate and alive part of his body.

However, because of our socialisation, we remove his hand because he is touching a sexual organ, which is wrong. We make the child feel guilty.

We are now beginning to destroy his innate sexuality. We have now begun poisoning his being, the source of his first joy. We are now moulding him into a hypocrite; he's going to be a diplomat.

He won't play with his sex organs when his parents are around. The first lie has now been introduced; he is not credible. He now understands that his parents are upset with him if he is loyal to himself, respects himself, honours his joy, and honours his instincts. And because he depends on them and cannot survive without them, he is defenceless against them. He will die if they renounce him, so the decision is yours to make regarding your desire to survive. The youngster must submit and you must be against yourself if you want to survive.

In the world, children are the most exploited phenomenon. The child has been the most exploited class of people. There is nothing he can do: he cannot go to court, he cannot approach the government, he cannot form unions to argue with the parents. He is powerless to defend himself from his parents' assault.

Furthermore, the reason the parents stop him is because they have been similarly conditioned by their own parents. The fact that the child is so shamelessly touching and playing with his own genital organs makes them feel extremely embarrassed.

The child is innocent at this point and has no concept of shame. The energy retreats; the 'don't' has arrived.

The initial trauma has occurred. The child will now never be able to joyfully and organically embrace his sexuality. The child has experienced repression, resulting in his body being split in half. He rejects certain parts of his body because they are unattractive, unacceptable, or undeserving of being a part of his body. He begins to castrate himself from the bottom of his psychology, and the energy retreats. There won't be the same natural flow of energy as there was prior to this ""don't.""

And the inevitable result of this ignorance that has been inflicted upon humanity is that, in the first place, the child has lost their natural state and has developed hypocrisy. Either he has to feel guilty or he has to hide something from the parents.

Many people are still trapped in the autosexual state. That explains why there is still so much masturbation in the world. It is the state of nature. It was a growing phase that would have passed on its own, but the parents interfered with the energy's ability to grow.

The youngster gets stuck because he wants to play with his genitalia but is unable to do so. Repressing, repressing—until it becomes too much and the sexual energy POSSESSES him. Additionally, if he starts masturbating, it might turn into a mechanical habit and he won't be able to go to the second stage.

And the parents, the clergy, the politicians, and the entire social structure that has existed up to this point are the ones who bear responsibility.

This man might stay stuck at this extremely immature stage. He will never develop into a fully mature sexual being. He will never experience the happiness that only an adult sexual being can experience. The irony is that these are the same individuals who strongly object to and denounce masturbation. They have been telling people that masturbating will cause them to go blind, turn into zombies, or never become intelligent—in other words, it will always keep them stupid. These are extremely dangerous claims. One thing is now universally acknowledged in scientific research: masturbating never causes harm to anyone. However, these recommendations are harmful. There are no disagreements on this; there is now complete agreement. All psychological studies concur that masturbating is a healthy way to release pent-up energy and never causes harm to others. Nevertheless, these notions—that you will become blind—may endanger your eyes because they will cause you to believe that you will become blind repeatedly. There could be a simple explanation for why so many people wear glasses besides their eyes. Since all children are intelligent from birth, it is unlikely that the reason why so many millions of people are stupid stems from their own stupidity. There might be another explanation for this: these methods. You won't get better, and your confidence will decline. And because they are aware of what they have been doing, a great deal of people are constantly terrified, trembling, lacking confidence, and trusting nobody.

To reiterate, there has never been any harm caused by masturbating. However, a person's entire being is open and flowing during a moment of intense climax, making it a very sensitive and delicate moment. If a thought occurs to him at that precise moment, he will consider it and say, ""Now what if I go insane? Should I become blind? ""If I stay stupid forever,"" these incessant autohypnotic recommendations are the root of a thousand diseases, a thousand psychological issues, and a thousand perversions.

Who bears the blame for this?

You've been given perversions by society. You are a part of a perverse society!

If the child is permitted to continue in the natural stage of autosexuality, he will naturally progress to the homosexual stage, though very few people ever reach this stage. Most people still use the first phase. You might not be doing anything more than mutual masturbating when you make love to a man or a woman. Very few people experience the glimpses that are certain to occur if your sexuality is mature, because very few people achieve orgasmic states. It is a natural phenomenon that very few people learn about God through their romantic relationships. When in love, meditation comes easily.

However, the reason it doesn't happen is because millions of people—the majority—are stuck at the initial stage.

Even after getting married and starting a family, their relationship consists solely of mutual masturbation. It is not true romanticism.

Making love is an art, a great art; it requires maturity, meditativeness, great awareness, and sensitivity.

Homosexuality is the second phase. The second phase comes naturally to very few people. The young one adores his physique. If the child is male, he loves the body of a boy, that is, HIS body. It would be too abrupt to go from a girl's body to a woman's body. Usually, he falls in love with other boys first; if the child is a girl, her first natural inclination is to fall in love with other girls since they share the same type of body and essence. Boys are another story; she can relate to the girls more than the boys.

The homosexual stage is a normal stage of life. Because society puts barriers between men and women and between girls and boys, it helps people stay stuck. In the absence of those obstacles, the homosexual phase quickly ends and interest in the heterosexual, or other sex, begins. However, society does not offer opportunities for that; instead, a massive China Wall stands between the boy and the girl. They are required to receive separate instruction or sit in separate seats in the schools. They are required to live in separate dorms at the colleges. Their getting together and meeting are not accepted.

The society that both supports and condemns homosexuality is homophobic. These tactics need to be comprehended. The same society demonises homosexuals and labels them as criminals and perverts.

There are still nations where homosexuality carries a ten-year prison sentence.

There have been nations where a homosexual might have received a death sentence! And it is produced by the same society!

You separate men and women to such an extent that you make impenetrable barriers. Additionally, when a man seeks love, he is unable to find a woman, and vice versa for a woman seeking love. Then, he falls in love with a man and she falls in love with a woman, depending on what is available. Although it is not fulfilling either, it is still preferable to nothing. Nature needs to fend for itself. It will find an alternative path if you don't let it take its natural course. If not, homosexuality is a phase that comes and goes on its own.

The heterosexual phase is the third.

A man is capable and mature enough to fall in love with a woman, which is a completely different world with a different chemistry, psychology, and spirituality, once he has truly stopped having autosex or homosex. He can then play with this other world and this other organism. Although they are poles apart, first glimpses, lightning glimpses of SAMADHI are attained when they approach—and there are times when they are really close and overlapping.

Although what I'm saying is an existential phenomenon, both the man and the woman must be of legal age. This is only possible if they have progressed past the first two stages. And mature men and women exist very, very infrequently. Thus, nothing occurs; they fall in love, but their relationship is fleeting. They are, at most, homosexual or autosexual in their hearts.

It takes a new sort of being that can embrace complete opposites to love a woman or a man. And only when the polar opposites come together—just as when positive and negative electricity meet, electricity is created—do the life energies of man and woman, yin and yang, Shiva and Shakti, come together. At that point, they merge, lapse into oblivion, and become inebriated, at which point they cease to exist as distinct entities, separate egos. They are pulsating as one, two bodies in one soul since they are no longer there apart. That is the first experience of SAMADHI, as well as the first experience of no-mind, no-ego, and no-time.

After experiencing this, a desire develops: how can this SAMADHI be attained so that it can become the norm and you are free from dependence on men or women? After all, dependence breeds slavery. A person doesn't begin looking for techniques, means, or methods—Yoga, Tantra, Tao—to achieve the same state on their own until they have experienced a heterosexual orgasm.

Yes, it is possible to achieve because, at their core, every man is both a man and a woman—half derived from his mother, the other half from his father—and every woman is both a woman and a man. You will therefore be able to see for the first time that it can occur within once you have witnessed it occur through the external woman. You begin to meditate now because the outer woman merely set it off and the outer man merely served as a catalyst.

The fourth and last phase is called BRAHMACHARYA, or REAL celibacy. This is not the same as monastic celibacy, which is not celibacy at all, but rather the celibacy of the Buddhas.

BRAHMACHARYA is the name. There is no longer any need for sex; you don't need an outer man or woman. Now, a deep and lasting togetherness has emerged between your inner man and woman. You are united in this true marriage; it is unbreakable. Right now, you're naturally in an orgasmic state. A Buddha breathes in and out in orgasm; he lives in orgasm all the time.

The four phases of sex are as follows.

I have never voted for the right and will never vote right but the liberal side has completely lost me and see myself far more Libertarian these days. Its never been easier/better to be bi or mixed race but liberal types seem obsessed with keeping oppression alive and well and sometimes come across as racist themselves. 

Trump gets shot and there were articles about him being shot making him more favourable amongst black people. It's what i call progressive racism. Also don't get me started on DEI. I got asked to apply for a promotion because I could provide a ""unique insight being part of two minorities"". Fuck that. My record should stand for itself. It's not progressive to see me as two minorities. I don't need white knights coming to save me. I don't need white people ""looking out for me"". Telling me how I should feel because im not white. For centuries it's been tilted towards white but we don't need to tilt the other way. 

I have a partner who is white. Lovely man. I've had so called liberals saying how does he refrain from unconscious biases. I've had interracial couples can have a racial power imbalance. Since when were progressives taking issue with interracial couples?

I'm bi. My man and I have kids and somehow we are living heteronormatively, as if it's a bad thing. Like when we're liberals against gay marriage and adoption. Gays literally fought for it. 

This is not being ""red-pilled"". Trump is an AH, and there are far greater AH than him in the GOP. If you need to say well the other side did x, y and z, your whataboutism will be telling. 

I don't want to feel special or different. I want equality. I don't need people giving me legs up and I don't think white progressives see people like me as an equal but voting capital."

I don't suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS); in fact, I enjoy Trump and don't view him as an existential threat to democracy. I believe he'd perform about as well as any other president.*

Hello, conservatives and centrists,

The last 48 hours have been exhilarating, like a cheap sugar rush. Enjoy it while it lasts. But let's take a step back and think strategically. Would you rather be right or be rich (or at least less poor)?

Liberals in this country form a diverse coalition of individuals from various ethnicities, religions, and backgrounds, unified by their shared liberal worldview. However, this coalition is showing signs of cracking due to their bad ideas, such as mass immigration, censorship, DEI initiatives, defunding the police, excessive regulation, unsustainable social welfare programs, and costly foreign wars. While their ideas are weak, they still hold all the cards in critical areas: tech, entertainment, Hollywood, music, non-profits, news media, education, fashion, and government institutions.

If they can't win with their ideas, they can win by casting their opposition as the enemy for four more years, and they couldn't possibly select a better face for this campaign than Donald Trump. Trump is the WWE Heel in their kayfabe narrative. A Trump presidency is great for the deep state, CNN, and The New York Times—they make more money and get more cover for their bad ideas.

All the while, the presidency is becoming less powerful. The president commands only a small percentage of the government; Trump couldn't even build a wall. He’s also had four years before, and not much has changed.

Voting for Biden, though, would continue to expose the rot in our country. What brought the Soviet Union down was not a right-wing revolution but rather demoralization. Mikhail Gorbachev stopped believing in the soviet union, and the soviet union collapsed without blood.

We need a similar moment in the United States.

Do you want to change? You won't get it with Trump that will literally strengthen the deep state, but Biden/Harris will unintentionally fast-track regime change.

CMV.

95,2024-07-15,CMV: The filibuster in the US Senate needs to be abolished,u/eaglesnation11,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e3vllf/cmv_the_filibuster_in_the_us_senate_needs_to_be/,changemyview,"For those who may not be familiar in order for a law to be passed in the United States it must be passed through two houses of the Legislature (The House of Representatives and the Senate) and then be signed by the President.

The US House of Representatives operate under rules where in order for something to get passed a simple majority is needed in order pass a law. There are 435 members of this house so if 218 people agree that a bill should be a law it passes.

The Senate operates differently and while only a simple majority is needed to pass a bill there is also an opportunity to “filibuster” a bill and keep discussion going as long as possible to prevent a vote. In old days Senators would have to hold the floor for long periods of time (~24 hours in some cases), but due to that wasting everyone’s time there’s been an unspoken agreement that if one side knows they don’t have enough votes to stop a filibuster (you need 60% or 60 out of 100 Senators) that they simply won’t pass the law and no “political theater is needed”.

The filibuster has been eliminated in certain cases. In the Obama administration the Senate ruled that filibusters were no longer allowed on voting on Cabinet positions. In the Trump administration judicial nominees could no longer be filibustered. Both made sense as it could be potentially dangerous to not have an official appointee at both positions.

I really think this was a good idea when the country was founded. An old political science teacher put it perfectly as this system was designed to respect the will of the minority even though it cost efficiency within the government. I think it was a great idea to make sure one side couldn’t steamroll changes.

However, what wasn’t foreseen in my opinion is that political parties would have so much power that they would be against something just because the other side was for it and majorities would be so slim that it is near impossible for one side to get a filibuster proof majority. It has happened once in my 28 years of life for the period of less than one calendar year and even then it was still hard to get things done because ONE dissenter on your side means that your bill would fail (What Obamacare was supposed to be vs What we actually got)

I think it’s time to end the filibuster. As someone who leans very heavily to one side you may think that I would think this is dangerous as if my side isn’t in control the other side could act sweeping changes. However, I feel that if you have the Presidency, House of Representatives and Senate you deserve to make those changes. And if they go too far there’s elections every two years where the people can change that.

I think the new system will really reflect the wills of the American people and also curb some increases in executive power we’ve seen since 2009. There has been an increase in executive orders because it’s so hard to accomplish change in the traditional way. 

So for those reasons the Senate should abolish the filibuster."
10,2024-07-15,CMV: It is impossible for human mass societies to have a long term rational and egalitarian structure,u/Weird_Intern_7088,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e3vqaf/cmv_it_is_impossible_for_human_mass_societies_to/,changemyview,"Let me preface this with a couple of points.

1. I am a firm believer in the rationality and moral necessity of an egalitarian society.

2. I am well aware that modern humans have existed in egalitarian structures for most of their existence.

3. I am also aware that authoritarian regimes, and monarchies in particular, tend to be, despite the beliefs of their supporters, a total mess. Authoritarians are more likely to go to war against their neighbors, they're more likely to be corrupt, and abuse their populace, and ""peaceful transfer of power"" is a rare occurrence among them. By virtue of the structure they operate in, authoritarians must spend more resources on a smaller section of their population and they rarely have anything left for the remainder, even if they desired to help them in the first place.

But..

I am also a firm believer of Schopenhauer's philosophy, that living beings are essentially locked in an eternal war against each other, each one of them striving for more and trampling other living beings in the process. 

When applied to a society, it is inevitable that as the wealth of that society increases, and as that wealth is distributed unequally, that a small slice of the population will seek to gain more and more control, to gain more and more wealth. When wealth from imperialism runs dry, then their only means to gain more wealth is by turning to the population in the imperial core; ""fascism is imperialism turned inward"".

The only thing that stops these oligarchs from destroying the society they are looting is for a few of them to consolidate power into the person of a monarch; a person who owns the society and thus has a vested interest in its continued existence. Essentially, a monarch ensures that exploitation can continue in the long term.

An international robber baron like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerburg is only interested in exploiting the United States until it is destroyed and they can go live in peace in another country. But a theoretical monarch of the United States is interested in its continued existence as a nation that their family and closest allies can continue to exploit in the long term.

Yes, we have a lot of democracies right now, but those democracies have existed for a very short time and were only made possible by centuries of brutal colonialism and by the savage exploitation of our planet which is now running out of resources.

The only reason the west even developed the sham democracy we have right now is because a new nation was created in the Americas. There will be no new nation on planet Earth, there is nothing left to conquer. And the conquest of other planets looks like science fiction right now.

The slide back into authoritarianism is inevitable. And future republics will simply be interesting blips in the historical record, just like they have been for most of our history following the agricultural revolution."

0,2024-07-15,CMV: Understanding the four stages of sex is important for personal development and achieving a state of enlightenment. ,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e3wkyy/cmv_understanding_the_four_stages_of_sex_is/,changemyview,"The four stages of sexual development must be comprehended. Sex does not become the Golden Flower until the fourth stage. It is dangerous to not comprehend those four stages, and the entire tradition has been trying to keep you ignorant of them.

AUTOSEXUALITY is the initial stage.

The child is a narcissist from the moment of birth. He knows nothing but HIS body, and he is incredibly in love with it. He's so happy, he's just sucking his own thumb. The child is seen sucking his own thumb and displaying a look of pure euphoria as he plays with his body, attempting to put his toe in his mouth, and creating a circle with the energy. A circle is formed and the energy begins to move in a circle when the child puts his toe in his mouth. The child experiences a natural flow of light, which he finds enjoyable since it brings him immense joy.

Unaware that they are sexual organs, the child plays with his own. He is still unconditioned and perceives his body as a single entity. Of course, the most delicate part of his body is his sexual organs. He loves playing with them and touching them so much.

This is the point at which the child's psyche is invaded by the poisonous society: ""Don't touch!"" The first filthy four-letter word is ""don't."" From this single four-letter word, numerous others follow: can't and won't are also four-letter words. When the parent tells the child, ""Don't!"" and those eyes look back at them with anger... And the child's genital organs, which are naturally highly pleasurable, are deprived of his hand. He is not being sexual or anything, but he is really enjoying it.

That is all—it is simply the most delicate and alive part of his body.

However, because of our socialisation, we remove his hand because he is touching a sexual organ, which is wrong. We make the child feel guilty.

We are now beginning to destroy his innate sexuality. We have now begun poisoning his being, the source of his first joy. We are now moulding him into a hypocrite; he's going to be a diplomat.

He won't play with his sex organs when his parents are around. The first lie has now been introduced; he is not credible. He now understands that his parents are upset with him if he is loyal to himself, respects himself, honours his joy, and honours his instincts. And because he depends on them and cannot survive without them, he is defenceless against them. He will die if they renounce him, so the decision is yours to make regarding your desire to survive. The youngster must submit and you must be against yourself if you want to survive.

In the world, children are the most exploited phenomenon. The child has been the most exploited class of people. There is nothing he can do: he cannot go to court, he cannot approach the government, he cannot form unions to argue with the parents. He is powerless to defend himself from his parents' assault.

Furthermore, the reason the parents stop him is because they have been similarly conditioned by their own parents. The fact that the child is so shamelessly touching and playing with his own genital organs makes them feel extremely embarrassed.

The child is innocent at this point and has no concept of shame. The energy retreats; the 'don't' has arrived.

The initial trauma has occurred. The child will now never be able to joyfully and organically embrace his sexuality. The child has experienced repression, resulting in his body being split in half. He rejects certain parts of his body because they are unattractive, unacceptable, or undeserving of being a part of his body. He begins to castrate himself from the bottom of his psychology, and the energy retreats. There won't be the same natural flow of energy as there was prior to this ""don't.""

And the inevitable result of this ignorance that has been inflicted upon humanity is that, in the first place, the child has lost their natural state and has developed hypocrisy. Either he has to feel guilty or he has to hide something from the parents.

Many people are still trapped in the autosexual state. That explains why there is still so much masturbation in the world. It is the state of nature. It was a growing phase that would have passed on its own, but the parents interfered with the energy's ability to grow.

The youngster gets stuck because he wants to play with his genitalia but is unable to do so. Repressing, repressing—until it becomes too much and the sexual energy POSSESSES him. Additionally, if he starts masturbating, it might turn into a mechanical habit and he won't be able to go to the second stage.

And the parents, the clergy, the politicians, and the entire social structure that has existed up to this point are the ones who bear responsibility.

This man might stay stuck at this extremely immature stage. He will never develop into a fully mature sexual being. He will never experience the happiness that only an adult sexual being can experience. The irony is that these are the same individuals who strongly object to and denounce masturbation. They have been telling people that masturbating will cause them to go blind, turn into zombies, or never become intelligent—in other words, it will always keep them stupid. These are extremely dangerous claims. One thing is now universally acknowledged in scientific research: masturbating never causes harm to anyone. However, these recommendations are harmful. There are no disagreements on this; there is now complete agreement. All psychological studies concur that masturbating is a healthy way to release pent-up energy and never causes harm to others. Nevertheless, these notions—that you will become blind—may endanger your eyes because they will cause you to believe that you will become blind repeatedly. There could be a simple explanation for why so many people wear glasses besides their eyes. Since all children are intelligent from birth, it is unlikely that the reason why so many millions of people are stupid stems from their own stupidity. There might be another explanation for this: these methods. You won't get better, and your confidence will decline. And because they are aware of what they have been doing, a great deal of people are constantly terrified, trembling, lacking confidence, and trusting nobody.

To reiterate, there has never been any harm caused by masturbating. However, a person's entire being is open and flowing during a moment of intense climax, making it a very sensitive and delicate moment. If a thought occurs to him at that precise moment, he will consider it and say, ""Now what if I go insane? Should I become blind? ""If I stay stupid forever,"" these incessant autohypnotic recommendations are the root of a thousand diseases, a thousand psychological issues, and a thousand perversions.

Who bears the blame for this?

You've been given perversions by society. You are a part of a perverse society!

If the child is permitted to continue in the natural stage of autosexuality, he will naturally progress to the homosexual stage, though very few people ever reach this stage. Most people still use the first phase. You might not be doing anything more than mutual masturbating when you make love to a man or a woman. Very few people experience the glimpses that are certain to occur if your sexuality is mature, because very few people achieve orgasmic states. It is a natural phenomenon that very few people learn about God through their romantic relationships. When in love, meditation comes easily.

However, the reason it doesn't happen is because millions of people—the majority—are stuck at the initial stage.

Even after getting married and starting a family, their relationship consists solely of mutual masturbation. It is not true romanticism.

Making love is an art, a great art; it requires maturity, meditativeness, great awareness, and sensitivity.

Homosexuality is the second phase. The second phase comes naturally to very few people. The young one adores his physique. If the child is male, he loves the body of a boy, that is, HIS body. It would be too abrupt to go from a girl's body to a woman's body. Usually, he falls in love with other boys first; if the child is a girl, her first natural inclination is to fall in love with other girls since they share the same type of body and essence. Boys are another story; she can relate to the girls more than the boys.

The homosexual stage is a normal stage of life. Because society puts barriers between men and women and between girls and boys, it helps people stay stuck. In the absence of those obstacles, the homosexual phase quickly ends and interest in the heterosexual, or other sex, begins. However, society does not offer opportunities for that; instead, a massive China Wall stands between the boy and the girl. They are required to receive separate instruction or sit in separate seats in the schools. They are required to live in separate dorms at the colleges. Their getting together and meeting are not accepted.

The society that both supports and condemns homosexuality is homophobic. These tactics need to be comprehended. The same society demonises homosexuals and labels them as criminals and perverts.

There are still nations where homosexuality carries a ten-year prison sentence.

There have been nations where a homosexual might have received a death sentence! And it is produced by the same society!

You separate men and women to such an extent that you make impenetrable barriers. Additionally, when a man seeks love, he is unable to find a woman, and vice versa for a woman seeking love. Then, he falls in love with a man and she falls in love with a woman, depending on what is available. Although it is not fulfilling either, it is still preferable to nothing. Nature needs to fend for itself. It will find an alternative path if you don't let it take its natural course. If not, homosexuality is a phase that comes and goes on its own.

The heterosexual phase is the third.

A man is capable and mature enough to fall in love with a woman, which is a completely different world with a different chemistry, psychology, and spirituality, once he has truly stopped having autosex or homosex. He can then play with this other world and this other organism. Although they are poles apart, first glimpses, lightning glimpses of SAMADHI are attained when they approach—and there are times when they are really close and overlapping.

Although what I'm saying is an existential phenomenon, both the man and the woman must be of legal age. This is only possible if they have progressed past the first two stages. And mature men and women exist very, very infrequently. Thus, nothing occurs; they fall in love, but their relationship is fleeting. They are, at most, homosexual or autosexual in their hearts.

It takes a new sort of being that can embrace complete opposites to love a woman or a man. And only when the polar opposites come together—just as when positive and negative electricity meet, electricity is created—do the life energies of man and woman, yin and yang, Shiva and Shakti, come together. At that point, they merge, lapse into oblivion, and become inebriated, at which point they cease to exist as distinct entities, separate egos. They are pulsating as one, two bodies in one soul since they are no longer there apart. That is the first experience of SAMADHI, as well as the first experience of no-mind, no-ego, and no-time.

After experiencing this, a desire develops: how can this SAMADHI be attained so that it can become the norm and you are free from dependence on men or women? After all, dependence breeds slavery. A person doesn't begin looking for techniques, means, or methods—Yoga, Tantra, Tao—to achieve the same state on their own until they have experienced a heterosexual orgasm.

Yes, it is possible to achieve because, at their core, every man is both a man and a woman—half derived from his mother, the other half from his father—and every woman is both a woman and a man. You will therefore be able to see for the first time that it can occur within once you have witnessed it occur through the external woman. You begin to meditate now because the outer woman merely set it off and the outer man merely served as a catalyst.

The fourth and last phase is called BRAHMACHARYA, or REAL celibacy. This is not the same as monastic celibacy, which is not celibacy at all, but rather the celibacy of the Buddhas.

BRAHMACHARYA is the name. There is no longer any need for sex; you don't need an outer man or woman. Now, a deep and lasting togetherness has emerged between your inner man and woman. You are united in this true marriage; it is unbreakable. Right now, you're naturally in an orgasmic state. A Buddha breathes in and out in orgasm; he lives in orgasm all the time.

The four phases of sex are as follows.

This is about claims, burden of proof, and evidence.

I see a lot of claims that Justice Thomas is corrupt because of quid pro quo deals (I'm sticking to these for this discussion). And I absolutely agree we have evidence for the quid, and evidence for the quo, but I don't think we have evidence for the pro.

Corruption here would require that the corrupt party was influenced by the gift. But you can absolutely accept a gift, and render a decision, while being oblivious to the influence.

And you need evidence to support the claim that he acted corruptly in his rulings because of the gifts/bribes. When prosecutors have to prove intent, they actually have to do the work of getting communications and witness statements to substantiate that position. And no one making the claim that Thomas is corrupt has done that work.

The purpose lack of disclosure is certainly intent to deceive, but that doesn't tell us that it is intent to cover up bribery. It could just be embarrassment at looking like it is bribery. Again, we need evidence of intent.


And these are all good reasons to ban things like the appearance of corruption. Simply do not permit parties to accept money because you won't be able to easily uncover the evidence of intent and it doesn't greatly punish anyone to not be allowed. That is a good law. But again, that doesn't mean a person violating that law actually was influenced.

Instead he decided, that murdering people and at the end first-born children as a DISTRACTION was okay.

Now recently I lost in a conversation about this on r/Democrats and have seen people debate this in comment section with most seemingly believing that this narrative is bad and Republicans are fascist who we shouldn’t have any sympathy for, so I have been thinking about this more. I myself support this narrative. I know this shouldn’t excuse the stuff Republicans have done that significantly contributed to this incident, nor do I think it should cause people to forget about things like Project 2025. But I also think that the complete hatred both sides have for each other along with whittling one side down to a stereotype is still a bad thing and leads to incidents like the aforementioned one.

It seemed evident to me, but I've seen many posts from r/DefendingAIArt, and I feel I'm missing something. I suppose that's why I'm here, to see if I am and if I should change that view.

I do not believe AI can create art as it does not have an actual understanding of what it's doing/what is being asked of it, nor does it have intention behind it. There are numerous examples of this, but probably the most widely acknowledged example is the weird things Image generator AI did when attempting to generate a hand and/or fingers. A human artist will struggle with drawing/painting fingers because of their complexity. There are numerous joint and small muscle groups close together, how the fingers and muscles act in conjunction with one another but have their own purpose when it comes to the utility of the hand and much other instinctive knowledge that comes from actually having a hand. We know what these uses are and at least vaguely know what a hand will look like when used in a situation. In essence, we know what a hand is supposed to do and how it usually looks, and when it doesn't conform to our understanding of how a hand functions, it is readily obvious. However, an AI just sees a picture and knows that there should be a hand somewhere, but how many fingers where they go and how they interact and restrict each other during complex movements is completely unknown to it on even the basest level. It knows what a hand is but not how it is used or what it may be used for in a given situation. The result of this half-knowledge is images like these.

[AI hand image 1](https://upload-os-bbs.hoyolab.com/upload/2023/12/06/105486198/3a2a097a42798dbe60e576e2b6ac7156_5904619833746369557.jpg?x-oss-process=image%2Fresize%2Cs_1000%2Fauto-orient%2C0%2Finterlace%2C1%2Fformat%2Cwebp%2Fquality%2Cq_70)

But you don't just see this mistake with AI failing to understand the concept behind what it's doing with just image generation. The military has run right into this same wall [with marines sneaking up to AI solid snake style](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/marines-ai-paul-scharre/). To me, AI feels like the actual real-life application of the monkeys on a typewriters thought experiment, only now some people are claiming that the monkeys wrote Hamlet. An AI artist did not make anything; they strung together a sequence of adjectives and nouns and fed it to a machine with a tenuous on what those words mean, and it generated an image by connecting it to other images it knows and tagged with those words and mixed them together with no clear understanding of what it's doing and what those words really mean. It can't create anything because it cannot have intention behind it's actions because it's just a machine and can't actually think."

They should get priority access to services such as flights, insurance, repair services, financial support, and healthcare. When we are talking about a woman who is pregnant, we are talking about two individuals (the mother and her baby). We should treat both of them with the utmost respect and dignity, and that includes giving more care and attention to pregnant women in order to help and support them whilst they carry a new life into this world.

As someone who is anti-abortion, I believe it is our duty as members of society to do everything we can do help and support pregnant women to make them feel supported, loved, and cared for. In the case of pregnancy, we must give extra caution, care, and support as we are speaking of two or more human lives.

I'm not saying that pregnant women are inherently superior to everyone else. I'm saying that, because of the fact that she is carrying a baby into the world that is attached to her and relying on her, we should treat both of them with care, which means providing more care and support to pregnant women due to the multiple lives involved.

The left is saying that there is a high chance of a fascist takeover. I think this isn't really true for a few reasons

  
They bring up project 2025, Trump himself has condemned this plan and there is no proof he intends to implement any of what's in it or if he even can.  The Supreme court might just strike down elements of it, I know what your thinking ""but the supreme court is in the pocket of Trump"". I would argue that is not necessarily the case, the Supreme court sided with Biden against Greg Abbot, they didn't even hear Trump's attempt to overturn the election and many other cases that didn't make the news. 

I love how the left is saying that project 2025, us leftist also say that the rich rule America (which is true) but so much of project 2025 goes against the material will of the rich.  Banning porn for example, porn makes so much money and is to popular it will lose anyone an election, firing tons of federal agency employees. Many of these people are in the pockets of big business. 

  
1: The demographics aren't there. the White population is declining in both numbers and influence. I remember Sweden was like the whitest white country imaginable as a kid and now I think POC are 25% of the population, white people just don't have kids. I am not in the mood to argue why but it's true. Unlike other groups they can't make up the difference with intermarrying because white men are not popular in the dating market.

2: LGBTQ acceptance is on the rise. I think like 25% of Gen Z is queer, how is the far right going to win elections against that ? They won't and more of Gen alpha will be queer.

3: Rise of feminism and women's autonomy, the far right vision kind of hinges on women being submissive and having families. Most women especially Gen Z and millennial women don't want that. I think among young people women actually make more then men, women can make great money on onlyfans while being a dude in today's economy isn't like that. The man vs bear meme went mega viral,barbie was the highest grossing movie in it's studios history.



The rich aren't on the side of the far right In France for example the capitalist shill liberal party that is funded by all the richest people in France gave up 200 seats to the socialist party in a new coalition to defeat Lepen's pretty moderate, pretty fake nationalism. Now this new government is passing a 90% tax on the rich while Lepen tried to cater to the rich and they shunned her anyways. They would rather pay higher taxes then support Lepen or even risk Lepen winning. Obvisouly I am happy Lepen lost but still the fact she did goes against long held wisdom.

Second, last time there was an attack, it was just a man charging the stage and the SS rushed him off stage immediately. This time they let him stand for a perfectly framed photo op.  

Third, the SS was clearing the area behind him right before the shooting. If that was because they heard of a possible shooter, they would have pulled him off the stage immediately, not let him keep rambling.  

Fourth, the SS and police were informed, and the story has changed from ""no they weren't"" to ""it was just the police and they blew him off"" to ""the police and the SS were warned and an officer followed him and was buddy lifted up to the roof"" to ""police followed him up the ladder to confront him."" 

Fifth, they were already positioned and aiming for that roof. They killed him after he supposedly fired only 3 shots, which means 6 shots came from SS countersniping. That doesn't make any sense.  

Sixth, the blood coagulated on his ear immediately. That's not how blood works, on top of a bullet being so fast that even the Shockwave shears flesh. A graze that close would have torn a hole along the side of his head, not left a tiny nick on the top of his ear.  

Seventh, there are pictures of his ear, and it has no visible damage. As said before, a bullet would rip flesh open, he should have had a hanging skin tag at least, and a missing ear at most.

While in many cases this was good and incentivized innovation in science and technology, I believe it to be outdated in the current and I believe a royalty-based system to be superior, where the inventor receives a percentage of the profit (10, 15% possibly), of the product sold, but any firm can sell a product that uses the inventors idea. I believe this is superior for 4 reasons:

1. It reduces the possibility of monopolization of a product. The most obvious case is of pharmaceutical drugs, where companies retain decade long patents where they can increase the price of drugs by dozens of times the true manufacturing cost. In this system, they will be limited with how high they set the price of drugs lest they be out-competed by neighboring firms. However, they will still have an incentive to inventive a new product because... 

2. It still allows the inventor to have an edge in the market. All things being equal, the firm that has ownership of the invention will be able to out compete competitors of the market because they will have lower prices due to the lack of royalty fee on their products, not to mention the period of time it takes for competing firms to adopt the product. This means inventors will still have the incentive to invent for profit, which is far more efficient than any other system.

3. It allows for increased innovation in a market and for the market to move faster. Having to wait a set of amount of time for patents to run out, 15 to 20 years in many cases, for competing companies to be able to use the invention is objectively inefficient, competitors have to choose sub-par options which hurt consumers if the owner of the patent fails to deliver adequately. 

4. It alternatively allows inventors to specialize. Firms specifically for R&D and universities can organically make contributions to science and technology and receive profits because of it actually proportional to how much it impacts society. This already exists, although IMO it is limited, with firms buying patents off of inventors, however this goes against the idea of a patent, and instead the profits go to who pays the larger price tag, with routine stories of inventors being exploited by larger firms. This allows for a more efficient division of resources as each manufacturing company doesn't need to have their own in-house r&d teams and these scientists can pool their resources together and so be less exploited by manufacturing firms.

Even with the Supreme Court being off the rails, if they don’t “shorten” the legislative cycle through some sort of dictatorial power structure, it  will just be four more years of congressional circuses and court appeals and then they have to try again with a new brand. MAGA is Trump, and if they don’t close that two-term rule and make him permanent, they can’t keep any of this going.

Now that the Republicans already have a “lesson learned” that their own supporters might take shots at them, they are almost REQUIRED to do a roundup of firearms at some point, if they want to feel safe about staying in power.

It’s a very common tactic of dictatorships to “outlaw” arms equal to or greater than their own.

The top reason why people tend to hate on her is because she is arrogant and I cannot deny Ronda is arrogant. Ronda Rousey was an arrogant fighter in the UFC which to the fans it rubbed the people the wrong way. Personally I believe that arrogance can be justified if someone is exceptional at something, and Ronda was an exceptional fighter and so her arrogance was ultimately justified. We people are the masters of our own destinies we don't owe it for people to be humble and arrogant people shouldn't be hated on simply because they have such a high and justifiably ego. 

Another reason why people hate her is because how she handled the loss against Holly Holm and people calling her weak. If I'm gonna be honest in Ronda's case that shows how passionate she is about the sport and how much it matters to her. Recently in the 2022 World Cup Quarter Final one of the greatest players Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, he was knocked out of the quarter final by Morocco. He was later seen on TV walking to the locker room crying, that just shows how passionate he is about the game just like Ronda was about UFC. 

In addition to this people really hated Ronda Rousey because she was at the top of her game. In life people tend to hate those who are successful and are dominating the scene and that's what Ronda was doing. People want to see successful people fail because they're at the bottom they need to see that good people crumble so they can feel good about themselves.

For a long time now, Presidential races have been far less about what your platform is, and more about voting against the other guy because of how awful they are portrayed to be. Ad agencies understand this and run ads smearing the other guy instead of anything of substance.

What prevents us from getting a younger candidate with actual good ideas or a plan is it would be way too easy to pull up their porn history. Even if they only looked up something weird once when they were 13, the opposition would have a field day running constant ads about what a sexual deviant they are.

The one counter I have to myself is that Trump seems somehow immune to any amount of smear. Has sex with a porn star while his wife is pregnant? No loss of support. Gets convicted for crimes from last election? If anything, gains support! I don't know how that fits into my theory."

0,2024-07-15,CMV: The embryonic stem cell research issue alone establishes that leftism is no substitute for anti-theism,u/ShortUsername01,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e47uah/cmv_the_embryonic_stem_cell_research_issue_alone/,changemyview,"Full disclosure: I am deeply skeptical that Christianity, leftism, or conservatism are as definable as they’re made out to be. I therefore use “self described” as a placeholder in lieu of a definition. I also have a personal stake in this as a diabetic. Anyway, without further ado…

I’ve noticed a profound double standard between how the “life begins at conception” argument is handled in the context of embryonic stem cell research (ESCR) and how it’s handled in every other context in which it’s invoked, from in vitro fertilization to abortion to the morning after pill. The general direction of the double standard appears to be one against the former and in favour of the latter three.

When it’s ESCR, we’re told to be civil. When it’s the other issues, we’re told detractors aren’t owed privacy at dinner, much less civility.

When it’s ESCR, the argument that it’s a human life because it technically fits the definition of life seems to be treated with some degree of validity. When it’s the other issues, that exact same argument is dismissed as an excuse to control women.

Put aside whether you believe abortion and the morning after pill are self defence, or that life creating IVF is a more justified use of embryos than life saving research. The fact remains that many proponents of all these things happen to disagree with the life begins at conception argument yet neglected to refute it in the context of ESCR. The moral duty to call BS on the “life begins at conception” argument in the ESCR context isn’t just owed to diabetics or cancer sufferers or Alzheimer’s sufferers. It’s owed to honesty itself. If you go along with the “life begins at conception” argument when it’s used against ESCR, you are not on solid ground to complain when it’s eventually used against your own pet causes. One should have pushed back in the context of ESCR.

I’m aware of polls suggesting support for ESCR to be stronger than that for abortion. But it’s at best halfhearted support, and at worst respondents don’t mean it. I say this not just in light of examples like the above, but by the fact that the abortion issue is far more often used against the GOP than ESCR is to this day.

By comparison, Sam Harris; someone self identified leftists refer to as conservative for his views on Islam; has in no uncertain terms invoked this as an issue on which anti-theism has a more moral response than Christianity. That much is obvious. But where leftists who are religious; and even many who are not but who make excuses for religion; fall apart is to imply leftism is the top priority, as opposed to anti-theism which strives to learn the broader lessons from what went wrong with religion, leading to a more principled worldview in which arguments like “life begins at conception” are challenged regardless of the context in which they are invoked."

This then leads the far left to say dumb stuff which alienates those in the center and pushs them a bit further to the right

Then it does it again on another topic and again on another topic

Now the far right uses those dumb things to twist what was said and the far left just goes along with it 

Another problem Is the far left has a more academic focus so when terms like white privilege or toxic masculinity get used they have an academic meaning but to the normal person it makes it sound like all white people are privileged or that all masculinity is toxic and the far right encourages the view that the left believes that

In Europe one of the major reasons behind the return of the far right is worries about immigration the far left has dismissed these sorts of concerns for over a decade as racist and people who are worried about this have begun turning to those who actually engage with the issue

You can also see it when comes to the rise of incels young boys and men are concerned about there issues but are dismissed by those on the left or told that feminism will solve the issue. This leads them to the only community that pretends to be there to help them and tell them there is nothing wrong with being a guy

Theres a saying The Right looks for converts, the Left looks for traitors and I think political discourse at the moment really proves this to be true

The left needs to go back to listening to people and understanding there concerns to counter the right who will use anything they can to convert people to there's cause

“What about ‘baby fever’?” Environmental 

“What about desiring of certain traits in a mate?” This is a tricky one but I’m gonna say that this is based on sexual attraction, which I suppose is based on both biological and environmental factors. Nevertheless, this does not prove that ‘baby making desires’ are instinctual. 

If making babies was instinctual, everyone would have kids. But it is not. Again, knowing how to copulate is instinct, desirable breeding is not.

0,2024-07-15,CMV: Dividend Investing is irrelevant ,u/mmaguy123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4ct4f/cmv_dividend_investing_is_irrelevant/,changemyview,"**Overview**

My view is that by and large, a company’s dividends are an irrelevant factor when investing in them. I don’t have a particular view on dividends, and am generally indifferent to them. In fact, in certain circumstances it can be a slight negative in investing.

**Simple Example**

 I will lay out my view with a simple example that was well illustrated by youtuber Ben Felix. 

Take Company A, and Company B. Both companies have a stock valued at 10 dollars. 

Both companies grow by an equal value. Company A stock grows to 12 dollars and pays 0 dividends. Company B stock grows to 12 dollars, however 1 dollar is redistributed to shareholders. Company B stock is now worth 11 dollars, and the holder has 1 dollar in cash.

In both cases, the profit potential is equal. One is unrealized, while in the other 50% of the gains are realized in the form of the one dollar dividend. However I could sell half the company A stock and realize the same profit of 1 dollar (assume fractional shares are allowed for sake of the example). Because of this, the dividend is irrelevant to me, and all that matters is the growth potential of the companies.


**When I think dividends can be a net negative all things considered equal:**

** 1. Tax (Non-Tax Sheltered Account)**
In the real world, tax also exists. Unless this is in a tax sheltered account, for Company B I’d have to pay an income tax on that 1 dollar dividend. In company A, I could sell half a share  immediately and pay the same profit and same tax, or I could wait until it’s applicable for capital gains tax, which in North America (I’m not very educated about other parts of the world), is less than income tax. Hence, the profit being stored as potential in equity gives me the flexibility to make it more tax friendly as well. 

**2. Companies reinvesting profits instead of paying dividends gives them more resources to grow**

In the previous example, Company B had to pay half of their growth as dividends to their shareholders. Company A, can reinvest the entire amount back into the company, giving them more resources to grow. And according to my view, growth is fundamentally all that matters for potential ROI. 


Thanks for listening to my view. I’d be glad to have my mind changed as I always want to learn more and make money :)

2,2024-07-15,CMV: Teaching people in abusive situations/systems coping skills doesn’t help- it just enables the abuse,u/Immediate_Cup_9021,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4eae3/cmv_teaching_people_in_abusive_situationssystems/,changemyview,"The abuser gets to keep abusing you without consequence if you’re fine. A terrible situation doesn’t improve if you just cope with it and accept it.

I coped through years of abuse believing my first therapist that I had anxiety and was just bad at dealing with life/was sensitive. So I learned the skills. 

I practiced them religiously. I learned how to tolerate it/avoid crisis and then I thought hey it must not actually be that bad (it was that bad). My tolerance for abuse increased and I stopped listening to my survival instincts telling me to run. 

Similarly, I learned pain management meditations and therapy for pain and instead of being properly treated for my progressive autoimmune disease, I did some deep breathing. 

I went out into the world with these incredible coping skills and could tolerate absolutely terrible treatment and accepted it thinking my situation wasn’t that bad/it was okay because I could keep myself out of a crisis. Other people couldn’t regulate their emotions but I could, so they deserved better treatment and it was okay for everyone to treat me poorly. I could handle it. 


Had no one taught me the skills, I would have demanded to be treated better. 

Had someone just let me actually feel as bad as they were treating me and snap, I wouldn’t have put up with it and I would have received the actual help I needed way sooner.

Change my mind. Convince me that coping skills can’t prevent you from action /making life bettering decisions. Because looking back, I’m pretty upset that I managed to cope so well I got treated like trash when I could have screamed and made a big fuss about it or just said hey, enough is enough and stood up for myself. I kind of wish I would have quit or demanded my rights be recognized instead of just practicing more coping skills to survive terrible conditions like a good little employee. I desperately needed medicine to stop my body from killing itself but I was taught coping skills and I could function in a 8/10 pain and no one took me seriously. I didn’t think to go to the hospital. 

I’m a little anti coping skill right now. "

- I believe necrophilia is okay because a dead body is not a living being and no one is being hurt.

- I believe you can separate art from the artist, no matter what the artist has done. 

To make it clear, if no one is being hurt or killed, I think these things should be allowed.

0,2024-07-16,"CMV: Feminism is a movement for women, by women. Men have no place in feminism and should not be calling themselves feminists.",u/DrPrrofCarmichael,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4fwod/cmv_feminism_is_a_movement_for_women_by_women_men/,changemyview,"I've been grappling with the idea that feminism is a movement centred around women's experiences, struggles, and empowerment. It seems to me that, fundamentally, feminism is about addressing issues that women uniquely face due to their gender. This leads me to the contention that men, while they can be allies, should not call themselves feminists or be deeply involved in the movement.

Here are my main points:

1. **Women's Experiences and Voices**: Feminism is rooted in the lived experiences of women. Men, no matter how empathetic or informed, cannot fully grasp these experiences first-hand. By taking on the label of ""feminist,"" men may inadvertently centre their perspectives in a movement that isn't about them.
2. **Potential for Overshadowing**: Historically, many movements have seen men overshadowing women’s voices, even within feminist circles. Men calling themselves feminists might unintentionally dominate discussions, diverting attention from the very people the movement aims to uplift.
3. **Allyship vs. Participation**: Men can be valuable allies without identifying as feminists. They can support feminist causes, amplify women’s voices, and work on dismantling patriarchal structures without stepping into roles that might detract from women's leadership within the movement.
4. **Spaces for Women**: Feminism often provides safe spaces for women to share their stories, heal, and strategise. The inclusion of men in these spaces might alter the dynamics, making it harder for women to express themselves freely.
5. **Identity and Solidarity**: The term ""feminist"" carries significant weight and solidarity for those who have fought and continue to fight for women's rights. When men adopt this label, it can dilute its meaning and the sense of shared struggle among women.
6. **Egalitarianism vs. Feminism**: If feminism were truly about equality for everyone, then we already have a term for that—egalitarianism. Feminism, as it stands, specifically addresses the inequalities faced by women. By conflating the two, we risk overlooking the unique challenges that feminism seeks to address.
7. **Byproduct of Dismantling Patriarchy**: While it is true that the feminist goal of dismantling the patriarchy would indeed benefit some men—who suffer under the same patriarchy as they are not in positions of power—that is a byproduct. Any benefit to men is incidental and not the primary focus of feminism. The movement's core aim is to address and rectify the systemic inequalities and injustices faced by women.

I understand that many believe feminism is about gender equality and that anyone who supports this cause should identify as a feminist. However, I believe there's a nuanced distinction between being a supporter and being part of the core movement.

I’m open to having my mind changed and am interested in hearing perspectives on why men should or should not be calling themselves feminists and what role they should ideally play within the movement.

I think this was a huge, unforced error. The US has been in an absolute fever for the past several years, with both sides treating the 2024 election as the ""final battle for their interests and freedom."" Amid that backdrop, I don't think it can be wise to tell the public these ""foes"" they've been fed so much hatred for cannot be taken to court by them or anyone else. They are protected for life, shielded from consequences, forever.

Again, my thesis is that when the public feels the judicial system is no longer capable of holding political leaders accountable, they will want to step in to fill the gap in completely dangerous ways. A complete lack of legal avenues to respond to a POTUS who orders a strike team to kill his political opponent would seem to leave only one other logical outcome for an enraged public.

I want to finish by saying that I am, especially of the last 8 years, pretty apolitical. I'm a pragmatist, and that's in my nature. I have spent my life engineering and architecting complex systems, and I tend to not miss the forest for the trees anymore. I condemn any violence towards any political candidate. I don't want to hear ""what about this thing, or this person..."" here. I want to focus on why the media is doing that, instead of looking to SCOTUS to answer for that ruling and what I see as obvious, direct fallout that will continue until they correct their mistake."

1. Not allowed to have your cellphone or any social media at all , no computer room even . At all times .( who the fuck remembers all the important numbers ? They all under l contact list and I don’t even know my work number ) so yeah if you end up losing your job due to being In a psych ward . Good luck 

2 . Not allowed to have your own belongings and order outside food ( food is a hit or miss though . I was there for a week and two days the dinner was pretty good and the others day are very mid . I grew up in Asian household and I am lactose intolerant , so yeah with many American food ( Mac and cheese , quesadillas and things I can’t eat … not so well 

3. No clothing ! Most of us were admitted against our will , some of them were admitted while in the airport .And we only have one sets off clothing with us , we can do our laundry though .but underwear ? For a facility that suppose to house people for a couple of days at least have some clothing for us to wear while doing laundry but nope . And women we have discharges so we can not wear the same underwear all the time , gross  but they don’t even bother to prepare underwear’s for people . I was lucky that I had family members bring my clothes to me but some of them were not as lucky . And how dehumanizing it is that you are not even able to have clothes on … 

4 . Keep you as long as they want , can’t go out for work , doctor appointments . So if you miss them and have to pay penalty , good luck .your fault . 

5 . There were group therapies . But barely individual therapist . Our therapist had the entire hospital to see . I am lucky my therapist actually understood my situation and helped me get out of there without blaming my suicidal thoughts . But when they evalutae you you admit you feel suicidal sometimes they will keep you longer , the 72 hour legal hold is a lie . They will held you as long as they want to 

6. Not having hygenie products ! I have ocd and the tiny toothbrush they gave us  does not last one brush and they take away after 9 am due to room lock out so yeah if you didn’t brush your teeth than good luck . They force you to be in your room at certain times and out of  your room at certain times . And nope you can’t even keep your owns pads . I was on my period ( my period started early due to overdose on meds . And they say if I need pads I have to ask them for … one only . Even when I sleep I have to go to the front desk the morning because I  was not allowed to keep my own .luckily I had period underwear or else this would  not be pretty 

They take away hygiene ie supplies at 9 am and don’t give them until 8 pmsoo I  had to shower with hand soap to wash the blood off my body on my period

Lining up for food , wearing only gawns , not allowed to have hygiene supplies , can’t use your cellphone or any social media at any. Time at all . Don’t even have clothes to give you to wear if you have no family members … this feels like jail . I know jail is wayy worse but this is not how you suppose to treat mental patients 

All these suppose to prevent us from hurting ourselves ?

Yes many of us are in danger of our selves . But mostly not due to mental illness but due to more stressful situation like domestic violence abuse by family members , victim of sexual assault , homelessness . Very few of of us wants to hurt  Others most of us just  want to end it because life is so hard and we can’t take it anymore 

If we somehow find ways to kill ourselves , that’s fate I guess .i know it’s a law but we should not  force anyone to live , we should help them to live , not force them .most of us do get out though , by lying . I am not less suicidal . I just wouldn’t kill myself because next time I do and failed I will end up there again . I will just go to another country where euthanasia is legal for depressed people so I can avoid this mess 

Does the government , doctors know that we are suicidal but we are not stupid ? Like we know if we fail we will still have to find away to navigate things around until we succeed ( lock us up now we lose our job our money and our freedom , and we still living , miserably . Great .

No privacy ( you are stripped down in the ER , can’t even close your door , and when you go to the bathroom and shower everyone can hear you , you will have a roommate, needs some self time to cry and scream ? Nope .

Medical bills .. shit ain’t free ! We were forced to live on without our will but those medical bills we shave to pay for them . I just ignored  all of them . Fuck it , 

All it does is that it helps you become a n actor . You follow your orders and acted calmly so they let you out 

It makes you feel like you commited a crime , like you killed someone even though you only try to kill yourself the way  you were treated is like you did something wrong 


And the crazy thing is that … if you were hospitalized for other reasons like injury you are probably allowed to have your phone and hygenie supplies 

All it does it’s that next time ifi  feel suicidal . Don’t feel anyone , if I did a suicide attempt and regret it or failed I will just call the ambulance saying that I did something stupid and I am not suicidal . Or find a more successful way to kill myself so I don’t end up there 

I am less  suicidal  though . But I am stop not happy . I just sleep all day . I still traumatized from the cyber bullying  and betrayal all my crushes and my ex friends done to me . I just force my self to live at this point , I am not happy . Every day I wish for a painless death and I am scared to tell my psychiatrist or. Therapist because legally they have to call the cops and they are gonna  put me there again . I take medication to help me function ,but not able to cry and feel sad over all those bad things happens to me makes me angry because losing my emotions makes me feel like a robot 

And that’s not way we should live . I am less suicidal not because I am happy , I am because I am scared of the consequences . They need to find a better way to treat psych patients , and criminals too . I watched videos about ex convicted and what they weren’t through in jail like … not basic hygenie supplies or even ramen noodles … we are human too . 

Going there was so dehumanizing I  will just consider assisted suicide so I don’t have to do it myself . I hate living , I hate there . I making better because I may happy. I am better because I am scared of punishment

LGBTQ+ doesn’t follow traditional views and values, actively going against them as conservatives often believe a man and a woman should be together and anything that contradicts that is “woke.”

Additionally, conservatives are notorious for being discriminatory so why would an LGBTQ+ person become a conservative and agree with ideas that their enemies propagate. Furthermore, conservatism has a history of holding us back from growing and changing and we are actively seeing it in real time. The Supreme Court is mostly filled with conservatives and oh look! 510 anti-LGBTQ+ bills in 2023.

It’s just confusing why as an LGBTQ+ person 
you would ever agree with conservatives and try to actively seek for their approval when their ideas are literally attempting to mak
e your existence illegal. You being an LGBTQ person is inherently contradictory to conservative ideas. 

Before someone accuses me of not knowing what I am talking about, I am LGBTQ+ myself (the L in LGBTQ+).

I know I’m going to see some common arguments so I will refute them now.

“They’re doing it for acceptance within their circle!”
“What if their parents deeply indoctrinated them?”
1. If your circle is full of conservatives who actively hate your very existence, find a new circle. I know it might be impossible for some, but plan an escape route and take the necessary steps to leave.
2. Then they should realize that and try to unlearn these beliefs. I know it’s difficult but it can be done with effort.

“They only believe in the good parts of conservatism though!!!”
You can still believe in the “good parts” (i.e strong national defense, economic growth etc) without being a conservative. 

“They have Internalized homophobia and use conservatism as an outlet”
Then they should learn to accept themselves as they are and that they will never stop being LGBTQ+. Additionally they should find a new coping mechanism instead of engaging with people that actively hate their very existence.

I think certain crimes (like unprovoked violent assault/murder and pedophilia) and or severe genetic illnesses (that would cause the children to die immediately or suffer extremely painful lives) or sever mental disabilities that would cause someone to be unable to care for a child should be sterilized as it’s not fair to bring an innocent child into a situation just for them to be neglected or abused. I think this process would obviously needs strict oversight and each case would need to be approved by an impartial board.

And now I hear this Trump shooter also took his father's weapon.

When the first shooting happened in Finland I formed the opinion that if you allow your weapon to be taken and used in a crime then you should be punished by some new law.

Obviously this doesn't exist at the moment, but it should exist is my view.

I don't know much about guns or gun laws but I do know that most countries who allow gun ownership have some sort of regulation on how the guns should be stored. At the very least a locked safe, and in some cases even taken apart with ammunition and weapon separate.

So clearly there are laws, some strict and some less strict, that regulate the storing of weapons in order to keep them away from people who are not allowed to have them for whatever reason.

With this in mind I think it makes a lot of sense to punish people who allow their weapons to come into the wrong hands.

Of course there have to be exceptions like burglary, where the suspected perpetrator cannot be traced in any way to the victim who had their weapon stolen. But we now have two very clear cases where a person allowed their weapon to be taken by a close relative, and this shouldn't happen."
0,2024-07-16,CMV: the assassination attempt against trump was most likely a setup.,u/acetylcholine41,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4mcum/cmv_the_assassination_attempt_against_trump_was/,changemyview,"So firstly I wanted to apologise for if this is a repeat topic, I did use the search function and found some similar posts but not exact.

I also want to state that I am aware that some of my information may be incorrect - I'm not American myself, and I'm not an expert in this topic. Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. 

So, there are a few reasons why I believe that it's more likely than not that the assassination attempt was a setup:

1) **The shooter was a republican himself.** It simply doesn't make much sense for someone with the same political aligning as Trump to be so motivated to assassinate him that he laid down his own life to do so. The only situation where I believe this would make sense is as if he was even more right wing than Trump and wanted him dead to be replaced by another candidate (?). 

It's more likely, in my opinion, that he was paid to attempt the assassination and miss to boost Trump's popularity (which has had *immediate* effect). As per the sources I've read, the shooter was an extremist, so he likely viewed it as an honourable way to die.

2) **He was able to get through the security unhindered.** In my opinion, it's very suspicious that the security wasn't heavy enough to prevent the shooter getting access to Trump in the first place. It's also been reported that multiple members of the public, and a police officer, actually spotted the shooter, and yet nothing was done.
 https://www-bbc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd167v5lpq2o.amp

https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/15/trump-rally-shooting-witness-warning/

3) **The shooter missed**. Again a fairly weak point, but it seems ridiculous to me that the shooter could miss. It was a clear day and he had a very clear view of Trump. For the assassination of JFK, JFK was a moving target, the weather was poor with bad visibility, etc. 

4) **Trump is clearly just a deranged and delusional person**. When Biden was elected, Trump became obsessed with the idea that the election was rigged against him. He clearly believes that the system is unfair, and that Biden cheated to get to the top. This leads me to believe that he has no objections to cheating his way up to the top himself. If anyone was going to do something like this, it'd 100% be Trump.

I hope that all makes sense and again please correct me if I'm factually wrong about anything. 

I think the biggest weakness to my argument is that the shooter was kind of just some random 20 year old guy, fresh out of high school. Not a trained gunman. He was obsessed with guns, yet did not even make his school rifle team. If the assassination attempt was staged, it would make more sense to hire a trained and experienced gunman to ensure that the shooting was as accurate as possible.

I am not a conspiracy theorist in any way whatsoever, and I've never taken to any conspiracy theories before this. Which is why I've come here - I'd like to see convincing evidence that it was more likely *not* an assassination attempt. "
54,2024-07-16,CMV: Modern rhetoric is bad and not useful for engaging honestly,u/Comfortable_King_821,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4mtas/cmv_modern_rhetoric_is_bad_and_not_useful_for/,changemyview,"I'm a believer that the best way to have a debate is to follow the Socratic method where one person tries to convince the other person of their debate proposal by holding up to questioning, up until the other person willing replies with their own proposition/debate claim in response. 

Framework:
Person A: X is good
Person B: Why?
Person A: Oh I just can choose to consider X good, and I'm choosing to, so it's good to me
Person B: I think if you understood Y you would choose to consider X to be bad instead of good
Person A: sure. What is it? Why would that change my mind?

In reality, a lot of conversations end up being a person making their debate proposal, and then upon questioning flipping the script, shitting on them or questioning the opposition for asking questions.

Framework:
Person A: X is good
Person B: Why?
Person A: Because Y is good and Y follows from X
Person B: Why does Y follow from X? And why is Y good?
Person A: What? Y just obviously follows from X! Why is Y good? The fuck is wrong with you for asking if Y is good?! Anyone who questions whether or not Y is good or follows from X is stupid, close minded, or evil!

If it isn't clear, even if you genuinely considered something obvious, if someone is questioning it in good faith it's not very helpful, in terms of actually producing something between the two of you or convincing them, to respond this way. You can argue it can be good to react this way if there's some kind of audience but it just seems like a stretch. I don't see any use in this kind of conversation. 

And that's not all. People think that, for example, because of Donald Trump's attempted assassination he will win the election. Why would that be a thing? Does some random shooting at him demonstrate some fact about the state of the world as a whole or about the Democrat party? If we genuinely think that one politician is gonna get more of our votes than the other politician due to something that, presumably, shouldn't have a significant impact on policy, then what does that say about us? I'll tell you what I think it says about us, that we're fucking stupid. The only thing this should influence is the level or quality of security in politics."

They simply say ""I don't know, you don't know, no one knows for sure"".

An atheist that says ""I just believe there is no god, but no one can know for sure"" is a reasonable atheist. 

Certain athiests say, ""no, I do know, god is impossible""

Having certainty in something you can't prove is one of the major issues athiests have with religion. But many atheist have certainty in something they can't prove too. 

It's the certainty that I find irrational. I think for the most part it's a disingenous certainty born of the frustration that religion can create. It's understandable. But there's some fantastic philosophy out there that such people are closing themselves off too.

Following their decision, my lightly held opinion which can definitely be changed, is that extending the logic and force of this ruling to justices, no Supreme Court justice can ever be legally questioned or investigated for potential vioation  of the Constitution if allegedly made during their Constitutional duties within the Supreme Court, no matter how 'seemingly' obvious to some, and the only formal binding recourse for any such potential future crimes is political as for the president, by impeachment by Congress.

I am not interested in this question on the liklihood of such actions, much less on whether such actions have been comitted historically by justices on either the right or left. My question is strictly on legal implications of the recent ruling on Presidential immunity. While my general strong preference is not to follow side tracks, if so, a Court's rulings implications on itself seems to raise thornier questions than even analogous rulings on the executive branch and I am curious on legally based thoughts on this.

I really do NOT want to foster any feelings of hopelessness amongst Ukrainians and make anyone despair about the situation, so please do not read my stance here as objective truth.

That said, I do legitimately believe that if Donald Trump is elected, the end result will ultimately mean Russia's victory in this war and its occupation of Ukraine, probably until Putin finally dies from something. Trump will most likely stop sending money and armaments to Ukraine because it costs too much, and Ukraine's already precarious position will then become a completely untenable position. Simply put, it just seems like Ukraine's military couldn't possibly withstand a Russian assault without US assistance.

And no, I do not think European allies will be willing to offset the difference. I'm sure they are already giving as much as they can already (why wouldn't they?), so the idea that they will just up and give more because one of their allies stopped giving anything is extremely unlikely in my mind.

Think what you will about what the election of Trump means for the future of The United States, but you have to also consider what it means for the future of Ukraine. If Russia occupied the entire country, there's no reason to think that their approach to the country is just assimilation...I gotta believe there's going to be a great deal of revenge involved also. These young, aggressive young men leading the Russian assault have had to endure years of hardship and all the terrors of war, so absolutely if they end up winning the war and getting to occupy the country, there's good reason to think they commit rape on an unprecedented scale, that they murder anyone who so much as looks at them the wrong way, and they otherwise just do anything in their power to dehumanize and demean any and all Ukrainians in the country. I don't think it's at all over-the-top to refer to what will happen to the country as a whole as a ""death sentence"".

Defeating him at the ballot box is crucially important not just for the US domestically, but for the wider world. 

It has become painfully obvious that Biden is utterly incapable of doing that. Yes, his administration has been one of the most effective in modern American history. But that does not matter - this election won’t be decided based on legislative track record. The media environment has evolved, this will be decided on optics.

In 2020, when he was the best candidate to beat Trump, i voted for him enthusiastically. He is no longer the best candidate to do that. For years, “generic democrat” has outperformed Trump in the polls, while Biden tended to be in a dead heat or lagging behind. Biden’s debate performance was the last nail in the coffin, there is absolutely no coming back from it, and Trump is surging in the polls. 

The amount of vitriol directed by Biden loyalists against those Democrats who have said he should step down, for obvious reasons, has astounded me. One of the main differences between the two parties has been that one has completely devolved into a cult of personality - where no amount of criminality or moral depravity will change people’s minds - and the other hasn’t. I’m seeing now, however, that too many people on the Blue side are also going down that path, unconditionally supporting this old man no matter how dire his political situation so clearly is. He will lose, and unless he steps down, his legacy will be that of sacrificing the future of the country at the altar of his own ego. 

The stakes are too high for this kind of blind tribalism that’s keeping him propped up.

Most mainstream media laughed at this idea, and Trump ended up besieging the Capitol on January 6th with a violent mob, and clear plan to utilize 'alternate electors' in some sham ceremony to stay in office. The plan failed, and after the failed Coup, Trump did eventually leave office.

In other words, Maher's prediction was largely correct, and not taken seriously, by elites or the public (the vast majority at least).

.....

If you asked Reddit, maybe even CMV, in 2020 ... if Trump might refuse to leave office, or stage a violent mob break in aimed at holding Congressman hostages, general terrorism, and a coup plot .... the vast majority of users/ commenters would give a litany of fairly confident reasons, mechanisms, safeguards, and assurances on how this was ""close to impossible"" and would never happen in a million years.

The sociological reasons for this are debatable, but broadly, I think online, sometimes there is too much skepticism of doomsday scenarios, and too much assurance that ""things never change"".

... Change my mind.

And afterward, ponder whether Trump is really has a 65-70% chance at winning the Presidency in November like [every.](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7456/Who-will-win-the-2024-US-presidential-election) [single.](https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1721142606462) [gambling.](https://www.oddschecker.com/us/politics/us-politics) market predicts, and might institute Project 2025 ""the Fourth Reich"". No, that'll never happen, right guys?

Remember World War Z. The Tenth Man Rule? .... we don't even need a Tenth Man. This isn't a long-tail scenario, it is a LIKELY scenario.

EDIT: So far the prevailing arguments are that Trump didn't besiege the Capitol (I believe he did, but if that's dramatic, he encouraged a riot). And secondly, okay he did but ""it would never happen again, and zombies aren't real."" .... You're supposed to be changing my view here, not hardening it folks.

EDIT2: I changed my mind on the Civil Reform Act point. JD Vance has specifically announced that Trump should clean house of all executive agencies, and despite this being ""totally illegal"" tell the Supreme Court to go shove it.

0,2024-07-16,CMV: The idea that Jews are the sole aggressors in the 48 Arab Israeli war is anti semitic and we should continue refuting it in the modern day. ,u/SuperPapaya5790,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4rpy8/cmv_the_idea_that_jews_are_the_sole_aggressors_in/,changemyview,"A lot of the time, I see the idea that the Jewish migration was on it's own a casus belli, essentially stating that the war did not start in 48 but rather Jewish immigrants started this war by moving to mandatory Palestine in the first place. At first, I did not care about such narratives, because I felt like history is history and now is more important.  

Even today, I'd agree that the history is probably going to be irrelevant in this conflict going forward, but still, I think it is important to refute bad faith history because it can be a form of antisemitism. I see it this way: if someone tried to say, well the Japanese Americans asked for their internment in WW2 by doing x or y, you would not say well actually it's fine that you think that because it's in the past. You would condemn that person with a heart and a half. And no one would really dispute that it counts as racism not only against Japanese Americans who suffered internment, but also against Japanese people *alive today* globally. Same with Armenian genocide, and  the Bosnian genocide, which thankfully was just recently recognized by the UN. 

At the end of the day, I think unsatisfaction with legal immigration is a thing across the entire globe in easily over half of countries, and that number is probably a lot higher than that. However, the other side of it is that most nations don't declare war against legal immigrants either. Yes, it's true that anti-immigrant crime happens everywhere. People may attack immigrants with no care of their ethnicity, what they have to provide, whether their ancestors or native or any of that, and we don't make a new state out of it. 

The big difference has to do with what happens after those attacks though. Anyone who committed an attack against immigrants in the US, UK, or France would be detained immediately. In British Palestine, these people were instead encouraged to do it again and again. That is the difference and what ultimately gave Jews a clear right to a state. 

They already had a right to the homeland by simply buying land and allowing hundreds of thousands of people to settle on that land or in public *unclaimed* land near it. Even without buying land, settling on unclaimed land in a legal manner gave them a right to a homeland. 

And the fact that they would not respect this homeland is what gave them a clear right to a state, and imo, this is the specific point where anti Zionism became anti semitism, once it became clear Jewish community rights would not be respected without a Jewish state. 

The other side of it is if we are calling for historical honesty on their side we should do the same for ours. With history, I believe the best rule is simply to be honest while holding firm that even if the history goes one way or the other, we won't give up power because of it.  

So, in spirit of that, I will acknowledge that there was some serious issues with how the first Jews settled Israel as well. For instance, it would have been a lot more ethical to allow the Fellahin to stay on the land alongside current and future Jewish migrants, though admittedly I think the role of the fellahin are overblown and the conflict would've taken very similar turns without their eviction. 

And yes, there are some issues with the British calling the shots as opposed to people on the ground who would be more qualified, but I'd also say this: if Palestine was an independent country that had simply not claimed a lot of the lands that the Jews had settled on, leaving it unclaimed, and the Arabs attackd Jewish settlements, then the Arabs would still be responsible for starting the war, since creating communities near someone else's communities is not an act of war. 

Also, yes, there is a question over whether the initial partition plan was ethical. Essentially, it would have forced 40% of the population of Israel under permanent minority rule. I think there is a strong case that this was extremely unethical from the UN to suggest. 

So the point is that yes, the first Jews to settle Palestine did a lot of unethical things, but none of them rose to acts of war, or things that would give Palestinians a legitimate casus belli. And as such, it is unethical to claim that Jews were responsible for starting the war. If anyone tried to point to any other example of legal immigration (or honestly even illegal immigration) or land purchases being justification for  a full blown war being waged against any other group at any time, be it the 1500s, 1800s, 1940s, today, 2040s, they would get blasted as bigots. This is the only conflict where the act of simple legal (and partially illegal) migration being considered casus belli is considered remotely legitimate. 

I'll end with one point I'll give the pro Pal side entirely, and a general point about the debate. 

I do think that the Nakba was a much stronger punishment than what Palestinians deserved. Palestinians were not part of the Arab armies that invaded, so to punish them by expelling the ones who fled the war as refugees was extremely unethical, though again, we must remember that this decision was likely influenced by Palestinians' refusal to let current and future Jewish migrants live peacefully before Arab armies ordered them out/they fled on their own. It's possible that without the massacres, Jews may have been more open to Palestinian refugees returning after the war, but since they did not. It was more of a case of ""you kicked us out of our towns and killed us for decades, so thank you other Arab nations for showing them what it feels like and double thank you for trying what you tried knowing we have stronger European grade weapons.""

Also, one thing I will say is that I don't think the rule of victors only writing history applies here. This only applies if the victor somehow takes away the losers' pen forcefully, either by killing or genocide, or ruling over them while insitiuting restrictions on how the loser expresses history. This is essentially impossible with diaspora populations because the loser has left somewhere you don't have power (I am ignoring the West Bank for this, and focusing on the diasporic Palestinians who live somewhere where Israel absolutely does not rule). 

A notable exception is Palestinians in Israel proper, where the government does restrict how they talk about thier history since its their territory.

So, by choosing expulsion/arguably ethnic cleansing over genocide or military rule, Israel did in fact abdicate a large parts of its right to be the sole writer of history, even if they get total victory over the West Bank and Gaza, since there are still millions of Palestinins outside the region entirely. 

The loser having a right to their pen in some cases does not invadlidate the winner's right to have a pen too though, so Zionists are still allowed to hold pro Pals accountable when they twist history to push a narrative in the present or create clear lies intended to smear Jews of previous generations and/or today."
1,2024-07-16,"CMV: One does not stage an assassination attempt by letting a shooter aim at his goddamned face, and the ""deep state"" had nothing to gain with Trump dying.",u/Leading-Status-202,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e4rqgm/cmv_one_does_not_stage_an_assassination_attempt/,changemyview,"I see lots of talks about the assassination attempt being a false flag, staged, fake. They go hand in hand with those who say that the presidency wanted Trump dead. For the second conspiracy, I'd say that the secret services have learned from their lessons, and they know that killing a ""hot"" person while they're still hot will only martyrize them. We can 100% exclude that this was the work of the ""deep state"", as they call it.

Another minus for that theory is that trained snipers never shoot at the head if they have a full view on the subject, but at the chest. There's more surface area, and any bullet of that caliber is going to make inner organs explode. The guy who shoot was an amateur, end of the story.

My main objection with the false flag accusation is in the title itself:

**You do not stage an assassination attempt by letting the shooter use real rounds while aiming that close to the target's body**. 

Let's be real for a sec. If anything, the shooter would be instructed to shoot ABOVE the head or IN FRONT OF HIS FEET. IF. Not in the face. Try pretend punching someone, you will quickly find out that it's HARD, and if you don't slam your punch against their face, you will almost definitely get close hit them. Too much room for mistake, so we can just exclude it.

There's no shooter good enough to aim for someone's ear at that distance. There are shooters who are exceptionally got at that... with a stable, fixed bullseye. Which is big and round, and not tiny like someone's ear front facing you.

You do not place real rounds and fake rounds on the same barrel, because who knows in what order they were placed? Who knows if the shooter triggers one by mistake? Too much potential for flukes. It's either one or the other. Killing people on stage is 100% a fluke, if it was fake. But it's a reall assassination attempt, and people died, because all rounds were real.

He was indeed shot in the ear. The bleeding is consistent with the wound, and you can see pieces of his ear missing in multiple photos. 

I'll finish off by saying: you're really telling me that Donald Trump, the ""pathological narcissist"", would allow someone to maim his ear for clouth? He's using it to his own advantage, but you can just forget that he would allow anyone to destroy his facial features on purpose. That's just out of the question."

I've made this statement talking both from a perspective of a millennial who lived long enough to ear many stories of betrayal and also from the perspective of someone skeptical about the validity of the various surveys accessible online on the matter. 

My distrust of those reaserches comes from their obvious limitations: small pool of respondents many of which where in their twenties and thirties (impossibility to determine if they'll cheat in the future), inability to clearly define what is cheating, no indepth interviews to see if cognitive dissonance was at play or to attest if partecipants were blatantly lying (the anoninity per sé isn't a great deterrent factor for such accourrance) and because the results don't fit with both evolutionary theories that states the importance of sex and sexual experiences during the course of somebody lifetime and the need for variety as a general rule of thumb (I'm aware that not everybody feel the desire to change partner, but that doesn't mean they'll never be unfaithful) nor the experience of the vast majority of people as indicated by other surveys stating that something around 80% of people experienced betrayal from a SO (no need to explain how that percentage is much higher in reality). 

Said that I think the desire for monogamy is artificial and also very superficial and not thought through by the vast majority of people claiming to be monogamous. To say this I take into account the researches that say how a staggering percentage of >60% (it varies depending on what research you take but generally the results indicate always, as stated, an high amount of people who have those fantasies) people in relationships have fantasies about infidelity. This last piece of data alone clearly disproves the actual validity of the other studies I was referring to that stated how only the 20% of people betray their partners.

Now, I recognize that there have been a great many definitions of both atheism, theism, and agnosticism over the years ... but I think often (or perhaps usually) the people making the argument for agnosticism vs. atheism are defining it (agnosticism) very broadly, and the people making the argument for atheism vs. agnosticism are defining it (agnosticism) very narrowly, when in fact the two terms overlap extensively.

Some terms:

* [Agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism) is generally held to mean that the existence of God / the divine is unknowable, and therefore maintaining to be certain about it one way or the other is irrational.
* [Atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism), on the other hand, is a lack of belief in any deities -- generally as a rejection of the proposition that there is / are gods.

Now, from my experience on reddit agnostics tend to define agnosticism very broadly while defining atheism very narrowly

* ""Agnosticism"", to paraphrase Huxley (admittedly the guy who coined the term) is interpreted as simply the unwillingness to pretend to have certainty about that which is uncertain, a very healthy trait for a scientist, without applying it to the existence of god in particular. E.g., ""the theory of gravity is just a theory, it explains the phenomena we see and predicts future phenomena very well, but I am not *certain* it is correct; it could change.""
* ""Atheism"" is then defined very, very narrowly as something along the lines of ""the positive belief that there is *not* a god,"" essentially a faith-based position. ""It can't be proven that there is no god, but I'm certain there is not. I'm taking it on faith.""

Conversely, atheists tend to define agnosticism very narrowly while defining atheism very broadly:

* ""Atheism"" is interpreted as the rejection of a belief that is unsupported by evidence; you don't believe that your mother is actually secretly a demon named Crowley from the 3rd circle of hell or that you robbed a bank yesterday without remembering it, because there is no evidence to support either of these things and you're not in the habit of just believing random things people tell you. 
* ""Agnosticism"" is interpreted as the *decision not to make a decision* about whether to accept or reject a belief in god, on the basis that you ""can't know it for certain"". As such, an agnostic is neither an atheist nor a theist; they're undecided. ""It can't be proven that there is or isn't a god, so I'll believe neither.""

This is obviously going to be a nonproductive conversation, because both groups (""agnostics"" and ""atheists"") *can* hold essentially the same opinion while assuming their interlocutor is just labeling themself the wrong thing (""You're actually an atheist! You're actually an agnostic!"") 

So it seems relatively unlikely that you can have a fruitful conversation about these labels without first agreeing what you actually mean by the labels. Am I missing something?"

Subreddits for minors should not exist. Too vulnerable and leaving kids to moderate themselves is also a terrible idea.

some of the posts are absolutely appalling and the mods have spent years ignoring legitimate complaints while justifying their inaction by saying it’s hard to mod a subreddit that big, the only people the only thing the moderators there seem to actually care about is censoring legitimate options.

As I mentioned I active to the point that I still have friends that I met there when I was younger and have been talking to for years, I remember it was also really frequent (almost weekly) that someone (usually a girl) would post a selfie and end up getting a bunch of weird comments. 

Not to mention most of the mods step down once they hit like 20, so a lot of the moeration decisions are made by children. Not hard to see how once it got huge, there was no way to stop weirdos from hovering.

I remember a few years ago some made a post calling out the mods for inaction and asking the legitimate users of the sub to stage a boycott or something, but nothing really changed once the whole thing died down.

I feel like alot of people use the phrase ""I dont have talent"" or ""He has talent unless me"" as an excuse for their lazyness.

I personally think the ""talent"" that people name talent is more like a skill that u can develop. From what I think its the skill to understand the base concept of an task faster than other. Understanding that concept can either happen by luck or by experience, like if u tried to learn a lot of different skills in ur past you prolly have an easier time, to learn new stuff in the future. Some of you may be familiar with neuroplasticity and the difference between the the plasticity of a child and the of an adult. Over simply said the more you age the less plastic your brain gets and the harder it gets to learn something. So if you learn the skill of understanding concepts early in ur life it will probably be a big difference than somebody who learns it a bit later (also thats prolly a skill u cant 100% master, so every person has a different degree of mastery on that skill). So basically what im trying to say is that there is a skill that helps u learn over skills and that cold the our so named ""talent"".

I tend to think that sometimes regardless of prestige… sometimes people are just incompetent and mistakes happen. That being said… the right is fully charged and paranoid that there is hit out for trump. 

My theory is that Donald trump will win the election by a landslide.. he will either be about to take office.. or be in office and then we will die of 100 percent legitimate causes. No foul play. He is old, he is under tremendous stress.. and with his BMI and lifestyle I would not be surprised if something were to happen

The right will see this as a direct attack and try to overthrow the government and have no faith in the democratic process. There is no amount of evidence or rational that can prove to them there is no foul play. Confirmation bias will kick in but they will be trying to avenge their leader that was “misrepresented by the media”… “tried to be thrown in jail”…. “Was almost taken out at the rally”.

I’ve been thinking a lot about dating and relationships lately, especially as someone who’s over 30. Dating can be exhausting, disappointing, and sometimes downright soul-crushing. The endless swiping, ghosting, and failed attempts is no doubt exhausting. But here’s my controversial view: if you’re single and over 30, and you decide to remove yourself from the dating market completely, you’ll likely end up regretting it.

First off, I totally get why someone might want to take a break or even swear off dating altogether. Life is busy, careers are demanding, and maybe you’ve just had one too many bad dates (or heart breaks). But opting out completely? That seems excessive.

Here’s the reality check: as we age, finding someone we’re attracted to gets harder. Our pool of potential partners shrinks, and let’s be honest, we become less attractive too. It’s a harsh truth, but it matters. The older we get, the more baggage we accumulate, and the pickier we become. The chances of finding that perfect match diminish as time goes on.

Plus, there’s the simple fact that companionship is a fundamental human need. It’s not just about having a romantic partner; it’s about having someone to share life’s ups and downs with. Sure, friends and family are great, but they can’t fill the void that a romantic partner can. Loneliness is a real issue, and as we get older, our social circles often shrink. Finding someone to share your life with can add immense joy and fulfillment.

Then there’s the regret factor. Picture yourself 10 or 20 years down the line. Will you look back and think, “Wow, I’m so glad I decided to stay single all those years”? Or is it more likely that you’ll wonder about the what-ifs? The people you might have met, the experiences you could have shared, the love you might have found? The fear of growing old alone is very real, and it’s something that can weigh heavily on your mind as the years pass.

Also, sometimes dating can be fun and we make meaningful connections, and yes, even love stories that start in the most unexpected places. You can't experience that by opting out completely.

So, while I understand the frustration and fatigue that comes with dating, I believe that staying in the game, even if it’s just one toe dipped in the water, is worth it. The possibility of regret, the diminishing dating pool, and the potential for happiness make it a gamble worth taking.

Change my view.

**TL;DR**: I think people over 30 who give up on dating entirely will likely regret it because our dating pool shrinks, we become less attractive, companionship is crucial, and the potential for future happiness outweighs the temporary frustration. Let’s discuss!"

*Economic Inequality: Capitalism inherently creates economic disparities. The pressure to compete and the stress associated with financial insecurity can lead to anxiety and depression. Research has shown that economic inequality negatively impacts mental health.

*Workplace Stress: The capitalist system often prioritizes productivity over well-being. This can lead to overwork, burnout, and stress. The constant pressure to perform and the lack of job security are major stressors for many workers.

*Consumer Culture: Capitalism fosters a culture of consumerism, where people are constantly bombarded with advertisements and the idea that happiness comes from material possessions. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem when individuals are unable to attain these societal standards.

*Social Isolation: The emphasis on individualism in capitalist societies can lead to social isolation. Without strong community bonds and support networks, people are more vulnerable to mental health issues.

*Healthcare Access: In many capitalist countries, access to mental health care is often limited to those who can afford it. This exacerbates mental health issues as many people are unable to get the help they need.

*Job Insecurity: The gig economy and precarious employment conditions, which are hallmarks of modern capitalism, contribute to chronic stress and mental health problems. The uncertainty of not knowing if one will have work tomorrow creates a constant state of anxiety.

*Stigmatization of Mental Health: Capitalist cultures can stigmatize mental health issues, viewing them as weaknesses that hinder productivity. This stigma can prevent individuals from seeking help and exacerbate their conditions.

*Environmental Stress: Capitalism's focus on growth and consumption often leads to environmental degradation. Pollution, climate change, and the destruction of natural habitats can cause chronic stress and anxiety for individuals concerned about the future of the planet. This environmental anxiety adds another layer of mental health challenges.

*Urgency and Burnout: Capitalism often fosters a culture of urgency, where everything needs to be done ""yesterday."" The constant push for faster results, higher productivity, and immediate success can lead to chronic stress and burnout. This relentless pace leaves little room for rest and recovery, further deteriorating mental health. The perpetual rush to meet deadlines and achieve goals can make it difficult for individuals to find moments of peace and relaxation.

The capitalist system perpetuates these detrimental mental health conditions primarily to benefit a small group of billionaires. While a few individuals amass immense wealth, the vast majority of ordinary people face increasing economic strain, job insecurity, social isolation, and mental health challenges. The relentless drive for profit and growth ensures that the rich get richer while the average person struggles to maintain a decent quality of life, exacerbating the very issues that undermine mental well-being. This stark disparity highlights the urgent need to reevaluate and reform our economic structures to prioritize the health and happiness of all people, not just the financial elite.

\[John Eastman's memo\](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-Chapman053476/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-Chapman053476.pdf) on the topic is not ambiguous.

>2. When he gets to Arizona, he announces that he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other States. This would be the first break with the procedure set out in the Act.

  
Note that those ""multiple slates"" are \*fraudulent\*.  They do not conform to \[3 USC §6.

The December 6th one on page 5 even underlines the sentence saying not to let the governor or any state officials sign or transmit the fraudulent documents.

  
We even have the \[emails\](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24245353/email-chain-about-last-minute-fake-electors-scramble.pdf) between Trump's campaign lawyers and Ken Chesebro orchestrating the logistics of mailing those fraudulent documents.  Where we see Rudy was also involved in the effort.

  
That's what Trump wanted Mike Pence to do on January 6th, it's what Trump is referring to when he's thanking John Eastman, on stage immediately before him, \[in his speech\](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial).

  
>And I'll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That's a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, ""What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution.""

>And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.

>Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We're supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution.

>States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.

>And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: ""Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage."" And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We're just not going to let that happen.

  
He's describing the actions set out in John Eastman's memo, continued:

  
>At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States. That means the total number of ""electors appointed"" - the language of the 12th Amendment -- is 454. This reading of the 12th Amendment has also been advanced by Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe (here ).

>A ""majority of the electors appointed"" would therefore be 228. There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden. Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.

>Howls, of course, from the Democrats, who now claim, contrary to Tribe's prior position, that 270 is required. So Pence says, fine. Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority. That sends the matter to the House, where the ""the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote .... "" Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. President Trump is re-elected there as well.

>One last piece. Assuming the Electoral Count Act process is followed and, upon getting the objections to the Arizona slates, the two houses break into their separate chambers, we should not allow the Electoral Count Act constraint on debate to control. That would mean that a prior legislature was determining the rules of the present one - a constitutional no-no (as Tribe has forcefully argued). So someone - Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc. - should demand normal rules (which includes the filibuster). That creates a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors, if they had not already done so.

>The main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission - either from a vote of the joint session or from the Court. Let the other side challenge his actions in court, where Tribe (who in 2001 conceded the President of the Senate might be in charge of counting the votes) and others who would press a lawsuit would have their past position -- that these are non-justiciable political questions - thrown back at them, to get the lawsuit dismissed. The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter. We should take all of our actions with that in mind.

  
Notice how Eastman is writing ""howls, of course, from the Democrats"".  He's not saying that the GOP would have any issue with this criminal conspiracy.  After all, Trump is still the candidate after doing all this.

So what happens should JD Vance be less principled than Mike Pence?  Wouldn't that have been the very first question Trump asked him, if he would be willing to do what Mike Pence wasn't?

To change my view, I'd need to think that such an action would cross a line, I'd need some indication that the GOP or his base wants to reign Trump in and curtail his most criminal efforts.  That the rank and file could care, that SOME level of checks and balances still apply given they've already excused this conspiracy once and have nominated him for presidency.

When would the GOP stand up?  If Trump decides he wants to hand the presidency over to his kids, what's to stop Vance from declaring he has a fake elector document written in crayon, thus the votes from California and New York can't be counted?  Hell, what's to stop Vance, should he be the nominee, to do the same for himself?

Who would rise up given they have done this once before and the electorate has forgave him?

What guarantee is there that these actions are actually unacceptable given they have been accepted?"

I'm not going to debate about the importance of a vote in local or state elections. 


I think there may be an exception or two, but virtually every state in the US awards all delegates based on a quorum of votes. The candidate that gets 50% of all votes + 1 wins. Once this quorum is reached, the winning candidate gets all the delegates. At that point, everyone else's vote might as well go right into the dumpster. Whether you vote for or against the winning candidate after a quorum of total voters including you is reached, all you are doing is standing in a line to change a popular vote count on the Wikipedia page for the election. Politically, it achieves nothing. 

The only counter I could see to this argument is that if everyone thought like this, and nobody voted in my state, then I could vote myself and determine who gets all our state delegates. But we don't live in a hypothetical world, we live in the real world. And in the real world, it will be a cold day in hell before Democrats in states like Illinois, California, and New York struggle to get a quorum. You could say the same for Republicans and many staunch red states. So the reality is that for any one person in one of these states, casting a vote for president is a waste of time. And most Americans live in states like these. 

People want to blame voters for ""not turning out,"" and insist it's our duty to go vote, but ignore the fact that candidates that lose the popular vote by millions can still win the presidential election, specifically because a lot of our votes don't count. You might as well ask people to go lobby our representative voters in swing states rather than ask them to vote directly, because if you could convince just one person in a swing state to vote your way, that would be a more effective political action than casting your own vote. And if you convince no one, then you've achieved just as much as you would've if you spent the day voting. "

I almost never encounter anyone who smells that bad, and when I do, I don't care. Someone having a little bit of body odor after an active day is completely acceptable, and should not be shamed in the way it often is.

It doesn't have to be humanity, just some life with human-level or higher intellect and consciousness. I'll list out some common ones and why I don't think they're good Filters.

Artificial Intelligence - This is the most worrisome filter for me. My reasoning is that if AI destroys humanity, this is just replacing humanity with a more intelligent and more aggressive species that will take to the stars in our place. Of course, it's a possibility that this AI has solely destructive intentions, but even then, it would have a secondary goal of self-preservation. Eventually, the Earth and Sun will die, so it has no choice but to expand outward. The worst-case scenario in my opinion is if this destructive AI is not sapient but still smart enough to destroy sapient life. So in this regard, ASI isn't as much of a concern as dumb, militant AGI.

Bioweapons - I think it would be very difficult to wipe out all of humanity with an engineered virus, since you will inevitably have people in remote locations who survive or are immune. Even if all of humanity is eliminated, Earth has a billion years left to support life and plenty of our precursor species running around. Primates evolved 55-90 million years ago, hominids evolved 6 million years ago, and homo sapiens evolved \~300,000 years ago. Given a billion years, I don't see a reason why evolution wouldn't bring about human-level intelligent species again, who would rerun through the stages of human history, eventually maybe finding humanity's ruins and stored digital knowledge.

Climate Change - This will slow us down, not stop us entirely. I'm not denying that millions, maybe even billions, will be affected by effects on agriculture, but I don't see this leading to the extinction of technological civilization. Humans are just too adaptable.

Nuclear War - Same reasoning as climate change, this will slow us down, not stop us entirely. Humanity can rebuild even if just a few million people survive a nuclear war."

They all seem to advocate for a theocracy in which everyone will worship the Christian God and live a Christian lifestyle in a very Islamic way. First, the justice system they wish to establish in a euro-centric Christian theocracy falls more in line with Islamic practices established in Africa and the Middle East in nations rooted in Islamic beliefs and practices, I have seen these Christian Theocrats advocate for strict punishment and even execution and physical chastisement in order to enforce a law-abiding and Christian state. Secondly, the ""return to tradition"" they wish to enact seems parallel to the conditions of nations who currently have strong commitment towards Islamic practices and beliefs. This may serve as more of a warning towards religious extremism in general, but I'd figure I'd bring it up. These far-righters seem to romanticize a time in Europe in which Fuedalism reigned supreme, and the church reigned supreme as a monolith that was responsible as not just a religious authority but as a political, and cultural authority. Because of this, Europeans were unfreed, unhealthy, illiterate, and impoverished. Very similar to the unfortunate conditions of people currently living in nations whose political systems are currently controlled by Islamic practices.

1,2024-07-16,CMV: What Cooperative Lawmaking Would Look Like,u/codepeach_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e54jnn/cmv_what_cooperative_lawmaking_would_look_like/,changemyview,"Source: [https://www.thegnosi.com/p/what-cooperative-lawmaking-would](https://www.thegnosi.com/p/what-cooperative-lawmaking-would)



Americans are raised to think of our political system in idealistic terms. Our political mythology imbues us with the idea that policymakers from either party convene to work together on behalf of “the people.” And, although the process features vigorous debate and deal-making, officials eventually manage to sufficiently push aside their differences to forge compromises that collectively serve Americans, at least on the most vital issues.

But, that would presuppose that officeholders are in government to work collaboratively with all of their colleagues. In actuality, lawmakers are there to work with some of the other lawmakers to advance an agenda that some of the voters sent them there to advance. Meanwhile, opposing lawmakers, cheered on by their voters, do everything they can to block that agenda.

Such is the way of things in America, which, like every other free nation, has a political system based on competition. Those countries have something else in common with the U.S.: they are getting democracy wrong.

In a cooperative political system, all policymakers would work together to promote an agenda that almost everyone would want to advance. Officials would transcend their ideological disagreements to devise policies that would improve life for everybody.

(Seriously, doesn’t this sound much better than the way we do things now?)



**What it entails?**

Identify the stakeholders in each policy area One purpose of establishing premises to analyze issues is to affirm that impacted people or groups are legitimate stakeholders. Stakeholders, as AWDHEO has previously defined the term, are any groups or individuals who are affected by policy issues.

So, for affirmative action, stakeholders could include eligible beneficiaries of affirmative action, those who aren’t covered by affirmative action and the schools, workplaces and programs whose operations are affected by affirmative action policies.

Identify stakeholders’ concerns Once a list of stakeholders has been compiled, the next step is to figure out what each group cares about. Groups that benefit from affirmative action obviously want to preserve the opportunities that they receive through the policy, while excluded groups want equal access to these opportunities. Meanwhile, the schools, workplaces and programs that are affected by affirmative action provisions are most concerned about being able to carry out their missions, while meeting the established requirements.

Seek solutions not victories If the victory-driven, partisan aspect was taken out of policymaking, it would open the complete array of possible solutions to affirmative action, as well as every other issue. If the offered policy responses weren’t defined as liberal/Democratic or conservative/Republican, then people wouldn’t automatically dismiss certain ideas simply because of their source.

Obviously, this would be easier said than done, as we have been conditioned through our whole lives to believe that the object of politics is to beat the other side. But, there are strategies lawmakers could use that would facilitate the passage of solutions-oriented policies:

Eliminate flashpoints for conflict Sometimes, aggravating circumstances make achieving resolution between opposing sides nearly impossible. However, if these items are removed, compromise becomes more attainable.

In the case of affirmative action, the exacerbating factors are the possibilities that each side dreads most. For supporters, it’s the prospect of affirmative action just suddenly being gone, in an instant. For opponents, it’s the idea of it becoming an ever-expanding, eternal fixture in American law and life.

To create a climate that’s conducive to cooperation and compromise, policymakers should take both of these outcomes off the table. Proposals that would immediately or rapidly dismantle affirmative action programs should be non-starters. But, the same is true for approaches that would treat such programs as sacred cows that can never be touched.

Make recognition of the fundamental rights of stakeholders the starting point for making policy When people’s basic liberties are under threat, they become consumed with rage, which causes them to shut down. However, if their bedrock freedoms are assured, they will become more accepting of compromises that relate to those freedoms.

When it comes to affirmative action, the essential right that should be guaranteed to both those who are and aren’t served by it should be the same: the chance to vie for educational, professional and other opportunities on a level playing field. There may be disagreements about what constitutes that condition, but the right of everyone to compete on an even surface must be universally affirmed.

Validate the concerns of stakeholders Officials’ ultimate policy response to issues should take into account the concerns of everyone affected by those issues. More than that, it should legitimate the fact that their cares matter.

This doesn’t translate to all stakeholders getting exactly what they want. Cooperative policymaking doesn’t mean splitting policy spoils evenly among factions. The goal is to devise optimal policy solutions in the holistic sense. Some stakeholders might not get exactly what they’re seeking, but their underlying needs could be met though alternate proposals. Creative policymaking could also harmonize the interests of disparate stakeholders. And, sometimes, certain stakeholders may have to accept that, while their cares are indeed valid, the concerns of other stakeholders outweigh them.

But, whatever policy resolutions would emerge concerning affirmative action or any other matter, it’s plain that that the cooperative process allows unprecedented exploration into the complexity of policy issues. Under the standard, competitive model, partisans take multidimensional issues and reduce them to two sides: good and bad. And they classify each side’s stakeholders the same way.

  
**TLDR:**

The current political climate in the United States could benefit greatly from a shift towards cooperative policymaking. By acknowledging and addressing the concerns of all stakeholders, setting aside partisan victories, and focusing on inclusive solutions, we can move closer to a political system that truly serves the interests of all Americans. Let’s start a dialogue on how we can implement these principles in our current political landscape.



What are your thoughts on this perspective? Could a cooperative approach improve policymaking in the United States, especially on contentious issues like affirmative action?"

Unlike Biden and his administration, who in my opinion have been involved in escalating conflicts, Trump has a track record of de-escalation. For instance, Trump was the first sitting U.S. president to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, a move that significantly reduced tensions in the region. In contrast, Biden has not achieved any comparable diplomatic successes.

During Trump’s presidency, there were no new wars initiated by the U.S., and his administration focused on withdrawing troops from prolonged conflicts. This contrasts with the current administration’s approach, which seems to be more interventionist. Trump’s direct and unconventional negotiation style could be advantageous in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. His relationship with Putin, while controversial, might facilitate a diplomatic solution that Biden’s administration seems unable to achieve.

Furthermore, the extreme left has been polarizing American politics, often labeling the right as extremists. As an immigrant, I find this troubling. Trump, despite the media portrayal, is not against legal immigration. He advocates for policies that prioritize the security and prosperity of America without resorting to racism. The left’s justification of extreme measures, in my view, is not conducive to the country’s wellbeing.

In conclusion, Trump’s approach to foreign policy and his negotiation skills make him a candidate who could potentially bring about a more peaceful global environment. His re-election could lead to a resolution of ongoing conflicts and reduce the polarization within the United States.

- Political violence has no place in society.

Now for my view.

I generally reserve forming an opinion until all the data is gathered and information is available, however based on what’s known so far, this is what I believe will be the most likely concluded motive.

Crooks was a loner, didn’t have friends, was apparently bullied often, wasn’t diagnosed with severe mental illness (not that I’ve seen so far anyway), his political affiliation seems inconsistent - certainly not enough to draw off of, and no current evidence of extremism on either side.

But we do know he didn’t make the rifle team in high school, not even the JV team - which we can infer  he was very likely bullied over. He also did spend time on the local range after high school, and him wearing a Demolition Ranch shirt indicates he spent some effort learning and training with weapons. 

I think, in a twisted way, he did this as an attempt to “get back” at, or “prove wrong” the people who bullied him over not making the rifle team and thought this would “show them” that he was a good shot.

Obviously, uncovering new information would change my mind, but based on what we know today, I think this is the basis for his motivation."

Means another war in the middle East which nobody wants. Iran may even go ahead and fast track nuclear weapons development, and strike first. Who would blame them, if they see war is imminent.

In short, it makes US an untrustworthy ally, whose words are only valid for maybe 4 years. Say what you will about China or Iran, but at least they have consistent foreign policy frameworks that has enabled great geopolitical success in their spheres of influence. ie. Iranian proxies in the middle East, Chinese stranglehold in resources and infrastructure in the developing world.

Not advocating for dictatorship, but foreign policy cycles need to be longer than 4 years, else the geopolitical standing / national security of the US will be in trouble.

0,2024-07-16,CMV: A Trump Win Will Damage the GOP,u/its-Jai,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e587uv/cmv_a_trump_win_will_damage_the_gop/,changemyview,"With one eye looking down on 2024 and another eye looking toward 2028, I believe a Trump win will permanently damage the GOP. 

First, Trump's economic policy hinges on tariffs, to the extent that he has suggested replacing income tax with tariffs instead. Such a policy would return the United States' tax regime to before 1913, but suppose Trump only plans to raise tariffs on all imports by 10%, it will at bottom work as a price hike on consumers and producers enmeshed in the global supply chain (the very people who happen to be employers for so many). Such a plan would heat up inflation and only serve domestic manufacturers and their workers. Let us not forget that Trump and Vance plan to weaken the US dollar to support domestic manufacturers as well. Of course, their tariff plan will cause a trade war to break out, suppressing exports regardless.

Second, Project 2025 will empower a syncophantic bureaucracy whose interests grind against most Americans. Trump in the previous weeks has tried to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation's wet dream, but he has mentioned in rallies that he has Article II, suggesting he favors a maximalist presidency whose civil service is obedient to one man. A captured executive branch will undermine and may even outright destroy the independence and fairness of various institutions. One can imagine the possibility of a major corruption scandal in not only the executive branch but also in the right-wing judiciary Donald Trump made possible after the Supreme Court overturned the Chevron decision, which  undermines federal regulators as well as the separation of powers. Wrinkling what should be a plain-sheet rule of law.  

Third, the recent ruling in the surreally titled Trump v. United States dangerously crowns the President as king, a slap to the Founding Fathers. Presidential Immunity allows Trump to kill and torture any American under official orders and possibly even invoke the Insurrection Riot to tamp down the riotous flames that will inevitably arise. Supporters of Palestine will be maimed and parents will be horrified. The impunity and disregard to rights foreigners have known will be a new fear Americans must learn. Conspiracies will swirl in the coming reign of hushed whispers feeding a dark psyche of angst and paranoia. Blue-state and -city leaders will resist, but wart-ridden violence will surface from the cracks. I fully expect a Trump win will precipitate a constitutional crisis -- an outcome his protege Vance wants, as the man admires French President Charles de Gaulle: the architect of a new French constitution which expanded the President's powers. 

A Trump win will radicalize a generation and disenchant Americans craving a return to normalcy. Trump's economic policies will make 2022's inflation tame in comparison, and he will severly undermine the rule of law. The GOP, the party of law and order, will be nothing but bones after Trump and his carrion cronies have picked its flesh. "

Not a huge upset, but enough to show that that the general consensus was wrong.

Now come 2024, I see the same rhetoric. Granted a presidential election is different than a general election, but we’re still looking at polls as a way of predicting the outcome of the election. Every day, it’s “Bidens up in this poll, maybe he’ll pull through?” Then the next is “Trump is up, he’s definitely gonna win.” 

Polls are not good at helping figure out the election. What we see online and in the news will not help either. It seems like less and less people are engaging with these things and the last election proves it. "

0,2024-07-17,CMV: Adolf Hitler was influenced by esoteric groups and hidden forces. ,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5ai8x/cmv_adolf_hitler_was_influenced_by_esoteric/,changemyview,"Hitler, his fascism, his entire movement, and his frantic attempts to take action have all been widely discussed. However, nobody is aware that there is something concealed behind. Hitler served only as a tool for other powers. There are now hints that he was not the drama's true actor. He was employed as a tool, nothing more. There was someone else following him; there were other forces at work. One of the oldest and most ancient symbols of a certain school of adepts is the swastika, which is the symbol of Adolf Hitler's party.

The Jains are among the oldest communities in India. Their symbol is the swastika, but it's not quite the same as Hitler's. Hitler had the swastika reversed. Hitler's swastika is anticlockwise; the Jain's is clockwise. This swastika turned anticlockwise is a destructive symbol. They looked for a symbol for three years straight, but a symbol is more than just a symbol. When a symbol is drawn from a more profound tradition, it becomes a connection. In order to find one of the Aryan race's oldest symbols—which allows for the contact of many hidden things—people were dispatched to Tibet.

It was decided to use the swastika, but reversed. Additionally, Adolf Hitler was persuaded that the symbol's order should be reversed by Karl Haushofer, the person who discovered it. Despite being confused, he was among those in contact with numerous esoteric groups.

He was looking for two things: first, a very old symbol; and second, a symbol that could also be created. This is why the swastika was selected and created in the opposite order. Events took on an entirely new form because it had never existed in this manner before.

And with this reverse symbol, anyone with access to esoteric knowledge knew that Hitler intended to destroy himself. This knowledge was known throughout the world. He would go insane and come into contact with suicidal forces.

Some secret schools provided Hitler's philosophy in its entirety. They employed him in the same way that theosophists and covert organisations intended to employ Krishnamurti.

Hitler maintained his winning streak, at least for a while. There was no defeat—he was just winning. It was amazing how he could win at anything and appeared to be unbeatable. But after a while, everything starts to backtrack. What caused this to occur?

Hitler was defeated by forces opposed to Nazism, but that is not how history actually happened. That was merely an external occurrence. Hitler was a tool of a secret society. This was one of the most desperate attempts, as despite centuries of work, the esoteric group was unable to provide the assistance that humanity so desperately needed. This was a last-ditch attempt to save humanity before it ends up destroying itself on this planet. Thus, they had attempted through saints, helpless individuals, and spiritually impoverished people. Through Adolf Hitler, they attempted to teach humanity a certain lesson and take over the entire world before it was destroyed.

However, Hitler also attained independence at the eleventh hour, much like Krishnamurti did. He started to fall. The historical miracle of warfare is this. It was an unprecedented occurrence. Hitler would not listen to any general's advice. He would strike or move, but he would not listen to any general's advice. He would act and move as he pleased, defying the counsel of all his trained individuals, and still prevail. There were ridiculous and ludicrous moves. Those were actions that no war-savvy person would have taken. Hitler, however, would conquer them and rule for three years.

Everyone in his immediate vicinity was aware that he was merely a tool for a more powerful force.

There was no way to explain this. Additionally, he wouldn't be conscious when he gave an order. This is a recent discovery that is now known. Every time he placed an order, he would be ecstatic. He would close his eyes, start to shake, start to sweat, and then his voice would sound entirely different. There would be another voice giving orders.

However, the day he started to fall, his own voice started to command. Ever since that moment, he had never experienced ecstasy. A portion of the functional contact was lost.

It is now widely felt by scholars studying Adolf Hitler and his life that the phenomenon was more than just political. The individual was more than just a crazy politician or political maniac because everything he did was wholly unpolitical, including his entire strategy.

And those who had remained with him felt that he was a split personality. He was so ordinary in his everyday life that it was unimaginable. He was an ordinary man, not the product of magic. But he had a completely different personality when he was possessed and taken over.

Who was in charge of this? This was being done by some esoteric group, and they were attempting something. Hitler lost all power upon his independence. He was just an ordinary man in his final days. Everything he did after this specific point, when he lost contact, worked against him. Everything he did prior to this was always advantageous to him.

It was orchestrated by the group, the nine of Ashoka. 

Their goal was to conquer the entire globe. When dealing with men, there's always a chance that you could start using force without realising it. You won't know that someone else is succeeding if you are successful. Your ego gets bolstered because you succeeded. There comes a point at which your ego becomes so strong that you are unaffected by anything. This has occurred countless times.

The main purpose of this esoteric group is to provide continuity in times of need. They may assist in numerous ways. The fact that Japan and Germany became friendly was no coincidence. It was a result of this nine-person group. This is the unspoken truth.

Since the esoteric group supporting Hitler was Buddhist, Japan, a Buddhist nation, might be persuaded to support Hitler. And when Hitler was winning, the entire East was ecstatic. Inside, the whole East was in Hitler's camp. It was an Eastern group that was working behind him.

Everything has a causal connection; nothing occurs by accident. When a teacher such as the Buddha appears, the main task of an esoteric organisation is to assist by acting as a middleman. Preserving knowledge after it has been acquired is another task performed by these esoteric organisations.

41,2024-07-17,CMV: Gacha Games are inherently bad game design,u/__R3v3nant__,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5cuxc/cmv_gacha_games_are_inherently_bad_game_design/,changemyview,"For those who don't know, Gacha games are games where you can spend in game currency (which often times can be bought with real money) in a system ehich gives you an *random* chance of getting certain items or characters.

I believe that this is inherently bad game design

The first problem I have is this is very similar to lootboxes and gambling, which hijack the reward centres of the brain to cause addiction, addiction should never be part of a game. This can cause some people to spend exorbitant amounts of money, sometimes putting them in debt.

Another problem that arises is that it can cause people to not get rewarded for hard work. Usually in a game if you put a lot of work in you will get compensated with rewards from the game, Gacha games throw it out the window since it is random, you can not get what you want.

I used to play a game called battle cats which had a Gacha system. During a collab\* (which is an event which comes around fairly rarely, and this collab had a chance of never coming back) I had previously grinded and saved around $130 of catfood (the games currency) to spend on this collab to get 2 specific ubers\*\* (the game worked by having different rarietes of cats: rares, super rares, uber rares and legen rares). I spent nearly all my catfood and *didn't* get the ubers I wanted. I spent nearly $100 worth of cat food and got nothing of note from it.

The final and probably worst problem is how Gacha can screw with the games balance. Some characters in gacha games can be significantly more powerful than others which creates an incredibly unbalanced experience. In battle cats there's 2 ubers\*\*\* which are notorious for nuking the games difficulty and deleting any sort of balance the game had. I had both and I managed to cruise through a lot of the game by just using those two and a lot of other people have similar experiences. The inverse can also apply. In battle cats certain rares and super rares\*\*\*\* are basically required for progression so there's horror stories of people not getting them and suffering though many parts of the game. This happens as rares and super rares are fairly accessible so the developers have to balance as if they are there, leaving those without them in the dust

For any battle cats players reading:

\*It was the fate collab

\*\*Sakura and Saber

\*\*\*Dasli and Phono, although it is to be noted that there are many other ubers that are broken like that

\*\*\*\*Where do I start:

* Ramen is pretty much required for angels
* Cyperpunk is basically required on some of the hardest stages in the game
* Octo is basically required in some wave stages
* Can can is so busted the game basically expects you to have it and his talents

Ideology was the most fearsome weapon of USSR, not tanks. And to negate that weapon, Europe developed more humane version of socialism. I dare say it contributed much more to the loss of the soviets in the cold war.

Now back to Trump. While he is a billionaire and a friend of billionaires, he appeals to poor and white people, especially men. There is no protection of the ""privileged classes"", their suffering is ignored. Young women outlearn and outearn young men, outpace them in practically every aspect of life. While ideologues of pyramid of oppression/intersectionality dominate academia and insist that men/white are privileged, because some rich old farts are mostly white men.

Girls outperform boys in education, rate of graduates is closing to 4 to 6. When women are lacking in STEM, a lot of fuss and money goes into boosting women participating, including creation of special gender based programs. But nothing for boys who underperform in basically any other aspect.

There is evidence, that underpeformance of boys is at least partially due to teacher's bias against boys:

406,2024-07-17,CMV: Standard sheet music is an unintuitive mess that has killed countless people's interest in learning music.,u/KimonoThief,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5e06p/cmv_standard_sheet_music_is_an_unintuitive_mess/,changemyview,"As some background, I've been making music as a hobbyist for over 20 years in DAWs (mostly FL Studio).  A few weeks ago I began learning piano.  The instrument itself is wonderful.  I love the way it sounds.  I love that you can play chords with one hand and melodies with the other.  Practicing scales is fun.  Practicing chords is fun.

Learning to read sheet music is.... A total nightmare.  You shouldn't have to decipher the Rosetta Stone to figure out which note you're supposed to play, but this is what sheet music asks you to do.  Sheet music doesn't reflect the actual physical layout of a piano whatsoever.  They've decided to map the C Major scale (a 2-2-1-2-2-2-1 pattern) onto a series of alternating (1-1-1-1-1) lines and spaces, which is a totally baffling decision that leads to all sorts of insane notation difficulties.  We need to go through a ridiculous process to figure out what note a symbol on the staff is representing.  Is it a treble clef or a bass clef? OK, bass clef, so now I have to say All Cats Eat Grass... Oh wait, my mnemonic device doesn't extend three lines below the staff where this note is, so now I actually have to count the notes as I move down.  Oh wait, the key signature has four sharps, which is... checks Google... E Major.  Which means this note needs to be sharp.... It can legitimately take over a minute just to figure out what one single note is.  And that's not even getting into the ridiculous way that rhythm is notated, with measures of differing physical widths and all sorts of weird symbols to denote things that would've been obvious if you had just placed them on an equally spaced grid.

I genuinely think this miserable, arcane system has caused many otherwise potentially talented musicians to just give up.  And before you go saying ""Well they couldn't have been great musicians if they couldn't learn sheet music"", I heartily disagree.  Nothing about learning sheet music has anything to do with actual music... It's a terrible exercise in rote memorization and deciphering somebody's ridiculous secret code.

As for alternatives, I've tried reading two other systems that seem to be just completely superior to sheet music in every way.  The first is the hooktheory website.  Now this is a sensible way to notate music.  It gives you the key of the song (I don't need to memorize that four sharps means E Major).  The songs are notated in a piano-roll like format, where the notes are color-coded according to their position in the scale and note names are shown on the left side.  The chords are numbered and named below the melody, and also color coded.  Accidentals are shown on the lines between notes and color coded with stripes of the note above and below.

But even better than that is Klavarskribo.  This is a notation that just lays out the piano on the page.  White notes are shown as white.  Black notes are shown as black.  Measures are equally spaced out and you can just look at the spacing to know when to play things.  I legitimately was able to just start playing songs of any key, spanning all over the piano, no problem whatsoever, in Klavarskribo notation because it's just an intuitive format that matches the piano perfectly.  Weeks of sheet music study, 2 minutes of Klavarskribo study and I'm already better in the latter.  That speaks volumes.

So yeah, sheet music is a mess and there are better alternatives.  I think it's important because again, people are being pushed away from learning music by this awful system.  Things that won't change my view:

* ""I learned it! Many people have learned it! Therefore it's fine!"" No, just because you learned it doesn't mean it's a sensible system or that it hasn't turned many others away from music.  

* ""Well it's everywhere now so you'll just have to get used to it!"" Yeah I know, that's why I'm still learning it.  Doesn't mean it's not an unintuitive mess.  And it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to incorporate other alternatives, especially for beginners to learn.

The one argument I've heard that might make sense is the compactness of sheet music.  But I haven't actually seen any data showing how much more compact it is (or even if it is at all) than other systems."

- Faith: You need a lot of faith, that your god will answer or be capable to accept the true god or god accepts your sacrifice.

- Selflessness: You wouldn't do it for yourself. You would do it for all other people, that have been mislead since birth and aren't able to escape the clutches of a false religion, that indoctrinates them.

In the ""minuscule"" case god doesn't answer there is the conclusion that god doesn't care what we believe in or that there is no god and we all can be atheist together.

Counter arguments I am expecting and answers:

1.  You are insane. --- Yes

2.  My holy text is the correct text and I have it since birth, because I'm special. --- You are a narcissist

3. I found my holy text after doing excessive research. --- Great that will make the sacrifice bigger.

4. Nobody will do that. --- I'm hoping for a miracle, that everyone will see my logical argument and agree with me. 

5. I wouldn't do that. --- Is because you lack in the 3 named virtues of a believer?

6. People could recreate their false religion from memory. --- Yeah I got nothing for that. I just hope everyone is reasonable at accepts the result after the sacrifice.

7. Destroying a holy text is heresy. --- You will prove that you trust your god more than paper. It's not heresy as a sacrifice. Also not as much as killing other people for your believe. You can make your text again, but not people and if you're right you will just receive the same text again. 

I hope I made my argument for a way to determine the correct religion. Rather than waiting for death or apocalypses, discussion that go in circles or fighting each other until only the ""true"" religion survives."

1. How could a president of the USA disrupt and crush the democratic foundations of the USA and turn it into an authoritarian state? Surely he can’t just decide to do it. Give me the roadmap, in detail. 

2. Why and how is there a risk of the roadmap becoming reality, so much so that some of you feel confident enough to say that democracy is at stake?

.

I've always found it really weird how outwardly DISGUSTING current popular songs are. And yet they're everywhere in the radio! People show songs that actually say 'sex' and 'dick', among other things, to KIDS.

.

I don't think being so sex-crazed you make a ""song"" like WAP should be encouraged. They're NSFW lmao.

You obviously wouldn't blast porn in a public street or project it onto a building. And if you did, you'd be severely punished by the law. These nasty lyrics should work much the same way; marginalize them like we do porn.

.

I mean, don't get me wrong, some of them are bops — the instrumentals are great. But the lyrics are still there and as such, one should be listening to them privately or near people who, you know, actually have consented to listening to that stuff?  
I'm sick and tired of having those blasted into my ears in supermarkets and malls, and appalled that my little sister's been singing those before she could even understand what it mean.

The worst part is that these lyrics normalize some wild shit too like cuckoldry, drugs and overall just very, very, VERY irresponsible behavior. It's about time people realize that it doesn't matter if you're 'not paying attention' to the lyrics."

He is a vile disgusting human being. It will be because of his policies. There's a pervasive notion among Democrats that Trump supporters are irrational or even lunatics, but that misses a crucial point: many Americans find Trump's policies appealing.

There's a dismissiveness from the Democratic side that borders on dehumanizing Trump supporters, as if they are less than human for their political choices. This is especially true for the rural poor, who have felt neglected for years. Despite being in power, I don't think the Biden administration has made significant strides in addressing their issues.

Moreover, the Democrats often fail to communicate what their policies are effectively. It feels like they are more focused on retaining power rather than offering concrete solutions. This lack of clear messaging and tangible policies makes it easier for Trump’s straightforward, if controversial, policies to resonate with a significant portion of the population.

So, if Trump does win, it won't be because of his antics or personality quirks. It will be because his policies speak to a segment of Americans who feel overlooked and unheard. "
200,2024-07-17,CMV: what a teacher wears DOES matter,u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5j0hj/cmv_what_a_teacher_wears_does_matter/,changemyview,"Saw a post on another sub about this but didn't see any good counterpoints. Growing up I recall that all my teachers dressed business casual at the least. Even in high school I had a teacher which I later found out was only about 6 years older than a senior but presented himself as much older in class by what he wore. The only time you'd see a teacher in casual clothes was at special events and even then it would still be modest. But now it seems that a lot of teachers feel they can dress however in the classroom. I've seen teachers who dress almost exactly like students, or wear clothes that intentionally show off their curves. I find it creepy and off putting that they're placing looking cute over looking professional and I think it contributes to inappropriate relationships.

especially for high schoolers, a young teachers culture is likely not too far off from theirs. Slang might be different but they probably watch the same shows, follow the same pop culture, and listen to the same music. It seems like kids are getting involved in politics and activism at a younger age as well meaning there's becoming less and less which separates a teacher from a student on a social level. Add to it that these teachers spend a lot of time with these students, probably the majority of their week and get to know them pretty well it's easy to see how what was once a mentorship relationship can cross the line and become a inappropriate one. 

I feel that one of the major things which separate that are the clothes. When you wear business casual you are presenting authority both to yourself and to the students. It's an outward expression that you understand your role and take it serious. On the other hand if you wear inappropriate clothes you're presenting yourself as a peer to the student and showing that the role isn't necessarily your priority and students see that.

I've seen some terrible and unconvincing arguments for this which I won't dismiss outright here because maybe you can argumet it better here but the only point I won't respond to is anything which basically says ""let people wear what they want"". "

Reddit is the digital playground for liberals and progressives, while FOX News is the conservative stronghold.

Starting with Reddit, the upvote system amplifies the loudest liberal voices. Subs like r/politics, r/news, and r/worldnews are dominated by left-leaning perspectives. Pew Research shows 71% of Reddit users lean Democratic, creating a liberal echo chamber. Try posting a conservative opinion in r/politics and watch it get downvoted into oblivion.

On the flip side, FOX News is the conservative mothership. They skew everything right, with the Media Research Center finding they negatively covered Biden’s campaign 61% of the time while giving Trump positive coverage 52% of the time during the 2020 election. They’re not about balanced reporting; they’re pushing a right-wing agenda.

Reddit’s algorithms and user base ensure liberal content gets the most traction. A PLOS ONE study showed how the upvote system reinforces popular opinions and silences minority viewpoints. It’s a digital mob mentality where the loudest voices dominate.

FOX News uses editorial control to frame stories to fit their conservative narrative. Their COVID-19 coverage, for example, downplayed the virus and pushed anti-mask rhetoric. The University of Chicago found areas with high FOX viewership had worse compliance with social distancing early in the pandemic, showing their influence on behavior through biased reporting.

Both platforms claim to serve their audiences but are really shaping opinions by reinforcing existing beliefs. Reddit users step into a liberal echo chamber, while FOX viewers tune in for right-wing reassurance. Sure, Reddit has subreddits like r/Conservative, but they’re dwarfed by left-leaning subs. And FOX might feature a token liberal commentator, but the overall slant remains staunchly conservative.

So, Reddit is to the left what FOX News is to the right. Both are powerful echo chambers deepening the divide by feeding audiences what they want to hear, ensuring no one has to confront uncomfortable truths or opposing viewpoints. Welcome to the polarized media landscape, folks."

Biden would have aged out and there would have been a real primary right now for an actual young successor to lead the party. 

Trump would have served his two terms and would be ineligible to run now.

Before the 2020 election Biden has said that he is a transitional candidate and now would be the perfect time to, France and Britain called for snap elections recently and they worked out, in fact Democrats already said they would not be holding a full DNC nomination period to push forward Biden, and this all feels very condescending.

I am 30M in the United States. After many years of pondering the issue of women and men dynamics in this country I have come to the conclusion that technology is largely to blame. Why is technology significant and why does prostitution need to be legalized? 

1. Technology created more imbalance in a dating game that was already imbalanced. Men have always pursued and women have always had options. They were previously limited to areas they frequented in real life but now that everything is connected their options have expanded tremendously. As a result, all women have to do is sit back in the comfort of their home, sift through the dozens of messages they get each day and choose the top 10 or 20% while those who are less attractive are basically ignored. 

2. Due to a large percentage of men being excluded in regards to dating/sex they have two options, be sexually frustrated or seek out illegal means of obtaining sex. There are many women who have capitalized on this and in my opinion this is the biggest money grab in history. The rate at which men in the United States are being financially exploited by greedy women is astounding. Charging hundreds of dollars to simply engage in an act that they were biologically designed for. Taking a day or multiple days worth of a man’s income for an hour or less of “sex work”. Women are not hardwired to sympathize with grown men, they are hardwired to obtain what they can. 

3. I believe prostitution needs to be legalized in order to create a more fair society. Right now men are being shafted hard due to the greed of women. But not only does prostitution need to be legalized but the prices for service need to also be reduced significantly. I’d estimate the current rates on average are about $200 an hour. It should be more like $50 an hour, part of it should be taxed as well. 

4. I already know there’s going to be people complaining about “women’s value”, but what about men’s value? Frankly I do not buy for a moment that the current rates are justifiable. Women simply see a demand and are exploiting it. If you were to legalize prostitution and reduce a woman’s income as a result I am willing to bet that there would be no shortage of women who would continue doing “sex work” because they could not bare working a regular job. 

5. Men’s mental health has rapidly declined, women are not going to change to accommodate us. Why are most mass shooters unattractive men? Elliot Roger’s is a good example, most are not as vocal as he was but I’m certain that if men lived in a world where they could actually receive care and affection as easily as women there would be much less of these incidents. 

Convince me that I am wrong about this.

Black is the more prominent of the members.  A few days ago, during a ""make a wish"" segment at a concert, Gass said his wish was something to the effect of ""that the shooter doesn't miss next time"".

Black went on to cancel the rest of the tour, also stating that future creative plans are now on hold.  Gass issued an apology - not a ""sorry if you were offended"" type, but an outright ""what I said was wrong"" kind.  He knew what he said was inexcusable.  

I do not understand peoples' reaction to this.

*""Oh, so now they're holding satirical comedians to a higher standard that political candidates!""*  Huh?  Who's ""they""?  Black is an outspoken liberal, so he's never been supportive of Trump and similar people.  He's holding his bandmate to the same standards he's held others to, including politicians.  

*""This must be that cancel culture that Republicans 'don't believe in'!""*  Again, huh?  Jack Black himself is the one who pulled the plug.  The promoter didn't cancel the tour.  The venues weren't canceling shows.  The leader of the freaking band made the decision.  

*""What a way to treat your friend.""*  Still confused here.  Ever since 2016, people on my side of the political spectrum (left-leaning) have been quite vocal about the notion that you can, and should, disavow your own freaking family if they say outrageously toxic things.

In order to do that, he has to:

1. Find a way to remove thousands, potentially millions, of people in unappointed government positions
2. Find an equal number of loyalists willing to move to DC and take low-level government pay
3. Find a way to clear them all for government work in a smooth transition between them and the people they've replaced.

Even if he does all of that, he would still need the Senate, the House, and the Federal courts to get most of the Project 2025 agenda done. For example: banning pornography. Trump can't even Clarence Thomas to support that (he's a hardline First Amendment defender, and has been accused of having porn habit in the past). I'm not sure if Trump really supports that himself (he's married to a former nude model, and has appeared on a Playboy cover that he once had framed in his office). It's never going to happen. That's just one policy on the agenda. The rest are equally unlikely.

I believe that we shouldn't be ashamed of our privileges. Instead, we should view them as personal assets and use them to our advantage. I know this might ruffle some feathers, but hear me out.

In my experience, most people, especially in developed countries like the US, have some form of privilege. It's not black and white; it's more like a spectrum. Your privilege might come from your gender, race, social class, or a million other things. And here's the kicker - what's a disadvantage in one situation might be an advantage in another.

Take me, for example. I grew up in what you'd call an upper-middle-class family. My mom had a good income, which gave me opportunities that some of my friends didn't have. I started to see my background as a tool I could use. This shift in perspective changed everything for me. I began to think of all my advantages - big and small - as personal assets. It's like having a toolbox, and each privilege is a different tool you can use to build the life you want.

Now, I'm not saying we should ignore inequality or the struggles of others. That's not it at all. What I am saying is that feeling ashamed about your advantages doesn't really help anyone. In fact, it might hold you back from doing something great that could benefit others too.

Let me share a personal story. When I was trying to break into my career, I made a decision that felt embarrassing at the time. I moved back into my mom's basement from age 20 to 25. It wasn't glamorous, and yeah, I felt a bit ashamed. But you know what? It allowed me to pursue my dreams without worrying about rent. In the end, it paid off. I broke into the tech industry and landed a high-paying job.

Looking back, I realize that living in my mom's basement was a form of privilege. Not everyone has that option. But instead of feeling ashamed about it, I used it to my advantage. And that's really the core of what I'm trying to say here.

I think we'd all be better off if we stopped feeling ashamed of our advantages and started thinking about how we can use them effectively. It's not about exploiting your privilege at the expense of others. It's about recognizing what you have and using it wisely.

Of course, this comes with some caveats. If you're in a position of power that affects lots of people, you need to be more careful about how you use your advantages. And obviously, using your privilege for illegal or immoral things is a big no-no. It's all about finding the right balance and using your assets ethically.

I know this perspective might not sit well with everyone, and that's okay. It's just my opinion, based on my experiences. I could be wrong, and I'm open to other viewpoints. But I can't help feeling that this might be a more productive way of looking at things.

So that's my take. What do you think? Am I onto something, or am I way off base? I'd be interested to hear other perspectives on this."

Our reasoning up until now has been that between graduate school, beginning our careers, and homeownership, we decided that it was not the phase of life to have children. 

Now, we are revisiting the conversation, and I have the self-awareness to recognize that *I just don’t want to have kids.* Digging deeper, I realize that what’s holding me back is that I can’t see past the high costs involved (financially, emotionally, not to mention diapers), and a host of other drawbacks that I would happily discuss in the comments. 

I also understand that this is a lack of maturity on my part, and possibly a failure to exhibit strength of character. Which is why I am interested in a shift in perspective - almost unanimously people say having children is worth these costs, and that’s a perspective I cannot adopt without taking the plunge on faith. 

Other context for foreseeable questions: My wife and I are in our late twenties, both gainfully employed, we are both Christians and have had many conversations about this. I’m in a crazy phase of my career, she’s self-employed, and we are both committed to one another’s well-being. Also our best friends are currently pregnant. "

**Some background info:

Great Man Theory of history- Exceptional individuals throughout human history have taken upon themselves to bend the arc of history in their favor.

Social Forces Theory of History- The real drivers of history have always been long term cultural, demographic, economic, and technological trends.
______________________


Leaders who have aspired to be great men in their respective countries have merely been a product of the times. One man or woman simply  cannot be the driver of history. Long terms trends, in terms of culture, demographics, economics, technology, political movements, language and even climate have done more to bend the arc of human history than one individual. 

Without the centuries of civilian complacency, corruption of political elites, and lack of funds spent on domestic priorities, perhaps the Roman Empire would have never fell?  

Without the long term lack of democratic traditions that were present long before the Weimar Republic, Hitler and his inner circle would never have never successfully installed a fascist totalitarian government. 


Without the rising tide of online misinformation via high speed internet and smartphones during the late 2000s through mid 2010s and  unchecked excesses of 40+ year long crony Neoliberal economic system, Trump would have never successfully won over economically discontent swing voters in the Rust Belt. 

And so, no turning point of history has ever been able to have been achieved by a single person. Major change through the efforts of the populace fighting for whatever political movements were prevalent in their times, not because  some great leader did all the work themselves to make it happen. 

I'm open to learning about ways either theory has been more true than the other in various cases throughout history, but for now, I lean more towards the ""Social Forces theory"".

Children innately know that most punishment is not for their own benefit but for the benefit of the adults around them who lack the time, energy, skill set, or self restraint to choose otherwise. 

This early childhood experience of gaslighting puts children on a path to becoming paranoid adults who constantly question the validity of what they’re being told by authority figures.
They grow into adults who cannot trust anyone, who always imagine they are being fed lies, and are being kept from a deeper more obscure truth for nefarious or selfish reasons.

It’s not that these conspiracy theorists are against facts, it’s that they are incredibly fearful of submitting to a morally corrupt authority system that they presume to be prosecutorial and cruel. I think that this explains why so many people of older generations are very easily influenced and manipulated by conspiracy theories online, particularly political ones. 

I wish that more people would be open to considering what makes a person vulnerable to delusional biased thinking instead of writing off large groups of population as simply “crazy.” In reality, we are all equally capable of experiencing paranoia, and the online information funnels created by algorithms could easily brainwash the large majority of us.

1. Any hypothetical about the president being able to order the assassination of political rivals, among other heinous/criminal actions, has *always* been possible.
2. Actions like the ones described above would subsequently be held accountable via impeachment.
3. Any hypothetical scenario about the president being able to undermine the political process of having a fair and honest impeachment trial has *also* always been possible.
4. If we grant the hypotheticals of the president being able to commit heinous actions and undermine an otherwise successful impeachment process, this does not require the new supreme court ruling; rather, it *always* could have happened.
	- The only thing this ruling *actually* does is arguably undermine the rule of law, but sending a criminal ex-president to jail is just the 'cherry on top,' so to speak, when questioning whether authoritarianism exists. A criminal indictment isn't necessary if we can successfully stop authoritarianism in its tracks and hold it accountable by removing and banning the actor from office.
5. Therefore, the recent supreme court case does not usher in any theoretical risk for authoritarianism that wasn't already present, and instead only undermines the rule of law, which is not necessary to counter authoritarianism if impeachment exists."

The salient parts of his policy plan ([Agenda47 ](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/reclaiming-americas-independence-by-slashing-bidens-disastrous-trade-deficits)and public comments he's made) are:

* implementation of some kind of universal tariff (10%?)
* implementation of selectively more aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods (to \~60% in some cases?)
* targeted reduction in trade with China specifically
* a [broader desire](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-us-dollar.html) to weaken the U.S. dollar to support U.S. exports
* a [mass program](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/trump-immigration-republicans-explained.html) of deportation
* at least maintaining individual tax cuts

Whether or not any of these things are important or necessary per se, all of them are inflationary:

* A universal tariff is effectively a 10% tax on imported goods. Whether or not those tariffs will be a boon do domestic industry isn't clear.
* Targeted Chinese tariffs are equally a tax, and eliminating trade with them means getting our stuff from somewhere else - almost certainly at a higher rate.
* His desire for a weaker dollar is just an attitudinal embracing of higher-than-normal inflation. As the article says, it isn't clear what his plans are - all we know is he wants a weak dollar. His posturing at independent agencies like the Fed might be a clue, but that's purely speculative.
* Mass deportation means loss of low-cost labor.
* Personal tax cuts are modestly inflationary.

All of the *together* seems to me to be a prescription for pretty significant inflation. Again - whether or not any of these policy actions are independently important or expedient for reasons that aren't (or are) economic, that is an effect they will have."
2,2024-07-17,CMV: The US should have some sort of mandatory national service,u/invinciblewalnut,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5usm0/cmv_the_us_should_have_some_sort_of_mandatory/,changemyview,"I believe the United States should have a one-year minimum mandatory national service requirement like some other countries, though not necessarily military service. It would build character in people and have them contribute to the society they will be living in. It would also provide people with valuable technical, job, and interpersonal skills, not to mention networking and a chance to get some real money in their pocket. This should be mandatory for all people but would primarily focus on high school graduates and dropouts. Of course, there would be exceptions, such as the Amish, since they more or less do their own thing. I also think having service delays for rural agricultural families would be beneficial since extra help is often needed during the sowing/harvest seasons.

Some options for this mandatory service could be:

* Civil service such as the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps
* Military service, whether that be active, guard, or reserve (and yes, the Coast Guard counts)
* Police or other law enforcement training (conservation officer, etc)
* Habitat for Humanity or other charitable or community organization
* the US Jobs Corps or enrolling in an apprenticeship program

I'm still torn on whether an exception can be made for students enrolling directly in college or a trade school since I don't think delaying higher education would be beneficial. That being said, those individuals might just get a service delay and complete their mandatory service after their education. Those enrolling in graduate degrees or high may also get some service delays, but even they would have to do their time."
369,2024-07-17,"CMV: Even if a fetus were considered a fully-fledged human, abortion should still be permitted for the mother without limitations according to United States law. ",u/cudakid210,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5v5gg/cmv_even_if_a_fetus_were_considered_a/,changemyview,"To start: I am not looking for moral appeals here. “It kills the baby” “it’s wrong” “it’s mean” “you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant” are not arguments against my position. I am arguing within the legal theory of the United States, not within a moral framework for this argument. 

Assumptions: I grant for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is a human being with all rights that should be accorded to natural born citizen. 

As an aside, in an extreme view of this position I would hold that once viability has been reached, the fetus should be eligible as a tax dependent, a co-rider for carpool lanes, and should have a social security number, etc. Please note that personally I do not feel that this is true, but for the sake of a stronger argument, I am allowing the pro-life side a stronger starting position: ie; granting the fetus full-personhood. 

Argument: The fetus is a human being who cannot survive without a birth. This human will die if they do not leave the womb through a medical procedure: ie, birth. 

This surgery is unique in that it requires a medical intervention on the body of the patient benefitting from the surgery (the fetus being born) but it also requires to consent and cooperation of a third party to be involved in and accept the dangers of the surgery: the mother who is giving birth. The fetus cannot be born, and thus cannot live, without being born by the mother, full-stop. The mother, on the other hand, can continue to live quite easily without going through the dangerous medical intervention that is childbirth. Her life is not endangered by the requirement to give birth, only that she is forced into a binary of doing something about the pregnancy, but abortion is significantly safer than a birth or Caesarean section, and in a purely pragmatic sense is the better option for her own health and wellbeing (assuming she does not want a child)

When taking this into account, the closest analogue I can think of would be a sickly sibling in need of a kidney. You are their only match. Without the kidney, your sibling will die, without question. And also without question, donating your kidney is dangerous, and poses a risk to yourself personally. 
But, while it may be morally wrong, or distasteful to not want to put yourself through the danger of that surgery to save your sibling, it is NOT MURDER TO NOT DONATE YOUR KIDNEY, EVEN IF THEY WILL DEFINITELY DIE WITHOUT IT. You choosing not to undergo a dangerous medical procedure that is unnecessary to your own personal medical wellbeing is not murder, even if that has the direct consequence of the death of another. It would insanity to force you to donate your kidney to a match, in the same way it should be insane to force a woman to give birth to a human. 

In fact, even if you had recently died, if you aren’t an organ donor, your rights to bodily autonomy, even as a corpse, trump your siblings need to violate your bodily autonomy in order to keep living. 

Even if all that was needed to save the person’s life was a single drop of your blood, you cannot be compelled to give it if I don’t want to. 

So why, when the rights of living, breathing, tax-paying, spouse-having, kidney-needing adult humans cannot supersede your abilities to make your own personal decisions regarding which medical procedures to engage in, should a fetus, even with the full rights of men, be able to do so?"

Simply raising wages would face stiff blowback by fiscal conservatives and Wall Street. Any sort of UBI would likely see even worse blowback.

The standard deduction helps people across all professions whether you make $30k/yr or $130k/yr. Companies would not have to raise wages. If we raised the deduction from $14,600 to $29,200. You would only pay federal tax on income over 29,200. This would put more money in workers paychecks while also promoting employment/work (so the ""money for nothing/handout"" argument wouldn't really work against it)

Of course, this would still face some resistance as there would need to be a new tax bracket created for incomes over a couple million, but for 99% of working Americans, this is likely the easiest thing to agree upon when it comes to creating more take-home pay for liberals and conservatives alike who have to actually work for a living

0,2024-07-17,CMV: Self diagnosis of mental health disorders is not dangerous and doesn't hurt anybody,u/jman12234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5wajs/cmv_self_diagnosis_of_mental_health_disorders_is/,changemyview,"I come to this conclusion based on a few points:

1. Self diagnosis does not effect anyone but the individual in question:

I don't buy that the greater acceptance of self diagnosis effects anybody but the individual in question. The spate of TikToks and media relating to having mental illness doesn't impact the stigma of mental illness, which is the argument I most commonly see. The stigma against mental illness goes back centuries. The modern prevalence of mental health media in both traditional media and social media is actually a sign of a greater acceptance of mental health illness. The push back is a backlash against mental health awareness, not the other way around. 

The second argument I usually hear is about the proliferation of mental health misinformation. But, misinformation about mental health disorders is a society-wide, systemic issue, Not one to be held alone by people who self diagnose mental health awareness is already bad; people, in general, do not know what they are talking about. I do not understand how people seeking to educate themselves about a disorder would spread more misinformation than is already out there. A lot of people don't even believe in mental illness which is by far the most damaging bit of misinformation that is circulating.


2. If you think you have a mental health disorder, you probably do:

Most people with mental illness come to the conclusion based on their own assessment of their individual qualities.  They feel something is wrong; their life isn't gelling together appropriately; they struggle deeply and for long periods of time. These things are ephemeral and often invisible to outside eyes. Further, many of our diagnostic instruments rely on self-reporting scales, which only the individual could possibly answer. I do not understand, therein, why self diagnosis is harmful to the individual. 

3. Even if they're wrong about the specific diagnosis, self diagnosis leads to getting help:

Many people feel too afraid of the stigma of mental illness to seek out support and get help. Having a diagnosis you think is fitting seems like a way to build confidence enough to get help. I speak here from personal experience -- everyone in my life has a mental health disorder -- but I know very, very few people with mental health illnesses that did not have at least an idea of what was afflicting them before seeking out aid. In this way, it seems that self diagnosis leads to getting help.

Not that the idea of a modern government like today was conceived to ensure everyone has basic rights and cannot be oppressed, harmed, or infringed without consequence. However, even back then there would be people who can understand and feel what is inherently and distinctly right and wrong.

Then people will argue how there were even worse civilizations that made the Roman's look like child's play, I don't see how that is supposed to change anything either. It's like arguing if Stalin or Hitler was worse, one killed more people sure but the other killed way less in far more horrific and morbidly creative fashion. Well? Who cares? We all were doing something horrible at the time.

It's just silly to me that people will go to such extents to excuse and admire something so inhuman. It almost makes me feel like it is a point, perhaps like people say, we can't judge because honestly they seem so unreal, inhuman, and far removed that there MUST be something different back then that is incomprehensible to us.

It rarely targets the right person for the right reasons and it rarely if ever affects the lives or systems in power on a permanent basis. This is why Political Violence is wrong for most people.

However, while everyone is happily and easily advocating against this violence they ignore actual problems that cause people to turn to violent solutions.

My examples are going to be based primarily on the United States - but I understand to some degree they are global issues. 

For instance, the economy is in a bad place. If you owned a home already you’re doing great and fine and probably have had your value go up. But your home insurance is quickly becoming unviable because of global warming and rising costs associated with areas of the economy being affected.

Or for another instance, Healthcare. Healthcare costs cannot sustain for hospitals, nurses, or physicians. All of these will have huge impacts on all regions of the country but especially rural poor counties.

Corporations and Billionaires that demand so much wealth be in their pockets and the entire tax system of the country is robbing communities blind. There are not functional economies in multiple small towns and they almost require the life line of large corporate warehouses of markets to keep them afloat. 

As long as economic hardship exists, healthcare is too expensive, and the path from low class to middle class to high class cannot be achieved for normal people in their lifetimes - unrest will be rampant.

That’s to say nothing of a political system where both parties prop up the system and refuse to alleviate suffering so that they can use culture wars and minority groups to monger fear and separation so that they can control votes and jockey for power.

Solve for the causes of political violence and condemn them. Not the violence itself.

i posit that the left is in the midst of dealing with ""reactive abuse""

from random link [https://www.charliehealth.com/post/what-is-reactive-abuse](https://www.charliehealth.com/post/what-is-reactive-abuse):

“Reactive abuse” describes situations where a person who has endured sustained abusive behavior reacts aggressively towards their abuser. The abusive partner often manipulates this reaction to shift blame and create a false narrative of so-called “mutual abuse” (more on this below). However, this behavior is self-defense, a response to ongoing harm, and should not be equated with abusive behavior. Below, we will discuss reactive abuse, strategies to manage it, and the mental health toll of abuse. 

is this not the dynamic trump has created/allowed?

every social media, PR stunt, narrative theft and bit of political rhetoric that has brainwashed the country seems to be dripping with signs of this mind-fuck tactic.

2. The game to this day is full of glitches and badly designed quests. There's usually only one way to do something and it's sometimes a guessing game to get it right. I guess this may be endearing or nostalgic for some people since many pc games used to be this way 20+ years ago but I find it annoying.

3. Ambushes and the general shittiness of combat: Master strikes are basically just quick time events and if you fight more than one enemy or even just 1 powerful enemy you can only really use master strikes. I can think of quite a few widely repudiated games with more interactive and immersive combat than KC:D's.

4. Too much filler dialogue and some awful voice acting. Dialogue options and reputation consequences are so random.

5. Crime system that makes no sense. Murder someone in cold blood? the guards don't notice. Loot their corpse? They will telepathically detect this from across town.

Bad boys and playboy kind of men are much more misogynistic. I heard Arab and North African men have better game than local men in Europe. Nordic women have a craze for Mediterranean men who are much more sexist than most Nordic men.

0,2024-07-17,CMV: Biden should instruct his delegates to support him for a 3rd VP term and then allow an open DNC convention for the Presidential nomination ,u/DaftMythic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e61auu/cmv_biden_should_instruct_his_delegates_to/,changemyview,"There have been many calls for president Biden to step aside for a younger candidate to run for president on the Democratic ticket. However there is some contention about who should replace him.

In order to respond to this outcry Biden's best strategic choice, and the best outcome for the DNC would be for Biden to instruct his delegates to the DNC to change the rules to have the VP vote happen before the Presidential vote, urge his delegates to vote for Biden as VP and then have the presidental ballot be open.

**My suggestion in short is a *wildcard*/Biden ticket**

Two further change of the rules would be tied to this

A) For the first, say, 3 ballots the person selected for VP candidate cannot be nominated for the presidential ballot, but if after that there is no restrictions and if the VP candidate is selected as the Presidental candidate then there will be another vote for the VP.

B) After the first ballot for the Presidential nomination every candidate who receives some threshold, say 15%, should be given an option for a prime time speech at the DNC.

Now, as to advantages of this rules change. 

**First,** it provides a process that is as small ""d"" democratic as possible at this point. If Biden were to announce this rules change now it would likely steal a number of news cycles as many of the potential presidential nominees are given air time to make their case. Voters could be instructed to contact their delegates to make their voice heard.

This is better than weeks more of speculation of will he/won't he get out of the race.

**Second,** it would provide a lot of drama and likely drive up interest and ratings in the DNC leading up to the convention.

**Third,** it would allow Biden to retain his advantages for being on the ticket: all his fundraising would transfer. Additionally from a policy standpoint, Biden even admits that his great governing strength is his understanding of the Senate. As VP he would be able to work closely with the Senate to get bills passed. It would also allow for a new Presidental candidate to still talk up the good policy wins of the Biden era and not ""change horses mid stream"". He would also be able to hammer JD Vance on his lack of foreign policy and governing experience at the VP debate, while a more dynamic candidate hammers Trump in the next Presidential debates.

**Fourth,** it would give an opportunity to showcase the depth of presidental material on the bench in the Democratic party that could help in 2028 and beyond.

**Finally**, in the event that the balloting goes past the 3 rounds (or whatever as laid out in part B above) Biden may still be returned to the top of the ticket. If this happens he could put to rest the idea that he ""should have stepped down"" as we enter the final stretches of the campaign as he can point to the fact he gave the delegates a chance to change but they supported him, and in the meantime leading up to the convention the pressure will be off of him to step down.

Now downsides:

**First Unity:** there is a chance this could devolve into infighting and protracted balloting at the convention. However Dems are already facing a crisis of unity as there are public cries for Biden, who is still popular and loved in mamy circles, to step down. In effect the status quo is to for weeks more of questions about Bidens fitness to lead and more breakdown in unity instead of messaging that is focused on attacking Trump and Democratic policy goals.

A corrilary of this point,  if Biden did step down in some other process then its not clear that there would be any more or less disunity than the quasi open convention I am proposing. There is already questions about if Kamala is best to take his spot as well as backlash potential if she is denied the opportunity.

And if Biden just says ""to hell with 65% of the party wanting me to stand aside"" that is likely to keep grumbling going until August 7th, or the convention, and perhaps even beyond as people still look in the rear-view mirror saying ""he shoulda gotten out""

Additionally, Biden could side step the issue of Kamala if the delegates make the decision. He could obviously support her strongly as his current heir apparant but if she didn't win on the first 3 rounds of ballotting it would provide a useful pivot moment to allow for someone else to emerge (as Presidential or VP candidate) without it looking like Biden or the DNC leadership threw her under the bus.

Also, from a messaging perspective, Biden could still spend the weeks leading up to the convention campaigning on the fact that he is returning (as VP) to finish the job but also step aside for unity sake and say ""but you know what folks, any Democrat will be committed to the rule of law and the constitution and would be better than Donald Trump, and I will be there to give them all the wisdom and guidance I have"". And the Biden plans are basically the same as the Democratic platform. I think thats a message that all Democrats could get behind even as they seek the top of the ticket.

**The second major downside is Ohio**: part of why the role call vote is for August 7th is to ensure the Democratic ticket is on the ballot in Ohio. I am not a lawyer nor do I know the ins and outs of how that procedure is setup, but perhaps there can be roll call votes for the VP and President as I am proposing prior to that deadline? Or maybe just pinning down the VP would be enough? I'd like to know more about this.

However the truth is that no Dem presidental ticket is likely to win Ohio, it has shifted too far red, and the cost of losing down ballot races in one state may be worth it to win the presidential race against Trump."

0,2024-07-18,"CMV: Because boys need to have sex early, parents should use fear tactics to force their teenage sons into having sex so they don’t become incels",u/their-holiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e649i4/cmv_because_boys_need_to_have_sex_early_parents/,changemyview,"I think [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/s/EPiN5BpWdU) is true and basically what responsible parents should do to avoid raising incels is use fear tactics to force their teenage sons to develop the skills they need for dating. Essentially for a male, being good at dating is kind of like being a professional athlete and if they don’t get on it quickly there’s just no way forward. Merely encouraging dating or letting the biology of teenage boys do the work is not enough, except for a small group that is “born with it”.

If the boys grow up to be bad at dating they are failures in life.

This is unfair to boys, but society is unfair to boys and this is an attempt at giving them a fair shot at life. When they’re 30+ they will be thanking their parents and saying this is the best thing they could have ever done for them. Daughters should be raised in a typical liberal parenting style. There is no pressing reason to diverge from conventional parenting for daughters because it is working well.

In the words of the post

>if you haven’t gotten at least the basic set of dating skills down by like age 17 (how to flirt, how to escalate without being a fucking creep, a decent social circle, some hints from women) then you’re probably cooked……
>The (growing) number of young men in these situations have four options if they want to date:
>1. Wait until your early to mid 30s to start dating and suffer through celibacy until then, when women (hopefully) care less about shit like “the ick” and you have a career and some money.
>2. Try to fruitlessly “self-improve” your way into the modern dating scene. This is essentially the same as option 1, because by the time you catch up with the young men who have ”it”you’ll be in your mid 30s if not later in life. (Assuming you start this process in your college years/early 20s and not later in life)
>3. Passport bro.
>4. Invent a time machine and get yourself to socialize more with women when you're young, because by the time you're old enough to realize how shit your dating options are, there isn't anything you can do, you're already fucked.


Parents should save a college fund for them and make it clear to them from around age ten that if they graduate high school a virgin they’re getting kicked out of home, they lose access to the college fund, and nobody in the family will ever speak to them ever again. 

The college fund threat should be very real.  Parents should immediately spend the college fund on something stupid or donate it to charity immediately after they graduate as a virgin so there’s no chance they can plead for it back.

I think parents should actively punish their sons if they don’t go to parties. Maybe cutting off their internet or forcing them to sleep on the couch. There can be no excuses  maybe going as far as locking them out of the house for the night so they have to go to the party, and then unlocking the doors at 4am or whenever.

I do not believe natural desire for sex is enough to convince most teenage boys to have proper priorities in their lives. You can recover from going to Carnegie Mellon over Harvard, but you can’t recover from having insufficient sexual experience going into college. But kids are dumb and just want to play video games or study something they’re passionate about instead of doing what’s actually important for their futures. 

Parents should provide for any expenses that would contribute to their sons having sex. These can include speech language pathology, letting them have large parties, and alcohol and drugs. And they should be 100% clear their love is conditional on them having sex by high school graduation. 

Obviously prostitution doesn’t count because then every boy would just get their mom to give them $500 to have sex with a sex worker so they can keep their college fund, but I think probably it’s a good way of

I feel like there are exceptions they should make but basically only if their sons get cancer. I feel like there’s no bouncing back from getting cancer at age 16-18 but it’s enough to just throw it here as an option. Autistic sons should not be given this mercy because they are the main group I believe will benefit from this. Physical illnesses are okay but anything mental should be treated equally.

Oh and if there are two sons they should be compared with each other on their sexual successes. If one is not a virgin then he needs to be the favourite. 

I know this will cause trauma and other issues, but I believe being able to date is more important than these issues. If a parent truly loves their child they will be willing to sacrifice feeling like they’re friends with their children in exchange for the children’s well-being.

The biggest issue that could arise from this is that their sons might be unable to date due to perceiving it as this work they needed to do to get their college funds. They might perceive sex as a joyless task they need to do to please their parents instead of as an essential source of self worth, and in college they might voluntarily not have sex, and then have their skills degrade and end up as incels after.

I only know maybe five males I consider sexually successful, but none were raised with this strategy. One had an older brother really fixated on ensuring he had sex, and had sex at age 14, but that’s about it. The other 4 seem to have gotten that way just out of their intrinsic nature. But only one of them had classic “good” parents.

The purpose of laws in the USA is not to impose any sort of morality on to citizens about whether something is right or wrong, they are so society can function. For arguments sake let’s pretend that there is nothing morally wrong with killing. That doesn’t mean it should be allowed and it would still be illegal in civilized nations, if there are murders freely wandering the streets we would have to live like animals, everyone would be hiding somewhere afraid of getting killed rather than going to work or everyone would be strapped 24/7 and we’d be living in a constant war zone. My point being that murder and literally every crime has extremely logical reasons for being illegal in complete absence of morality. 

Abortion is virtually the only political topic that has absolutely zero bearing on how effectively society functions therefore should be completely left out of politics.

This is *not* a CMV for wider issues with appointment of heads of various EU institutions (the Spitzenkandidat system, direct election, seats relative to population, etc.)

When approving the European Commission president in the European Parliament there are two rules, which I believe should be changed: 1) the vote should not be secret. That is, you should be able to see what the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted. 2) The candidate for the presidency should be allowed to stand more than once for the mandate being voted on. Here, I do not mean term limits (that's another discussion), but simply how many times the candidate can go through the approval process in the European Parliament in the institutional cycle (i.e., each full mandate).

**No secret vote**

My main point on making the vote public is that you increase accountability of the MEPs. In order for voters to make an informed decision in the next European parliamentary elections, they need to be able to see what their preferred candidates voted for. As the presidency of the European Commission is the most important and powerful position within the EU institutions, its instrumental for voters to know if they voted for or against a candidate that they might like or dislike.

My smaller point, which I in all honesty do not believe can stand alone, is that a public vote increases stability. This is because a public vote makes ""whipping"" (the practice of enforcing the party-line) easier. If the vote is public, the party (in this case both the local one and the European group) can take disciplinary actions against rogue members of their party (if their rules allow it). The practice of whipping (or voting a long party lines) makes it much easier to predict if a given candidate will win the vote.

**Being able to stand more than once**

In the current EU rules, the candidate for the European Commission presidency can only be voted on once in the approval process in the given European institutional cycle. This means that if fails to win the vote in the European Parliament, then the whole institutional process has to start again. The Council will have to find another candidate, who has to build a coalition, and then hope to win the secret vote.

I believe that this is an issue. Failing to secure a majority in your first try should not disqualify you from trying again. I have several issues with this practice. First of all, the vote could essentially end up being decided by chance. If an MEP is sick or stuck in traffic or otherwise prevented from voting, their absence could essentially sink a candidacy. Last cycle the president won the vote by 9 seats, which is 1,27 % of Parliament. Considering the lessons learned from the pandemic, its not unlikely that less than 2 % of MEPs could miss an important vote.

Secondly, failing to build a successful coalition in the first try, does not mean that you are not capable of building one in the second try. Given the short time span from nomination to confirmation, it would be difficult for anyone to build a quick and successful coalition. In many countries, this process can take many many weeks, in some it takes months. Given the interests and the complexity in the European Parliament (coupled with the process of even nominating a candidate for the European Commission!), there is little reason it should be a rushed decision.

Now, I am not advocating for infinite tries each cycle. I am perfectly fine with a limit, but I believe on is too little and can leave the candidacy to chance. Ideally there would be, as in many parliamentary countries, a system where a person (a president or a monarch usually) can ask the political parties (and in this case countries) to select a candidate after it is clear that they cannot secure a majority.

As there are (obviously) other systems of government than the ones I am familiar with, which are efficient and successful, I would be interested in hearing why the current system (or parts of it) are good. For example I know that [Germany](https://www.bundestag.de/en/parliament/function/chancellor/chancellor-197632) has a secret vote for the Chancellor - which is largely the reason the EU has this system - and so I would be very interested to hear about the advantages of this system."

Following the attempt on Trump's life, we've seen a subtle shift in the major Party's ideologies that hasn't been said by too many news outlets, and that's the fact that the parties have shifted morals/attitudes regarding this topic.

I'm seeing right wing people going into people's jobs/doxxing them over comments about Trump like ""Shooter shouldn't have missed"" or ""We were so close to Utopia"" etc but the point being is that they're literally doing the same things they've condemned the Left for. Where was this energy when people were literally calling for the head of Pelosi/AOC? 

You have Left Wingers saying that the Right are cupcakes and need to get over it, and freedom of speech typical sayings, that people shouldn't be censored or fired over things they say online... I mean both sides are LITERALLY saying the same things that the other usually says, and it's funny to see how your viewpoint will change on something if it's something you are actually sympathetic about. 

For example Destiny, a popular stream debator, was just banned on Kick, a streaming platform known for its less than savory streamers, including ex scammers, open racists, homophobes, accused Sex Offenders, you name it. But they banned Destiny over saying he's glad the Firefighter bystander died, apparently because the Firefighter had not so nice things to say politically. I could care less about what Destiny or the Firefighter said, but the response from the fans is what prompted me to make this post.

The supporters are saying it's good that he got banned and they hope it makes him watch his mouth later on (Very similar to the Left celebrating what happened to Alex Jones) and the dissentors are saying it's BS that Kick of all platforms are banning because of mean words (Same company that has had ppl saying the F Word to LGBT people, N Word to Black ppl, ""jokingly"" flirting with minors online, you name it, all degenerate behavior)

But what do you guys think? Has anyone else noticed the shift in thinking from both parties?

",u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e65wdj/cmv_music_is_deeply_connected_to_meditation_and/,changemyview,"The only language that can create the soundless is music, and it is the only sound that approaches silence. It must be acknowledged that music is meaningless. It's a celebration of pure joy. It is the sole form of art capable of communicating the indescribable.

The oldest known tradition about music is that it originated with meditation. The individuals who practiced meditation were unable to share their experiences in any way. They created a variety of instruments so that you could hear something without understanding it, but still enjoy yourself and dance.

For those who first discovered a language that is not a language, it must have been an immensely valuable discovery. Sounds don't mean anything by themselves. Meaning is the sounds that man has imposed. Sounds are inherent. There is a unique sound and melody produced by the wind moving through the pine trees. Alternatively, a river has its own sound and melody as it flows through the rocks as it descends from the mountain.

As they listened to the inner silence, meditators must have felt a great deal of difficulty in communicating it. It was during those early times that people discovered music. The discovery is straightforward: when the sounds are stripped of their meaning, they take on harmony and a heart-pounding rhythm. It does not say anything, but it also says the impossible.

The common misconception about music is that it is made up of sounds, but this is only partially true and of secondary significance. The music has silences in between two sounds as it gets deeper and deeper.

Since instruments can only produce sound, an old Chinese saying goes, ""When the musician becomes perfect, he throws away his instruments."" The musician creates the silence.

However, as they reach their peak, the same noises that were briefly silent begin to cause disruption. An odd notion, but one that is significant and has perfect meaning. It holds true for all forms of art. The archer discards his bow and arrows after he reaches perfection because all it takes is his gaze to bring a flying bird to the ground. The arrows and bow served only as a warm-up.

The same holds true for all the arts that humanity has created, including music and painting. You can reach the ultimate peak without the aid of the steps or ladder that brought you this far. It loses significance.

The classical music was all about meditation and quiet. 

There are two possible outcomes: either musicians discovered meditation, or meditators discovered music. They are incredibly and profoundly connected to one another, but since meditation is a much deeper and higher experience, the meditators must have discovered music as a way to communicate something of their inner dance, inner silence, to the people they cared about.

Eastern classical music requires not only extensive training for the performer but also for the audience. The old classical music is beyond the comprehension of the masses. You must possess the ability to harmonise with the harmony. You have to, in a sense, fade away until the music is all that is heard.

Great artists, musicians, dancers, painters, and sculptors have all experienced the realisation that just when they reach the pinnacle of their creativity, they pass away. Their taste of vanishing into the universal comes from their very creativity. That turns into their very first meditation experience. Therefore, both are viable options:

Either meditation has sought to find a way to express the inexpressible, or music has guided people towards meditation. Either way, though, music is the pinnacle of human creation.

There is meditation.

Your creativity is expressed through music.

However, we are no longer in touch with real music. And slowly, slowly, the music of humanity has gotten progressively lower as people's interest in the inner world has decreased. The quality of music nowadays is the lowest it has ever been. It makes contact with you, but it does so at the lowest point of your sexuality. While classical music was spiritual, modern music is sexual."

",u/Throwawayyy18172,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e66okq/cmv_the_palestinian_stop_dont_skip_videos_did_a/,changemyview,"Many of you have probably seen these types of videos on Tiktok. They consist of people shouting at the beginning of the video “Stop! Don’t Skip!” or something like “Don’t skip if you care about Palestine.” They all usually claim that their family is in danger in Palestine and ask for money or interaction with the post. This became such a common way to get money over there to Palestine and in the short term it was very successful in that goal. Now it seems interactions with these videos have significantly dropped and I think I know why. There are many problems with these videos, the first one being they feel very scripted and performative, often saying the same things in many different videos. For example there is this one guy who is always crying and acting really angry and in every single video he says “I don’t forgive anyone who skips this video.” It’s so obvious that he’s acting so over the top and just trying to take advantage of people’s sympathy. There’s just no way he’s always constantly angry and constantly crying. The videos just don’t seem genuine, they all seem very performative and this is damaging to the cause because the issue is a real issue and many people are suffering but this gives a bad look to the cause making it look fake. Another thing is these videos can easily be made by anyone and anyone can claim they are from Palestine even though they’re not. I don’t think it’s a reliable way to help overall as it helps one family at a time when there’s millions of people who are in need of help. I think if you truly want to help, you should donate to trusted aid organizations or go out and protest. My final theory is that they also desensitize the audience to the conflict, constantly being bombarded with videos and not really being able to do much. They became too much and for the average person wanting to kill time on TikTok, their FYP gets taken over by these videos causing them to get desensitized and annoyed. Think of it like this, imagine a beggar comes to you when you’re walking down the street. You might feel bad for them and give them some change, then another comes and you also give them some change. Now imagine after giving those two beggars money, you’re constantly stopped by beggars every two minutes, you would be annoyed and less inclined to give and you may not even go back on that street anymore. These videos target the average joe who doesn’t really have much power when instead the attention should be brought to politicians who actually can do something. 

TL;DR: These videos became way too many, are very performative, and have desensitized people to them. The best way to help is to donate to trusted aid organizations or protest. "

I mostly buy that Randall understands the biological function of the tongue, mind you.  He has one and intentionally uses it all the time.  People are acutely aware of it's position and it's movements when they choose to be - and occasionally even when they do not choose to be.  It does have some surprises that a layman might not know about, but of course I don't know what research he's done.

  
But it's position on the understanding of metaphorical use seems wildly low.  It is the seat of language and communication.  Really not that hard a concept, compared to the liver which I (and presumably he) would need significant context clues to interpret in a metaphor.  Tongue can occasionally have multiple meanings - but then, so do nerves which he ranks extremely high on understanding.

  
I believe he is not utterly bewildered by the metaphorical use of the tongue as his chart represents, but has simply misplaced the organ."

Right now, there is extreme wealth inequality. The richest 2,153 people have more wealth than the poorest 4.6 billion people. To make it easy to remember, that is roughly 2000 people holding the wealth of the bottom 60% of society.

This data is from January 2020, and we all know that corporations and the mega wealthy have only used the event that occurred soon after to tighten their grip on us, sucking up even more wealth. So they are getting ever more power and influence.

Influence they can exert on those less powerful than them.

Of course, we have no concrete evidence that the rich elite are a monolithic group working together to exert some dystopian future. To suggest otherwise would make me sound crazy. But they do have a shared interest, which is the growth of their money (power and influence). It's naïve to think otherwise.

The more they grow their power, the closer we get to a dystopian future.

I get that there is just so much propaganda and division that these 'special interest groups' (to put it nicely) shoved down all our throats, but how are so many people blind to this simple fact?

The more power they have, the more power they can take, and so on. Do people think they will eventually be content and stop seeking more? The only limit greed has is the limit of what can be ""mine.""

It makes me so frustrated to see people opening their mouths ever wider so the boot can slide in easier. All they have to do is point our discontent (for the conditions they are actively causing) at each other.

""The right are raging idiots that want to tear our way of life apart!""

""The left are raging idiots that want to tear our way of life apart!""

I am not both siding with this. I am just saying that people from both sides will fervently defend and idealise those who are obviously taking advantage of us. It annoys me to no end, and I am genuinely confused as to why people do it. Is it just the power of propaganda, or is there something I'm missing? Is it the same as how a victim of an abusive relationship doesn't believe others when they are told their relationship is awful?

Basically imagining it were dogs in factory farms, held in pens, forcefully impregnated, killed in gas chambers. It would be just as immoral as what pigs are going through now.

Reminder #1: Hold this situation equal in every regard but species. If you’re imagining it’s morally different to kill a random pig versus your pet dog, picture the opposite situation. Or picture both/neither as your pet. Their utility/relationship to you personally does not change their experience as a victim. The same way that I care about my mom more than yours, but both our moms deserve ethical treatment because of their own experience.

Reminder #2: This is directed towards the morality and treatment of the animal, NOT how your culture views you if you eat either. Public perception is not a factor in morality of a victim. Just because something is generally accepted does not make it morally justified or unjustified.

This all hit me with the news of the Yukon Dog Meat festival last month in China. Made me question what the true moral difference is between two often compared, extremely intelligent animals."

To be blunt, my conclusion has been disappointing.

I've always looked up to the USA and envisioned how we, as Africans, could conduct ourselves politically. I have generally liked the liberal policies of the Democratic Party, although there are elements of their social progressivism that I wouldn't want anywhere near my beloved continent.

To get to the point, no matter how broken or corrupt our political systems are on this continent, I never expected my countrymen to collectively believe that an old man with failing mental faculties could win against a populist opponent like Trump. There's no poll or historical context (like incumbency) that can justify this level of delusion.

For one, I don't think the leadership of the Democratic Party is genuinely worried about a Trumpian dictatorship. If they were, they would front a serious candidate. Biden is just a makeshift band-aid that they don't really care if it holds because they are confident they'll have another shot at the White House in four years.

Regarding Trump, I think the hatred for him is really overblown. I used to dislike him as president, but over time I've realized that the American media is a poison stronger than cyanide. Learning that the USA is invaded by millions of illegal immigrants yearly, I'm surprised Trump's wall isn't finished. No African country would be so generous to welcome such large numbers of people regardless of the circumstances.

So, I have to ask: how can Americans criticize African leaders when their own political system is in such a shambles? Can a nation that seems so divided and unable to address its own glaring issues really hold any moral high ground?"

I’ve recently seen many people talk about successful people and go “yeah he’s just lucky” and truly believe luck is the most important factor to success. I couldn’t disagree more, often they’ll say yeah well they met the right person and it was the right time and circumstances for them to succeed. 

It’s a losers mentality to think that way. Yes of course if you invested in some crypto coin that 1000x ur money ur lucky, but same with the guy that won the lottery. If they lose that money they’re done lol, they won’t likely make that back. I truly believe that some people are just plain stupid and have really bad attitudes and unrealistic expectations on success. 

Most people try to do something and they fail and they say they weren’t lucky but the other guy who succeeded, HE was lucky. What I’ve seen in observation is that both guys failed, one quit once they hit a wall and the other guy failed 1000 more times tweaked and adapted his strategy and plan before he succeeded. When you truly try your very best and put your will and power into something CONSISTENTLY you’re going to put yourself in every opportunity to get “lucky”.

I like the Thomas Jefferson quote “the harder I worked the luckier I got”. If you want a great example of someone who didn’t have an ounce of luck in this world look up Francis Ngannou, and hear his story. 

I don’t get why anyone would want to even adopt the mindset that there has to be luck involved in order to achieve great success or wealth. If I truly felt like lighting would have to strike me in the head in order for me to become rich what kind of person would I be? 

This has been on my mind because recently an old friend made a comment to me that I was just lucky  with my career and the success I’ve found in trading oil futures. I got offended because she didn’t know the months and months of failure and frustration, and thousands of hours I went through to get to where I am now. Anyone can make money what I do, but can you do it the next day? And the next week? And next month? Nope, couldn’t do it purely on luck. You can take away every dollar I have, but I worked hard to build a skill, all I need is the internet and I’ll be back to where I am right now within a year. 

I’ve now been able to build better networks with people in my line of work that are successful and not a single one of them believe in luck. They’re smart, have good attitudes and they get things done.

What's the point of clinging to life at all costs? I can't see why is suicide always discussed in media as tragic and terrible, there is always this ""so sad that nobody did anything to prevent it!"" mentality. Of course we SHOULD care deeply about suicide rates because they are an indication of deeper social problems and of people being unhappy but the society's moral panic is often centered on the act itself as something ultimately evil.

I can't see why. What difference does it make when we die? Yes, a dead person won't experience a number of things, but they are dead so it doesn't matter. A dead person can't be worse off than a living one because they don't exist anymore."

In one, you believe it is a form of theft. It harms others and infringes upon their rights because the artist (and associated rightsholders like publishers, producers, etc) are entitled to money from the sale and/or licensing of their art.

In the other, piracy is not a crime, because no one gets hurt. No artist is deprived of anything by piracy, because the state they are in before you pirate and the state they are in after you pirate are absolutely identical; they didn't have your money before your pirated, they don't have your money afterwards. The only thing that changed is that you personally have their art.

I am not here to argue which of those is right. What I am arguing is that using *either* of those two moral frameworks presents a scenario in which pirating is the *best* course of action; as an alternative to a boycott.

Under the first moral framework, piracy harms the artist, but in the case of a problematic artist, they deserve to be hurt. The only difference between a boycott and privacy is the private enjoyment of the pirate and that does not, to my understanding, effect the morality of the action in any way. Under the latter framework, piracy causes no harm and is therefore permissible.

I don't like the political views of JK Rowling, Varg Vikernes or Orson Scott Card. I do not want them to be rewarded for their views or art, and I want to minimize their ability to promote their views. That does not mean, logically or morally, I should deny myself their art. I should not suffer simply because someone else has broken the social contract; but when you break that social contract, you yourself deserve to suffer (if, indeed, the act of piracy inflicts suffering).

You may be asking ""who determines when it is ethical to pirate a creator's work?"" and the question I ask you is whether or not you apply that same standard to organizing a boycott. Ultimately, the end result is the same; the rightsholder is denied money from the sale or license of their work. Does it matter how?"

Growing up I was a libertarian and would have scoffed at the above statement. Now as a 30s guy however, I wish I lived in a country that had more federal regulation of vices like tobacco products and fast food.

I normally am a very healthy person - run half marathons, bench 225, etc. But when times get rough in my life I’ll find myself turning to dip and fast food to comfort me. Then I’ll get fatter and more unhealthy and it’ll take months to recover!

I wish these things were just stuff that I could not reach for anymore. The temptation is just always there and I wish it wasn’t. 

I wish more politicians discussed regulating these things - our country would be so much better off if we limited them severely.

I used to think that “land of the free” meant freedom to do whatever you want but now that just seems like hedonism - the founders idea of “land of the free” was for freedom for laudable, real things like freedom of expression and assembly - it was never in reference to freedom to poison ourselves."

The money supply had an enormous spike in 2020. I believe that is related to PPP, but it obviously was not due to Biden because it was before he was elected. The inflation increased during his term because there is a lag between the creation of the money and it's inflationary effects. 

Additionally the Inflation reduction act was passed in Aug 2022, and inflation has seemed to have curbed since then. Some people say ""we still have inflation"" because prices have not dropped. That is misunderstanding inflation. It's like saying ""we're still going fast"" even though you took your foot of the gas pedal. Prices do not go down when inflation flattens, they stop increasing.

I don't think it is Trump's fault, per se. It's likely we'd have a large spending bill in response to COVID no matter who was president.

My viewpoint is based on monetary supply data here:

People talk about freedom of speech, but guess what, there is no such thing as freedom of speech. You're delusional if you think there is. You can talk trash about Christians and Muslims and nothing will happen to you, you talk about Jews, and man you're life is actually over in America. There are a lot of good Jews and I love them just like I love my Christian/Muslim brothers and sisters, but you guys know which kinds I'm talking about. 

The liberals have allowed A ""he"" to believe they're a ""her"", and vice versa. You use the wrong pronouns on someone (accident or on purpose), and your career can basically be ruined. You can identify as a cat, dog, bird, and if you mis-identify them, you're also in trouble. The liberals will try to enforce their ideas on to children and if you speak against it, you're a bad person. As if they're ideas are not terrible.

This whole idea of wokeism, which was created by the Liberals, aka the Democrats, has caused the country to be split on basic things. It has actually ruined families. If it continues, then I could actually see the U.S. splitting into multiple countries in the future.

Okay so I'm politically very Purple. Where I stand on the Issues I'll lay out right here. 

My Liberal Views -

 1.) I'm Very Pro Union. Unions can fix a lot of problems this country has. (I know Vance is pro union but that's Rare)

2.) Monopolies & Oligopolies are destroying our collective savings accounts and destroying any chance of retirement for most people as they're milked dry.

3.) Increasing Taxes on the Wealthy is needed & well overdue. Close loop holes.

4.) I'm pro gun control. I think it's more than fair to want a Pistol/Hunting Equipment but why the fuck do you need an AR-15 

My Conservative Views - 

1.) I'm very pro police and pro first responders. They're more than essential to our society.

2.) a lot of the red tape in this country needs to be eradicated. Protecting workers & the environment should be the government's focus. That being said it should not cost $800,000 to house a homeless man in California.

3.) I'm pro Israel. Netanyahu is terrible and to discount the atrocities he's lead is ignorant. But to look at Hamas & to not realize they are the threat is absurd.

4.) Inflation & the cost of goods has been terrible on the American consumer & to act like everything is fine because the S&P 7 is keeping everyone's 401K's up is asinine and insulting.

My Moderate Views.

1.) Yes a women should have a right to choose. But that should expire after 4 months. 120 days seems like a more than reasonable cut off date.

2.) EMS should be given the same protections & federal guidelines as Police & Fire Fighting.

3.) Yes we need more rail. But A.) not as much as Europe were significantly less dense & B.) it has to be coming from the federal government via eminent domain. California's high speed rail is costing $200 Million per mile.

4.) Term limits, Banning excessive financial contributions & Banning stock trades for every member in the Senate & House are beyond overdue.

5.) Neither candidate is competent to run this country. It is literally choosing between hospice & prison.

6.) Neither side is willing to reach across the Isle and get anything done causing absurd gridlock.

7.) Both sides are completely entrenched in cancel culture. You're seeing it now with Republicans trying to get people fired over jokes about the assassination attempt & Democrats do over offense jokes all the time.

Okay that's all my views. Anything I missed I'll be glad to answer. Here's why I'm leaning towards Kennedy. Let me clear. He's a batshit conspiracy theorist & I will not defend him. But it's not the man it's that he represents a hope that the other 2 parties might be scared enough to change.

A lot of my moderate views are things the American people want to see accomplished. Most notably & urgent 2 Presidential candidates that are FIT FOR OFFICE. But they refuse to do any of it because they have no incentive. So if we could get RFK to 20% (he won't) we could scare the Major 2 parties into doing something. ANYTHING that can establish hope for our system of government. 

Look at Ross Perot. At one point he was polling 28% & ahead of Clinton. He ended up with 18%. But that Administration ended passing more than the Obama, Trump & Biden administration.

Not to mention we could force the 2 Major parties to go back to 2008. Where our choices were an Experienced & Heroic man & a man who represented hope for so many.

16 years we went from Hero's & Hope to Hospice & Criminals."

I would be a CEO for a small corporation for next to nothing to build my experience or to give back to my city (work for a regional company or non-profit). Utilizing my skills to make a company better would be worthwhile, rewarding and if the basic income is high enough, I wouldn't have to worry about saving for retirement, so I wouldn't need a lot to live, so the wage could be pretty low. I feel like I'm not the only one, and that competition among talented Managers would bring the price down they would need to pay. As a professional Manager, I have a bias of course as I know I could perform the next step and believe there is ample competition who also could, but I think it would apply to a lot of professions. I'm sure many of us would be willing to take the next step up for very little money if our expenses were largely covered. 

On the other hand, McDonald's is such a popular food item I am certain they would keep existing, even if they had to raise prices to pay workers more to attract them, but the work is hot, monotonous, and you risk oil burns and other hazards. I would take the job tomorrow if it prevented, you know, starving to death, but otherwise I would literally never do it. You could offer my $200,000+ per year or more (on top of UBI), and if I knew I had my retirement and living expenses covered by UBI, I would never be willing to take it compared to my current profession, even if my wage was cut meaningfully. 

I believe that over-time, the prices would settle where positions like Fry-cooks, Roofers and Nurses would be higher than Airline Pilots, College Professors and Managers, despite how much the free market currently pays the latter positions, as they are prestigious, mentally engaging, but ultimately not physically demanding or dangerous.

We've been talking for some time now. We've gotten to the point where he says that he wants to be serious with me. I'm looking for a serious relationship but I have some reservations. I don't know if they're justified.

To start, he's a well educated guy with a great job but as a result he doesn't have experience with women. Which is not a problem for me except that I worry we might not be aligned sexually. He was dating a girl for almost a year and they never had sex and only did pecks for kissing. Apparently, he tried but he kept going soft. Which happened to us as well. It made me feel very sad when it happened and the thought of us not having a decent sex life made me feel very sad. 

I tried getting him to read about kissing and I tried making out with him but he told me that he thought it was pointless and didn't think he liked kissing and therefore wanted us to maybe find an alternative. That made me very sad because I love affection. I worry that being with him would feel emotionally and sexually dry.

He admitted that he doesn't think he's very expressive which didn't shock me considering that he's a nerd but I wanted him to have more desire and urge then I've noticed. He says that he feels awkward and uncomfortable seeing naked porn. The way he gets off is by watching pretty girls on YouTube doing hypnosis. I wouldn't mind that too much if I felt like he was also ""normal"" and would get off on actual sex videos. 

He tries to make it up in other ways by being thoughtful and accommodating. I appreciate him for it but I feel like I really might need an emotional/sexual connection. And I would really like if we could have fun and exciting sex. I'm worried that I would have to accept what I would consider to be lightly interesting sex because he may not be able to bring himself to open up to a whole lot more. 

He also mentioned to me how it wouldn't mean much to him how he thought I felt because it would be my responsibility to leave if I wasn't happy. I understand it might be him trying to be respectful and treat me like an adult but to me that kind of mentality comes off very cold. 

I'm torn because I do like that he's able to acknowledge when he could be better and he has been compensating for where he is lacking by being very nice and thoughtful. I'm just not feeling the type of excitement and happiness that I wish that I was feeling. I feel tense and anxious about us. I like him as a person but things don't exactly flow between us. 

I think if the feelings were reversed I don't think he would be as compassionate and merciful. It's hurting me. I think he's nice and I like so much about him but I don't know if I can be in a sexless relationship. He said he's attracted to me. It's just a turn off that he gets soft or says he doesn't like kissing same with him getting soft. He says he feels anxious. he doesn't think he wants to go through with it and he's not sure when. He was with the previous girl for 7 months. Please let me know what you think. I'll be happy to answer anymore questions that you may have.

I wrote this in 2021 right as I was about to get my flu shot after having been an extreme anti-vaxxer. 

But this resurfaced this week and I wanted to post it here. I now speak full time as an advocate for how to communicate kindly with patients about vaccine fears. Here’s the old post! 

“I was the anti-vax measles costume Karen, and now I’m pro-vax

Hi. I'm Heather Simpson. And this is the story of how I went from being a hardcore anti-vaxxer to a pro-vaxxer.

You probably don't know who I am, because I am a nobody to most people. But back in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, I was a viral anti-vaccine ""influencer."" 

Could not sound more cringe if I tried.

I was fully vaccinated as a child. In 2011 I barely poked myself with antique jewelery and I ran to my doctor's office to get a tetanus shot. I was pro vaccine because I was raised to be.

And then one day....fear crept in. It came in the form of an advertisement dedicated to an anti-vaccine documentary series. My husband and I wanted kids, and I knew this subject was important, so I caved and dumped $200 into the series. 

The series, as you can imagine, described how vaccines are linked to almost every single bad condition you can think of. And, as a young woman preparing to enter motherhood, I didn't know any better. They fed me fear and I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was, from that point on, convinced that vaccines could and would cause autism, SIDS, autoimmune diseases, and death in general.

I continued to study anti vaccine theories. You can find anything you want to support your claim, if only you set your mind to it. And boy did I find some things. I mostly found an abundance of fear based stories that terrified me. I decided I was never letting a vaccine near my child or I. 

Ever.

When my child was born in 2017, we gave her the vitamin k shot (which I was scolded by some anti-vaxxers for, and was told it caused her to have health issues) and we opted to give her no vaccines. I was confident in our decision, and so was my husband.

When she was about 18 months old, or the Winter of 2019, I started posting on Facebook about my vaccine hesitancy. To be honest, that was a lie, as I was not ""hesitant""...I KNEW I didn't like vaccines. But I figured looking ""hesitant"" would make me seem less crazy. When I first posted my views and hesitations on vaccines, my post got shared several hundred times.

I was shocked. Friend requests started pouring in. I didn't know what was happening. So I kept posting my views on vaccines, people kept sharing my posts, and my audience grew. It was wild and completely unexpected. I had no idea that this world of anti-vaccine moms and dads existed on social media.

They were so supportive and I made life long friends that I will always treasure. This whole experience was worth it if not just for the friends I made.

Fast forward to October of 2019 when I dressed as the measles because I was ""trying to think of the least scary thing I could be for Halloween."" Yall, I am taking this moment to openly tell you I was the worst. 

The. Actual. Worst.

It didn’t even look like measles. It looked like syphilis.

And then it went viral. Like, real viral.

It blew up on both Facebook and Reddit, and several national news oulets picked it up. I got death threats and people begged me to kill myself. It was bad. I did it to myself and I should never have dressed as something so heartless, but it was bad. I was shaken up quite a bit.

A few months later, however, Febraury of 2020 arrived. I started to feel different about things. I was relying on western medicine to treat my endometriosis, I had just had surgery, and had been studying vaccines from a different standpoint. I started to soften my anti-vax views. But when I posted about this softening of my views, a lot of the anti-vax crowd lost it on me. They were furious and just plain cruel. 

It was then that I realized a lot of them are very cult-like, because they will cast you out if you don't have an identical belief system as them. Don't get me wrong, there are MANY of them that are not this way, in whom I love and adore. But a LOT of them are militant about their anti-vax beliefs. They claim to be ""pro medical freedom"" but will tear you apart if you choose a different medical decision than them. 

They bullied me so hard that I ended up in the ER with a panic attack. It was one of the worst weeks of my life....all because I was softening my views on vaccines. 

And then they ""cancelled"" me. Ohhhh, that online cancel culture. Gotta love it. 

But, if I'm being honest, it turned out to be one of the biggest blessings. Because I then had time to read, think, study and grow on my own without the ""group think"" influencing me.

And here I am now, planning to get my flu shot next week. I will also be getting my COVID vaccine. We will also be following our pediatrician's recommended vaccine schedule for our toddler. (I will not be discussing details as it is her private medical record.)

HOW DID I GET HERE?! 

Allow me to explain the magic that happened in those months of studying after being “cancelled.”

First of all, when approaching an anti-vaxxer, you have to realize that there are usually three types. Typically, one is a conspiracy theorist, one is scared, and one is an ex-vaxxer. Sometimes they are all three. Sometimes they are none of these. Each person is unique, but these are the three categories I’ve typically observed. Depending on what catergory they fall into is going to help you to know how to approach then.

My category? I was scared. Terrified. I did not want to inject something into my child if I thought it was going to kill her. I wanted to protect my baby with my life. This is most anti-vaxxers I know. They are fiercely protective of their children, just like pro-vaxxers, and only want to keep them safe. 

And, to clarify, this is not a bad person versus good person debate. There are incredible parents on both sides. 

But I digress. I kept reading horrifying anecdotes from moms who would say that their baby died the day after vaccines. Or that their baby stopped talking the week later. Or that their baby stopped walking the month after. 

What finally caused me to start to question my anti-vax beliefs was when I started digging into each of these anectdotes to find the real truth, instead of blindly trusting stories. I found some of them to be true, definitely. But...I started to see that a lot of the ""vaccine deaths"" were actually due to co-sleeping accidents or other underlying conditions. The timing was just very, very unfortunate. The whole situation was sad. But vaccines inevitably took the blame. 

And sometimes the vaccine DID cause the baby's death or disability. Vaccines have never claimed to be 100% safe. Sometimes your baby is one of the rare statistics. Which makes it even harder to have discernment when reading anecdotes and trying not to be overcome with fear.

I got to a point where I was so engulfed in every anecdote, that I lost my ability to critically think about a situation past my emotions. I would read a story, feel sick to my stomach, and swear to never vaccinate my child.

But the problem is, anectdotes without proof can get out of hand quickly in the hands of social media. Susie could have broken her leg on the swingset the day after her tetanus shot, but the way Susie's mom told it on social media was that Susie got her shot, and now she can't walk. Then this post gets spread 20,000 times. You now have a bunch of parents not wanting their child to get the tetanus shot because of COURSE they don't want to risk their child losing their ability to walk.

I was told that my child's sleep apnea was due to her Vitamin K shot, and that her heart arrythmia was due to the vaccines I received in my childhood. If someone develops an autoimmune disease 15 years after their vaccines, some anti-vaxxers will still blame the vaccines. People need a reason explaining why they are sick. People need a reason their kid is sick. Vaccines are the perfect scapegoat, no matter how long it has been since they received them.

The next thing that started pulling me away from the anti-vaccine movement was VAERS. Also known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. There was something like 48,000 events registered in 2019 alone. But here's the deal: parents can report anything with no proof. Causation does not have to be established to make the list. 

For example, these are real documented events on VAERS:

Gunshot wound, fight in school, frostbite, infection of mites, electric shock from a hair straightener, drowning, damaged hair from incorrect hair bleach mixture, sunburn, tested positive for an STD, sports injury (dodge ball), sports injury (football), suicidal ideation due to breakup with boyfriend, murder, motor vehicle accident, and many, many more.

Some anti-vaxxers use VAERS as one of their strongest arguments, but as you can see, by doing this they are able to claim that a sunburn is a vaccine injury. Which, it's just...not.

The next thing I started studying, and again what many anti-vaxxers use in their arguments, is the vaccine package inserts. They use it as a ""gotcha"" argument. I used this argument too, and was very confident in it. 

The problem, however, is that the pacakage insert is a legal document, one that has to list any adverse event that occured subsequent to the vaccine or during clinical trials or post-marketing studies. No causal relationship has to be proven, but they legally have to list everything that happens. The Gardasil vaccine insert, for example, lists gunshot wounds, car wrecks, and suicide as an adverse event.

Next, I examined the ingredients. The ingredients were the biggest thing I was afraid of. 

Let's talk about aluminum, because mercury for the most part has been eliminated from vaccines and aluminum has stolen the spotlight. Babies receive about 10 mg of aluminum their first six months of life if they are breastfed, 30 mg if the are formula fed, and 120 milligrams if they are soy formula fed. But they only receive 4 mg of aluminum from vaccines in their first six months of life on the current vaccine schedule. 

Scientists have also done research that shows that the aluminum from vaccines does not raise the blood level of aluminum already in your system, and that the aluminum from vaccines exits so quickly that half of it is gone from your body by the next day.

The second scary ingredient I forced myself to examine is Formaldehyde. It is used to inactivate the viruses and bacteria in the vaccines. Because of that, you are going to end up with some formaldehyde in the final product. The amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine, not exceeding one tenth of a milligram, is considered safe, as you already naturally have formaldehyde in your circulation. Formaldehyde is required in humans for the synthesis of thymidine, purines, and amino acids-which are all necessary for the formation of DNA.

Everyone has detectible formaldehyde in their bloodstream, or about 2.5 micrograms per milliliter of blood. If you take an average weight of a 2 month old (11 pounds) with an average blood volume of 85 milliliters per kilogram, the total quanitity found naturally in that infant's blood would be about 1 milligram. 1 milligram of formaldehyde is ten times that which is in a vaccine. 

And for the third scary ingredient I examined, we have Polysorbate 80. Anti-vaxxers believe this chemical will open the blood brain barrier (BBB) up and allow aluminum to slip through into the brain. The problem with this, however, is that it is physically impossible for that to happen. But opening up the BBB is not as simple as it sounds. Assuming a vaccine contains 50 mcg (HPV vaccine, for example), a 10 pound baby would have to have dozens upon dozens of vaccines injected straight into its carotid artery to have even a CHANCE at opening up the BBB. Polysorbate 80 is also a very unstable chemical that gets attacked by esterases in your tissue at a very fast rate, and has a half life of 1.07 hours. (1,2)

But ultimately, what finally changed my mind, was having people reach out, listen to my fears, and talk to me. The thousands of mean comments didn't change my mind. In fact, those comments made me think I was even more in the right. If I had enemies, after all, then I must be doing something right. Those awful comments had the oppopsite effect of the pro vaccine person's intentions.

But when friends calmly and patiently explained the science to me, showing they cared more about me than about changing my mind, my mind started to open up to the fact that I could be wrong.

The final straw was when, through a series of my own health events that caused me to be hospitalized, I was treated with a ton of compassion by doctors. The doctors that were supposed to evil. It dawned on me that I am definitely not a conspiracy theorist at all. 

There is no way that thousands of doctors and scientists are out to kill or maim our kids. It's statistically impossible. Most of them are amazing people with huge hearts for kids. 

Wish me luck on my journey-I am looking forward to seeing where it leads me.”

Anyway, it’s now 2024 and I’m so happy that I changed my mind. The people I’ve met along the way are genuinely incredible. Please never give up on anyone!

I do agree that Crypto has a lot of problems however I critically support it unless some things are addressed.

The main thing that crypto addresses to me is that it takes power away from fintech who currently do not have enough regulation and oversight. The main thing that I dislike is how currently any bank or ecommerce platform such as paypal,cashapp,venomo and so on can currently ban anyone they want for whatever reason they want. 

If they wanted to ban every single environmentalists just for being an environmentalist they theoretically could, obviously they probably never will I am not saying they will but they could and I dislike the idea they can. 

  
There are some other reasons but I like to keep this post a little light so I can flesh out relevant points in the comments. "

the problem is these things can't be proven. the statement 'everyone has a right to absolute free speech' is unprovable and unfalsafiable, because we made rights up.

this is especially apparent in tge abortion debate.
pro-choice people will often say things like 'fetuses don't have a right to life' or 'the mothers right to life outweighs the fetuses right to life'

pro-life people will often say the exact opposite of those things.

some people will take these arguments further, for example I've seen some pro lifers argue that a fetus is technically a living human being, and therefore has the right to life because all living human beings have the right to life.

these are terrible and unconvincing arguments. I've literally never seen someone be convinced by something like this.

I think it's generally better to argue based on outcome. for example, instead of arguing that fetuses don't have the right to life, argue about why banning abortion would cause harm, and instead of arguing that fetuses have the right to life, argue why abortion causes harm."

There's an argument for anti-natalism that i can't seem to get around, and it's a simple, stupid analogy.

Is it ethical to enter people involuntarily into a lottery where 99% of the people enjoy participating in the lottery but 1% are miserable with their inclusion?

Through this lens, it would seem that continuing society is like Leguin's Omelas, or like a form of human sacrifice.

Some amount of suffering is acceptable so that others can become happy.

Of course, the extrapolations of this scenario, and the ramifications of these extrapolations are...insane?

I'm kind of withdrawn from society and friendships because i find that adding my former positivity to society in general to be unethical. Obviously, this kind of lifestyle can be quite miserable.

I find myself inclined to be kind/helpful where i can be, but then i find that these inclinations make me sad because doing ""good' things seems to be contributing to this unethical lottery perpetuating. Feeding a system of cruelty by making people happy...

Being a 38 year old ascetic is also miserable... can't seem to find the joy in things...but i'm not here to ask about gratefulness and joy, just giving some explanation into why i'm asking this philosophical question."

Highlights from Year One • ⁠Reversed Trump's Muslim ban • ⁠Historic Stimulus Bill passed • ⁠Ended the war in Afghanistan (Set in place by Trump\*) • ⁠Reduction of poverty levels by 45% along with reduction of child poverty levels by 61% by the first 6 months • ⁠5 Rounds of cancellation of student loan debt totaling almost $10 billion • ⁠Passed largest infrastructure bill in history • ⁠The unemployment rate dropped from 6.2% when Biden took office to 3.9%, the biggest single year drop in American history. (This was also affected by COVID quarantine ending.) 
2. Year Two Highlights from Year Two • ⁠The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 • ⁠3 Additional rounds of student loan debt cancellation (8 rounds so far), totaling up $35 billion for 20-40 million Americans • ⁠First major gun legislation in 30 years • ⁠CHIPS Act to protect American supply of semi-conductor chips • ⁠$62 billion worth of health care subsidies under the ACA (Obamacare), capping insulin at $35 • ⁠Allows Medicare to negotiate 100 drugs over the next decade, and requires drug companies to rebate price increases higher than inflation • ⁠Unemployment at 50 year low 
3. Year Three Highlights from Year Three • ⁠Got republicans to publicly take Social Security and Medicare cuts off the table by tricking them during the State of the Union • ⁠6 More rounds of student loan debt cancellation (14 rounds so far), totaling up to $127 billion • ⁠As of October 2023, 34 straight months of job growth, longest stretch of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s • ⁠Child poverty rates fall from 12.6% to 5.8% due to Biden's Expanded Child Tax Credits, 2.9 million kids escape poverty • ⁠World's best post-pandemic recovery, doubles all nations except Japan • ⁠Created 14 million jobs since he took office - More than any president in history did in four years (and its only been 3 years) • ⁠Black unemployment rate lower under Biden than any other administration (4.7%) - Compared to black unemployment under Trump was 2nd worst number in history, reaching over 16% • ⁠Diversity in justice: Majority of Biden’s appointed judges are women, racial or ethnic minorities – a first for any president • ⁠Rail companies grant paid sick days after administration pressure in win for unions. Most people will only remember that he forced rail workers to go back to work in December 2022, even now that will be the top answer if you google ""Biden Railworker Deal"". But most people do not know that the Biden administration continued to pressure the rail corporations and work with the unions so that in June 2023, the corporations capitulated and gave the rail workers what they wanted. Biden knows how to work politics and knows that the real work isn't done with the cameras on you for a soundbite, but in the background where people can debate without a fickle public watching every move. 
4. Year Four (so far) Highlights from Year Four • Another round of student loan cancellation, $1.2 billion this time, 15 rounds so far, totaling more than $128 billion • Growth shatters expectations: GDP expands 3.1% - a year beginning with heavy odds of a recession • ⁠Post-pandemic recover still leading the world by far • ⁠Plan to modernize American ports • ⁠Rescinds Trump-era ""Denial of Care"" rule that allowed health care workers to deny medical care to patients because of their personal religious or moral belief • ⁠Violent crime drop significantly since 2020 • ⁠$5.8 billion to clean up nation’s drinking water and upgrade infrastructure"

0,2024-07-19,CMV: Jesus survived the crucifixion and lived out his days in Kashmir. ,u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e70gd2/cmv_jesus_survived_the_crucifixion_and_lived_out/,changemyview,"Jesus was never crucified and died. A person must die on the Jewish cross for at least 48 hours, though there have been documented instances of people hanging there for nearly six days without passing away. Jesus could not have died on the cross because he was taken down from it after just six hours. A wealthy supporter of Jesus and Pontius Pilate plotted to have Jesus crucified as late as possible on Friday because Jews observe Shabbat, which forbids any activity on Saturday. Everything comes to an end by Friday evening.

It was arranged that Jesus would be crucified late in the afternoon and brought down before dusk.While Jesus was still on the cross, a soldier speared his body, and blood and water oozed out of it.

The incident is recorded in the Gospel of St. John: ""But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."" This has led to the belief that Jesus was alive on the cross, because blood does not flow out of a dead body.

He was still alive, even though the amount of blood that had spilled out of his body may have rendered him unconscious. He would then be kept in a cave, and his body would be taken by his followers before the Sabbath ended and the Jews hung him once more. After the tomb was discovered to be empty, Jesus was taken out of Judea as soon as possible. He relocated to India after his health and healing returned, and he lived a long life—one hundred and twelve years—in Kashmir.

The fact that both Jesus and Moses passed away in Kashmir is a strange but lovely coincidence. I have visited both of their graves. Since those are the only two graves that do not point in the direction of Mecca, the graves provide more than enough evidence.

Muslims bury their dead with their heads pointing towards Mecca; thus, all Muslim graves worldwide point towards Mecca, and Kashmir is a Muslim country.

Not only do these two graves not face Mecca, but the writing on them is in Hebrew, which is not a language spoken by the Mohammedans. Jesus' name is written exactly as the Jews pronounced it: ""Joshua."" The Jewish name ""Jesus"" was converted to Christianity. Jesus's grave is undoubtedly his.

Because they are located in the same location, Pahalgam, very close to one another, only one family has been caring for both graves over the centuries.

They are Jews, and they always will be Jews, so I needed their assistance to have the writing on the graves read to me.

In Kashmir, Moses had gone in search of a group of Jews who had become disoriented while travelling from Egypt to Jerusalem. His main worry upon arriving in Jerusalem was the tribe that had vanished into the desert. After his people had settled in Jerusalem, he set out to find the lost tribe, which had made its home in Kashmir. Moses lived and passed away in Kashmir, where the people are primarily Jewish (although Mohammedans eventually forced them to convert).

Since it was then known that Moses had discovered the lost tribe in Kashmir, Jesus also travelled there. The gates of Judea were closed; he would hang once more; Kashmir was the only place he would find people of the same language, the same mentality, and where he would not be considered a stranger. So his visit to Kashmir made sense.

However, he had gained knowledge. He had given up on the notion that he was God's only begotten son, for fear that these Jews would also have him crucified. He renounced his claim to be the messiah. He resided in Pahalgam with a small group of close friends and supporters.

Because Jesus referred to himself as ""the shepherd"" (Pahalgam means ""the town of the shepherd""), the town was named for him. Therefore, Jesus and his companions lived in a small colony around the tomb of their ancestor, who established Jewish tradition.

Jesus never heard of Christianity and lived his entire life as a Jew.

However, the remaining disciples in Judea succeeded in crafting the narrative of the resurrection. Furthermore, it was impossible to demonstrate it in any way. They were unable to produce Jesus; if he had been raised from the dead, where was he? Neither could the opposing side provide proof of what had occurred.

There was a Roman soldier on duty around-the-clock, so there was no chance that anyone else could have removed the enormous rock that had been placed over the cave's mouth, making it impossible for Jesus to have done so.

However, Pontius Pilate saw that Jesus was completely innocent and opposed Jesus's crucifixion from the start. Though they are not illegal, he has some strange ideas. And what harm does it cause to an individual? Let someone enjoy themselves if they believe they are God's only begotten son. Why get upset and why bother him? If someone claims to be the Messiah and to have brought the message of God, then by all means listen to them; if not, by all means do not. However, there's no need to execute the man.

However, Jesus had to learn his lesson the hard way. He and his group led a very quiet life in Kashmir, praying, living in harmony, and giving up on trying to make a difference in the world. Furthermore, Kashmir was so remote from Judea that the account of Jesus' resurrection among his disciples gained significance there.

Thus, I would say that while a resurrection of sorts did occur, it was more of a conspiracy. However, Jesus lived a long enough life to not die on the cross or in the cave where he was imprisoned."

193,2024-07-19,CMV: Airport security in its current form should be abolished,u/macnfly23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e721d8/cmv_airport_security_in_its_current_form_should/,changemyview,"This is a fairly new view but basically my belief is that airport security in its current form should be abolished and replaced by a more casual bag check for any obvious prohibited items.

Two airport terrorist attacks come to mind. The one [in Brussels in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_bombings) and the one in [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Atat%C3%BCrk_Airport_attack). These two attacks demonstrate to me that if someone really wants to commit an attack they can just do it before the security check. What difference does it make to protect planes from being attacked if attackers can just attack people before? That also goes to a wider point that I don't think airport security checks deter someone with a general intent to attack. If someone is intent on attacking they can do it somewhere where there aren't security checks and where there's still a lot of people (a train, a bus, a shopping mall, a busy city center, etc.)

I won't get into the theories that security checks aren't even that effective and miss out on things as I don't know enough about them.

Finally, I get that for many they'd rather waste more time and have to come to the airport early (wouldn't it be great if you could just go, leave your bags and directly to your plane) rather than face a risk of an attack on their plane but my view is that it's disproportionate to the potential risk. I once saw someone suggest that there should be ""security"" flights and ""non security"" flights proposed and while I don't think that would make sense financially or logistically I feel like it'd be interesting to see how many people would choose not to wait in line and come to the airport early in exchange for a slightly higher risk of there being an attack.

I also know about TSA Pre-Check but that's only in the US though either way that technically does change ""airport security in its current form"" which is my view so I'd be fine if TSA Pre-Check was extended to everyone basically and made even less burensome."

Feathers are used for flight. Yes, some species of dinosaur eventually evolved into modern day birds, but there was no reason for them to evolve feathers until they could use them to, at a minimum, glide safely to the ground from higher heights. The evolutionary precursors to dinosaurs were called archosaurs, and resembled large lizards. As far back as I can see, there was never an ancestor to T-Rex that flew.

Some animals like penguins use feathers for insulation, but the environment during the Mesozoic Era was warm and dinosaurs were unlikely to have died of hypothermia. 

Yes, there are feathered birds that don't fly, but the feathers of an ostrich are vestigial from a time when they were able to fly. Depicting T-Rex and other large dinosaurs as feathered feels like a retcon to reinforce the idea that dinosaurs evolved into birds rather than having any sensible scientific basis.

I would change my view if anyone could show me direct physical evidence of large, feathered dinosaurs or possibly even for a strong enough hypothetical argument for why evolution might put a survival stress on dinosaurs to develop feathers."

0,2024-07-19,CMV: getting a college degree in America is way too easy. We should make it harder to get in and easier to get kicked out. ,u/IMissBarrackObama,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e79itz/cmv_getting_a_college_degree_in_america_is_way/,changemyview,"I’m a semester away from graduating with a dual B.S.s in Aerospace and Mechanical engineering at a mid-tier state university; and I’m planning on doing and M.S. in aero at the same university. I’m reflecting back on the past 8 semesters and frankly, I’m shocked at how easy and undemanding college has been.

To start, I feel like I don’t know shit. I’ve passed every required class with about 50% As, 30% Bs, 20% Cs (so obviously not a star student). Problem is I feel like there’s really basic stuff I have no idea about. For example, if you asked me to do basic dynamics or cyclical stress and fatigue calculations, I wouldn’t even know where to start. But I still passed dynamics and machine elements with As. The scary thing is  nobody else I know can do any of that either.

There’s many problems I notice. To begin, nearly every course has been graded on a curve (the scores are redistributed to show how each student compares with the best in the course, or something like that). This makes no sense because it allows students to pass regardless of whether they understand the material or not. For example, in aircraft design I studied my ass off to get the top score but it was still only 77%. The prof redistributed the grades so a 75% basically gave you a 100% and the new passing grade was something like 45%. This is ridiculous, the prof is basically certifying that I’m 100% competent at aircraft design and that people who score a 45% are sufficiently good at it. WTF??? (In this case this is the only undergrad course the prof teaches, he mostly teaches grad courses so he misjudged how long the final should be.) But still a 45% on the final means you should retake the course. I personally saw the same thing happen in control theory, machine design, and even basic courses like analysis, thermo, and dynamics.

Cheating is also a huge problem. Most of the top students in the program chegg every homework set, find previous exams, copy homework etc. This is reflected in that their grades are also mid 70% for every class; but it becomes 100% with curving. Also their grades are padded with crap like easy pop quizzes, homework completion grades (i.e. 100% for turning in work even if it’s all incorrect) and in aero fluids lab 20% of the grade was attendance. WTF???

The department has this weird fixation on passing as many students as possible. The semester I took machine elements I barely got by  with a C (50%). Course covered a huge amount of material and there was a final project that I spent like 100 hours on. The prof failed like 35% of the class. The department got angry with the prof. He was replaced and now the course covers only half as much material and the project is a joke. The passing grade is still 50%. Again WTF???

Part of the reason I’m not a top student is cause I do a lot of extracurriculars. This year just 1 other guy and I built a whole DBF plane and wrote the entire report. I also helped design a drone for another competition. I had to lose some attendance points and didn’t finish hw because of this. I missed out on big scholarships that went to students who get mid grades on exams but turn in every hw and get full attendance; but I can guarantee they don’t know shit.

My family is originally from South America. My parents studied economics and computer science. My grandfather studied mechanical engineering and got a scholarship to finish his degree in Germany. They tell me when they were studying, the whole of their grade was assigned based on a single final exam. They’d never heard of curving before. You either know the required material or you don’t. If you don’t you repeat the course. Also you could get kicked out of a program super easily for being slightly below average. You also needed to be good to actually get into a program. The fact that you can get guaranteed admission to an engineering program with a 25 on the math ACT and a 2.75 high school GPA is absurd. There’s too many people in my program.

Is this just an America thing? I’m worried for my future as an engineer and for America if this is normal. I can't comment on what it's like for other majors but from what I've seen its just as bad if not worse. "

92,2024-07-19,CMV: Warhammer 40k is poor satire,u/page0rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e7a220/cmv_warhammer_40k_is_poor_satire/,changemyview,"To start, I'm happy to admit my familiarity with the setting is casual. I don't play any of the board games, have little interest in most of the video games, either. Most of what I know is from reading a half dozen Horus Heresy books, browsing wikis, and conversations with fans. If there are obvious things I'm missing, I'm open to that. Though, I'll also say that if you have to dig into obscure lore from short paragraphs written in the margins of old physical codex books or back issues of White Dwarf to ""get"" the points of the setting, then it's still probably not doing a good job 

So, in the 41st millennium, the universe--and humanity in particular--has descended into brutal wars of survival on every possible front. Once, there was a big special guy, the God Emperor, who spent tens of thousands of years trying to orchestrate an ascension, an escape, for his people, but due to the meddling of various Chaos gods, just as he was in the middle of his great crusade to unite all his people under the rule of order, he was betrayed by his favoured sons and mortally wounded. Ever since, he exists at the brink of death, sitting on his golden throne. Without his guidance, and against his wishes, humans have stagnated, become theocratic fascists who spend as much time trying doing silly superstitious (or are they?) rituals and burning heretics as they do fighting their enemies, with no real ambitions to make anything better 

And that's all fine. As plot, it works well, and for sure there are fits and starts of poking fun here and there. Like, the fact that the Emperor of Mankind was kind of a huge piece of shit, who was too busy trying to do intergalactic genocide and create his psychic mind palace to, like, give his ""favoured sons"" a thumbs up and a hug every now and then, destroying thousand of years of his perfect planning overnight. That's fun, in its own way. It works. All the stuff about the space marines becoming hyper religious technophobes because they can't move on from worshiping the one guy who constantly told them worship was bad has some charm. The ""grimdark"" aesthetic itself is neat, but also reveals the flaws in the foundation. It's the cosmology of Warhammer that undermines it

Being over the top as a joke is fine, and leaning in to bad systems to show that they suck is also good. The problem is that Warhammer can't wink at us. You take something like the Starship Troopers movie, which also has a future of fascism, and even tries to make it look good. But it also tells you what's going on, it lets you know that the humans here aren't the good guys because they're the ones invading territory. They are the cause of the problems, and using the blowback as justification to perpetuate all the bad things they wanted to do anyway. That's important. It's also important that, because of that, it doesn't have to be that way. These people could live in a democracy and have peaceful relations with those around them, and clearly that would be better for everyone 

And then you have 40k and you have Chaos and the Warp. Everything else, the orks and the Tyranids and the space elves. They are enemies of humanity, but humanity could be fighting them or not in plenty of different ways that are better or worse than all the terrible shit they're doing. But not Chaos. Just being aware that chaos exists makes falling under its sway likely, if not inevitable. That's a core feature of the setting. So, when you have a regime of secret police that go around executing people who looked at them funny one time, that seems like an extreme response, but the more of it there is, the less so that becomes. It's not just plausibly justifiable, but starts to become the rational response. You may not like it, but what else can be done? Helldivers will tell you the government had to ""put down"" a worker action in some factories to benefit the war effort, and you know what that means and how silly it is. 40k tells you that an Inquisitor had to exterminate all life on an entire planet because some of the people there started talking funny and, I mean, what else are they gonna do? 

There's no real alternative, and importantly, none of this is their fault. Humans create the dystopia everywhere else, and they could have not done so. That tells us something. Humans didn't create the warp, they didn't create the chaos gods. They're victims trying to defend themselves, using only the tools they have available. Could they do it better or nicer? Probably, but also probably not 

I know it's a problem in the community, the whole fascism thing, and how there are way too many unironic dorks being weird about that. But, honestly, this is Games Workshop's own fault. It's way too easy to justify anything because the setting itself implicitly sanctions ""evil"" as the status quo. If things can't be different, then it's hard to coherently critique anything ""bad"" going on. What's left is all the actually sincere heroism and badassery the theocratic fascists accomplish 

Anyway, that's my bit. I'm open to changing my mind"

Why is a soldier who falls off the wing of an airplane and breaks his back given more than I make in payments for life tax free, free healthcare, exemptions from sales tax and property tax etc etc 

Why should I, the taxpayer, have to starve and argue my case before social security disability just to get…$1,489 on average a month  …still have to pay taxes while a disabled va veteran gets $3,750 tax free a month, and doesn’t have to pay any taxes? How is that fair?

Keep in mind, only 10% of US military will ever see combat during their service according to NPRC.  

It also seems like many of those benefits have a LOT less stringent requirements than SSDI. For example, you can be “100% disabled va veteran” get all those fancy benefits and still have a full time job..if you try to make over the paltry 1500 they’ll cut your benefits on SSDI…

Considering we pay taxes to support all these benefits it kinda rubs wrong that they get to live on that whereas me and my family would basically have to starve …. Va loans and education benefits are another matter, but I think it would benefit all of society to have those benefits more widely available …"

Nevermind how doctors of all specialties are getting out of there because of the laws putting restraints on how they practice medicine. Bye bye access to medical care!

All the Muslims I see in Al Jazeera comment section talk about cleaning Israel from river to the sea. They don't even talk about cooperation and diplomatic ways to resolve. All they want is to fight with Israel. 

Palestine doesn't have a proper military. They have a bunch of terrorists fighting for them. Hezbollah is going to destroy Lebanon as they talk about bombing Israel. All these organizations derive their actions from Quran. Arabs decided to wage war on Israel in 1940s and lost brutally.

No doubt why Palestine is losing territories. Black September and 1980s plane hijack tells a lot about them. Such cheap tricks written in Quran won't help them."

They might acknowledge that animals have the capacity to suffer and have desires, but consider any action done to an animal as *amoral* simply because they aren’t human. 

I think this view is inconsistent and arbitrary, and that moral worth should be thought of as a *spectrum* rather than an on/off switch. That is, a chimp might be worth less than a human, but nevertheless worth *something*

During the process of evolution, the change between individuals in each generation is INCREDIBLY minute. While we have *constructed* a definition of species, it’s not like there’s a magical moment in which a Homo Heidelbergensis morphed into a Homo sapien

The distinction between species is a social construct that we use to categorize different creatures. It’s typically based on the capacity to interbreed and produce fertile offspring, but we could simply drop this category for something else if it became more useful for evolutionary models. 

Our universe doesn’t really categorize things. That’s what we do; there are simply organisms that change over time which we like to place into boxes for linguistic or communicative purposes. 


So if, one by one, we examine your parents, then your grandparents, then great-grandparents, etc. for hundreds of thousands of years, eventually we will arrive at a humanoid that’s not QUITE like us, but probably close enough for us to say “we probably shouldn’t kill this thing for fun”


Now just extrapolate this to all creatures. If what we value about human beings is why we give them moral worth (things like higher order cognitive skills and the capacity to suffer for instance), then the extent to which those apply to other organisms is the extent to which morality should apply. 

To CMV, I’d like to know why it isn’t arbitrary to place moral dividers based on the species of a creature.

The seeds of a Civil War are already planted. Non-negligible minorities already believe that force is justified both to restore Trump to the presidency and to prevent Trump from being president. A total of 17% of adults. That’s 44 million adults. Among them, 17 million own guns.

Everywhere I hear people downplay the likelihood of a civil war. People are too comfortable. Yeah, the people you know. You yourself, too.

Wouldn't using education/force to eradict such extreme thoughts a greater good for both the believer and the others?

I have an example. In the Dungan Revolt (Tongzhi Hui revoltl) of Chinese Qing Dynasty. The Hui people are essentially native Chinese who lately converted to Muslim. Some of them are following an extreme thought branch. So when there is conflict, it tend to be transforming into religous cleansing of non-believers unlike any other peasant revolts or warlords wars. The devastation is so enormous, the Han/Manchurian/Tibet/Mongle people had been massacred by the tens of millions at the start and eventually when General Tsao （yes, general Tsao chicken is using his name) quelled the revolt. The Qing Army and Han Miltia in return butchered most of Dungan people as revenge.  In affected GanSu and Shanxi provence the population death ratio is more than 75% and account for more then 20 millions.

What if the Qing dynasty push hard so that the extreme branch of the Hui religion never been able to spread? That could be view as oppress of freedom, but that could save tens of millions of civilian life. Is few dozens and their religous freedom is more valuable than the tens of millions? Is deprive the freedom to convert into extreme religion acctually saved the life for them and the others around them?  That is my question. 

Sorry for my poor English and grammer. Hope anyone can shed some light.

But first, let's assume for the sake of argument that he did, in fact, commit the rape. It begs the question: Why did he have to take such extreme measures in order to satisfy such a basic need? It's such an easy phenomenon, sex. Men and women are in plenty, and no one is required to commit rape.

However, because of the way society has viewed sex, it is now a major issue. It ought to be straightforward playfulness, and that's precisely what it is. There is no issue when two people are playing tennis together.

There is never any talk of rape in tennis; no one ever hears of someone being raped. There's no need to rape—you can play. In tennis, two players use both their bodies and their minds. There isn't a net between them, so what are they doing when they make love?

Contraceptives are essentially like a safety net. They turn the situation into a game, with that net providing a sense of security.

There was no net. Adam and Eve did not receive it from God. Maybe He was just angry and kept the net to Himself, but if He was going to kick those two unfortunate people out of Eden, He ought to at least have given them everything they needed to survive.

Society continues to push you to take sex very seriously. It continues to force you to repress your emotions. Repression has a limit, and beyond that point, energy takes over. For the simple reason that rape cannot assist a man in solving his problems, whenever a man commits rape, he is not acting rationally. His entire physiology is aching for joy, but the rape cannot grant it to him. He cannot receive the warmth, love, and openness he needs from rape. It just isn't the solution he needs.

However, you've run out of options. Because of what you have done to him, the man just erupts like a volcano. He ignores the repercussions when he sees a lonely woman. He forgets everything—he forgets the church, the court, the constitution, God, hell, and THE BIBLE. He stops being himself and his true self, almost becoming an animal.

Furthermore, the way the woman is screaming, shouting, and attempting to flee is not appropriate for a romantic moment.

It's okay to refer to it as a fight, but not as love. And he uses only physical force to push himself on the woman. When he tampers with another person's right to independence, he receives neither reward nor punishment—rather, he faces castration or fifty years in prison. This is the climax he experiences. All of this is the responsibility of society; the judge, the court, and the law are all representatives of society.

This is an extremely clever method of eliminating people. You want them to be criminals on the one hand, but you're also willing to punish them on the other. However, your punishment seems more like a form of retaliation than it does kindness.

Which category will you assign the judge who orders the man's castration to if he has committed a crime—rape? He is not distinct from a rapist in any manner. Society is exacting its retribution. The society is not being just; it hasn't examined the entire issue.

Examining the entire phenomenon, things become extremely complex: was the woman intending to be raped? If so, what would happen next? The same society that produces rapists also produces repressed women, who are so self-conscious of their repression that they retreat from friendly approaches. She had hoped that someone would come up to her and show her love, but whenever someone does, she pulls away because she has been socialised to believe that the person is ugly and a representative of the devil.

She naturally shrinks in fear when she realises that this man is suddenly no longer human and that the devil has taken control of him. But how much longer can she continue to shrink like this? She eventually becomes older and people stop coming up to her. She eventually begins gaining weight because, in situations where she is not loved, women tend to overeat. Overindulging in food can take the place of love.

You may have noticed this: you won't overeat and you won't ever need to go on a diet if you are in a very loving and harmonious relationship. You are filled to overflowing with love, so there's no need to keep stuffing yourself with junk. One feels so empty when there is no love. It aches to be empty, and you want to put something in that space. And the reason you choose food is that, psychologically, food and love go hand in hand.

From the mother's breast, the child simultaneously received nourishment and love. When the mother was feeling loving, she would offer him her breast; however, when she was feeling angry or unloving, she would take the breast away from him. And the first point of contact with another person's body was the mother's breast.

The obsession that all painters, sculptors, and poets have with the female breast is not unusual.

She had hoped that someone would come up to her and show her love, but whenever someone does, she pulls away because she has been socialised to believe that the person is ugly and a representative of the devil.

She naturally shrinks in fear when she realises that this man is suddenly no longer human and that the devil has taken control of him. But how much longer can she continue to shrink like this? She eventually becomes older and people stop coming up to her. She eventually begins gaining weight because, in situations where she is not loved, women tend to overeat. Overindulging in food can take the place of love.

You may have noticed this: you won't overeat and you won't ever need to go on a diet if you are in a very loving and harmonious relationship. You are filled to overflowing with love, so there's no need to keep stuffing yourself with junk. One feels so empty when there is no love. It aches to be empty, and you want to put something in that space. And the reason you choose food is that, psychologically, food and love go hand in hand.

From the mother's breast, the child simultaneously received nourishment and love. When the mother was feeling loving, she would offer him her breast; however, when she was feeling angry or unloving, she would take the breast away from him. And the first point of contact with another person's body was the mother's breast.

The obsession that all painters, sculptors, and poets have with the female breast is not unusual.

I would argue that all you really get is a reflection of the problem rather than a solution.

I’ll start by saying I would *actually* like to change my view, however as it currently stands I feel so strongly disconnected from the mainstream left on this topic for a couple of reasons. (I’m American btw if that helps contextualize my argument)

1) Palestine is not a progressive nation with Western legal standards and beliefs.

They certainly don’t have a thriving LGBTQ+ community or robust freedom of speech laws. Yet at NY and SF Pride two weeks ago, the streets were flooded with those same LGBTQ+ members enthusiastically waving the flag of Palestine, while the flag of Israel was banned. Persecution of gays is not treated as a crime there, and is often encouraged. Violence is oft preferred over arbitration and sponsored by the government, Israel is likely guilty of this as well, however, the PLO’s charter was vehemently antisemitic up until the Oslo Accords, and its still common to hear “From the River to the Sea.” It baffles me that most Westerners don’t realize that’s a call for genocide.

2) Palestine is not a good-faith actor internationally is not an ally to America in any capacity. Contrasted with the fact that Israel is one of our most important allies, why would we support their enemy?

Palestine’s actions and rhetoric have consistently hindered peace negotiations and strained relationships with other nations. On the other hand, Israel has been a long-standing ally of America, with strong political, economic, and military ties. Israel has consistently fought against militant radicalism alongside the US, Palestine has continued to move in that direction in turn. Israel has stood by us in the latter half of the of the 20th, and 21st century in standing against virtually all of our enemies, geopolitically it only makes sense we do the same.

3) Palestine shoulders the blame for much of the conflict in the recent century.

Supporting militant groups, launching the attack that started the current war, continually rejecting peace offers that would reconcile a two-state solution, using women and children as human shields, sending ballistic weapons into populated civilian centers during peacetime, need I go on. 

4) The Palestinian people would no doubt prosper under different national organization.

I think what irks me most is when people exclaim “Free Palestine” without understanding the implications. Okay— the Palestinians should have freedom. We can agree on that, but at whose expense?
Hamas is two planes short of the Taliban and the PLO is rapidly becoming the most corrupt governmental organization in the Middle East. Neither have the capability to effectively govern an independent Palestinian state that wont immediately degrade into chaos. For the purposes of peace, Israel occupying Palestine is probably the most effective way to pacify the threat. Israel has a substantial interest in seeing a neutralized and peaceful Palestinian state on their borders anyway, whereas Palestine has always rejected the notion of Jews getting any sort of statehood. (Im also generally going to trust the soldiers who wear a uniform and follow rules of war versus the ones the rape and murder hostage while hiding behind children to evade capture)


5) Both sides are bad, Hamas is evil.

I can already anticipate the most common argument against my belief:

“The support is showing support for the Palestinian people, not Hamas.” 

See, I call BS. Hamas was democratically elected, they have popular mandate. Im not saying it damns the entirety of Gaza, what I am saying however, is that when Nazism was supplanted in Germany and *they* began an aggressive war, the vast majority of people weren’t standing in solidarity with them. And both the Nazis and Hamas were political parties brought about by contemporary crisis.

Nowhere in this text have i extolled the virtues of Mossad, Netanyahu, and the IDF. However, in terms if geopolitics, human rights, and common sense, Israel is by far the better actor to support."

If fascism comes to America, the media, the radical right, voters, and foreign influences all share at least some blame. Now the Democrats too have only themselves to blame for failing to put up a fight against a convicted felon, a rapist, an insurrectionist, and a lunatic, for failing to prepare and throwing the towel.

This should have been an easy fucking win for the Democrats, but against all logic they have managed to fuck that up so badly they have failed the American people (and the fact the Republicans can't find anyone other than Trump to represent them also reveals how morally bankrupt and failed they are too).

Unless a miracle happens or somehow the Democrats get their shit together (I don't know how they'll do it), the Democrats are slated to lose, and it's their own DAMN FAULT. 

Allan Lichtman says dropping out Biden is a bad idea, but having Harris run as president according to his election prediction model could still work, and running anyone else will virtually guarantee a Democrat loss in November because of the loss of the incumbency. 

So really the Democrats are stuck in an almost lose-lose situation with no clear path forward 4 months before the election.

We are in full blown Constitutional crisis mode, and the lives of millions of Americans will be affected once Trump seizes power and throws the entire checks and balances system under the bus. 

I don't want to live under a hybrid regime/illiberal democracy/autocratic dictatorship, and I'm sure many people also don't want this. But it seems inevitable. It seems inevitable because the current system is dysfunctional and has been hijacked by moneyed interests, the wealthy, the elite, etc, who want nothing more than total and absolute control. "

0,2024-07-20,CMV: It is immoral for a man to ask a woman out on a date,u/AmazingAd7955,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e7xi6u/cmv_it_is_immoral_for_a_man_to_ask_a_woman_out_on/,changemyview,"Alright, I'll admit that's a bit of a crazy opinion. It's not an opinion I particularly want to hold, but one that unfortunately I have had to come to terms with based on the facts that I am aware of.

**Why do I think this?**

  
*Foundation*

If you ask people online, a lot of women will say that they don't feel safe or comfortable in our society. 

A lot of people will say that at least part of that comes from the fact that they have to deal with men making unwanted advances, whether it be from people they know in longer term friendships/acquaintances, or people they have just met at a bar/club/whatever.

I have absolutely no issues with people saying that. I can completely understand how if 10 guys approach you every day, however polite they are, it's going to be uncomfortable and it's going to make you potentially worry for your own safety if even one of the many guys who speaks to you is aggressive about it. 

I can also understand that it can be painful to have a friend catch feelings and then accidentally torpedoing a friendship when it isn't reciprocated.

Fine. It's not something I particularly enjoy accepting, but if that is how people feel, that is how they feel. That's  just life.

  
*Dilemma* 

Ok, so the big key point here and the reason I hold the opinion I do is this:

**There is no way to know for sure if your advance is wanted or not. Not sure enough to where you should be willing to risk that level of discomfort to someone else.**

Look, obviously if all men stopped approaching all women in all contexts, things would stop working very quickly- and that's because there are some amount of advances done in some contexts and in some ways that women will want. 

However, as much as you can choose to make a respectful advance that gives any person any number of outs, you still are unable to determine exactly how that person is going to feel until after said advance has been made. Women are not a monolith. Different people are going to want different things and have different standards as to what is acceptable.

What this means is that *even if a woman wanted a man to pursue a romantic relationship and was happy to be approached after the fact, any man making the advance has to be willing to risk said woman feeling unsafe and uncomfortable. Uncomfortable to be a hot enough topic for hundreds upon thousands of women to be talking about it.*

This is why I don't feel that ""just work out what said person wants"" or ""you can increase the chances of a positive outcome by approaching in x way"" to be a valid rebuttal to this point. I agree that you can *maybe* make an educated guess on how someone is going to react, but are you going to risk them feeling unsafe? Is that fair to them?

My answer is no. Of course it isn't fair. We're talking about 1 romantic relationship vs someone's ability to feel safe or potentially trust an entire gender. It's an unbalanceable equation. One side is clearly a much bigger issue.



*Where this leaves us and how my opinion could be challenged*

Obviously, this leaves us (read:me) in a bit of a predicament. Every man can look at every possible advance they could make and go ""Ok, well am I absolutely sure that this is going to go the way I think?"", and now no man could morally ask a woman out. Ever. 

Perhaps some people think that that's fine. I suppose antinatalists might be happy with the result. 

But as your standard common or garden 24 y/o male redditor, I would like to at least think that it is possible to engage with this in a way which isn't negative or hurtful. That would be nice. I don't like my opinion because the only moral path for me is to be permanently single. Which is like, fine, I guess, but I'd rather have the option to not do that if possible.

**The way you would pull apart this argument is by rebutting one of the following points:**

A) Making an unwanted advance against someone is immoral 

*I don't understand how you would refute this point. I don't want to hurt people :(* 

B) You can never be truly sure that your romantic advances are wanted

*Again, without a crystal ball, I'm not sure how you're refuting this, but I'm open to ideas.*

I guess you could also come up with something else I haven't thought of, however I am incapable of writing that in my post as I do not currently know what it is, pretty much by definition.

I thought about refuting some common counter arguments in the post, but I think that kind of defeats the entire point, so I'll save the discussion for the comments.

Looking forward to your replies :)"

She could say all the nice things but stay firm in that position.  He would likely drop out at that point. If he didn't, she could make the ultimatum public. This would catapult the public's awareness of her and pitch her as a candidate who does not put party politics before national interests. It's pitch her as a candidate who is reforming the party through shock, just like Trump did to the GOP. 

  
If a second Trump administration is as dangerous as many of us believe (and the Democratic Party continue to tell us), it's time to take risky actions to demonstrate that we put the United States above party politics. This would demonstrate that someone on this side is a bold leader...someone that can go toe-to-toe with Trump.

To change my view, I'd need to be presented with another scenario where there is a better chance to position a new candidate that will have a chance to beat Trump. I'd also need to be convinced that the Democratic Party is capable of making changes that allow us to put forward candidates who are not pre-selected.

That is to say, they are not swinger types or in an open relationship etc. 

The vast majority of the time, strippers give sexual attention (ranging from flirtation to lap dances) because they are getting paid to do so, not because they actually want to sleep with their clientele.

People who approach and flirt with others in night clubs, however, typically do want to sleep with the person they are approaching (especially men, who tend to do the approaching in these settings). 

It's fake attention vs real attention, in my view, and I'd be less upset about my partner paying for attention that will not lead anywhere than if they were getting unsolicited attention from people who would sleep with them that night if they could. 

I think, though I have mostly framed this as non-gendered, the contention is usually about men going to strip clubs (making their gf or wife jealous) and women going to night clubs (making their bf or husband jealous). 

And, just to get ahead of certain responses, let's ignore the whole trust and insecurity talk; we all know, ideally, partners should be able to trust each other in any situation and they should not be allowing insecurities to make them jealous. It just isn't that simple for many couples."

It's a distopia about genetically engineering. So basically Umbrea are modified in order to suit their pre-chosen role in society. They are educated to love their chosen job and not want to do anything else.

It sounds terrible, right? The problem is idk why. First of all, I think Aldous did a pretty bad job with Causality, since a lot of the problems that showed up in the book didn't seem to be related to the fact that everything is genetically engineered.

I'm not supporting all of the things in the Brave New World. But as I said, I am referring to the genetical engineering part. Why is sorting people into roles and sort of programming them to be good at it before their born is bad, even when making sure that they are happy with their role?

So in general I've head some people say also that scientifically we have the tools to do things like that in the real world, but genetical engineering is prohibited by law since it's immoral. For instance engineering an unbreo into being immune to cancer or accelerated cognitive action.

So I've heard some claims for the immorality of this who sound really stupid to me, for instance: Only the rich would be able to budget genetical engineering, thus expanding the socio-economic differences in society.

To me it sounds like something a little brother would say, claiming it's not fair to give something to me (that he can't have anyways) but not to him. It's not a f*ing slice of cake it's saving human lives.

Really I don't see why people are so strongly against genetic engineering. To me it seems like not that much could go wrong. So... CMV?"

Because it’ll take the war to the next level. I genuinely believe Russia wants Ukraine to strike inside of it. Russia wants its civilians to die. Even Ukraine launches attacks on Russian airfields, Putin’s media will claim that Russian children died.

Everything meaningful goes in his favor. He is an incumbent president not tainted by any scandal or any major unpopular domestic policy. His foreign policy isn’t exactly popular, owing to his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and unconditional support for Israel, but it’s not a total Jimmy Carter or LBJ level failure either. Biden is much more liked as a person than Trump is. The economy may be less than ideal but it’s not in free fall either. By every metric Biden seems favored to win. 

Trump on the other hand doesn’t have much going for him. He is a former president who lost reelection, was unpopular throughout his entire presidency, is hated by at least half the country, and whose foreign policy seemed very friendly towards authoritarians. 

Looking at it rationally, all Trump has behind him is noise from his loud base. You have to remember that trumps base is at most 35-40% of this country. Biden has no noise behind him because his supporters are unenthusiastic. But unenthusiastic doesn’t mean they won’t vote for him. He has been a decent president whose administration hasn’t made any catastrophic errors and isn’t hated by the general public outside trumps base, who really only hate him because he beat Trump. I believe voters vote retrospectively not prospectively, that’s why Biden’s age won’t be as big an issue as people think. It’s also why Trump was able to win in 2016 despite most people not thinking he’s of good character.

Noise isn’t everything. In 2016, I could have bet my life Hillary Clinton was going to win. People were already calling it before the election even happened. The Republican Party was in damage control mode, it was a question of how badly Trump was going to lose, not if he would. Yet Trump stunned the world because at the end of the day, people didn’t vote for Trump, they voted for a Republican administration because they were disappointed in the prior Democratic one. I think this election will be the same. The Republican Party is deeply unpopular and the voters will vote to continue the stability of Biden’s administration. Change my view so I lose sleep tonight over the prospect of another Trump presidency.

1,2024-07-20,CMV:  Overemphasis on pro-social behaviours is counter-productive,u/radoxvic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e802ss/cmv_overemphasis_on_prosocial_behaviours_is/,changemyview,"Pro-social behaviours include behaviors such as ""helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering"". In their essence, these behaviours are good for the collective, in that they retain the status quo and reduce social tension. They *can* indeed help individual people to a degree. Thus, they're inherently collectivist and too big of an emphasis on them is easily just as bad as domination od destructive anti-social behaviour.

It comes at the expense of individuals. Pro-""Pro-social-values"" people portray selflessness that leads to conformity as an utmost virtue, which we should all strive for at all times. Behaviour which breaks that mold is discouraged. It's embedded in all major religions for a simple reason - it creates coherent societies that by and large do not question status quo, and are complacent. One of the values often seen as pro-social is following the majority, which would equate these behaviours to herd mentality. Consequently, the individual is stifled in favor of a strong supportive collective, as they are forced to conform, give up their own autonomy in favor of helping others. 

A society that favors pro-social behaviour way too much will give the incentive to anti-social individuals to blend in, and disguise their actions as being helpful. So a dictator in a heavily collectivist society might ""give away money"" in a lush manner to bolster support, ignoring rational choices - just to further solifidy the idea of them being ""there for the people"". And seeing how pro-social behaviours are usually supported by empathetic individuals, it can lead to excuse of bad behaviour. 

I am asking this, after seeing a Tiktok that talks about Italian mafia. Most popular comments were all people stating how the mafia ""actually helped their communities"", implicitly ignoring the wrongdoings, or at least relativizing them. Solely because they had some pro-social elements to them, in minds of many, it can outshine the (extremely apparent) negative sides. I could list many such examples.

All in all, too much pro-social behaviour removes individual responsibility, creates complacency, reduces individual happiness in favor of collective feelgood, and ironically can lead to anti-social behaviour taking root, disguised as pro-social."

For example, as an American, I see a direct line from the end of the Cold War in the early 90s to the dissolution of American politics today. What changed? Without the USSR as the common enemy of Republicans and Democrats, now they have each founded enemy in the other.

Attempts to form a world government have failed twice, resulting in fractious, impotent bodies. That is because right now, most people see other nations, races, or religions as the greatest enemy.

That would all change in the event of an alien invasion. The need to unite all mankind to tackle this threat is the only true impetus that would lead to effective world government and a common purpose that would allow for humans around the world to fight together."

Only recently have we seen anything at all in terms of user experience improvements, and those are far from universal. 

The low cost carriers in the US are struggling - Southwest, Spirit, Allegiant, Frontier. Their profits have tanked as consumers have made it clear they’d rather have the better experiences of the legacy airlines. 

Ticket prices are exceptionally low for the vast majority of travel, especially domestically. Meanwhile first and business classes are virtually always the first to sell out. These used to be dominated by business travel, but as leisure travel has grown substantially, they are occupied by consumers wishing for a more luxury experience. 

It’s my belief that airlines have generally taken the wrong focus. They should be expanding the first and business class sections dramatically. People want food and drink options included, comfortable seats, etc. I believe most would pay more for that, as the market is currently showing. I also believe there’s a market for an even more high end first class product domestically. Exceptionally few routes offer pay down seats. Lay down routes are always sold out. There’s certainly a market who are willing to pay thousands for that experience as opposed to paying many tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for private flights. 

I’m generally across the country we’re seeing people opting for luxury over economy. Cars, houses, travel, etc have all gotten fancier, with less and less opting for budget options, given that incomes have continued to grow rapidly. "

Its more like, society pressures women into being monogamous so they attempt it but it barely works out.

Seems straightforward to me. 

But if a someone of the same height is complaining that their height is stopping them from getting dates, we don't accept this, but try to pin it on the short man's personality. There are certain things that a short height makes severely more difficult to the point. Just like basketball is in this category so is dating. Of course, I think a 5'4 man has a greater chance of getting a date than playing basketball on an official level. No doubts there. But there is a culture of denying just how steep that advantage is. 

I will say that every short man's situation is different. Given that women generally don't date men who are shorter than them, a 5'4 man in an area where a woman's average height is 5'5 or even 5'6 is going to have a much more difficult time than the same person in a place where the average woman's height is 5'1 or 5'2. 

I will also say that with the rise of the ""shortcels"" becoming a thing, it is totally wrong to delude them with ideas that they would have an easier time dating if they dumped their incel ideologies anyways. They should dump their awful ideas to become productive members of society in general but it's not like they'll have much easier times dating. 

Of course, there are exceptions and plenty of short men in relationships but when a short man is having trouble dating, the main culprit is most likely his height. "

I really don't need anyone. Wherever I go whatever I am doing people seem to need me more. I know I can be smart sometimes, funny sometimes, I have an insane intuition and can be creative as well. I find that I have been too kind to other just for them to like me. The problem is I never really realized how little others contributed to my well being. 

I am constantly barraged with messages from people requesting advice on things. From breaking up with someone to general depression and anxiety to more specific topics like body dysphoria. The problem is I don't have answers, all I have is band-aid solutions. Like anyone else humans were never created with an instruction manual so none of us truly know what we are to do or what we are capable of until we do it. 

I just feel sad because I always had held onto this hope that people can change and people can get better if I am there and can offer guidance. Over and over again it's been proven to me that most people if not all don't like breaking the boundaries of what stresses them out and rather fall back on old habbits to cope. You know that is fine too but the issue is they still ask for help. 

People are just too much and not enough at the same time. I am always been surrounded by negative people and I now know they've been a reflection of myself in a way. I grew up around narcissism and other negative personality types. Maybe some rubbed off on me but I always wanted to do good and be a good person.   
  
The other issue is that good is inherently subjective going back to the idea that none of us have the instructions to life. It kinda sucks there are no real standards apart from social norms and expectations to guide us. The problem is that a lot of these social norms and expectations are rooted in bad soil. People are herded into ideologies and lifestyles that help perpetuate and economy for the sake of capitalism? I guess? Idk, at the end of the day though people just haven't respected my ideas and my virtues for long enough. I have become fed up.  
  
All the advice and insight I can give and people still go and get back with that ex. They go back to their own versions of the answers in the form of habits. They heard what I said but it seems to always end with that and I am tired. Even if I am wrong which chances are I could be its something different. People just hate trying a new solution over a new one I propose and it legitimately makes me think society and people are just insane? Yes I guess I might be right on that insanity through doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different out come...   
  
Anyways, I do want to restore hope that there are people out there that don't need lies to comfort themselves and stare in the void along with me the endless nothingness that is life. Please change my view that people can be there for me, even if I know that they never are when I need them and help me find hope again to want to help people that are going through difficult times.

I’m fully on board with this- there are a lot of great qualities men have historically possessed that women should learn from. My problem lies in the fact that there has never been a similar movement in regards to men integrating positive feminine traits into their lives. To this day, even in feminist circles, feminine traits are often thought of as silly, frivolous, and are generally not taken seriously. I love femininity in all it’s nurturing, beautiful, dark, soft, twisted, strong, mysterious, glory, and I think it’s high time men take a note or two from women; if not for any reason than because some of the most pressing concerns of young men in our time (loneliness, lack of meaningful relationships, lack of purpose, etc.) could all be mitigated by taking on more female traits. I’d also like to clarify that I don’t believe the levels of masculinity and femininity in a person are a zero sum game, and a person can increase one dimension without a necessary decrease in the other. There’s a trope about women turning a house into a home, and I think there’s something beautiful about that and I think proverbially, that is something America is missing; this place needs to feel more like home. People need to feel more like home. Those among the likes of Jordan Peterson talk about “making your bed” and “getting your house in order” which I’m all for. But sometimes, what good is making your bed if you’re an adult man with navy blue bedsheets? Alright, I’ve labored the metaphor.

But what really put the nail in the coffin for me was reading the story of Junko Furuta, and how Japan handled that situation. Minimal jail time for the perpetrators, one of the predators’ mom’s desecrated Junko’s grave, and Japan did absolutely nothing about it. No controversy, no outrage. Just another day in Japan. Living in apathy and blissful ignorance after that girl was mercilessly tortured and murdered, and letting them pretty much get away with it. And if you try to talk to a Japanese person about it today, they’ll blow it off as if it was nothing.

- The concept of an all-knowing, all-powerful God can provide a sense of accountability and motivation for moral behavior, which might be lacking in atheist frameworks.  
- Supernatural incentives like heaven and hell can be particularly effective for individuals who are more vulnerable to them, such as those struggling with addiction, poverty, or mental health issues.  
- A progressive Christianity can emphasize empathy, compassion, and social justice, while incorporating modern scientific understanding and critical thinking.

Note: I'm not advocating for a return to traditional or fundamentalist Christianity, but rather a reformed version that adapts to modern societal needs. This reformed Christianity explicitly rejects slavery and all forms of oppression.

What irks me is how willing the avg skeptic is to die on this hill. And even when not knowing HOW archeologists ""proved"" it was built for Khufu and in that time-frame.

Facts the average person does not know:

1. Not a single heiroglyph or artifact has been found in the Pyramid.
2. Not a single heiroglyph in ALL OF EGYPT has been found that even references ANY pyramid.
3. The evidence that it was built for Khufu(which is what they base the time of construction on)is grafitti that was scratched into the quarry from which the stones come from. A carving cannot be carbon dated, and there were other names scratched into the quarry. This is not the scientific method.
4.The estimated work force went from 100k workers, to 5k workers.
5. 2,500,000 stones in 27 years=253 stones laid and mortard in final position every day on a 24h shift. 

This equation is assuming that ALL 2.5 MIL STONES were ALREADY planned, mined, shipped, measured, cut, and finally placed next to the construction site ON THE FIRST DAY OF WORK. And all they had to do was slide it up scaffolding and mortar it.

So that 253 a day result is not even close.

0,2024-07-20,CMV: There is nothing inherently morally wrong about lying,u/monkeysky,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8ctn0/cmv_there_is_nothing_inherently_morally_wrong/,changemyview,"It is generally taken for granted that lying is a bad thing to do, and that it is only permissible under circumstances that ""balance it out"" in some way by having an exceptional benefit. However, I don't see any reason why lying should be considered morally incorrect on its own.

Obviously, deception can be used to harm people. This is often seen now because deception is a convenient way to make someone act against their own best interest, but it is demonstrably true that it can do the reverse, or that someone can be harmfully persuaded without lying as well. Like most forms of communication, it can be used to hurt, help, or under purely neutral circumstances. This is true whether you look at it in terms of intention or consequence. There is also a possible occurrence of emotional harm, where a person feels betrayed after being lied to, but this is a feature of the current social expectation of truthfulness, not of lying itself, and it is easy to imagine situations where a person can be lied to without experiencing any emotional harm (or, inversely, where a person can be harmed by the truth).

For lying to be inherently morally wrong, I believe there would need to be some sort of harm which is inflicted unavoidably by every act of lying, and I can think of two possible arguments for that being the case:

The first argument would be if you think that each person has the moral right to complete accurate knowledge about reality, regardless of the consequences of that knowledge, and that any action which impedes that right is harmful to that individual. I don't see any reason to agree with this proposition, though, and that belief itself would have some extreme and unintuitive conclusions that go against other conventional values, such as privacy.

The second argument would be that trust is valuable in general, and lying devalues or damages trust on one scale or another. Kant used a similar argument in an example for his own theory of the categorical imperative, where he stated that lying is logically self-contradictory because it erodes the same trust that it relies on to benefit the liar. I disagree with this in any case, though, because even if lying were fully morally acceptable there would still remain obvious benefits to telling the truth. If there is any value to trust, I think that value can just as easily be applied to skepticism, and a balance between the two.

If there are any other reasons I'm overlooking, I'd be interested in hearing them.

**TL;DR** \- Lying can harm people directly, but not in any way that is inherent to the act. It can prevent people from having a full and accurate understanding of reality, and it can generally limit the strength of trust, but I don't think either of those things can be seen as necessarily morally wrong."

227,2024-07-20,CMV: The discourse on sexual assault has gone too far.,u/tired_lover,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8dlgg/cmv_the_discourse_on_sexual_assault_has_gone_too/,changemyview,"(Incredibly controversial, I know.) 

Firstly, let me just say I’m obviously not talking about *serious* cases of sexual assault - things like actual rape, pedophilia, sex trafficking etc are all heinous crimes and obviously deserve to be condemned as such. I’m instead talking about less severe and more murky forms of SA - things like being kissed at a party by someone you didn’t know, being felt up by a partner you’re sleeping in bed with after you said you didn’t feel like having sex, etc.

I feel like theres this new idea that what used to be called “awkward moments” are now considered just as bad as full-on rape. Having someone slap you on the ass at an alcohol-fuelled party might feel gross and wrong, but is it really *that* life-altering and damaging? Not to mention so much of this discourse seems to treat human hormones as this on/off switch that can’t be influenced in any way by drugs, atmosphere, misinterpreted cues, etc.

And I say this freely as someone who has been both a victim of and committed acts of these “awkward moments.” I’ve had weird sexual experiences that I didn’t consent to, been kissed by random people, slapped on the butt, and so on, but I’ve also touched people inappropriately, made misguided attempts to hook up with someone, etc. 

The problem I see is that we are, at our core, sexual beings, and sexuality is an incredibly powerful and difficult thing to get a grapple on, so obviously mistakes are going to be made (especially so if you’re young and inexperienced.) In fact, I’d argue that unless you’re a nun or something it’s pretty much impossible to go through life without *some* awkward encounters, for both men and women. 

And again, I’m not talking about the more obviously terrible acts - forcing someone to have sex with you against their will, using a position of power/status to coerce others to sleep with you, etc. These are deeply wrong and should be punished. I’m just talking about the moments that might cross boundaries but usually have a far more innocent explanation than “he/she is a predator looking to exploit others no matter what.”

The only other alternative I see is that society eschews human sex entirely and we all become a bunch of shut-ins relying on future sexbots for pleasure, and nothing else. I mean honestly, with the amount of sexlessness being experienced by Gen Z and the incredibly arcane levels of consent education being promoted these days, it honestly feels like we’re already moving that way, but whatever. 

Anyway, that’s just my view. I’m fully prepared to be eaten alive in the comments. "

1.) Inauthentic Voting: You should support politicians who you feel support your core values, not because you want to want another politician to lose. Your votes aren’t actually representative, and they prevent you from actually thinking about your politician’s policies since you only want the other side to lose.

2.) Complicit In The 2 Party System: People have the audacity to complain about the 2 party system, yet they still choose to pick a “lesser between two evils.” They say that not enough people vote for third party, but guess what, if you all stop settling for the two main candidates and spread out, you would find other ones who more accurately represent you. This one is also important because it can sway centrists, moderates, and independents too.

3.) Bias And An Increase In Believing Lies: Voting for Biden/anyone who opposes Trump just because you hate him means you’re more likely to believe in lies going against him, and lies in favor of Biden. Political bias is imbedded in all of our psyches in some way, but they’re especially prevelant when you vote solely out of hatred and not for representation.

So yeah, while Trump definitely isn’t an ideal president, if you choose to vote against him, do it for the politician who represents you and not just out of settling for a politician you still hate. A third party candidate would be much likelier to win if we branch out our ideas more."

What I am proposing, and what has been proposed many times in the past, is that Halloween is changed to the last Saturday in October, so it's as close to October 31 as possible.

There is plenty of precedent for this. Several holidays or de facto holidays in the USA are already on fixed dates. The Super Bowl is always on Sunday. Easter is always on Sunday. Election Day is always the first Tuesday in November. Thanksgiving is always the fourth Thursday in November. So the idea of celebrating Halloween on the fourth or final Saturday of October is not uncharted territory.

Now, as my CMV says, what I'm looking for are good reasons not to do this.

Saying something like ""well it's always been October 31, so why change it?"" isn't a good reason. Saying something like ""Halloween is based on Samhain, so it shouldn't be fixed to a day!"" is also not a particularly strong reason because that festival was established before the modern Gregorian calendar.

Pros:

1. Saturday is a non-working day for many people. This means most parents will be home to take their kids trick-or-treating.
2. Saturday is neither a school day nor a school night. This means kids do not have to be at school, and don't have to be home early to get ready for school the next day.

Cons:

1. There are no studies I can find that suggest weekends are less dangerous for trick-or-treating in terms of things like drunk drivers.
2. I am looking at this from an American perspective, there might be good reasons against this from other cultural viewpoints. Please list them if they exist."
487,2024-07-21,CMV: You CAN be racist to white people,u/Calseeyummm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8hzgg/cmv_you_can_be_racist_to_white_people/,changemyview,"Why is there such an insane double standard when it comes to white people and non-white people on the subject on racism?

Why is a black or asian or latino, etc. person able to call a white person a racial slur without anyone batting an eye? But when a white person does the same, it's suddenly not ok? Why is that?

A racial slur is a derogatory term used against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. The N-word is a derogatory term used against black people. Cracker is a derogatory term used against white people.

Why is it ok to use one, but not the other? Why because of the colour of my skin is it ok for someone to say haneous things to me and make me suffer through it without being able to call it out because ""you can't be racist to white people"" or some other unjust reason?

Racism is discrimination against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. If you discriminate against any culture, nationality or ethnicity then you are racist. It doesn't matter what country, ethnicity or community you belong to, it is racist to discriminate based on those factors. You can be racist to anyone.

One argument I have heard many times is that white people can't experience racism because they ""systemically oppress"" other ethnic groups. Ok. Here's a hypothetical:

Let's say that tomorrow we are all transported back to the time where we were cavemen. No society, not system, no government. Nothing.

If a white person calls an Asian person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that falls under the definition of discrimination.

If an Asian person calls a white person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that also falls under the definition of discrimination. There is no ""systemic oppression"" excuse now. It's the stone age. No society, nothing like that. Just basic human emotions and conflicts.

It is racist to call a white person a slur the same way it is racist to call a black, Asian, Latino, etc. person a slur. And yet white people are forced to endure being called these things and not being able to call out the unfair and unjust treatment we are subject to.

I am so sick and tired of seeing the media pushing this false narrative that it's ok to hate white people. But if a white person said it's ok to hate any other race, they would be harassed to no end. It is really demoralising to see how we've just thrown basic human nature and common sense out of the window because it's a competition of who suffers more."

Intersectionality is a problem seeking more problems so that they can whine about the problem while trying to put crown on the head of the biggest victim. it's such a big umbrella that it's meaningless and an incoherent mess.

it's victim olympics trying to seek who's the bigger victim. You take individual characters and then try to see who's the bigger victim. Is a white woman a bigger victim than a black man. How about a disabled white man compared to a black man. what about a brown woman? What about a black woman married to a powerful white man. Does this black woman has more power than a white man? what exactly is the measure of this ""power"". is it quantifiable in every scenario or are we just making a wish and running with it?

then there's the tone policing. What if a brown woman was victimised by a black man. Is she supposed to use civil tone tone or else she can't speak. What about a black boy who was brutalised by a white woman. is he allowed to express his trauma in his words even if the words are generalising and insulting. How about a brown man accused by a Jewish lady falsely accused of stealing? will his tone be policed? in an intersectional club it seems like it will be.

And then the goals. If you try to bring in so many groups under one umbrella just to show this ""so many victims"" narrative, how long will they stand together. are their goals aligned? are they even seeking the same end results? Do they agree with the methods? what's the remedy for the inbuilt differences?

to me, this whole Intersectionality debate outside of a formal, academic setting looks like idiocy. It tries to take in so many variables with the some intent of finding which variable is the least valued and that destroys the whole equation. It's just ""victims"" seeking more ""victims"" because they're bored of their mundane lives and because apes together strong mindset."

I think the total shortage of their goals most recently was something like 41,000. Recently, the US house passed a bill that would automatically register all 18-25 year old men for the draft instead of having them have to do it manually. The reasoning is because it would take away the chance for people to face penalties for accidentally forgetting to register and it would save money because they wouldn’t have to spend money on sending out reminders or advertising reminding people they have to sign up. Although the bill is unlikely to pass and become law in the current state it is written because democrats control the senate and they don’t like some of the measures that are included. They have their own bill proposing women be added to the draft. 

With all of the conflicts going on in the world right now, and these measures being proposed, they must be preparing for something to happen. Why else the renewed interest in updating the process of registration?

There have been some articles too stating that some in Trump’s orbit are considering mandatory service including his newly pick VP candidate JD Vance, Lindsey Graham, and his former Defense Secretary Chris Miller, who Trump may appoint again to the head of defense. Trump stated on social media these rumors of him considering mandatory service are completely untrue, saying he never thought of the idea and it is just a way news organizations and people are attempting to hurt his image with the voters. 

With all the the conflicts going on, renewed interest in updating the draft registration process, the military failing to meet its goals, and rumors of Trumps orbit, especially JD Vance now he is the VP pick and Chris Miller wanting mandatory service, everything seems to be pointing to a return to the draft and they know something about it that we don’t.

Making white people feel uncomfortable is not only not a concern but it's a virtue, look at all the white tears rhetoric.

Let's contrast this with how the left talks about antizionism. The left goes to great lengths to avoid hurting Jewish people's feelings, the left does not argue that all Jews are Zionist despite all Jews benefiting from Israel in a more direct way then white people benefit from racism, in turn the left does not argue that Jews have to oppose Israel and gets mad when people say they do, you would never hear someone say ""Jewish silence is violence"" Jews are allowed to have an active role in the anti zionist movement while white people in the anti racist movement are supposed to listen to and uncritically support antiracism without making decisions for the movement themselves.

I know that is one data point but overall, the past data does not reflect the growing risk, but I feel like any attempt at all to address the issue is immediately thwarted with crowds of angry shark fans. I grew up in the ocean and don't feel comfortable going in anymore, and I just need to accept it, because any attempt at all to bring it up is always screamed at either in all caps or with real human voices. Obviously the squid eating robot is a joke but we could do SOMETHING rather than continue allowing more and more sharks near our beaches. Maybe we let fishermen kill seals again, idk, but something needs to happen. "
5,2024-07-21,CMV: How can Russian supporters justify the war in Ukraine? ,u/Tzeenach,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8p0aj/cmv_how_can_russian_supporters_justify_the_war_in/,changemyview,"I know this will likely be listed as some sort of rude/hostile content, but I’m asking this as a sincere question about the topic. This is something that I see going on, especially on boards like this, which are usually supposed to be politically neutral. In the past, I’ve looked into subs like this to try and see things like, “Why do people believe the Russian side in the Russo-Ukraine war?”. However, seemingly the vast majority of the topics across Reddit are people going “How are people so stupid and believing in the western narrative and not believing Russia’s right to defend itself!?” type lines. I’ve also got friends from both Ukraine/Pro-Ukraine side and Russian/Pro-Russia sides, and had decent discussions with both, plus trying to look at all the information I can online (I’ve even got a friend who is ethnic Russian, living in Crimea, but does not sympathise/support Russia in this war). So, I want the people who support the Russian side in the war what actual proof do you have of any of the claims that Russia makes to convince me that Russia somehow has any actual “just” reasons to be conducting, or perhaps even just to back the claims that Ukraine and the West is vastly lying about Russia's staggering losses while apparently Russian sources are far more trustworthy.  
  
 Ukraine has been consistent in its narrative that it’s simply trying to defend its existence against people who have been decidedly against their existence. Russian sources, from Putin and his ministers to their state-sponsored media, and the Russian social media, have overtly stated that they don’t even believe Ukrainian is a real culture, and they have a very overtly, clearly genocidal methodology towards what they feel they will do to Ukrainians. Lots and lots and lots of evidence (far more than it’s possible to be faked) has been shown that the Russians are committing war crimes, that their artillery basically just dumps onto Ukrainian cities arbitrarily to kill civilians, while Ukraine for the most part is trying to only hit military or mil-adjacent infrastructure (in fact Russia has been so limited in evidence of supposed Ukrainian atrocities on their citizens that to try make a thing out of the ""intercepted missile in Crimea over a beach"" seem like a Ukrainian war crime). The Russian army has been videos, filmed and shown on satellite evidence torturing and mutilating people in their occupied territories and have starved and abused Ukrainian prisoners (systematically, of course both sides have had acts of brutality but all evidence I have seen is that Ukrainians do it as singular soldiers in acts of understandable anger at an invader and go too far, while most Russian atrocities are effectively supported from top to bottom). Russian supporters claimed that Russia’s winning in all fronts, and meanwhile, the vast amounts of video and photographs from frontline sources, satellite evidence and documented proof of the enormous Russian losses and the incredibly slow rate of their supposedly invincible world class army is performing incredibly bad at this war and have no reason to be prove they are assured to win this war. They take a field and lose a vast number of men and equipment (provably in footage) and already online sources showing mil-storage yards and tracking social media in Russia show that more and more Russia relies on brute force and ancient equipment. And from my friend in Crimea, I hear plenty about the strikes that “aren’t happening or failed” according to Russian media, and from him it doesn’t seem those strikes are fake or have failed from what he sees.

The narrative the Russian state and supporters have made keeps changing. One minute it is some vague and totally illogical and ahistorical claim about Ukrainian lands being Russian, then we get unsubstanciated claims to stopping NATO expansion because NATO is openly planning war and genocide against Russian, to halting imperialism, to protecting Russians in Ukraine from claimed atrocities that lack any evidence, to claims it is basically supporting the right-wing and fighting this for the ""culture war"" to stop the evil LGBTQ+ and wokeness, to claiming it is supporting the left-wing and fighting to ""protect and cure Ukraine from supposed massive rise in Nazism"", and so on and so on. Russia clearly is just making up any other topic that suites them at a point in time. Meanwhile, as Russia claims it is the West who are the aggressors and genocidal, and even though no one has ever threatened the actual structural integrity of Russia itself, Russia keeps threatening nuclear assaults on anyone who dares to help Ukraine, even though they have a clear right to defend themselves. It invents ""nuclear torpedoes"" to sink continents in radioactive waters, it brags about it's thermobaric weapons and it uses chemical weapons and cluster munitions for it's troops since the beginning (all while MASSIVELY hypocritically claiming Ukraine commits war-crimes when they finally used only cluster munitions in late 2022, and this was only on military targets unlike the Russians who fired cluster munitions into cities). Meanwhile, these supposed “votes” to allow Russia to annex the territories they partially occupy were so blatantly against every international law and VERY obviously faked and doesn’t work with any international laws about how territories are supposed to be decided. These are laws that Russia itself signed up to, and Russia used to defend its existence after the Soviet Union’s collapse. And yet, somehow, Russians believe it doesn’t count when they don’t want it to. The most I see from the Russian side amount to conspiracy theories and using incidents or single events to justify whole lines of logic that don’t matter, like claiming that famous “Nuland-Pyatt phone-call” that apparently according to Russian supporters was proof the revolution was somehow a NATO plot, when listening to the phone-call itself was such obvious proof that they actually had no idea what was going on and needed to figure it out.

The only four consistent narratives that seem to be there are

1.      A sort of “FK you! We are a world power. We have the right to do what we want. Look, America did it too.” Of course, this doesn’t make you a good guy, it overtly shows that you’re nothing better than any of the other people in the world who do crimes, and yet somehow people still will morally grandstand for Russia. This is also usually blended with a whataboutism on how will hear about the US and the Iraq war type defence, the ""the West is FAR more evil, did you hear about what they did in Libya, did you see what they did in Serbia!?!?"". This firstly doesn't justify your country doing illegal wars, and that alone should be enough. But also, most western countries and citizens openly list and admit the fault of those wars. Second, most of those wars had far more actual justification to happen (like stopping the Serbs from genociding everyone around them in their fascistic quest to eradicate all non-Serbs in the Balkans, or how Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi were known for trying to invade and occupy other territories during their reigns). These were not good enough reasons, but far more than anything Russia can prove about Ukraine to claim their war was justified. Also, the USA didn't annex territory from Iraq, and NATO didn't try genocide the Libyian peoplw while claiming their culture was ""fake"". However, Russia has overtly been not just invading, but outright annexing and culturally genociding the Ukrainian people and culture, the latest in a continuation of the Russian Empire and Soviet Unions several attempts to Russify non-Russian countries and claim they are someone the victims in all this.

2.      It’s a totally fake and arbitrary line of “NATO was the aggressor, wanted to destroy Russia, they wanted to genocide the Russians”. Meanwhile, Russians also use narratives to show NATO was an incredibly weak alliance, and plenty of evidence shows NATO nations were both trying to interact and work with Russia even after the Crimean annexation, and most NATO nations weren’t keeping their military up to date and wasn’t posing any actual threat, and that it’s a very clear people who join NATO. There is no evidence eastern European countries joined from some “gun to back of head” threat by NATO, but we’re actually joining it because they were afraid of Russia and what Russia would do. In addition, even if NATO was a threat, that doesn’t give anyone the right to invade a neighbour who first off was not part of NATO and had clear proof it wasn’t planning to join NATO right up Russia invaded it. (It is insane to me how Russian supporters use an anti-imperialist narrative against NATO. Meanwhile, when Russia engages in the most overt type of imperialism ever with outright invasion and territorial annexations, this is somehow fine.) 

3.      The regions they’re conquering were always an “eternally Russian” region, and the majority populations there were all Russian and pro-Russian supporters, and that they had a right to join but also faced genocidal levels of violence from Ukrainians. This is false on several accounts. First many of the regions never reported anything in the region of a Ukrainian sponsored genocide attempt in almost every evidence piece I’ve seen to support this amount to the wackiest conspiracy theory like the “US sponsored Ukrainian made virus to kill specifically Russians” narrative. And while Russia proactively sponsored anti Ukrainian laws, the second they conquered any portion of Ukraine. Ukraine only launched some of the barest bones legislation to try and protect themselves after the full-scale invasion happened. People tried to exaggerate the “Language law” that Ukraine passed, which effectively meant that Ukrainian was recognised as the initial and primary language of the state, which is not genocidal, as it does not ban or block Russian (though even I admit it isn’t a good thing to do, but again is FAR more justifiable than actions by pro-Russians and the Russian government’s actions to minorities in Russia and occupied regions). Many of the regions of Ukraine with large Russian populations showed that they did not want to unite with Russia or believing they were under threat from Ukraine, most supposed hatred only came when Russian media pushed by the Kremlin told false stories about supposed Ukrainian atrocities against Russians that were mostly fake, and the few “real” incidents were vastly exaggerated. Secondly, many of these regions were not originally pro-Russian until a few decades or even a century and a bit ago, when the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union committed atrocities in the region to “lessen” other non-Russian populations like mass forced relocations, or the Holodomor (again, with large amounts of historical evidence and the only counter from pro-Russians being a ""nuh-uh, that's fake, it's NATO made propaganda, it is actually deeply Russophobic to claim the Holodomor is real or that the Soviet Union was anything but loving to it's citizens). So, the principle of saying that “just because people in an area are from a certain ethnicity”, in this case, a justification towards if you do a genocide on a region in one generation and place your own people there, you should be allowed to take the land of the people next generation. Which is oddly immorally wrong not to mention against the whole international laws that even Russia signs up to.

4.      That Ukraine sometimes lies, and that the West also sometimes lies, basically another ""whataboutism"". This is true every country will exaggerate in war, however, from my existing research all I’ve ever seen is the fact that Ukraine and the West may be exaggerate their victories or their losses by 20-25%. If Ukraine claims that they destroyed 20 Russian tanks in the last day, they will usually that later on be able to send footage and evidence that 16 tanks were actually destroyed. Meanwhile, every Russian source I’ve ever seen tends to try and list the same tank being destroyed five times by taking 5 different pictures at different angles and different points in its destruction, or times where they showed painfully obvious decoys (like a famous supposed HIMARs they hit that was clearly a wooden mock-up) and claim it real, or that famous case of where the Russian MOD declared 2 ½ months into the war that they had destroyed more tanks and planes than Ukraine even had in their entire military. If Ukraine’s lies and exaggerations are a “Mediterranean Sea” in volume, from what I have seen then Russia’s lies are the “Entire North and South Atlantic”.

At the end of the day, I have never seen any credible evidence by any Russian-sided person to justify why Russia should be seen as “the good guys” in this war. All the proof I have ever seen is that Russia is a fascistic state that is attempting to annihilate the rights of a people and their land, along with having an overtly genocidal belief in what they should do with the Ukrainians, and simply makes ""West bad"" arguments to defend itself that some idiots who like that narrative will just latch to and then blindly support Russia for that reason. Even the three people I know in real life are Russian supporters, whenever I challenge them on these topics, never come up with any credible evidence other than again spouting a conspiracy theory that has effectively no proof. Ironically, one of them also identifies as a communist, and apparently his only reason to justify the actions of Russia in this war are because “West bad, capitalism bad”. And whilst I agree that there’s plenty of things at the West has done very badly, I would simply argue that “West bad, but overtly fascist Russia worse”. So, can I sincerely ask what reason is there to support the Russian side?

And if the argument is “Well, Russia will win anyway, the weak soy-West must return to the strong Christian nationalism that glorious Putin will bring, \*\*\* you and your lefty LGBTQ+ scum, we will get you next” from right-wingers, or the "" Typical Western sympathiser blinded by capitalist propaganda"" tankie-leftist non-arguments without evidence I see often as the response to anything pro-Ukrainian online, please don’t bother commenting. Also, if your defence is simply to counterattack my question with “We’ll why don’t YOU present a million pieces of evidence to prove YOUR side is not lying!?” or claim I don’t know someone from Crimea, then also please don’t bother commenting. I’ve spent years looking through all the sources I can online, looking at what evidence and proof both sides are offering, including talking to actual Ukrainians and Russians I work with, including supporters of both sides. I’m not about to write a doctorate or doxx friends I have to explain where I found all my sources or reasons to believe Ukraine over Russia over the years, my whole question is to ask the Russian-sided people for the supposed “firm evidence” they are right in this war that I’ve asked for numerous times but failed to see but seemingly convinces some.

Stealing someone's apartment or house (potentially changing the locks)- people doing that have certain ""rights"", when in reality they are just opportunistic criminals. And somehow, there are still laws on the books in a plurality of states that protect these individuals. 

A lot of times, I hear about the ""evil landlord"", and how they deserve it, or something along those lines, but I completely disagree. A lot of people rent out a room, or relative's property and are honest, hardworking folks who are in need of some extra income and do not deserve to get screwed like that.

The only time this could feasibly make \*any\* sense is in the days of homesteading some 150 years ago, when someone arrives with their wagon train at a nicely-built cabin where the owner died or abandoned it, and there is no one occupying it. Also could be understandable in the context of more vague property laws 200 years ago, but in 2024, in my opinion, these outdated laws should be repealed."
0,2024-07-21,"CMV: Overall, the calories burned metric on smart watches and fitness trackers does more harm than good and shouldn't be a feature of a fitness tracker",u/Empty_Technology672,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8p6ms/cmv_overall_the_calories_burned_metric_on_smart/,changemyview,"Apple Watches, Garmins, Fitbits and other fitness trackers usually include a calories burned metric. Everyone of these watch manufacturers as an algorithm that calculates the daily calories burned that presumably takes into account one's basic metabolic rate (BMR) and calories burned from activities. It differs from company to company but it looks like the algorithm uses body weight and heart rate to come to their conclusions. Even at best, these fitness watches show a guess. No watch can accurately tell you how many calories any one person burned in a day.

I've read a lot of threads on fitness and weight loss subreddits. A very common repeating trend I see amongst athletes is something along the lines of ""I eat the amount of calories that my Garmin says to eat. But I am starving. I am so hungry. How do I stave off that hunger? According to my watch, I am eating enough.""


Or, I've seen on women's fitness subs the same post except also with the added ""and I've rapidly lost 10 pounds and lost my period.""

From an athlete's perspective, you don't want to gain weight because that can impede performance. So it's logical that you would take the information from your watch at face value and use it as a tool to fuel yourself. 

On weight loss subreddits, I've seen the opposite problem. There are tons of posts saying ""My total daily energy expenditure according to my watch is 2500 calories. I cut my calories down to 1900 calories. Why am I not losing weight?"" 

While you can update height and weight on smart watch apps, you can't add things like body fat percentages or other metrics that could shift BMRs hundreds of calories a day in one direction or another. Obese people may have a significant percent more body fat than an athlete which, in my unscientific and lay opinion, could influence the calories burned metric these watches spit at you. 

Calories burned metrics are also incredibly toxic and triggering for people who have eating disorders (although people with eating disorders probably should shy away from wearables in general).

TL;DR: calories burned metrics are estimates at best and don't tell an accurate picture of calories burned. This can make athletes underfuel, people on weight loss journeys eat in a way that wouldn't be conducive to weight loss and can lead to obsessive behavior among those with eating disorders or body dysmorphia. Overall, the calories burned metric does more harm than good and shouldn't be included in a smart watch app"
10,2024-07-21,CMV: Taking things “for granted” Is a necessary evil.,u/Juju1756,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8pkoq/cmv_taking_things_for_granted_is_a_necessary_evil/,changemyview,"In order to live your lives to the fullest, taking certain things for granted is necessary.

When you become too deeply focused on a small aspect of life, and protecting it, you actually risk butchering it, diminishing the value of it, and distracting yourself from personal development.

If all we did was overvalue every little thing we had, we would be taking away energy for exploring and trying new things.

Around 2 years ago, I had the mentality of “I will not take anything for granted”, and decided I will try to enjoy and not waste a second of life. It only took a week to get burnt out.

I began focusing on things that were perfectly good in my life and became so protective and sentimental of them, that I began to despise them, and I was unwilling to let go of things I had, even if letting go made room for something better.

I began to settle, and lie to myself that I was perfectly happy, when deep down, I knew I wanted more. 

According to research, it is in our nature that when we get something, we enjoy it for a while, but inevitably, it will wear off, and we soon want something else. Wouldn’t this mean going “out of our way” to not take things for granted goes against the natural state of things?"

I personally find that hard to believe because men are expressing all kinds of emotions freely without anyone harassing them. Men show anger all the time. 

In most movies, all the emotional moments come from male characters crying. There are so many father and daughter or son moments that are emotional ( don't know why we don't have more of the same with mother) 

Bret Kavanaugh was unable to contain his emotions for more than 5 seconds and no one made fun of him. Male criminals are given more sympathy than female criminals for their tragic past

Hell in history women were labeled hysterical and even were lobotomised for showing emotions. 

With this much institutional oppression against women for showing emotions and institutional freedom for men to show emotions, how can we say that men are not allowed to show emotions?

0,2024-07-21,"CMV: it’s not worth it to have a society where someone can “strike it rich”, ever, for any reason, ever, for all of time. Ever.",u/Ultimarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8qith/cmv_its_not_worth_it_to_have_a_society_where/,changemyview,"The argument is necessarily quite vague, so I’m hoping for angles I haven’t thought of! 

Ultimately I’m assuming an empirical liberal democratic framework, which I would sum up as “suffering is bad, and people deserve an equal say in how to prevent it via whatever social, political, intellectual, and material resources are somehow ‘available’ to the community.” I hope that’s not too involved, I don’t want to debate the specifics of that phrasing from the top of my head - I just want to express that I’m open to evidence, but “hey that’s just the game bro 😎 think about alpha wolves” is not enough, I’m seeking logical appeals to some sort of morality. 

I’m defining “rich” here to be something like “access to considerable luxuries that others don’t have, even when some in the community are in relatively desperate need”. Again, not attached to that specific definition, could be moved there I suppose. I don’t think Marxist class stuff is directly relevant here since he focused on the means not the artifacts, but I’d be thrilled to be proven wrong by someone who paid more attention to Kapital than I!

Here are some potential basic counterpoints that I don’t find convincing, but presumably might be a good start:

1. “Inequality inspires invention via patent laws” *eh I feel like funding all promising research equitably would do far far more than this could ever hope to do. What famous inventor did it for the $$$ that wasn’t also evil and not that great of an inventor in the end?*

2. “The very smartest people will only work if they get to be rich, like CEOs and founders and stuff” *do we really need those people? Why is that reasonable for them to demand?*

3. “If we have a market, we have to have jackpots like this, it’s just how The Economy works” *Do you have specifics? That seems counterintuitive and I can’t think of any plausible confounding factor, so I dismissed it. I feel like, at the very least, there’s gotta be endless historical examples of markets with relatively no rich people, such as… (AFAIK) even the very most centralized/urbanized North American indigenous nations.*

4. “The faint chance of getting rich is psychological fuel for the working class” *that’s just dystopian as hell, IMO! Can’t take it seriously, on its own. Just seems like a categorical evil, to build a society around dishonest hope like that. Why not shoot for honesty and equity in all our decisions?*"

1. Leadership: husbands are expected to (gently) domineer day-to-day life. As the head of household (according to traditional gender roles), a husband should have the final say in all matters, and every tradwife I’ve seen on social media is more than willing relinquish control and acquiesce to a strong husband’s will.

2. Protection: husbands are expected to handle all threats to tradwives/family units, be it physical, emotional, or financial. Tradwives want a “fixer” - a man who will face all problems head on, shielding them from hardship in all forms.

3. Aesthetics: from what I’ve seen (willing to change my mind here), tradwives want a conventionally “masculine” man who looks the part. A man who LOOKS like they could handle points 1 and 2. Tall, big hands, muscular frame etc.

I know that dom/sub relationships don’t necessarily conform to traditional gender roles. But from what I’ve seen on social media, tradwives just want a burly, strong man to protect them from external danger/obligations/responsibilities. Change my view!

Speaking of America's hatred of women... Democrats' embarrassing failure to move with party unity started with the first election Trump won. Dems around Hillary seemed to think it would be a cake walk and her campaign seemed to fail in identifying 1) the misogyny of the voting population 2) Trump's popularity and 3) the importance of campaigning in certain states. I voted for Hillary - and happily - but I was a much bigger fan of Bernie, whose policies might actually connect with younger generations of millennial/zoomer voters who could sway our country's politics and policies into a more progressive future. It seems like Democrats have basically been screwing this up for a decade now, and the upshot feels likely to be a second trump presidency and perhaps the slide from democracy into fascism and the end of the West as we know it.

Biden, even if he is old, at the very least had the name recognition required to get the average voter to vote for him, combined with the advantages of being white and a guy.

The US has only gotten more racist and sexist in the past 8 years, and Kamala Harris doesn't stand a chance in the polls no matter how great of a candidate she is. 

Biden didn't win the 2020 election in a landslide, he won by extremely narrow margins, and I'm not confident a miracle can happen a second time.

Now that we've all seen the risks of electing people who are of the age when these serious physical and mental barriers to effectively leading the country, I believe Trump is now under the microscope to prove that he's not too old, and I don't think he'll be able to survive that scrutiny. Generally, uncommitted voters have been deeply displeased by the fact that the last 8 years and the current election cycle have been dominated by presidential leaders/ candidates who were born in the 1940s. 

To change my view, I would need to see evidence that uncommitted voters are unlikely to be persuaded to vote for a younger, more vigorous, candidate who is more connected to the realities of the modern technological world we live in."

It’s absolutely insane that a major political party will not let the voters choose their preferred candidate before an election. 

This is a type of anti-democracy behavior that can continue in the future if we don’t full stop call out the behavior for being anti-democracy. Biden was pressured to step down not because he needed to but because many high-ranking democrats didn’t like his debate performance. This move prevent the VOTERS from choosing their president. A “choice” between two non-choices is disturbing and is not a choice at all.

And just to say it, because I know people will argue it, the delegates do not have the interest of the voter in mind. Us voters do not vote for the delegates directly but instead the political candidate we want. We have no open election in who becomes a delegate at the DNC or who they’ll vote to be the next candidate. Whatever potential delegate decided to support the winning candidate at the time gets chosen. It’s not a democratic system and is akin to the electoral college voting for another candidate than the people vote for (hence states binding those votes)."

Of course, many Americans are an exception to this, and many (maybe most) voters will vote for their party's candidate whomever it might be.

1,2024-07-21,"CMV: Trump can’t pass the presidential parachute test, and is physically unfit for office ",u/titan-ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8veno/cmv_trump_cant_pass_the_presidential_parachute/,changemyview,"According to journalist [Annie Jacobsen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war), today's [federal plan](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13281433/Nuclear-war-devastating-survivors-envy-dead-attack-North-Korea-Washington.html) to ensure continuing government includes staff grabbing parachutes stored in a White House military office. 

This step permits the Secret Service to potentially tandem jump the president out of the Marine One helicopter [mid-air](http://youtu.be/yehCJ076_zI) in case of an electromagnetic pulse or nuclear blast, as Marine One cannot physically fit the parachutes normally. 

My view is that former President Trump, bless his heart, would certainly fail this apparently critical, secret test of our government in an existential crisis, and that in some way this type of expected duty - even if remote - should weigh on his decision to remain as president until 2029.

Trump is unlike prior presidents, commonly military men. He is too out of shape by his [own admission and that of his doctor](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html), too old and stubborn to train for these contingencies. He just experienced a traumatizing attack on his safety. 

I know President Bush skydived at 90, but he was doing a photo op (and was a Navy [parachutist](https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-b/bush-george-h-w.html) hero). 

As for Vice President Harris at age 59, she is a bit over the average age of the US Parachute Association of [over 40](https://parachutist.com/Article/skydiving-then-and-now50-years-of-change), but isn’t literally an elderly senior citizen with an injury inflicted last week. If I were a betting person I’d wager her security parachuting out of Marine One, over that of a 83 year old man like Trump will be in his second term. 

This plan is an actual reported contingency. With the real risk of a nuclear scenario our government spends trillions of dollars on to address, our presidential candidates should be fit for the expected result of the continuity of government plan. I’m not even focusing on the nuclear option planning under incredible time constraints Trump would need to competently face, if humanly possible under the circumstances. 

The public should be aware of the expected duties of their officials. Apparently, this is one test we know of that for President Trump, the Secret Service agent should be arrested for elder abuse for considering jumping out of a helicopter with the man we see on the news every day (same for for President Biden, too, but he dropped out today). The same guidance should be followed for vice presidential candidates like Senator Vance, a 39-year old former soldier. "
280,2024-07-21,CMV: Our smartphones are destroying us,u/SniggidySnack,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8vm7c/cmv_our_smartphones_are_destroying_us/,changemyview,"I truly believe that we would all be almost unfathomably better off if we all threw our phones into volcanos. I could write at length about this subject, but I will limit myself to what I think are the three most detrimental parts of smartphone usage.

1. Social Media - I know this is a horse that has been beaten far past death, but there is very little if anything redeemable about social media. It glorifies the mundane, overstimulates our monkey brains, and sows division.  All this while its developers use real time data to find the best way to further our addictions. This machine has become finely tuned to such a degree that short-form content is now king on most platforms, and it is eviscerating our attention spans. I truly believe that in the coming decades one of the greatest assets you will be able to possess is the ability to tolerate boredom and focus. 

2. Communication - Our phones are wreaking havoc on the way that we communicate with each other. Several decades ago, the two means of communication were face-to-face conversation, and an occasional phone call. I do not think that it can in any way be healthy for children to return home from school and be inundated with Snapchats, DMs, FaceTime requests, and text messages. These ways of communication cheapen our interactions and eliminate much of the non-verbal components that are vital for understanding how to navigate interpersonal relationships. Over the past few years, I have met very few younger people - or even many older people who have been affected similarly by their phones - who can articulate themselves eloquently. 

3. Time Consumption - Time is the most valuable commodity, and we are selling it for nothing to our smartphones. I find it devastating that whenever I enter a public space where other individuals are waiting for something (e.g., on the bus, in a waiting room) the only thing I ever see anyone doing is scrolling through their phone. Whenever we get a chance, those germ bricks are in our hands, pouring useless information into our minds. Hobbies are becoming less common, people are less industrious, and we are spending our time worse than we ever have. The average person is spending more than four hours a day on their phone. I find that unacceptable.

The most depressing part is everyone I speak to seems to know this. We all know how detrimental these devilish devices are, but we have become slaves to them. I am interested to see if anyone has a more positive outlook than I do, because I struggle (and have especially struggled as of late) coming to terms with the impact that our phones are having on our lives and on society as a whole.

But because of stuff like project 2025, I feel like there's more of a stake for this upcoming election and I cant help but feel like the entire thing is hopeless. The guy has a cult like following who'll support him even, in and outside the government. And the failed assassination attempt only served to affirm their beliefs that outside forces want to put an end to his and their holy crusade to ""make America great again"", as well as gaining him more support. Compare that to the Dems, who's divided on who'll their next candidate will be because the guy they bet it all on obviously turned out to be way too old to be running (not that Trump is a young sprout himself). At this point, its almost gaurenteed that Trump will take back the white house. But maybe there's something Im missing here. and maybe Im just being too doomerist about this whole thing"

Both party platforms just feel like facades to keep business running as usual, taxing tf out of the middle/upper middle class and appeasing to major corporations.

I have always had the opinion that drugs sucked because I grew up in an environment where almost everyone would consume them but now I have made myself sharper about this topic to give more reasons as to why they suck. 

From my own experience I can say that everyone I know from back then , be it friends , neighbours or family,  they always started with ""just a little bit "" and ended up with "" if I don't smoke I'll go crazy"" I have seen it myself and had to feel the crazy impact someone with an addiction can not only have on their life but also yours as someone who is close to the addicted.

I first started with searching for similar experiences like mine on reddit. 

I've seen many post that described how a loved one fell into addiction and died because of abusing drugs or a loved one having killed someone while being high. 


I specifically started researching about one if not the most prominent drug that is being consumed.  Which is Marijuanna ( aka . Cannabis) 


Which not only has many risks if being used harshly ( abused ) but also in regular with regulated use.  


I got my info at:
 https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/cannabis-marijuana

Which is a trusted / reliable source . 


It usually starts very mild but then progresses into a risky addiction . When falling into addiction the drug you are using usually become ""numb"" or doesn't manage to bring the ""kick"" and so people usually search for more stronger and usually more dangerous stuff . 

I tried searching for something that can make this stand alone as a fact but only found implications so this info is based on my own experiences .


I feel like if this drug is being used as an excuse to hide behind a curtain and used as some kind of ""copium"" or ""escape"" which is not only the wrong way of handling things on paper but also in rl . 

Even if you just enjoy it , it will eventually hurt you and if it doesn't it will most definitely hurt people around you.

3. Jesus actually fought against legalism, and caring about laws, and placed more emphasis on Love, commitment, and faith. 

4. Sex is a natural, and beautiful part of a relationship. If two people are commited to eachother, love eachother so much no matter what, how is sex in that context a sin?

0,2024-07-21,"CMV: ""Western Civilization"" is a Meaningless Term",u/JStevinik,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8zvtq/cmv_western_civilization_is_a_meaningless_term/,changemyview,"I am mostly levying this critique on pundits who suggest what they deem to be ""Western Civilization"" is ""collapsing"" because of the increasing presence of non-reactionary policies and peoples.

There are multiple angles to approach this because not every person who thinks that there is such a thing as ""Western Civilization"".

When I press people to define it, they give me a few things: political freedom, post-feudal economics, rule of law, modern science, etc. 

However, these things either were not invented by countries deemed to be the ""West"", not exclusively practiced by it, not appreciated, or never applied to the vast majority of the history of the ""West"".

The rule of law has been promoted or observed in many ancient and middle-aged civilizations, e.g. the Code of Hammurabi.

For example, multi-party liberal/bourgeois democracy only existed for the past few centuries and some countries like Spain and Portugal did not have consistent political liberalism until the 1970s. Illiberal politics is on the rise in some European countries due to fears of a ""civilization collapse"". Clearly, even these reactionaries do not regard liberalism as the essence. This makes perfect sense because the vast majority of history since the ancient Greeks (regarded by some as the beginning of the ""West"") is anything but liberal. Europe had illiberal parties and even regimes throughout the 20th century, e.g. 1/4 of the French voted for the (Pro-Soviet until the 1970s) Communist Party of France after WW2. That and many third-world countries have representative systems yet Japan, India, and Nigeria are regarded as a part of the ""Western Club"". 

Modern science and medicine are not fully appreciated there, given the rise of mainstream politicians casting doubts on scientific consensus and even anti-intellectualism. Ever wonder why some of avoid some of your relative's Facebook feeds since the COVID-19 pandemic? Again, most countries utilize and respect modern medicine more yet they are not automatically a part of the club.

For post-feudal economics, there somewhat of a point there. However, many proponents deem the aforementioned Marxism as ""anti-western"". However, almost all countries are post-feudal at this point.

Defining its boundaries makes no sense since most people define Russia and the former Soviet Union. This is despite the fact that Marxism is defined by Wikipedia as a part of ""Western Philosophy"" yet some conspiracy theorists deem people taking it seriously as the ""West's downfall"". Russia its majority population identifies themselves as Orthodox Christians. Seriously, there is a contradiction between defining ""Western"" as majority Catholic or Protestant (post-tenth century split that somewhat reflected the eastern vs western Roman empires) or ""Judeo-Christian"" values. Speaking of that, these religions were first practiced in the Middle East, which is not a region deemed ""Western"". These religions are Abrahamic yet Islam is regarded by reactionaries as one of the existential enemies of Western. Not to mention irreligiosity is increasing in some European places, so would these people regard Czechia as no longer Western when less than 50% of its population identify as Christian?

Essentially, ""Western"" is a useless term. I would argue that an anglosphere civilization is a more practical term. Developed countries, regardless of location and religion, are a part of the imperial core, which has an actual material basis in its meaning."

Frankly, I think the Democrats would just have been better off keeping Biden, due to his working class roots in Scranton, PA and his folksy persona, despite his cognitive state. They would still have the benefit of the doubt of getting more support from the unions than any other Democrat, which are prevalent in the Midwest swing states. 

I honestly think that having a candidate being smeared as a loveable yet ""way past his prime"" grandpa is way less damaging than having a nominee being portrayed as a some out of touch elitest from California of all places. Kamala and her campaign would also somehow have to deal with the Progressive wing bashing her on her track record of being in law enforcement back in her home state. Also, her mannerisms and her background make her very prone to be portrayed as some Hillary 2.0, and this may sway back the Republican voters(anti-Hillary voters in 2016) who have voted for Trump in 2016 but not in 2020.

I guess what this discussion boils down to is how her campaign can best strategize in the next 4 months to garner enoughr broad support from Progressive, union,  moderate, and Independent voters alike. 

From the surface, it just seems like the Democrats have given the GOP an opponent that would be smeared in very similar ways they did to Hillary. 

I am open to any insights on how she might go about best planning for her candidacy.

The Turks claimed mistreatment and discrimination of Turks was rampant amid Cyprus' possibile move towards unifying with Greece. They invaded the island to ""protect them"" and never left; taking about 1/3rd of the land mass and moving something like 150K-200K Turks onto that land; intentionally destroying the possibility of a ""one-state"" solution.

The legitimacy of the mistreatment is besides the point, but I will say there is some of that in Ukraine too. I think you need to get government approval to import more than 10 Russian-language books and they do discourage the language and ban it's use in public school as a way of preserving their identity. Also, the British established an affirmative action and the Turks had a permanent veto over laws as a way to discourage ethnic tension.

A lot of people (rightly) point to this as a reason why Israel is targeted with double standards; but this situation is worse than either Israel or Ukraine. There is literally no security concern about this. The hills of the West Bank the Jewish settlements are built on could easily be used to destroy the urban areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv despite the Iron Dome. With Russia, 80% of their population lives on the flat lands west of the Volga. If they get invaded, there isn't much they can do other than just bleed out the enemy with a war of attrition. Not that these justify expansion is, but Cyprus is too far away from Anatolia to ever pose a threat to them.

-The British bases are there with gov't. permission and they don't move civilian populations there. 

- Unification with Greece is not an expansionist threat to Turkey. They already share a border, and Cyprus is too far away to make a difference in a local conflict like that."

To be completely transparent, I consider myself conservative leaning, but in many ways tired of Trump. I voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. The reason for my Trump vote in 2016 was heavily influenced by how the DNC forced Bernie out (yes, a Bernie bro I was). My vote in 2020 for Biden was because of how Trump handled covid. In both cases I felt like I was voting against something — not for anything. And frankly, I am tired of that.

There are some exceptions:

* When someone doesn't have a strong opinion, they're more easily persuaded.
* When differing views come from a trusted opinion leader, the instinct to resist is weaker, and the instinct to agree is stronger.
* Some of the OPs in this subreddit come looking for different perspectives, making them more open to dissenting views and more rational.

If you think about it, people who grew up poor often lack basic necessities and face third-world problems like finding enough food to eat or clean water to drink, while also taking care of their families and working hard.

Work ethic, much like language acquisition, is most effectively instilled at a young age. This concept aligns with the formation of habits. During my time in college, I met students who frequently claimed they would study harder for upcoming exams but consistently succumbed to procrastination when the time came.

Every anti-Israel argument is fraught with propaganda and emotionally driven lies, from the idea that Israel started many wars against Arab peoples and nations(despite the fact that Jews have endured countless pogroms in many nations for millennia, notwithstanding many Arab nations and including in pre-1948 Israeli/Palestinian territory, and every war was started by Arabs), to that Jews stole land(they bought it at every opportunity; Arab landowners would cry out about the Jewish invader and then quietly sell to Jews; the British gave Jews many offers for partition, and they enthusiastically took anything they could get), to that Jews commit apartheid(despite the fact that Israeli Arabs are given full opportunity to succeed in Israel and in fact are disproportionately represented in the medical field and are not even required to serve in the military).

There are many more lies to exhume, including thar Jews won’t come to the table with indigenous Arabs(not even mentioning how many Arabs are recent immigrants), including the fact that the Palestinian ethnic identity is a farce concocted by Soviets(https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9090/soviet-union-palestinians) to reposition Arabs as the underdog when they own 99%+ of the Middle East. Many Arab leaders would admit that there is no substantive difference between Arabs of Palestine and other nations, at least on the national level, seeing as Arabs tend to view themselves on the basis of their clan and specific village of origin.

This leads us to the fact that the original partition was between the Arabs of Jordan and the Jews of  Israel. The Hashemite state of Jordan is the Arab state. This disproportionately gave land to the Arabs, and then Jordan annexed the West Bank in 1949, and later on after they lost control, they refused to re-annex the West Bank. They wanted and currently want nothing to do with the Palestinians after all the internal conflict they caused in Jordan.

This splices everything further. Now, Jordan, most of the original territory of the agreed partition, was not enough for the Arabs. The partition plan succeeding Resolution 181 in 1947 gave Arabs even more, and it didn’t even give Jews Jerusalem, the holiest city in Judaism, where the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans. The Jews were forced into exile, and the Muslims built a mosque on the holiest site in Judaism in its holiest city in its holy land. Even today, Jews face restrictions in visiting their holiest site, because Israel has made numerous accommodations with Jordan, a state that has been forced into quiet peace with Israel after decades of hostility.

And we can go on and on with pro-Palestinian obfuscation of the fact that Israel is uniquely globally maligned for its Palestinian policies, when it’s made more concessions than is historically normal when they were the ones who won the wars of defense against a population that has terrorized and subordinated them for centuries.

1.

2. Bill Barr, his own homeland security department, and many rejected legal challenges, by all accounts, revealed to Trump that there was no proof of mass election fraud sufficient to overturn the election. 

3. Rudy Giuliani, by all accounts, presented Trump with shady evidence of voter fraud that was directly debunked by DOJ and local United States attorneys in swing states. Danesh, Fox News, and others have been sued and lost large sums of money in defamation lawsuits  against local poll workers, dominion voting machines, and state election officials for knowingly spreading false information about election fraud. 

4. Trump, by all accounts, told Kevin McCarthy during the J6 riots, “these people are more angry about the election than Congress seems to be” and sat idly by until Ivanka and others talked him into making statements.

5. Trump, by all accounts, withheld classified national security documents, refused to turn them over, and is accused of sharing classified documents with Bob Woodward and other individuals without a clearance. As well as stored those documents in an easily accessible bathroom. 

6. Trump has majorly caved on the issue of abortion and other important conservative issues to get elected. 

These are the issues I care about. I don’t believe Biden’s harmful rhetoric about fascism or threat to America, but at the same time, I don’t believe we should reward election denying. It is clear to me that the 2020 election was fairly won by Joe Biden. However, the fact is that Kamala Harris is a progressive Democrat and would govern as such. I would love a rational counter argument to my issues as I would love to be convinced to change my support for November. However, right now, I think Trump was totally derelict of his office and would simply stay home or write-in a candidate.

3. Rudy Giuliani, by all accounts, presented Trump with shady evidence of voter fraud that was directly debunked by DOJ and local United States attorneys in swing states. Danesh, Fox News, and others have been sued and lost large sums of money in defamation lawsuits  against local poll workers, dominion voting machines, and state election officials for knowingly spreading false information about election fraud. 

4. Trump, by all accounts, told Kevin McCarthy during the J6 riots, “these people are more angry about the election than Congress seems to be” and sat idly by until Ivanka and others talked him into making statements.

5. Trump, by all accounts, withheld classified national security documents, refused to turn them over, and is accused of sharing classified documents with Bob Woodward and other individuals without a clearance. As well as stored those documents in an easily accessible bathroom. 

6. Trump has majorly caved on the issue of abortion and other important conservative issues to get elected. 

These are the issues I care about. I don’t believe Biden’s harmful rhetoric about fascism or threat to America, but at the same time, I don’t believe we should reward election denying. It is clear to me that the 2020 election was fairly won by Joe Biden. However, the fact is that Kamala Harris is a progressive Democrat and would govern as such. I would love a rational counter argument to my issues as I would love to be convinced to change my support for November and vote for the Republican nominee. However, right now, I think Trump was totally derelict of his office and would simply stay home or write-in a candidate.

0,2024-07-22,CMV: “Genius” intellect does not exist,u/Inferno_Zyrack,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e964wy/cmv_genius_intellect_does_not_exist/,changemyview,"There are a few bases I’m making about this claim in order to hopefully help guide away from certain things.

1. Genius is defined here as exceptional intellect or creative ability and especially as a term given to great scientists, entrepreneurs, or artists.

2. Genius’ don’t exist because all of the people who colloquially receive that title are people doing work that is either actually collaborative (I’ll expand on 2b.) or in some way relevant only within the time and field based research available at the time.

2b. Musicians and Directors cannot be single minded geniuses because they are required to have so many other staff sign off on most of their work or so many other unknown contributions that it’s impossible to know other than to say that a sound or technique followed a certain person. EXAMPLE: George Lucas made three of the greatest science fantasy films with the original trilogy. But it’s clear from the prequel trilogy an even for its time poorly written character study that’s heavy handed poorly plotted and a ham fisted mess of references to older material and movies that he’s not a singular genius. The original trilogy has a lot to blame on the crew and writers and producers and actors around Lucas.

3. Genius is a better signifier of someone with an easily sensationalized story than any sort of magnificent, wonderful, or incredible breakthrough. EXAMPLE: The Beatles changed the way music sounded and defined the post-modern idea of celebrity after Elvis’ influence. But it was a media storm - combined with high quality artistry - that made any of them so-called genius’

This is a somewhat soft view and I’m sure someone will give me good examples to the contrary. Please change my view."

In actuality if one had an associates degree and transferred to get a bachelor’s degree and assuming every credit carried over to the bachelor’s degree to fufill all of the speciality degree specific courses and maybe a few basic gen ed courses then the only courses needed to get the bachelor’s degree would be more gen ed courses and perhaps a high level specific course in that specific field of study.

30,2024-07-22,"CMV: The People Regularly Posting Here About the ""Inevitable and Imminent Defeat of Ukraine"" are Wrong and Likely Just Ignorant of Core Facts (and Many are Likely Just Pro-Russian Propagandists Pushing a Narrative Online)",u/Tzeenach,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e9cwjd/cmv_the_people_regularly_posting_here_about_the/,changemyview,"So, often on the CMV and other ""ask a question"" type sub-reddits, there seems to be a far higher number of ""Ukraine is about to lose"" or ""We should negotiate with Russia (with subcontext of letting Russia keep it's ill-gotten gains)"" and other sorts of posts that seem to position this war as some inevitable victory in some format for Russia. However, from everything I've seen there is nothing at all backing this conclusion for a massive number of reasons, some of them including:

1.      Ukraine has so much more to lose if the war goes against them. Russian sources have openly claimed from the president to politicians to their popular media to their social media that the Ukrainian culture and people are a non-existent entity and there is a blatant line towards a genocidal attitude towards the Ukrainian people in general. As such, Ukrainians are literally fighting for that right to exist while Russians are simply fighting for territorial expansion and the glory of their fascist dictator. As such, even if equipment run low and facilities became strict, then you’d still wind up seeing Ukrainians prefer to fight to the death rather than hand over Ukrainian lands to Russia.

2.      Russia has been provably committing vast amounts of war crimes and indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Ukraine and has demonstrated the fact that if Ukrainians give up, they will go under a regime that will treat them in the very best case as 2^(nd) class citizens. They know if Russia wins, it’ll be pogroms and mass killings all over the place, as was proven by what they did in Bucha, and that their hopes would be that they would annihilate a large swaths of the Ukrainian population to make them passive. Russia has also shown that it treats its own citizens with auto disregard, and so to many Ukrainians, the idea of becoming part of Russia is worse than death. They know that if the Russians win, they’ll plough over and concrete the graves of their sons and daughters who fought and call them “traitors”, or even eradicate their memory from history. They know that they will wind up committing a slow cultural genocide against the concept of the Ukrainian people. They know that Russia will then use them as cannon-fodder in future wars to try and conquer more countries. So do the Ukrainians there’s a very clear motivation to fight no matter how much to take even kitchen knives against Russian soldiers, rather than risk them winning this war.

3.      Ukraine doesn’t need to actually claw back all of the territory Russia conquered. All they need is for Russia to wind up losing some men in peace and equipment that they can’t actually successfully hold the ground as sitting on and will be forced into retreats due to the lack of equipment. Already, many piece of proof have come forward, saying that the best of Russia’s equipment is now running dry in their calling on more and more so video artillery and techniques and equipment. And many of Russia’s very best military men are dead or wounded or have wound up trying to leave the country to get away from the war.

4.      Even if the US does wind up going into the hands of the fascist Donald Trump, there is no evidence to point that the EU, or anyone else, is going to suddenly abandon Ukraine, or that the lack of equipment will mean that they can’t win the war anyway. Ukraine was pretty well holding off the Russians when they had low supplies of US aid. And there is also no particular evidence to state that the US even under that presidency won’t still be supplying a certain amount of equipment, if only just to meet certain NATO requirements. The worst case scenario is that the EU and other powers will wind up buying equipment from the US and sending it to Ukraine to help them, along with sending more EU and other military equipment.

5.      The claims that the rest of the world is about to abandon Ukraine and is losing interest at supporting them has never been substantiated. This has usually come from the pro-Russian side of people, insisting that the fact that the news in the West doesn’t every single day report on every single Ukrainian incident is proof that the West has abandoned Ukraine. In reality, most people in the West still support the idea of Ukrainian independence and supporting Ukraine. They simply have to continue on with their normal lives whilst continuing to support their government sending the money and equipment to keep Ukraine afloat. A lack of proactive interest is not a sign of loss of support.

6.      Russian casualties and losses to take very small gains in territory are provably massive, and despite the claim of the Rus-bots online, there’s plenty of evidence that the Russians are acquiring to use “meat wave” tactics and throwing equipment in clumsy frontal assaults. Usually, the only defence Russian supporters have for these sheer losses is to either claim that they are completely fabricated and using technicalities to claim “they’re not meat waves because that means 100’s of soldier per field and that isn’t happening!” as they make up their own definitions.

7.      Russia’s own justifications for the war have always been rather flimsy, where they’ve made claims about the idea that Ukrainians were genociding Russians or the claim that Ukraine is swarmed with Neo Nazis and all these other sorts of arguments that are baseless and have always been there just to villainize the Ukrainians but don’t stand on any truth. Russia itself is a fascist state, making the anti-Nazi claims somewhat ironic. And despite their claims that all Ukrainians are actually secretly Russia, nor that ¼ of all Ukrainian land is actually formerly Russian, lots of historical evidence exists to show that these lands were not Russian. They only became majorly Russian (and in many cases, not even majority Russian, just significant minority) because the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union mass deported or genocided of the local population and planted their own people there. As such, those people who insist that the Donbas and Crimea should be handed to Russia due to the high demands of Russians living there is effectively a line of saying “if your nation committed atrocities or mass murder or mass deportations or outright genocides on a people in a region and then placed your own citizens there, you should be allowed to keep the territory you stole, you should be rewarded for your crimes”.

8.      It’s very clear that the only treaties Russia is willing to sign with Ukraine are ones that ensure Ukraine is harboured and open for a future invasion. All of Russia’s supposed “fair and balanced” treaties are there just to make sure Ukraine is kneecapped, that it can’t join later to protect itself, that I can’t have an army to defend itself, and that all of the treaties Russia signed before, including treaties where Ukraine literally gave up the nuclear weapons, did not stop Russia from stealing land from Ukraine. Every evidence shows that Russia plans to annihilate the very concept of Ukraine, because that’s what Putin finds a threat, a nation that has many citizens from his own country and his own ethnicity and proving that democracy in the east can survive. The obsession with Russia is the re-Russification of everything east of the Oder River.

9.      Putin and his lackeys portray anything that doesn’t hand over the entirety of Eastern Europe and most of the Caucuses and all of the former “Stan” nations (like Kazakhstan, etc) into Russian influence as being a fundamental threat to Russia’s right to exist. Russia has effectively declared that it feels it has the right to outright occupy or formally and strictly control to the point of effective occupation a vast swathe of the world. It somehow claims that anything less than this is a clear sign of Russophobia and a proof that the West is trying to genocide the Russians. As such, Russia’s apparent “self-defense demands” are nothing more than a refusal to accept other nations rights to self-determination. It is the same logic as saying “I am not safe until everyone around me is my slave and bound in chains to me. And if you refuse to all be my slaves, you are clearly threatening my life and therefore I have a right to kill you first”. This does not sound logic, but by this logic, if the West allows the Russians to win this war, they will just continue to do horrific things to justify their sense of imperialist entitlement. As such, plenty of nations have already figured out that supporting Ukraine has long as it takes them to at least win this war is better than giving into Russia. It would be better for the world to end in a nuclear apocalypse that stops this horrific regime than to allow Russia to effectively turn the world into its slave market.

10. Ukrainian soldiers have fought immensely well and have proven that even with little equipment they are capable of annihilating the incredibly indiscipline and poorly equipped Russian army. Even with reducing supplies and even with a limitation on available equipment, it’s very clear that the Ukrainian army is nowhere near defeated and the constant claims by Russian supporters that they are have based on nothing. I see plenty of over fears by people online claiming that the Russian army is about to annihilate the Ukrainian army and yet in the last three years I haven’t seen anything more than the Russian army getting there as handed to them time and time again. The constant claims online by the “I’m not a Russian supporter but…” crowd seemed always imply that Ukraine is on the verge of losing, and Russia is just wiping them. And yet all of the evidence of the video and photo and satellite footage demonstrates clearly that Russia is performing incredibly poorly and there’s no reason to believe their arm is going to suddenly break through anywhere at any time, even if equipment starts becoming scarce again.

  
So do all those people I see actively on Reddit promoting the “I’m not pro-Russian, but…” or just the outright Russian supporting people who keep saying Ukraine must surrender and they’re weak and they’re on the verge of failure for the last three years (even despite the lack of failure and the constant disasters suffered by Russia’s armies), can you actually provide some sincere proof of why Ukraine is totally doomed? And if not that, can you at least explain why the overt lies of Russia about Ukraine’s supposed villainy and their justification to conduct this war are in any way real and substantiated?"

This is a list of things that makes being a man suck, in no peculiar order. I haven't experienced all of them yet tho

-Baldness: for some reason your hair at some point just fall, therefore any hope of having a decent hairstyle which isn't ""bald with beard"" or ""military looking"" is thrown out of the window if you're not genetically blessed.

-wardrobe: ""wtf, everything looks the same!"" Said a girl friend of mine while we were shopping and going through the men section, EVERYTHING IS THE SAME! and since a man can either dress casual or classy, and classy means a suit, having to dress up like a decent human being in summer is a nightmare.

-Emotions: a man can have an extremely diverse range of emotions, two: being angry and being happy (but not too happy, laid back happy) and in extremely rare cases being angry in a sad way 

-Activism: feminism is a respectable movement with two centuries of academia backing it up, men's right is a dishomogeneus mess where 3/4 of its members are actually mental and the other quarter is too unrelateably embarassing to attract most men.

-in a shipwreck people would probably look at men wrong if they throw people off lifeboats to save themselves

-pain: you're expected to find unreasonable amount of pain funny for no reason, said pain can be also manifested in ""drinking unreasonable amount of alchool Is cool"" and some other fruitless show of strength.

To me, this shows a clear choice by the Palestinian people to support a group that perpetuates their own suffering.

What else stands out to me is that they were cheering on the death of Jewish people on October 7th, which further proves the existence of a Palestinian identity cannot be a peaceful one. What do you think?"

I think this is just like anything, where there are good and bad versions, and there can be things that go too far. For the sake of this conversation, I’d like to talk about what I guess I could call the median usages that aren’t going too far.

For example, I think if a publisher or “author” (you’ll see why I put that in quotes in a moment) wants to automate the writing of 20 children’s books using nothing but data that the AI determines to make those children‘s books both popular and profitable, this is bad. The human element of this would be incredibly minimal. All the writing and art would be meaningless drivel. Even if it sparked emotion, it would be like a robot arm poking the emotional center of your brain, rather than what we feel when the connection we experience between us and another person causes a sudden wave of emotion.

However, I would honestly be fascinated by a book of AI art on a particular topic. I would be very curious about AI’s take on certain things, and if there was a thousand page book that was all art generated by AI on those topics, I think that could prove really interesting. I’d be curious about that in the same way that I would be in a human artist.

There are tools that allow people to create music without playing instruments. Hear me out… as a musician, I don’t hate this. There are things in music theory that we know can create certain moods, and if that’s all that someone wants then I’m ok with it. That’s not why I listen to music. I listen to music to connect with a feeling that a musician creates. Something authentic. AI can take the hundreds of lofi channels and musicians can rake in some cash letting their AI mood music do that stuff for them so that they can focus on their real, heartfelt stuff.

I also picture that there could be people who lack the funds or even have disabilities that make it impossible for them to play instruments, but maybe they have good ideas, or a good voice, and they can use these tools to turn their voices and ideas into music. I picture someone paralyzed that loves music, and I get emotional thinking about what that person would create using these tools. Or some guy whose money goes entirely to taking care of their family but who needs an outlet, and can use these cheap tools instead of spending hundreds on instruments. I’m all for that.

All this being said, I fully understand that even good intentions can lead to sour results. It’s totally possible that even these getting used for good things can lead to over saturation and negative results in the future. It probably won’t say unenshittified, but the unshitty versions of these I think have a lot of incredibly positive potential."

I may have given a bad tip 2 or 3 times in my life. Usually I figure-out what 20% is, then round up to the nearest dollar because the mental math is easy. If the service was great, I'll add a bit more depending on the bill.

I've seen posts online saying that even if the service is bad, diners should still tip a certain percentage. There is a professor at University of Oklahoma that says it should be 18% minimum, plus more of the service is good.

I find this really off-putting.Of course we should tip well, and should give servers the benefit of the doubt. If the restaurant is slammed, we should still tip. If there are minor issues that are promptly fixed? Still tip.

However, if the service is truly terrible, I think we should reserve the right to not tip. If the server disappears for long periods of time, forgets large parts of our order, and the restaurant is mostly empty? I'm sorry, but I don't think that deserves 18%.

Tipping culture is already out of control. We are being asked to tip in scenarios where it is not warranted. Saying there is now a required minimum tip seems like another step in the wrong direction.

Again, tip your servers. I love going out to eat, and I have a lot of love for servers, but making this an expectation is counterproductive and alienating"

Kentucky went to Trump 62% to Biden's 36%, so Beshear brings messaging and personality that plays well to moderates and conservatives who don't buy what Trump is selling. 

At just 46 years old, he brings a shot of youthful energy so many of us desperately want to see back in politics. 

Despite being pro climate action, he knows the touchy game of fossil fuels and how those industries affect local populations and the economy. 

As governor he has opposed religious charter schools from getting public funding. He is pro choice and has experience responding to natural disasters in his state. He restored voting rights to more felons (nonviolent) than any other governor in American history, restoring the right to vote of over 180,000 Kentuckians. While this might not play well to hardline conservatives, younger audiences like democracy, and people shouldn't lose their right to vote just because they commit any crime. 

Harris could pick someone like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who has been a popular figure for dems and progressives, but unfortunately a dual-woman ticket might be a strategic dead-end. Harris will need to woo some white male moderate voters. Roy Cooper, gov of NC is also a big name, but he's 70 years old, replacing Biden who is 80 with a 70 year old man would take so much wind out of the sails of this political moment, which feels very energizing for the first time in a long time. 

Josh Shapiro, gov of PA is another option, and may help swing PA, but some pundits are saying that this might be more of a political myth than reality (tough finding a source on this point, so I'm a little skeptical). Additionally, Beshear could appeal to many of the same interests that Shapiro could anyway, given that he pulls support in deep red Kentucky. Of course there's an outside chance Beshear peels Kentucky back to blue, which hasn't happened since Bill Clinton, but then again there hasn't been anyone from the South on the D ticket since Clinton either - except if you count Gore who was born in D.C. and lived in TN, but Kentuckians hate Tennessee. 

So, anyway, change my view. Is there someone better than Andy Beshear for Kamala Harris to choose? Why? 

I'm assuming Harris is the nominee, which isn't 100% set in stone yet. That could change."

Trump was very busy messing up stuff inside of the US, letting the war machine autopilot slow down during his time. With Biden we have seen the return of many of the Obama era and before, especially Bush, imperialist intervention, especially in the Middle East. 

Therefore, why (justifiably) Americans are terrorized by the idea of Trump coming back, his inefficiency and ignorance might be the key to slow down processes such as the Palestinian genocide. We’ve seen it before with the withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan. "

1. People who sexually assault others are bad

2. People who enable sexual assault are bad

From their story, they told him that was assault but then continued to have sex with them not only that time but 2 more times after. The next day the person unmatched her on a dating app and she responded by texting them saying that he shouldn't have unmatched her if he was going to assault her and called him a loser

Was the guy wrong? Yes? But the woman was also wrong as well. I've seen many times myself how women weaponize assault for their own gain and to me that's just wrong. In a way it's blackmail even if what the person did was assault and it's basically being used as a sword of Damocles.

But at least in the above scenario's people still got to vote, albeit their vote was completely manipulated. Increasingly, the new strategy seems to be not even allowing people to vote for their chosen candidate. Biden won his primary, but he's now being forced out by DNC elites and rich donors. The next Democrat candidate will have been selected, not elected. This comes on the heels of the DNC rigging both the 2016 and 2020 primaries against Bernie, in favor of a more pro-establishment candidate. And I've lost track of how many lawsuits there have been, and are still ongoing, to either remove Trump from ballots, imprison him (so he can't campaign), slap him with a gag order (so he can't campaign), etc.

This is not democracy. This is tyranny. It's fascism: a union of state and corporate power to quell dissent and strip people of their rights (social media companies helped censor Biden's laptop, to give an example of the corporate power)."

Frankly, I think the Democrats would just have been better off keeping Biden, due to his working class roots in Scranton, PA and his folksy persona, despite his cognitive state. They would still have the benefit of the doubt of getting more support from the unions than any other Democrat, which are prevalent in the Midwest swing states.

I honestly think that having a candidate being smeared as a loveable yet ""way past his prime"" grandpa is way less damaging than having a nominee being portrayed as a some out of touch elitest from California of all places. Kamala and her campaign would also somehow have to deal with the Progressive wing bashing her on her track record of being in law enforcement back in her home state. Also, her mannerisms and her background make her very prone to be portrayed as some Hillary 2.0, and this may sway back the Republican voters(anti-Hillary voters in 2016) who have voted for Trump in 2016 but not in 2020.

I guess what this discussion boils down to is how her campaign can best strategize in the next 4 months to garner enough broad support from Progressive, union, moderate, and Independent voters alike for enough Electoral votes. It's unfortunate that it is very likely too late to run an open convention where various Democratic candidates duke it out and eventually coalesce for one challenger to Donald Trump.

From the surface, it just seems like the Democrats have given the GOP an opponent that would be smeared in very similar ways they did to Hillary.

I am open to any insights on how she might go about best planning for her candidacy.

My intuition tells me that Kamala's victory will very heavily depend on learning from the mistakes that a certain former Female presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, made. Her major 2016 mistakes are the following:

1.) Not focusing enough on working class ills, especially in the swing states in the Rust Belt.

2.) Not aggressively attacking Trump on his policies and character when she had the chance during the debates and campaign, in general. She figured that showing her innocent female passivity as a woman while Trump attacked her would garner her more sympathy votes, which clearly did not materialize

\*\*\* bonus.) restraining from doing that annoying, condescending laugh.

To be honest, I really doubt she really will look back and learn from Hillary's mistakes. Maybe I do think she really is that out of touch, and will make herself prone to being smeared as a Hillary clone by both the right wing and some left wing progressive media apparatuses."

1) The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics is correct.

2) I would use a Derek Parfit teleporter, one that vaporizes your body on Earth and creates a perfect physical copy on Mars. This means I expect to experience surviving the teleportation.

Since I expect to experience survival after teleportation, I should also expect to experience survival after quantum suicide (QS). QS is basically when you enter a box that will instantly kill you if an electron’s spin is measured as up and leave you alive if it’s measured as down. In the MWI, there is a branch of the universe where I die because the electron spins up and another branch where I live because the electron spins down. Both branches are real (since alive you / dead you are actually in superposition with the spin down/up electron).

From my perspective, I will indefinitely survive this apparatus, for the same reason I survive teleportation: body-based physical continuity is not important for survival, only psychological continuity is (this is Parfit’s conclusion on teleportation). After t=0, I survive if there is a brain computation at a future time that is psychologically continuous with my brain computation at t=0. 

Some common arguments against this are:

1) Teleportation and quantum immortality differ in one aspect, the amount of copies of you (or amount of your conscious computations) is held constant in teleportation but is halved with each run of QS. However, this doesn’t hold any import on what I expect to experience in both cases. You, and your experience, in a survival branch are in no way affected by what happens in the death branches. 

Objectively, the amount of me is quickly decreasing in QS, but subjectively, I am experiencing survival in the survival branches. There is no me in the death branch experiencing being dead. Thus, I expect to experience quantum immortality. Parfit argues that the amount of copies of you doesn't matter for survival as well (see his Teleporter Branch-Line case).

2) Max Tegmark’s objection: Most causes of death are non-binary events involving trillions of physical events that slowly kill you, so you would expect to experience a gradual dimming of consciousness, not quantum immortality. 

I don't think this matters. When you finally die in a branch, there is another branching where quantum miracles have spontaneously regenerated your brain into a fully conscious state. This branch has extremely low amplitude (low probability), but it exists. So you will always experience being conscious.



I don't actually believe quantum immortality is true (it is an absurdity), but I can't figure out a way to refute it under Derek Parfit's view on personal identity and survival."

1. It was philosophically interesting the conversation behind identity and showing the similarities between people and cultures was Amazon

3. The concept was much different & more modernized/ current compared to other fiction or sci-fi shows & I feel like this might be because it's back bone didn't rely so much on the sciences we are use to and more so on the meta ones 
If yall know more shows with a similar concept lmk I'll check it out

4. It's like X-men had a baby with The matrix and that baby had a baby with Doctor whoX Stranger Things it's a very character driven show and it doesn't feel like the characters are fighting for screen time 

5. There's Romance & even Spicyness (all kinds of spicyness....(A court of wings and ruin and the rest of that series couldn't compare)

6. The Show even has its own theme song ""What's Going On?"" 4nonblondes  and the rest of the soundtrack is amazing imagine if we got a season 3 which they were already dropping seeds for 

7. Execution how they transition between characters and the artistic impulses 😍😍😍🩷🩷🩷

And they do so for one of 2 reasons. However, each of these reasons is extremely flawed;

Reason 1: ""A man can do things to me that a bear can't. So I'd rather choose the bear.""

By this logic, women should choose being near a bear over WOMEN as well. Since women also have the potential to do worse things than a bear. However if you switch the roles and ask women the same question but replace the word man with woman, most of them will either choose the woman, or dodge the question-- which exposes the double standard they have.

Also, the chances of a random man harming you who does not know you or care about you are extremely small. Most women will look at extreme examples of men who commit sexual assault or violent crimes, and use that as a basis to judge all men. When you cannot do that. Because the overwhelming majority of men in the world are average and do not care about your existence at all.

Reason 2: ""The chances of being attacked by a bear are less than being attacked by a man""

This claim is extremely flawed and let me explain why: Most women will go on Google and type in the phrase ""what are the chances of being attacked by a bear?"" and then at the top of the search results they see the figure ""1 in 2.1 million"" and they use this as an entire basis for their argument without doing any other research. If you actually click on the website who created that statistic (the National Park Service) it tells you this is the chance of someone being injured by a bear for every *park visit*. This is not the chance of you being attacked by a bear during a bear encounter. On top of that, this stat was created from the record of ONE park. Not all parks with bears. Also, note how it says this is your chances of being *injured* by a bear. This means that bear attacks that do not lead to injury are not recorded at all.

If you want to figure out who is safer between men and bears, you must figure out the chances of being attacked by a bear during a random bear encounter, and compare that to the chances of being attacked by a man during a random ""man"" encounter. And then compare the two. Here's the mathematical formula:

Bear attacks ÷ Bear encounters 

vs

Man attacks ÷ man encounters

Although the mathematical equation itself is simple, the hard part is collecting accurate numbers for this equation. But I went ahead and did 2 hours of research collecting data on man encounters, violent and sexual assaults by men, bear attacks, and park visits where bears roam around. Here's what I found:

The chances of being assaulted by a man (either violent or sexual) at random when encountering a random man is 0.000039%. 

(if you want to know how I got this statistic, I am more than happy to share the math with you all. Just ask me in the comments below and I'll go into detail about how that figure was calculated.)


The chances of being injured by a bear per park visit is 0.000067%.
 
(again, im more than happy to share with you how I got this statistic. Ask me in the comments below if you would like to see the math involved)

Unfortunately, there are no stats online that dictate how many times people encounter bears per year. So creating the correct stat for the bear encounter ratio is not possible. However what we *can* do is use the park-visit statistic as guidance to guess what it might be. 

If I have a 0.000067% chance of being attacked by a bear when I am visiting a park and standing within a few miles from a bear, I can safely assume those chances increase the closer I get to the bear. And if I actually *encounter* the bear, then those chances DRASTICALLY increase. Let's say my chances increase 10x if I were to actually encounter a bear, or come within range for it to harm me. That would mean that my chances of being attacked by a bear during a bear encounter are 0.00067%. 0.00067% is 17x greater than 0.000039%, which again is the chance of a man violently or sexually attacking you at random. So the whole idea that bears are safer than men is simply not true."

17,2024-07-22,"CMV: There is no reason to start days, months, and years at 1 while starting seconds, minutes, and hours at 0.",u/AuroraItsNotTheTime,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e9qsf1/cmv_there_is_no_reason_to_start_days_months_and/,changemyview,"The first day of each month is numbered 1. The first month of each year is numbered 1. The first year of each century ends with 1.

Easy enough, right? However, that’s not what we do for smaller units of time than days.

The first hour of each day is 0 (or 12). The first minute of each hour is 0. And the first second of each minute is 0.

I posit that there is no sensible reason for this. Time is one continuous medium. It’s not like time operates differently when the unit in question is a day versus an hour. I understand we can’t go back in time and make year 0 be a thing. But we can make January month 0. If that makes no sense to you, then I don’t know how hour 0 could make sense.

And yet with both things, people act like the explanation is obvious, like it would be crazy to do it the other way. Like it’s not simply an arbitrary choice to count these units of time differently.

Re year 1: why would anything start at 0? You don’t start counting apples with “this is apple 0.”

Re January 1: it’s the first day of the first month. That sounds like a bunch of 1s to me! 01-01 it is!

But 01:01:01? That simply means that 1 hour, 1 minute, and 1 second have already passed since the start of the day. That’s not the first second of the first minute of the first hour. No. That’s crazy. That would be a crazy way to do things. Like absolutely insane to count and number units of time like that.

Forget the fact that 01-01-01 doesn’t mean that one month, one day, and a year have passed since the start of the century. It actually means no time has passed since the start of the century.

Part of me thinks that maybe there’s like a social reason behind it to make things clearer. Like yeah maybe people are so dumb that they can’t be expected to conceive of the second day of the month being 1 and not 2.

But it’s not like clocks are some obscure thing that no regular person ever sees outside of an advanced math class. People use clocks all the time! People seem to grasp perfectly well that 1:00am is the start of the SECOND hour of the day and not going “WHAT? But it says 1! This is only the first hour.” Similarly, they understand that the final 24th hour of the day is designated 23. I’d say it comes so naturally that most people don’t even realize that’s what they’re doing. Why they can’t conceive of the 24th day being numbered 23 also is beyond me.

PLEASE help me combat this intrusive thought. Change my view."
0,2024-07-22,CMV: Writing is an Obsolete Skill,u/jacobgc75,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e9qt22/cmv_writing_is_an_obsolete_skill/,changemyview,"Writing is obsolete. AI has made the skill of effective writing redundant. **What really matters now is the content of your ideas, thoughts, and opinions.** AI is like the world's best editor, democratizing ghostwriting for everyone. Jobs that used to need strong writing skills? Now anyone can do them with AI's help. Just focus on coming up with good ideas; AI will handle the rest.

Think about it. Content has always been king, but now the playing field is leveled. You don't need to be a wordsmith to get your point across effectively. AI tools can take your rough ideas and transform them into well-written pieces. This isn't just for the elite anymore - it's for everyone.

**The traditional argument that writing is necessary for developing thoughts is flawed.** You can develop ideas through various means: conversations, mind mapping, or even chatting with AI. Writing isn't the only path to clear thinking. As long as you can effectively develop your thoughts and generate interesting ideas or relevant opinions, the method you use to get there is irrelevant. The act of writing itself isn't some magical key to unlocking your thoughts.

Look at non-fiction books by celebrities or entrepreneurs. Most of them use ghostwriters. AI is essentially democratizing this process. **Now, anyone with a smartphone has a top-tier ghostwriter in their pocket.** This opens up opportunities for people who have great ideas but struggle with writing.

In the professional world, this shift is already happening. **Jobs that once required strong writing skills are now accessible to anyone with AI assistance.** It's not about how well you can string sentences together, but about the quality of your ideas and your ability to communicate them roughly.

Education systems might be slow to adapt, but that's nothing new. In practical terms, the ability to generate and articulate ideas is becoming far more valuable than the technical skill of writing.

**AI bridges the gap between raw thoughts and polished writing.** It's making traditional writing skills less necessary in many contexts. This doesn't mean communication is less important - if anything, it's more crucial than ever. But the form of that communication is changing.

In essence, don't waste time perfecting your prose. Spend that energy on developing your ideas. In this new landscape, that's what truly sets you apart. Writing, as we've known it, is obsolete. The future belongs to those who can think critically and leverage AI to communicate effectively."

AI uses images in the same way humans do to learn art. It does not copy and paste as many claim, nor does it trace. In that regard, AI is better with originality than humans.

What AI does is take a *lot* of images, identify patterns, and try to combine the patterns into a full image. It usually sucks, and gives something too many limbs, messes up shadows, clothing, and architecture. Sometimes, it gets something mostly or (rarely) entirely right. 

What a human does is take a *lot* of images (and/or time), identify patterns, and try to combine the patterns into a full, generally cohesive image. They usually suck, and give something an extra finger (though this almost always corrected), slightly mess up lines, causing them to undo and try again, etc. When they first start out, they can't get symmetry right, can't do realistic shadows, can't give convincing depth, and can't work from most angles. They need to hone a technique. 

The only substantial difference between AI and human images are that AI doesn't need a technique. Both humans and AI are influenced directly by the art they use as inspiration/the dataset. There's a good reason you can't copyright an art style. Why does it matter when an AI creates an image resembling another style? Humans do the same thing. How does an AI steal, but a human doesn't, even if they're given the same resources? "

I have family, friends, and coworkers who legitimately believe and I am not BSing, that if trump wins the election slavery will be back, being queer will be illegal, Legal immigrants will be deported, and overall the US will be the scariest country on earth.

This strategy worked well in 2020 due to the climate of the country at the time, but I don’t know how much longer this will last. Trump was president from 2016-2020 and the country is still intact. 

I am tired of fear mongering and identity politics being the focus of the Democratic Party. Where tf are the actual policies that will help America in the next for years?

However, like self-check outs, supermarkets trying to change this long standing agreement is a cost cutting measure designed to push their labour on to us.

Soft tortillas would have to be unusually flimsy and heavy-laden to fall apart, and even when they do, I find that the mess is not nearly as cumbersome to clean up. Even if the hard shell taco does not fall apart within the first few seconds of your meal, I find that toppings often fall out just because there’s no ceiling to keep it inside because you can’t simply wrap it into a burrito. This might be all well and good if messes don’t bother you, but hard shell tacos have yet another weakness: since they are by definition hard, rigid, and inflexible, the ingredients simply don’t blend into a harmonious mixture. You end up with layers of different ingredients: you might have the beans on the bottom, meat in the middle, and lettuce, avocado, and salsa on the top, but they just simply won’t mix.

Plus, the government would have to step in to prevent widespread riots. Without action, things could get really chaotic if a lot of people are out of work.

When AI starts replacing jobs, it won't just affect people in the private sector. I'm in the government sector, and we’re usually slow to adopt new tech. So, I think I'll be safe for a while."

It has both societal and genetic reasons. Girls are not expected to eat as much as men and exercise more since their childhood. This is the reason they grow to be shorter and weaker than males. Kayla Harrison is probably stronger than Alex Pereira because she trains and eat well like male fighters. 

Women have been eating less and not exercising since patriarchy came into existence. Not exercising and eating well for generations have made women weaker than men. There are tribes in Africa which have been always egalitarian and their men and women are equally strong and big. As the society gets more egalitarian, physical difference between men and women will reduce. 

Physical differences is even larger among Europeans and lowest among Africans. European women are more into dieting and weight loss which makes them weaker. Maybe their men preferred fragile women for generations. How many European female tennis players are built like Serena Williams, Madison Keys and Paolini? None. "
0,2024-07-23,cmv: The civil rights act of 1964 should be heavily repealed for the sake of an individual's freedom of association and to end the discrimination this law brings. ,u/Front_Battle9713,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e9zbxe/cmv_the_civil_rights_act_of_1964_should_be/,changemyview,"I actually made a post like this a couple months back I think and while I did have some decent moral arguments I could not fully argue against some because of me not doing a more in-depth look at the law. 

I will first address the counter arguments that I had seen on my last post. The first counter argument I saw was people saying ""well that's just the cost of doing business and if you don't like it then don't do it"", I do believe we would have to give up some of our freedoms when doing business as to not hurt the consumer or employers but that doesn't mean its alright to extend that to things that don't hurt others. If the government said I had to wear a silly hat to do business while that is a cost of doing business that doesn't mean its okay and I can not critique it. If you really want to make this argument then tie into a moral argument because this by itself is just a logical fallacy or more specifically an appeal to authority fallacy. 

I saw a comment that said disparate impact isn't actually applied to businesses and I mistakenly believed him because I did not properly look at individual cases of where companies got sued. the ***Griggs v. Duke Power Co*** and many other cases like this prove this entirely wrong, the Griggs v. Duke power co was a case where this company had tests and policies that had an adverse impact on their black workers as many of them could not pass when compared to their white peers. They were liable to being sued just for this and the individuals presiding over it knew they weren't intentionally being racist but still prohibited such policies. 

Disparate impact is logical fallacy and it scares companies into doing actually racists things like race based admissions or DEI initiatives that hire more ""protected classes"". This brings more racism into our society as some groups can be legally discriminated against for this sex, race, or gender if they aren't seen as being more oppressed.  

The main issue I place above everything else is how these laws restrict freedom of association for when choosing who to sell to and who to hire. Freedom of association that isn't that is untouched and left alone but its a restriction on freedom of association nonetheless. The individuals running these companies should be allowed to sell to whoever they please and who they want to hire, its them choosing who to associate with and its an weird restriction on their freedoms. We allow other forms of freedom of associations like high barriers to entry and other things but we place a restriction on race, gender, and sexuality as if that's too far. 

What if two groups have an ideological divide or just any other divide by on that individuals beliefs? What if there's a bar or a coffee shop that is catering towards feminists and a very traditional Muslim applicant applies or muslims frequently visit that business. The same can apply to a Christian or whatever but there can be an ideological divide and there is plenty of reason why they may not want people who they consider to be a counter to their beliefs to be hired or in their business. Why would you think its okay to force those two groups together instead of letting them willingly come to together or let one group exclude that one."

1. Establishing of Israel: The actual citizens at that time had no real say in this. It was mostly the allies from WW2 who did this. Can't change what was done. I don't think Israel should have been created to start with. We could have given them some random island or something. 

2. 1948 war / 6 day war: AFAIK, the countries like Egypt, Jordan, etc. initially agreed to the terms the allies set forth with the creation of Israel. They then decided to attack Israel some years later and take some land (Palestine), as a response Israel took land back from them and won the war. I see Israel as justified in doing this and it is Israel's land. 

4. I don't agree with Israel's current treatment of Palestians in Gaza/West Bank. They should have either kicked them all out in 1967 or allowed them to be equal. 

4. Why didn't the Palestinians just move back to Jordan after Israel took it in 1967? It was originally Israel's in 1947. 

5. For that matter why are other middle-eastern countries not opening their borders for their Muslim brothers and refugees today?

6. To the present day, Hamas is terrible and corrupt and are purposely hiding behind civilians knowing they can use them to generate more outcry (putting HQs under Palestinian hospitals, etc.) 

7. Looking at other middle eastern countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, why should Palestine be free? It will likely be un-democratic, and ruled with Sharia Law. The following instability will become a breeding ground for Islamic terrorism that will spread more to Israel and the general world. 

Obviously, not everything the Israeli government has done is good. Killing civilians is never ok. They may have gone overboard with some of the stuff."

Arguments about national security, cultural preservation, or economic impact often seem like thinly veiled attempts to justify exclusionary and discriminatory attitudes.

Conservatives may claim that strict immigration policies are necessary for maintaining security or preserving cultural heritage. However, these positions often mask a deeper reluctance to accept people from different backgrounds. The emphasis on legal versus illegal immigration, for instance, frequently feels like a way to rationalize broader anti-immigrant sentiments.

The economic argument that immigrants take jobs away from native citizens ignores the complex realities of the job market and the significant contributions immigrants make to the economy. This narrative pits citizens against newcomers, fostering division and resentment.

At its core, the conservative rhetoric on xenophobia seems driven by a fear of losing cultural dominance and a reluctance to embrace diversity. This perpetuates stereotypes, fuels discrimination, and undermines the principles of equality and inclusion. 

Given this, I believe such viewpoints are inherently bigoted and should not be given attention or legitimacy.

I’m open to changing my view if there are conservative perspectives on migration that genuinely promote a positive sum game for human upliftment."

0,2024-07-23,CMV: just because Sean Strickland has beaten an ex-Navy SEAL in a sparring doesn't mean that Navy SEAL can't beat Sean Strickland in a street fight,u/AlexFerrana,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ea0mto/cmv_just_because_sean_strickland_has_beaten_an/,changemyview,"Recently, internet was hyped up about how Sean Strickland has beaten an ex-Navy SEAL, who's also a professional MMA fighter with an amateur background, in a sparring.

People started to say that ""Navy SEALs are overrated, your average amateur MMA mops the floor with them in a fight"" or ""Strickland proves that a professional MMA fighter is better than elite military in terms of hand-to-hand combat, Navy SEAL fanboys can cope harder"".

That made me feel absolutely disgusting and weird. And I have my counter-points about all of this stuff:

1) Sean Strickland has beaten a guy who only has 3 fights in MMA (2 wins and 1 loss (to the same fighter that he would beat in rematch), plus 11 wins and 1 loss in amateur MMA), and yes, he was a Navy SEAL, but the fact that this guy (his name is Mitch Aguiar, a.k.a. ""Smashin' Frog"": https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/100131-mitch-aguiar) is barely even trying to fight back and Strickland just uses him as a dummy for punching doesn't prove that ""MMA fighter > Navy SEAL"". Seems to be a fixed match for me. Also, Mitch's last pro fight was in 2020, and his resume doesn't seems to be impressive ( in 2018, he defeated a fighter named Brandon Pennington, which record is 1 win and 3 losses, and another fighter named Mumia Abu Del Ali in 2020, to whom he lost in 2018, who has an overall 3 wins and 3 losses record. Not counting amateur fights of Mitch Aguiar, but there's also nothing impressive as well).

2) Sean Strickland is indeed a professional fighter, sure, who has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and who started to train in MMA since he was 18. Great. Meanwhile, Navy SEAL aren't trained to fight in the octagon and win against a single opponent under the set of rules while wearing gloves, mouthguard and a cup. They're trained in many military things, which includes hand-to-hand combat, and their hand-to-hand combat isn't the same as MMA. Their hand-to-hand combat is for survival and for killing. 

3) Just because Navy SEALs has less advanced hand-to-hand combat training and skills doesn't mean that they're bad fighters. They don't need fancy combos or flashy kicks, they're using simple and effective moves which are also combined with a killer instinct and brutality. 

4) Jason Pike, who was originally challenged by Sean Strickland, said that ""yes, you can beat me in the octagon, but I would cripple or even kill you in a street fight"". And Jason is right. Because street fights has no rules and since Navy SEALs are trained to finish the fights as quickly as possible, it means that Navy SEAL's tactic would be aimed for the incapacitation of the opponent. And don't forget that streets has much harder surface and that makes it different from gyms and octagon.

5) Experience and skills of an MMA fighter is a good thing, but it's not everything and isn't really applicable in a street fight, especially where is a risk of a severe injury or death. Navy SEALs are trained to fight under stress and ""life or death"" situation, and they aren't fighting for money or for fame, they're fighting for the country. Their mentality is their main weapon, which makes them an ultimate warriors. 

6) Navy SEAL's main asset is an endurance and toughness, which they're training under an extreme conditions. I highly doubt that SEAN Strickland could pass the recruitment process of a Navy SEAL.

7) There's a lot of Navy SEAL's that are doing martial arts and advanced combat training even after retirement. Jocko Willink is one of them – he is a combat veteran who is 50+ years old now, but still in a great shape, has a black belt in BJJ and rolls/spars with elite fighters, and usually shows that he's a legit fighter who can give them a serious challenge or even defeat them.

8) ""OK, then why nobody from Navy SEAL has challenged Strickland to fight on the street with no rules?"". Well, I don't think that Navy SEAL guy would like to face charges of aggravated assault and attempted murder (if Strickland survives) or manslaughter (if street fight ends up with Strickland's death). Navy SEALs aren't idiots like Strickland who brags about how badass he is because he floored his abusive father with a headbutt and beaten him with a guitar or who is proud that he's a homophobic gun-totin' racist, willing to shoot a bunch of kids that was just pranking. Another one proof that Navy SEAL has better mentality."

0,2024-07-23,CMV: high schools should give goat speeches,u/sinmark,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ea27v6/cmv_high_schools_should_give_goat_speeches/,changemyview,"in the united states military academy, often referred to as West Point, there is a tradition. at graduation, the graduate with the lowest score is given the goat award. this is in reference to the mascot of their rival Annapolis. i think that this award should not only just be given to high schoolers but also give them the opportunity to give a speech.

in status quo, there is a simple problem. valedictorians give bad speeches. why then does this happen. well its for a simple reason. valedictorians have every incentive to tow the line. this is for two structural reasons. first is that if they reach this point they probably have a lot of privilege. generally speaking these are people who didnt have money problems or deal with rough home lives. or at the very least it didnt affect them to the point where it impeded there studies. and most importantly, even if they did struggle they got the support they needed. thus, generally speaking, they dont feel the need to make changes. the second structural reason is that this is a big opportunity for them. thus the school admin has a strong piece of leverage to control the valedictorian. if the valedictorian ever tries to rock the boat, the admin can take away the award. 

whats the solution then? its simple, give goat speeches. if your the goat, then your likely the opposite of a valedictorian. if your at this point, you had a ton of hurdles to even graduate. hurdles that were significant. if your the goat, you are the kind of person who maybe struggled with money struggled with a rough home life, struggled with racism, or bullying, or homophobia. your one of the people who had mental health issues or what ever other issues you faced that i dont even know of, and you faced these to the degree that they affected your academics. most importantly here is that they didnt get the support they needed. these are the kind of people at the margins, who struggled with barely any support squeaked over the finish line.

the impacts here are simple, we get better more critical speeches. we bring attention to issues in schools that NEED to address. and we get this message directly from the people that needed it the most. we get this message directly from the people the system failed. the comparative is simple, in status quo, we get speeches from perfectionists who will suck the dicks of the admin. on my side we get critical speeches from marginalized communities that bring attention to where the system has failed. in status quo we get a system that ignores issues. on my side we get schools that address the issues head on."

However, I do not believe that the climate change has the potential to threaten the food security of the human race. We will ensure to protect our main sources of food with the various means available to us. From efficient farming to genetic engineering and to changing our food habits. Basically, I’m convinced that 1) the impact on our main food sources will be minimal 2) we will be able to adapt. And if the continuos economic growth and development require that the variability of flora and fauna decreases… well so be it as long as it doesn’t threaten our survival. Of course, we have to do our best to minimise the impact on plants and animals outside of our food chain. "

I made something, I feel proud of it, people are fascinated by it and give money for it, this is a living economy, that's all. But now, people can just write a prompt, and an average of stolen art can be made. This art is not art, it's noise, and soon it will blend with the rest of what we have by becoming almost indistinguishable (before AI can actually CREATE art, and not generate it). Smaller artists who usually don't even do it for the money or full-time will simply be overshadowed by a wave of ""UNTALENTED"" people who usually are people that don't even try to learn the skill (most of the time they have time to do but start throwing excuses). It's like a middle finger thrown right into their face, screw expression, screw smaller artists, only big artists and people who don't bother learning the art prevail.

Imagine your hobby is Bowling, you were bad at it, but soon you learned how to get very good at it. Then someone invents an automatic hand adjuster that literally throws the ball for you and 95% of the time strikes for you. Also that device is not visible, so you (soon) won't be able to tell who is legitimately a good player and who is not. Same thing for gaming, as AI's capable of recognizing patterns on your screen may aimbot for you without even being ""aimbots"". So then, why would I feel the need to actually become good, when I can just automate everything.

There's this excuse circulating around that, food was industrialized, clothing was industrialized, and why shouldn't art be too? But those are basic human needs. Art is easily distributable and is very vast in variety. You can open Youtube, listen to 99% of its content for free. You can search up any piece of art, you can watch and read things at very reasonable prices for the artist, all with the same access one has to AI.

Another one is that silly excuse of people saying ""this artist tried to overcharge me for a drawing, therefore all artists deserve this"", absolutely wrong to overgeneralize like that. Psychopathic dictators do shit like that, not regular people.

And a third one is that humans already get ""inspired"" by art, therefore are in a way stealing it. It makes sense, but this is a terrible excuse. Many things you hear, many genres evolved from classical music, and classical music evolved from other more folk music, and we keep going on this pattern until we arrive to the point where humans simply like to make beats and melodies. People are inspired by others, but based on evolution, people really just start to make their own stuff up at times. Besides, if two pieces of art are too closely related, people can usually tell.

Besides all that, let's not forget that AI Videos are going to be extremely devestating, in comparison to AI images. Misinformation will skyrocket, individuals wouldn't even be able to send something that is a video and call it actual proof (And don't tell me that editing already contributed against that, editing takes a LOT more effort to do and a lot more time)

And then people even get HURT when artists protest about all this. You are destroying a massive part of an industry and you are replacing with something nobody really needed, and you cannot even admit that things are fine the way they are without model generated art."

Misinformation spreads like wildfire, and because social media companies are for-profit, the profit motive disincentivizes them from seriously fighting it and punishing accounts that exist solely to spread it. 

The open Internet allows enemy actors to spread society-weakening propaganda, and there are currently no useful mechanisms that keep the conspiracy-minded from seeking out misinformation. Authoritarians use it to manipulate the public in ways that are extremely toxic to entire nations. I believe it's one of the main reasons that America is currently in a huge political crisis. 

One way to help alleviate these issues would be to require all social media to become non-profit and subject to strict regulations. Removing the profit motive would alter the nature of how owners of social media companies approach their product, and cause other motives like creating a quality product that facilitates communication to become more salient. Heavy regulation would ensure that there are adequate safety measures put in place to keep misinformation to a genuine minimum and reduce the spread of propaganda. 

If a social media site could not survive under those conditions, that site should not exist. Social media is an incredibly powerful and dangerous tool and needs to be controlled for the sake of societal health."
0,2024-07-23,CMV: There is absolutely no scientific reason to think that (non-human) animals are conscious but plants are not. ,u/Skipquernstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ea44zv/cmv_there_is_absolutely_no_scientific_reason_to/,changemyview,"By 'consciousness' here, I mean the subjective experience of qualia that humans seem to have. Famously, there is no scientific consensus on what this is, or how it arises; some people think it is an illusion caused by a certain kind of information processing, some think it's a feature of the universe that we just haven't scientifically described yet. 

A lot of the average person's intuition about consciousness is not scientifically verifiable. Many of us feel like consciousness must be associated with intelligent behaviour, or self-acknowledgement, or even brains - but because we can't scientifically isolate consciousness, we actually can't find any of its correlates. 

For many people, it's intuitive that actions are immoral if they harm a conscious being. Harming an inanimate object isn't the same, because it doesn't cause a conscious subjective experience of pain. So a lot of arguments against things like animal agriculture revolve around the idea that animals are conscious, presumably with the implication that plants aren't conscious so we should farm them instead. 

But increasingly, it's being shown that plants do exhibit complex chemical responses to things that happen in their environments. They have self-preserving behaviour; they organise their resources to avoid being cut, injured or malnourished. This is fundamentally the same thing that animals do, even if the surface-level behaviour is different. 

Animals react to harm in a similar way to humans (because we are related to them), but plants react to it in their own way. Given that we actually don't know how to diagnose consciousness in things, for all we know, plants might be having an intense subjective experience of pain when they're harvested. 

This may feel like some kind of dodgy argument based on weird technicalities, but I mean it sincerely. I think plants are just as likely to have conscious experiences of pain as animals are, and I think we narcissistically assume only animals feel pain because they express it in the same way that humans do. 

I am personally a vegan for environmental reasons, and am not trying to argue against veganism in general. I am also not specifically arguing that animals aren't conscious, or that plants are. I'm just arguing that the seemingly 'obvious' distinction we draw between them is based on vibes rather than science. 

I know I worded this kind of bluntly just because I didn't want the post to be too long, but I'm genuinely interested in hearing where other people's reasoning leads them on this :) "

She has a troubled history with black voters due to her time as an attorney general, being part of the criminal justice system that unfairly incarcerated a lot of black citizens.

She was part of the Biden administration which failed to pass meaningful gun control or health care reforms, not to mention was generally asleep at the wheel for the out of control inflation until a year later. We still don’t have universal paid leave despite having control of both houses the first two years of the presidency.

And, most damning IMO, she was complicit in covering up Biden’s mental fitness for years. She was a hypocrite arguing about how the RNC put party above Country, only to do the exact same thing once the tables were turned. She could have been the loudest voice in the room about his lack of mental fitness - but instead she was the quietest, sitting back idly by waiting for other people in the party to force his hand.

Plus, as a true racial/anti-semitic kicker, I don’t see how this country puts a female person of color AND a Jewish man (her husband) in the Oval. Between sexism, racism, and antisemitism, I don’t think it’s likely for her to build a coalition beyond the far lefties, and even then they don’t like her bc she was part of the administration that was sending weapons to Israel. Even AOC said the whole ticket had to go.

I think the best chance for the DNC to win in November is to nominate virtually anyone else."

0,2024-07-23,CMV: Conservatives are much more dangerously misinformed about guns than liberals.,u/VanillaIsActuallyYum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ea7127/cmv_conservatives_are_much_more_dangerously/,changemyview,"To clarify, when I say ""dangerously misinformed"", I mean ""lacking enough knowledge that it is conceivable that your actions will lead to someone's death"". And it's quite easy for death and guns to be associated with one another, obviously.

Why do I say this? First and foremost, there's the fact that conservatives are largely unaware of, if not in complete denial about, the fact that simply owning a gun increases your risk of suicide. And I don't mean owning a gun while having a mental health crisis or owning a gun as some particular high-risk demographic. I mean just straight-up owning a gun, that having a gun in your house puts you at greater risk of death by suicide than someone who does not have a gun, *even after you control for every conceivable variable you can think of*. 

[This is well-documented.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/) Nevertheless, I have yet to meet a conservative who was aware of this risk, and furthermore, when I show them the research on this, I have never actually successfully convinced them that this is true, largely because they just continue to deny science and prefer to bury their heads in the sand about it. When I talk to liberals about it, they are more often aware of this increased risk associated with gun ownership, or I can present them the research and they willingly accept the conclusion.

Furthermore, conservatives often elevate this to an even more dangerous level of misinformation with the maddening reply of ""well it doesn't matter if they did this with a gun or not; they were just going to kill themselves with something else anyway."" Let's get something straight: *this is not true*. As the previous research shows, death rates DO change based on whether a person owns a gun, which means that the statement clearly cannot be true. But what's incredibly destructive about this point of view is how it *dismantles the concept of mental health treatment*. Conservatives are seriously trying to undermine the entire concept of mental health just to clutch their pearls over the second amendment, and they're doing it in a way that isn't even factually correct. Think about it: if you're sending a message that a person who wants to kill themselves is ""going to get their way eventually"", you're sending a message that suicidal ideation does not go away, that it cannot be treated or addressed, *AND THAT IS NOT TRUE IN THE SLIGHTEST BUT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IDEA TO BE PROMOTING*. Because anyone contemplating suicide might read a stance like that and think, well, if this guy is telling me that there's no cure for my suicidal ideation, why not just get it over with? You're depriving people of hope based on a lie you concocted to defend a right that you're dangerously misinformed about...does it get much worse than this?

Moving on, how about gun laws? Time and time again, conservatives insist that gun laws are useless, that they have zero effect, that nobody has ever crafted any form of gun law of any degree that has ever had any meaningful impact whatsoever. As exceedingly unlikely as such an event is in really ANY circumstance (it's like trying to argue that consuming any substance is guaranteed to have zero effect on your body), we've seen more than enough to know that there are gun laws and gun reforms out there that DO have an impact. [This source is probably the best one I can find on that front.](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/what-science-tells-us-about-the-effects-of-gun-policies.html) It found that:

>there is supportive evidence that [child-access prevention laws reduce firearm self-injuries (including suicides)](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/child-access-prevention/suicide.html), [firearm homicides or assault injuries](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/child-access-prevention/violent-crime.html), and [unintentional firearm injuries and deaths among youth](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/child-access-prevention/unintentional-injuries.html). In addition, we found supportive evidence that [stand-your-ground laws increase firearm homicides](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground/violent-crime.html) and supportive evidence that [shall-issue concealed carry laws increase total and firearm homicides](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/concealed-carry/violent-crime.html).

Nevertheless, you still hear conservatives rail against any and all gun laws, sometimes from purely ideological grounds, but often they come from the severely misinformed viewpoint that gun laws do not work and are ineffective. If you are saying ""sure, I understand the research and that people WILL die without these gun laws, but I'd still rather just stick to my interpretation of the second amendment"", that's one thing. Saying ""gun laws don't even work, bro"" is quite another, and I'm telling you that I am NOT seeing the former, I'm seeing the latter, and that is far, far worse.

The only apparent edge that conservatives generally have over liberals is that they understand the mechanics and details of guns better than liberals do. I freely admit this. Conservatives are much more likely to know that famous ""gotcha!"" that the ""AR"" in AR-15 doesn't actually stand for ""assault rifle"", what the term ""caliber"" is referring to, all the various models of handguns, shotguns, rifles in existence, etc. However, this is, and always has been, a minor issue, for sure way less minor than anything else I have mentioned. Specific knowledge about guns is primarily useful in crafting up a law that might restrict access to guns, sure, but how many of us are even in a position to be crafting these laws? A person absolutely has the right to say, I may not know the exact details of how much damage each type of gun can cause, but I know that some guns and the ammunition they fire are more deadly than others and I'd like to see laws and regulations that reflect this. We've already implemented this in all sorts of other industries. 

Take toys for example. I wouldn't know whether a toy was specifically suited for 6 month old children, or what's appropriate for age 2 vs age 3, but nevertheless, I do support the idea of labeling toys with age-appropriate labels on there, even though I wouldn't know how to do it myself. And from there, some child-rearing expert can handle it and craft up the labels appropriately. I did not need to be that expert myself to know that this would be a good idea in general. I don't see why it's any different when it comes to gun laws, why it is such an abhorrent sin to not know a semi-automatic from a hammer-fired pistol.

To sum up, I think conservatives are dangerously misinformed on suicide risk, on the effectiveness of gun laws, and I don't think the edge they have on general gun knowledge is meaningful.

I think concert venues should prominently message etiquette to concert-goers prior to shows beginning, and empower members of the audience to report those who don’t follow that etiquette. 

The etiquette basically is - once the show begins, don’t push your way in front of other attendees unless there is already space for you, and don’t dance in a way that forces others to need to adjust their position (unless it’s a concert where everyone is dancing in this way; ie, moshing at a metal show). 

Movie theaters tell audience members to follow a certain set of rules to ensure a fairly consistent experience for the general crowd. Obviously there are some variables a general admission concert can’t control, like the height of attendees, but the above rules in my opinion would lead to a more pleasant experience for all. 

Even if venues don’t hire additional security to help enforce this type of system, I believe the social pressure of messaging these general “don’t be an a-hole” type rules would at the very least slightly deter this kind of behavior, and empower audiences to call it out more readily. "

I agreed to be a part of it.

During her speech, my cousin (who is probably 5’4 350lbs) said something like “I want you to be alive to see your grandchildren get born”.

As powerful of a statement as that was, I started thinking that if we had a similar intervention for her she would go apeshit. And people would consider it “fat shaming” and “fat phobic”, even though the intention would be the same: to stop her from slowly killing herself.

If you still aren’t convinced of the double standard consider a man who smokes married to a morbidly obese woman. What do you think would be seen as more socially acceptable: the woman telling him to stop smoking for the sake of his health, or the man telling her to stop eating so much for the sake of her health?

This isn’t to say that anyone should go around commenting on strangers’ weight. Just like it isn’t appropriate to comment on strangers’ smoking habit. But both are addictions and they should both be able to be brought up by loved ones without one being stigmatized more than the other.

Admittedly this is from an American point of view where obesity is very common and smoking is not. Maybe it’s not like that in other parts of the world but there is a definite double standard in America and that double standard isn’t justified. CMV"

Tbh i still don’t know shit about shit, I was considering voting trump this year but i just can’t and it has nothing to do with trump himself, even if he was to magically bring us into an economic golden age, and fix the conflict in middle east and russia. the divisiveness he causes in our own country is unbearable and every year i feel like we are closer to something very bad happening
. Whether trump is a sexist, a racist, a homophobe i don’t know but his cult following sure is and ever since 2016 these people, people who used to be embarrassed of their ignorant views and hide, are out marching on the streets. 

So my plan was to not vote this year until the news just broke absolutely Biden. I honesty can’t bring myself to care about who wins, democracy is a scam, oil companies, pharmaceutical companies and secret wealthy families are the ones in control of what really goes on. This whole thing is is far too heated and at this point i feel like it’s almost on purpose to trick people like myself, the little guys who are too stressed out by their own lives trying to figure out how to pay bills. They don’t want us to vote. 

But anyway to my view. Whoever the president is doesn’t really matter right now with the way everything is playing out i don’t feel we are at some like of pivotal or turning point in the country at least not with these candidates it feels tired, there will not be a total abortion ban, there will not be a ban on assault weapons, there won’t be less trillions of dollars sent over to foreign countries, There won’t be a ban on trans care for adults, whether you’re red or blue none your major concerns will change drastically over the next 4 years, inflation isn’t going anywhere there will likely be mass deportation either way and both sides support israel and both sides don’t to mess with russia at this point. So the way i see it as a woman is that i might as well vote for a woman because if trump wins the culture that would ensue would make it so it would be a very very long time before a woman would make it on the ticket again. Little girls don’t have very good if anyone to look up to these days, and not to say Kamala harris is a woman worth looking up to but i just think it would be good to grow up in a society where the girls aren’t afraid to shoot big and work hard. When i was a little girl i wanted to be in the NBA, which is obviously very unrealistic but i don’t think people should say that to a little girl, i would’ve grown up and realized myself instead of quitting sports as a whole, like yeah i wouldn’t have been in the nba but if the adults around me had said i’ll need to work very hard instead of girls aren’t good at sports maybe i could’ve been in the wnba, maybe i could have gotten a college scholarship, maybe i would’ve just continued playing for fun and getting good exercise and not become obese by the age of 15. Maybe this is a terrible reason to vote for the leader of the country but i really feel like nothing is left to lose and hatred is at high i would just feel very relieved "

Yes, it might sound silly stating this before the 2024 election and (probably) four more years of Trump, but I just don't think the party will survive 2028 and beyond. Trump has upended the party in a significant way. Everyone who's tried to emulate him has failed to gain traction.  I think the party will spin its wheels for a long time, similar to how the Democrats have struggled post-Obama, but this will last much longer, perhaps even decades. There will be an ever-growing divide between those who want Trumpism to continue and those who want to move on. If the party returns to a common-sense approach (i.e., not creating a conspiracy out of everything), the media and party members will have to pivot, making the Trumpist zeitgeist nearly obsolete. Political pivoting typically shouldn't be that difficult, but the extremes of the past eight years, such as pushing unfounded election fraud claims, spreading conspiracy theories around Jan 6. rather than being responsible and denouncing it, and more, make it challenging. Switching to a moderate figure like Nikki Haley will be difficult and may push the MAGA crowd into a smaller, more extreme faction over time. While some may argue that MAGA will continue post-Trump, I don't think anyone else can replicate his cult-like appeal. For example, Nikki Haley, who is furthest from Trump, polled the best against Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy tried to imitate Trump and received some attention but almost no support. Ron DeSantis was slightly more successful, but it doesn't seem like he is that well-liked outside of Florida and is unlikely to carry the Trump torch. He folds too easily and lacks the demeanor to take on the ""demagogue"" type roll. The MAGA base wants Trump himself, not an imitator. In fact, I'd go as far as to say the average heavily invested MAGA voter might lose interest in politics all-together once Trump is gone, while Democrat voters could become more emboldened, especially after another chaotic and exhausting four years of Trump.

When the best players of these games have a 55-65% winrate, ITS A LUCK BASED GAME, and deal with it.
Its funny to see th denial in their faces, when they are trying to justify their wasted time in that specific game or sport.
A Non luck based game or sport is like WoW arena, or Chess. Where the best of the best players can have 95-99% winrate,obviously from factors that are unlikely like having a rly bad day, missclicking/distraction,heart attack,internet connection loss etc...
If a game is not luck based, then you dont have to go 100 games against someone to conclude whether you are better, cause thats just dumb, nobody has time for that, and also the law of large numbers only works for truly large numbers,  at 100-200 games there is still a slight chance,unlikely but still a chance that can happen , where you simply got there becauss of luck.
Obviously skill plays a role in games like LOL or Poker, but its not large enough to be considered a skill based game. Like you could choose the best poker player rn and a 6 year old monkey. And a monkey could beat the best player in the world with just some simple luck. That is just insane. Now you cant do the same in Chess. Magnus Carlsen would beat a monkey a 100 out of 100 times. There is no luck involved if we exclude the heart attack.

So people who play luck based games stop living in denial and accept it. There is nothing wrong with you putting your time in a game where a baby chimpanzee can outplay you, by just sheer luck, if you like losing to people who are worse than you, go ahead and have fun, but dont look down on people who prefer playing games where luck factor is minimized, and the skill and knowledge has way more weight."

It was by voting for Joe Biden that we actually got billions for clean energy, banned the no-knock warrants and chokeholds (which killed Briana Taylor and George Floyd), billions of student loans canceled, money to rebuild communities, and a child tax credit (that eventually expired).

Protesting without voting is kind of a waste of time. Voting actually makes the things being protested possible."

But it's really just meaningless cope. To me it translates to ""Theyre following the law but if the law was different then they'd follow that law""....uh yeah maybe? 

So unless I'm missing something the phrase is just a meaningless cope. It seems like a way to create an negative image of someone in your head because you don't actually have a valid reason to view them negatively or implying something

People want to execute you, lock you up, or cancel you forever, it doesn't matter if you plead guilty, are convicted, have done your time, and genuinely try to change, any efforts to do so will always be mocked as disingenuous. If they take their own life, people say they got off easy. They literally have nothing to look forward to, but everything to gain if they deny, deny, deny.

I said it's like the only purpose rapists who confess and try to change is to be recipients of hate and punishment, cautionary tales, but there is nothing left for them. In fact, it seems like **the more remorse a rapist tries to convey, the more they are hated and reviled. On the other hand, those who vehemently deny despite overwhelming evidence and conviction have more options remain open to them.** As long as they deny, someone will be willing to defend them. Even if the evidence is overwhelming. They remain in their positions of power. Even if convicted and incarcerated, they are still better off than if they had confessed and tried to change. There is zero incentive to do so.

For expressing this opinion I got absolutely destroyed by my friends, however, it felt like they were fighting me for something I didn't even say, as though I was defending rapists, which I was absolutely not. I tried to ask what a rapist has to gain by trying to get rehabilitated, they said ""they would at least be accepted somewhat by society,"" at which point I reminded them that all of them have expressed that view that ""a rapist will never change."" So the acceptance they are talking about is forever out of reach. 

I was so shocked by the violent response in what I thought was a safe space to express that thought, that I just noped out of the conversation stat and decided I would never verbalize a thought like that IRL again. But whenever I find out that an opinion I hold is that unpopular, I definitely want to understand why and change my view if I have to.

To be clear, this is the extent of view which I am asking to be challenged:

**Society disincentivizes rapists making efforts towards their own rehabilitation. If society at large does not honestly believe rapists can be rehabilitated, rapists themselves have no incentive to try to change, and will always focus all their efforts into trying to evade justice, over a lifetime if needed.**"
19,2024-07-23,CMV: The 'hard problem of consciousness' is worthy of scientific investigation.,u/Skipquernstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eaedco/cmv_the_hard_problem_of_consciousness_is_worthy/,changemyview,"(Quick definition for those who haven't heard of it - the 'hard problem of consciousness' is the scientific/philosophical problem of why and how we have subjective conscious experiences, rather than the brain just operating 'in the dark' with no subjective experience).

I don't know exactly where I stand on the hard problem of consciousness. I have a background in cognitive science and definitely would prefer a materialist explanation (although I am open to all ideas). I completely understand the perspective that there is probably illusion involved - I lean towards thinking that the brain is certainly tricking itself into thinking consciousness is a lot more significant/unusual than it really is. 

But I get the impression from a lot of colleagues in the 'illusion' camp that they don't think the issue is worth investigating at all. To me, this seems to be taking it too far in the other direction. One way or another, either something freaky is going on (that stretches the limits of normal materialism), or the brain is pulling an ALMIGHTY number and convincing itself that something basically impossible is happening. As I said, I lean towards the latter option, but I still think this illusion could be described a lot better than it has been so far. 

If you'll only work with objectively verifiable data, that is very doable - people's testimony of consciousness is physical and real, so even if it's not very precise, it must come from somewhere in the pipeline of their brain. Could we study what happens when people start thinking about consciousness, and whether that produces any weird feedback loop in any particular area? I'm not suggesting it would be anything magic, but it would certain explain a measurable and interesting aspect of human behaviour (i.e. the fact that we're so convinced we have consciousness that some of us dedicate hours of our time to thinking about it).

27,2024-07-23,"CMV: Political debates, such as between presidential candidates, should allow notes to promote better performances",u/CleverDad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eaekrz/cmv_political_debates_such_as_between/,changemyview,"In the last presidential debate, between Biden and Trump, one of the rules was ""no notes allowed"".

For sure, that particular debate might not have been saved - or even improved much - if notes were allowed, but I'll argue that *in general*, forbidding notes is not a good idea.

Debates serve several purposes:

* We wish to know the candidates' political standpoints and proposed policies
* We wish to assess the candidates' character and ideology
* We wish to assess the candidates' competency and acuity

I assume the ""no notes"" rule is meant to promote the third bullet point: Is the candidate able to present their views and policies and argue coherently for their character and ideology *from memory*, without notes to help them remember key points or structure their arguments.

This is not without merit per se, as a politician skilled enough to keep everything in memory and recalling it as needed must surely be a competent politician, but it has the negative consequence that most contenders will perform worse and often not be able to give their views and policies the presentation they deserve.

Also, it favors not only very experienced politicians disproportionally, but also those kinds of candidates who don't really have much concrete policy but just ad-libs stuff that sounds good. Fresher candidates, with rational, detailed policies based on sound ideology and empirical evidence, will have the hardest time.

While I agree that competency matters, I think political discourse would benefit from more focus on the merit of actual policies and their coherence and applicability and less focus on mere debate skills (including memory skills). By allowing notes, the quality of the debate will benefit and the viewers will be able to more accurately compare the candidates' opposing stances, and that is after all the most important purpose of political debate."
8,2024-07-23,CMV: School vouchers are bad policy,u/kabukistar,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eaf32a/cmv_school_vouchers_are_bad_policy/,changemyview,"#What are school vouchers?

Normally, in the United States, the government provides public school.  If you want to send your kids to a private school or homeschool them or do any other kind of educational option besides public school, then you are responsible for funding that yourself. 

School vouchers are a mechanism by which the government subsidizes you sending your children to some other educational option besides public school.  Most commonly, it's money that can go towards the tuition cost at a private school.

#What's the problem with school vouchers?

The main problem is that it takes money away from public education to instead support other parties.   Some people (on an individual level) might want to take their kids out of public school and put them in private school for their kids to get a better education, if the public schools in their area are lacking and there is a private school in their area that provides better education.  But that decision only makes sense because of the lack of quality in the local public school.  And school vouchers are exacerbating that problem by taking money from the public education.

Rather than spending public money subsidizing people going to private school, it would make more sense to use it to improve the quality of public schools in the area.  That way you are improving the quality of education for a wider swath of students.   There's nothing magical about being private that causes a school to be better.  If a private school is capable of operating at a level of quality, than public schools are as well.  And, as a government, you should fix whatever problems there are with the public schools.

Improving public schools, rather than subsidizing private schools, will be a benefit for everyone but a small group of people.

#Who do school vouchers benefit?

There are some things that private schools can do that public schools (even well-set-up and funded) cannot.  And putting money towards public schools instead of vouchers will be less of a benefit for people who desire those.  Those features are:

* **Religious indoctrination**:  If your goal for your child's education is more about ensuring that they are repeatedly told the value and correctness of your specific religious beliefs, rather than educating them, then that is something public schools cannot do, since they are by mandate secular institutions (Republican attempts to change this at the state level notwithstanding).  So that is one thing you can get through private schools but not public schools.

* **Create more class stratification**:  If you are very wealthy, and you want to give your kids every advantage in life over those who have less resources than you, then that's going to be a goal that funding public schools can't server.   Because improving public schools raises up the educational attainment of those with less wealth than you, eating away at the ""advantage"" you want to grant your kids.  So funding public schools wont meet your goals of trying to create as much distance between your kids and others.

* **Profit**:  If you have a financial stake in a private school (for example, being an investor in one), then school vouchers are going to help you realize more profit, since the government is essentially paying people money to buy your product.  Putting those resources towards improving public schools instead would mean people have less of a reason to go to your private school (since the free alternative is already high quality) and they have less resources to purchase tuition at your school (since they aren't receiving subsidies in the form of school vouchers).  So your bottom line is greatly helped by draining resources from public schools to have school vouchers.


These are the main goals/groups of people that I can think of that would benefit from school vouchers but wouldn't benefit from just improving public schools instead.   However, I don't think any of these goals should be compelling government interests and warrant choosing a policy that decreases the quality of education for the general population to support.

Are there other significant, more worthwhile, reasons for having school vouchers over improving public schools that I'm missing?  Maybe?  I'm curious to hear what people think.  Change my view."
18,2024-07-23,CMV: Labels like “boomer” or “karen” or any other labels (eg. “woke”) used to generalize a group of people are always problematic & counterproductive,u/Landa_Chuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eaf3ca/cmv_labels_like_boomer_or_karen_or_any_other/,changemyview,"We are a species that relies on pattern recognition to process the information around us. As a natural consequence, to try and understand, interpret, & navigate our various social milieus we tend to group (seemingly) similar people together & apply labels to them to simplify and make our understanding of the world more manageable.

While somewhat inevitable, we should fight & question this impulse whenever possible because the consequence of oversimplification leads to all forms of prejudice, xenophobia, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, classism, etc that we encounter on this planet.

I suspect “Boomer”, “karen” & certain other labels get a pass because they are generally associated with those in a position of power. It is therfore perceived as justice to generalize these groups together in order to attack them in a simple/manageable way. 

My issue is these labels are still prejudice, plain and simple, and therefore will always lead to injustice.

Society is infinitely complex, & flippantly applying labels (positive OR negative) to every group of people different from you that you don’t understand amounts to nothing more than ignorance & laziness at best, intolerance at worst, & worse still, hate. 

Do the work of trying to understand the people different from you. Don’t settle for generalizations when you could learn a bit more, stretch a bit further, and characterize something with more fairness and detail.

Of course it is always a moving target and increasingly complex task, but we have to resist the urge to generalize whenever possible.

Our society, always full of various & changing backgrounds & circumstances, absolurely depends on it more and more each day. We must strive for our discourse to be ever sharper, more intelligent, more tolerant, less fearful, more informed, less ignorant, more patient, and more kind if we ever hope to keep a society churning full of diverse individuals.

The central bank is the only organization that can legally counterfeit/print the currency ad infinitum.

When a dollar is printed, that value (purchasing power) is taken from all holders without their consent (dilution).

Plus, we are coerced into using the dollar via legal tender laws + legally defining competitive currencies as ""commodities"" rather than money, thus coercing us into pay capital gains tax if u ever want to use the money as a medium of exchange (even though the ""gains"" are just a result of their money printing and may not even outpace m2 inflation)

* **Non-Consensual Dilution**: The reduction in purchasing power due to money printing happens without the explicit consent of the currency holders.
* **Forced Usage**: Legal tender laws force people to use the national currency, limiting free choice in the market.
* **Punitive Taxation on Alternatives**: The capital gains tax on alternative currencies disincentivizes their use, effectively forcing compliance with the national currency system."

For better use of terminology, consider me an Independent. I prefer to keep myself at a balance.

To my observation, with the most recent news of Joe Biden leaving the election and having his replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee, at one point it does seem as though it’s another option for voters to think about in terms of the upcoming election. Especially those that were more against Joe Biden, but not necessarily for Trump either. Aside from diehard MAGA voters & more neutral, toned conservatives being for Trump it seems that while both sides are up at arms ready for this election we are at a standstill. A brief impasse. 

Which comes to my topic of the day. As a casual user of social media (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) I like observing peoples thoughts on the matter of where they stand at this point in the election season and where they might lean or believe they want to lean to. Of course I’m aware that social media is a form of sensationalism and much of the various inputs and ideologies can seem a bit like an extreme for most people. I wanted to entertain the thought that with this being essentially another case of, Hillary vs Trump 2.0 there are people that logically don’t like Trump for their reasons and there are those that dislike Kamala for their reasons. According to the information that I received, she’s not necessarily any better than Trump to a degree, but she is an option. People are conflicted, but it seems as though some are already at the point of exhaustion where they don’t want to go through any additional complacency with the Democratic Party, and they would actually be fine with just allowing Trump (who in this case is the Worse of 2 Evils based on what I observed on my side of social media) to have a second term. Essentially they are listing all of the faults of Kamala, which is not too far off from the faults of Trump but of course, one might appear more fundamentally “worse” than the other. It just appears as though they’re emphasizing hers more. When other users start inquiring what should they do since practically a third choice is not an option to get selected, and the winner is going to be one of the two sides of the Left or Right they state that they would rather just go through the worst once again seeing that there’s no true way to win this game unscathed supposedly.

My question to you is, do you have the same sentiments? Do you also believe that since we are in a “hopeless situation” that we might as well take the greater of two evils instead of just taking the lesser of two evils? I understand this is a matter of perspective so to some folk the Left might appear be the greater of two evils and vice versa, so please do answer from your perspective. Please do help me change my view on this."

Although it has become a whole lot more normal for most mysteries or easter eggs in games to be nicely wrapped up and have proper solutions, I am firmly in the camp that Mr. Blue Eyes is Cyberpunks G-Man. I believe the entire point of the character is the same as the G-Man in Half Life. Because of this there won't ever be a reason to actually reveal who he really is or what he really does, because the mystery around the character is what makes the character. Along with that, having some super secret unknown powers controlling things from the shadows is one of the major touch stones of cyberpunk anyway. So although it would feel better as a complete story to have a proper resolution, actually having that resolution would break some of what makes the character what they are and how they fit into the greater world. 

Now obviously the writers and devs could throw all of that out the window next week and just release something that tells us what is going on, but considering CDPR has some of the best writers in the industry,  they should understand what kind of character they are actually dealing with here and never properly write a solution to who the character is."

I recently heard a peer say “I think our generation needs to be more positive and optimistic. This is the best time it’s ever been to be alive, and the future will definitely be even better”.

I disagree. Yes, it’s better than the vast majority of recorded history due to advances in technology and science. I concede that. However:

Economically, we’re getting smashed. Income to housing price ratio is astronomically low compared to previous generations. 

I keep hearing tales from boomers that back in their time, a single working professional could buy a house and raise a family. A teacher, electrician, plumber, accountant, fireman, etc. could all make a comfortable living.

Those same professionals today couldn’t buy a tiny 1-bed condo today and feed themselves, let alone a house and family. Forget about saving up for retirement when everyone is running up their credit cards.

It’s not just housing. It’s the prices of everything. Housing is just the most extreme and important example because we spend the most on it.

This proves that the quality of life per unit effort is clearly worse now. It takes the same amount of hard work to become a professional, but you get much less in return. This is exactly what Klaus Schwab meant in “you will own nothing”.

Therefore, now cannot be the best time to be alive. And since the above trends are only continuing, there is no evidence that things will only get better. No amount of iPhones or ChatGPTs will make up for the faults of this era.

When you’re opposing another person’s point of view, whether it’s about gun rights or which ice cream flavor is the best, the most basic rule of debate is that you _cannot brute force someone else’s opinion to your own_. People exist with all sorts of pre-conceived notions and beliefs, and you cannot convince someone to change their mind by simply saying “you’re wrong”; and this in most cases is why internet arguments tend to be such a cesspool.

Take the abortion argument, for example. Personally, I’m fully pro-choice and I believe everyone should have the choice of what to do with their body. But I can’t just walk up to someone who’s pro-life and say “bodily autonomy!!” and expect that to win the argument, because to them, the sanctity of life, even for a fetus, is more important. 

And this is where the respectful debate needs to come in. The people on both sides of the argument hold strongly in their belief that they are right, and the other side is wrong - so convinced, in fact, that it is impossible for them to see the issue from the other side’s point of view. If I want to convince pro-life people to legalize abortion, my arguments should not be the common ones of “it doesn’t matter because the fetus isn’t alive yet” or “the mother’s bodily autonomy is more important than the life of the fetus” because these are _core beliefs_ that the other side will not change. Similarly, if I wanted to convince the pro-life side that abortion was immoral, the argument of “life begins at conception” simply wouldn’t work because the other side already strongly believes the opposite. These beliefs may be wrong or right, but if we want to change people’s minds, it shouldn’t be done with mindset that “They’re wrong, I’m right, and I’m going to let them know that.”

In both cases, the parties arguing are simply viewing their own belief as a fact, and fail to take into account that stating this fact, no matter how often and through what medium they do it, will never change the opposition’s mind, because the opposition already has their own very strongly held belief. Because nobody on either side is willing to be open-minded and explore the other side’s opinions, every discussion of such topics devolves into an argument.

Continuing the abortion argument, the right way to do it if I was pro-choice would be to try and understand _why_ my opponent believes in the sanctity of life. Whatever the reason is for their belief, whether religious or educational or social or anything else, I can dissect it and compare it to why I believe in bodily autonomy, and how that is different from what my opponent believes; and then use the information we gain to understand each other’s positions better. The goal isn’t to prove I’m right; it’s to understand my opponent and their thoughts well enough that they can be _led_ to my belief on their own terms.

All of this obviously requires a lot of effort, time and willingness to be open-minded and occasionally accept that you are wrong, none of which is really possible in today’s rage-baity engagement-farmy internet. However, I still honestly think we could prevent so many large scale arguments around the world if people were simply taught the right way to deal with opposition and arguments, instead of turning these issues into a screaming hotbed of two parties insulting each other

2,2024-07-23,CMV: Trump was NOT good for the American economy,u/NightmareKingGr1mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eajhx2/cmv_trump_was_not_good_for_the_american_economy/,changemyview,"I see all the time people saying ""I don't like Trump, but he was great for the economy."" And I seriously do not understand this, because all of the numbers show the total opposite. 

Here is a look at the actual numbers from Trump's so called ""incredible economy"" straight from the United States government:

[https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/\_cache/files/2c298bda-8aee-4923-84a3-95a54f7f6e6f/did-trump-create-or-inherit-the-strong-economy.pdf](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2c298bda-8aee-4923-84a3-95a54f7f6e6f/did-trump-create-or-inherit-the-strong-economy.pdf)

He *inherited* an incredible economy from the Obama administration (who is a war criminal but that is besides the point) and then single handedly decimated it. To quote the article since I know tons of people will not read these sources:

""Income: During the last two years of the **Obama administration,** **annual median household income increased $4,800.** This is **three times more than the $1,400 increase during the first two years of the Trump administration.6""**

""Average monthly job growth: During the last 35 months of the **Obama administration**, non-farm job growth **averaged 227,000 per month.** During the first 35 months of the **Trump administration**, the average was **36,000 jobs per month less, averaging 191,000 per month.**""

[https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-biden-election-president-e3a153c9b0c615ea6e0f2afb91cdc785](https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-biden-election-president-e3a153c9b0c615ea6e0f2afb91cdc785) 

Here is another source that quotes some of the information about Trump's economy:

""The United States lost 2.7 million jobs during **Trump’s presidency,** according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the pandemic months are excluded, **he added 6.7 million jobs.**

By contrast, **15.4 million jobs were added during Biden’s presidency**. That’s 5.1 million more jobs than what the CBO forecasted he would add before his coronavirus relief and other policies became law — a sign of how much he boosted the labor market.

Both candidates have repeatedly promised to bring back factory jobs. Between 2017 and the middle of 2019, **Trump added 461,000 manufacturing jobs.** But the gains began to stall and then turned into layoffs during the pandemic, with the Republican posting a loss of 178,000 jobs.

So far, the **U.S. economy has added 773,000 manufacturing jobs during Biden’s presidency**.""

The reason why people seemed to be doing so much better during the Trump administration was that they were reaping the benefits of Obama. Trump *removed* much of these benefits that directly harmed the working class. Naturally, it takes time for these negative effects to hit, so Biden was blamed when he was left with an economy in total shambles. 

  
But what about tax cuts!! 

""His Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 provided major tax breaks to corporations and wealthy individuals. The policy, among other things, reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Frankel called the policy ""beyond ironic"" for a president ""who campaigned in 2016 on being the champion of the working man or working person and campaigned on 'draining the swamp' in Washington.""

Shierholz said this policy ""absolutely increased inequality"" and the ""**vast majority of the benefits of those tax cuts went to the already very wealthy**.'""

I don't want to make this longer than it already is, so here are some more sources that explain these numbers better than I can:

Layoffs to trip fat off a company are encouraged even if this is unnecessary.

That's a separate can of worms. I'm also not saying anything about whether immigration is a net positive for a society or economy. My suspicion is that nominally ""progressive"" countries (looking at you, Liberals in Canada) aren't allowing large scale immigration from poorer, developing countries out of any sense of altruism or actual desire for progress.

I don't blame anyone who wants to move from India or another developing country to a Western country, I completely understand wanting to pursue a better life for themselves and their family. The problem is the impact that immigration has on wages and employment for the existing citizens of said country. Someone from a poorer country is more likely to accept a lower standard of living than even a second generation immigrant, because they'll be comparing their lifestyle in the west to their lifestyle in their home country. Poverty in Canada or the USA is far better than poverty in a developing country.

I frequently see it *claimed* at least that immigrants work harder for lower wages than natural born citizens, so I have to ask, what is the actual impact of that? If you have enough people putting in $30 an hour worth of effort, while accepting being paid $15 an hour, that actively devalues the work that people were doing, until now what *was* 'above and beyond' is considered the standard, and then the bare minimum. The immigrant working their ass off and getting underpaid benefits by having a more comfortable life overall, but they don't benefit from being underpaid. 

The only people who *do* benefit are the business owners, who are able to pocket a greater share of the profits. "

It is far more accurate to label this as a failure in how police treat the mentally ill or the fact that police shouldn't be forced to interact with the mentally ill. 

Absolutely zero evidence points to any racial motive on the officer's part. There are hundreds of body cam videos of mentally ill white/brown people being shot by police. Yes, even middle aged women. 

Also I would say the evidence is inconclusive on whether the officer was justified in shooting. In the video you can see

1. He asks her to turn off the fire, not to drain the boiling water or whatever she chose to do

2. After being told to drop the pot she does not simply drop the pot. She instead crouches down while holding it. 

3. If you slow down the video you can clearly see the officer shoots her while simultaneously dodging the hot water she threw at him. In no way was the water coming to him due to her being shot. She did in fact throw the water in his direction which caused her to be shot. "

[download (mass.gov)](https://www.mass.gov/doc/consent-order-for-dr-kanojia-6-10-24-pdf/download)

A lot of people seem to think this reprimand implies that Dr. K did something wrong in regards to his relationship with Reckful, directly or indirectly contributing to his suicide.

However, the only thing that reprimand actually concludes is the following:

>The Respondent has engaged in conduct that undermines the public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession.

I would interpret this to mean that Dr. K basically made the medical profession look bad by engaging in a public relationship that resembled a doctor-patient relationship and which ended with the (non) patient's death.  

It is NOT saying that Dr. K actually established an inappropriate doctor-patient relationship, or that he gave improper advice, or that he in any way contributed to Reckful's death.  

This is my interpretation of the regulatory conclusion at hand, but the question becomes whether Dr. K did anything *morally* wrong? 

I would argue no, absolutely not.

Dr. K repeatedly said during the Reckful conversations the same thing he says during all of his conversations: I am not your doctor, I cannot diagnose you, this is not therapy, I am only providing information, you should seek health from your own psychiatric doctor, etc.  It's hard to imagine that despite these constant disclaimers, a viewer could still conclude something like ""Dr. K was Reckful's doctor and even with his help Reckful still committed suicide, so I guess psychiatry is a scam and it doesn't work.""

And to the extent that there are some few people that are dumb enough to reach that conclusion, I would say the harm caused through their shaken confidence in psychiatry is far outweighed by the insights people could glean from Dr. K's conversations with Reckful.  Dr. K *did* give all the correct advice, said all the right things, tried his absolute best to steer Reckful towards mental health.  It ultimately wasn't enough to save Reckful, but who knows how many of his viewers may have been set on a better path from what they learned during those talks?"

Further, I don’t believe we should continue to try to make voting “easy”.

I understand my question by its nature is political, but I ask anyone who wants to reply to please keep partisanship out of this. The topic to me impacts us all equally. 

On voting rights - In my view, part of the cause of the intense polarization we see is the fact most people can vote. However, most people do not put in the effort to thoroughly evaluate different policy stances, have the ability to accept compromise, or can agree to disagree. People tend to believe whatever garbage they hear on FOX or CNN that validates their world view and end it there. 

Nuance and the ability to understand not every topic is binary (left/right, right/wrong, them/us) is lacking. People tend to vote for their “tribe” and cannot accept that they could be wrong and that the other side right, or more likely the truth is somewhere in between. I have friends and family on the left and the right and it impossible to strike any sort of agreement between them. 

How do we remember this? I don’t know. Some thoughts:

IQ testing - anyone who qualifies to vote must take an IQ test and be over 98 (average) to be allowed.

Input - If you do not contribute to the tax system, or take out more than you put in you shouldn’t be allowed to vote. Of the 165 million individual tax returns the IRS processed in 2022, the top 50% of earners contributed 98% of income. When services refund are taken into account 30% of tax payers pay more than they receive from the government. Why should someone who doesn’t give back get the same vote as someone who does? 

The hilarious part of this proposal is Democrats would have a knee jerk reaction calling this racist, but the majority (2/3) of the top 50% of income owners lean to the left, so this would be a slam dunk for the Left.

Ease of voting - Imagine you’ve had a long day, and you stop by a store to grab your adult beverage of choice to unwind. A nice cold beer, a glass of Pinot, whatever. You go to the counter to pay, what are you asked for? A photo ID. That 14 states and DC do not require a photo ID is insane to me. You have to have a photo ID to:

- open a bank account
- get a job
- drive a car
- get insurance
- board a plane 

The list goes on and on. Exactly who do you think is so mentally incompetent they cannot obtain an ID? The research isn’t always exactly precise but most studies show less than 1% of all US voting age citizens do NOT have an ID. Voting is a right, and to me it’s an important one. If someone can’t put in the effort to fulfill one of the most basic requirements to live in modern US, why should they be eligible to vote? It seems like a no brainer to me.

So if you made it this far, there it is. I don’t think everyone should be allowed to vote.

1. The human's lack of a choice in being born 
2. The inevitability of human suffering

The antinatalism subreddit has over 220K members. My opinion is based in almost zero research other than occasionally browsing that subreddit. 

I don't support antinatalism for a few reasons, but one that I haven't seen so much of online is this: that much of the crtitcism in the antinatalist noosphere (whoopee! big word!) is often rooted in classist, racist, and sexist tropes.

I do support some concepts that are adjacent to it such as access to abortion and contraceptives, family planning and sex education. What I don't understand is how placing the blame for disproportionate human suffering on the individual is acceptable.

The world is unfair. The likelihood of suffering in racial minorities and the poor is increased as long as the world is unfair. This results in the eventual bias against the disenfranchised. People living through greater suffering are not necessarily living lower-quality or low-value lives. Pleasure vs pain is not a zero-sum game.

The targeting women by antinatalists is also suspicious. They are often criticized for their moral shortcomings in choosing to have children, especially if they belong to another disenfranchised group. This trend of people self-affirming their views by shaming women is sexism.

I think that this phenomenon is not only a feature of this small, niche internet community, but belongs to antinatalism as a logical extension of the concept. To me, it conjures the racist and ableist fabric of eugenics more than a progressive and thoughtful philosophical movement. "

I’m sure I’ll get a bunch of comments about Donald Trump being an orange fascist and all the other names/standard reasons not to vote for him. While he certainly has his foibles, I’d like to keep him out of this discussion as much as possible and direct all the ire at the Democratic Party. 

The Democratic Party is anything but. How can you stand on being “the party that stands for democracy” while in the same breath executing a coup against the sitting president, presumptive nominee, and leading primary vote getter? This wasn’t about Biden’s diminishing mental state. If it was, he wouldn’t be finishing his term and he’d be removed under the 25th amendment. It’s all about the power for the dems. First they rig the primaries to not include RFK Jr, a life long Dem who could have played spoiler. Second once Biden starts to fall in the polls, party elites (Schumer, Pelosi, Obama, etc) put enough pressure on Joe to drop and hand select his replacement, nullifying the primary election process. The dems only care about winning, the will of the people be damned. Every cycle, democrats play with the primary system to get the elites approve of. It’s all one big cabal to ensure power for themselves. Kamala Harris, a candidate who hasn’t even competed in a primary election in her career, was just appointed the nominee. There is so much more to this as well. It sickens me how cut throat and deceitful these people are and I cannot in good conscience vote for anyone associated with them until they’re out of power."

I hold this view because of the way his recognition took place. Since the first letter of his resignation Joe Biden has not been placed in front of a camera. He has since released multiple letters and has yet to talk live on tv..

There was an audio of him speaking to Kamala at a recent hearing. This is plausibly a recording or an AI voice over. Very easy to create nowadays.

I think it highly likely that Biden himself didn’t even write the letters. I easily seeing it being forged. 

In fact, there are many ways to prove me wrong. I would even accept a zoom or Microsoft teams call as proving me wrong.

I suspect the Democratic Party completely spit out Joe Biden, want nothing to do with him, and have no plans of ever hearing his thoughts again.

The day another hearing comes out where Joe Biden talks live my view will be changed.

Until then won’t trust the Democratic Party again. This was the tipping point for me. The resignation was so quick, forced and informal. It went from “he’s totally fine” to a letter of recognition in a week.


I think it is plausible they forced him to leave and wrote the letters for him. Other wise why not video the resignation, as every other respected leader in video history?

Maybe it’s a coincidence, but the letter of recognition came shortly after the failed assassination attempt of Donald J. Trump. I am not suggesting the two are related, but the way the resignation was done left room for wild conspiracy theories. Highly unprofessional in my view."

The Trump administration will arrive at a point in the war where Russia has suffered massive loss of men and matériels. Biden will continue aid and so will Europe - missiles, artillery, and F16s will have arrived, not to mention UKRs formidable domestic drone programs. Zelensky has been meeting with Asian partner behind Russian backs. The odds are increasingly stacking against Russia not in terms of battle field losses but in terms of willingness and resources to continue the ground conflict. They’re losing more and more for less and less in return. Eventually chunks of the $300B in seized Russian assets will be pumped into Europe US arms and UKR domestic arms. This will be a turning point where Ukraine is in a place of strength. 

As DJT arrives he will evaluate the options on the battle: 1. F*ck Russia in the *** 2. Use F*ck position as a bargaining chip to extract more influence. DJT will not resist using the Ukrainians as a bargaining chip to extract whatever from Russia. So the war will continue as is for at least 6 months of DJT admin. Orange will not simply cave to Putin out of admiration. He will however make a public statement that UKR will get no more funds, but the funds have gotten there and the arms will continue to flow through other more quiet means. 

I’m open to changing my view but I’m telling you that I’m watching the war progression and I’m going to watch what Orange DOES not what Orange SAYS. 

Unhinged take:

Why the fuck would the US intel community listen to Redneck Willy the Median Voter who thinks that the cash going to Ukraine will go to him instead? We’re not even giving them greenbacks. We’re giving them old weapons and upping our own game. You really think DJT is such a Putin simp that he’ll basically give away an opportunity to collapse a mortal enemy?

He’s just signaling and by the time the transition of power is in place, Russia will be so weak that they’ll basically be begging DJT to stop the aid to Ukraine. He won’t because it’ll be a nice bargaining chip. Europe will have boosted GDP spending to 2% and be in the clear with Redneck JD.

The course of the war won’t change and Russia will be weakened to the point where the state might collapse once again. I’d love to see it! 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽"

0,2024-07-24,"CMV: Conservatives believe in Identity Politics, too and it's mostly based on Religion.",u/StatisticianGreat514,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1easb5d/cmv_conservatives_believe_in_identity_politics/,changemyview,"**Caution: Long Post**

One of the many Criticisms that we hear a lot from Conservatives towards Liberals is that they always accuse them of playing Identity Politics. They constantly criticize them for using such a tactic to divide people into certain groups whether it be Race, Religion, Gender, Sexuality, etc. and letting them think one way as a result of that. In this case, it's voting for the Democrats and any other Left-Wing Party and not what is best for the Country, which technically means voting for the Republicans and any other Right-Wing Party. Doing so has lead them to accuse them of playing ""Real Racism and Sexism"", as well as the ""Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations"" because they think view them as oppressed and immune from Independent Thought. But there's one problem though. Conservatives also play Identity Politics, too and and it's mainly based on Religion.

We always hear a lot of Conservative politicians and voters refer to themselves in the following terms: Christian, Conservative, and Republican in that order. They lean into their religion a lot to influence their Politics when it comes to important topics both Domestic and International. Examples would be Abortion, Family Values such as Marriage and Family, Education such as bringing God back in School, and the Affairs in the Middle East such as Israel. Simply put, their overall belief is God, Family, and Country. Unfortunately, they don't think a lot of Non-Christians are capable of being Conservative and Republican. An Obvious Example involving an Event that took place last week expresses that point brilliantly.

On the First Day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the event closed off the night with a Series of Prayers with the majority of them obviously being delivered by Christians, most notably Evangelicals such as Franklin Graham, a Greek Archbishop, and a Trump-impersonating Pastor. There were also two Non-Christian Prayers with one of them being Jewish. But there was another prayer that stood out from the crowd and it was delivered by a woman named Harmeet Dhillon. If you don't know who she is, she is a California Attorney who is the former Vice Chair of the State's Republican Party. She has constantly defended Freedom of Speech on College Campuses for Conservatives as well filed lawsuits against attacks on Conservatives. During the Covid Pandemic, she filed lawsuits against Stay-at-Home Orders, criticized the use of Face Masks, opposed Mail-In Voting, and called for the reopening of the Economy. Last year, she unsuccessfully ran for Chair of the National GOP. But there's one aspect of her that stands out the most. She's a Sikh, an Indian Religion that originated in the 15th Century. There's 300,000 of them living in the US so far and they're often mistaken for being Muslims because of their Turban making them susceptible to attacks for being Terrorists. This takes me back to the the topic being discussed here. Not only was she one of two Non-Christian Delegates that night as well as one of two that delivered a non-Christian Prayer, a prayer that stood out the most. In it, she recited a prayer known as an Ardas in Punjabi (one of the numerous South Asian languages) in which she prayed to Waheguru, a God they worship. While she did receive some praise for the prayer, she also faced intense backlash from Christian Conservatives who criticized it for being ""Anti-Christian"", ""Blasphemous"", and ""Demonic"" even going further by accusing the RNC for ""promoting False Gods"" instead of the One True God, Jesus as well as being ""Woke and Inclusive"".

If anything, this goes to show that Conservatives and Republicans not only have a huge Image Problem among the General Population, but they also engage in Identity Politics as well. As a matter of fact, it's their Creation. Furthermore, I think it's safe to say that the Identity Politics that you see on the Left is basically a reaction to the Toxic Rhetoric spread by the Right. And it's issues like these that exemplify it greatly. So, they better not blame the Media for dividing the Country when it's them who is promoting the Division. And it also doesn't help that any form of Community Outreach particularly towards Non-Whites and Non-Christians is seen as Pandering, being Politically Correct/Woke, and DEI in the eyes of a lot of Conservatives saying that all it does is spread Division, reduces people into Special Interest Groups even going further by stating that they will never vote for them, as well as trying to alienate their Core Base, who as I mentioned earlier are obviously Christians, Evangelicals especially. This is especially true when promoting events such as Black, Hispanic, and Asian History Months. In reality, all they're doing is acknowledging the many demographics that have contributed to America. And let's not forget the hate towards Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Pick J.D. Vance's Wife, Usha. When promoting Non-Christian Holidays, they always resort to good Old-Fashioned Christian Nationalism by condemning the Religions that follow them even going further by stating that they still won't vote for them. I mean, who doesn't forget the Hate and Vitriol towards Former President Obama for supposedly being Muslim when he's actually a Christian. This Belief still exists in the minds of many Republicans to this Day. That's one of many reasons why the Muslim Community votes Democrat. And let's add to that by including Former Republican Presidential Candidate and supposed ""Anti-Woke"" Advocate Vivek Ramaswamy who's Hindu, another Indian Religion and the Original One. He's has faced a lot of hate towards him due to him being Non-Christian with some going further by stating that he's Muslim. And now with Harmeet Dhillon, the same Tactics are being used towards her. And this isn't the first time she faced such Vitriol. When she was running for Chair of the National Republican Party, a Whisper Campaign against her by her rivals which included then-Incumbent Ronna McDaniel and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell was made against her Faith.

I mean, things such as this are the reasons why Non-Christian Conservatives/Republicans aside from certain Jewish factions are largely nonexistent. Conservatives should've used this as an Opportunity to expand their Voter Base considering every Religion shares their values and hence, topics such as Marriage, Abortion, Family, Education, Religion, and less Liberalism would resonate with them. But since they mostly don't see other Religions as equals, it's highly unlikely. Seriously, what makes these Conservatives think that being reaching out and being Inclusive to Non-Christians, let alone Non-Whites is Pandering, Politically Correct, Woke, DEI, etc.? It's called having Decency and Respect. And besides, look at your Party, not only is your Party 85-90% White, it's 84% Christian with 30% of them being Evangelical. What more do they want? Have they been pandered to enough? Yes, they have. But to me, their constant nagging and complaining is a result of them failing to realize that the World just doesn't revolve around them and only them. It revolves around everyone. But as the old saying goes: ""When you're so accustomed to Privilege, Equality feels like Oppression.""

So in Conclusion, Conservatives believe in Identity Politics, too and they play it much more harder than Liberals with Religion being Main cornerstone of it and occasionally, Race. If anything, this goes to show that there's no way we can get rid of it. Everyone has an Identity. How you carry, express, and identify yourself have Real-World Implications on how you're treated every day. And that's emphasized even further when it comes to Voting Records, Policy, Candidates, etc.

So the Moral of the Story is this: You can't have Politics without Identity because it influences what you believe in.

Nobody agrees on what freedom is anymore despite it being the founding ethos of this country. They don’t even agree on the whether people, or which people should have the right to free speech. 

Distaste of the “establishment”? You can say that,  a left-wing anti-establishmenter and a right-wing one may sound similar in that regard, but both of them want vastly different things which, if expressed, could easily lead to a physical altercation between them. They take on the “establishment” in both parties and then when they take control, the vastly different things they want lead the nation on the course to civil war. 

I don’t put much stock into anyone saying they want unity. It’s not possible. The divisions between Americans run so deep that any call for unity will ring hollow. 

After this election there will be a Troubles that lasts for many, many decades. Many people genuinely believe that there will not be a fair 2028 election. I won’t judge the merits of this belief. But this is a far more powerful motivator than BLM in 2020, and that brought out millions of people to protest. After November they will be one man’s terrorist and another man’s freedom fighter. Millions of lives will be wiped out and people will either have to agree to something to stop the bleeding or fight until the last Democrat/Republican or until their total victory against the other side.

I don’t really think about national divorce, but some of the more heated political debates that I see online makes me think seriously about the question of whether those petty and ugly arguments would exist if we just went our own ways, did away with the central government maybe maintaining economic and currency relations and the (maybe) free movement of people."

I’ve been a consistent Democratic voter since 2016 and I will be again this year, primarily driven by voting against Trump. I have my doubts about Kamala Harris but I have no beef with her and I think she individually will end up doing fine in a matchup against Trump if I’m wrong about this. However, if your main case for beating Trump as a PARTY is to prevent Project 2025 from ripping our government down to the studs and turning our country into a dystopian authoritarian hellhole, you simply cannot do that by continuing to run sham primaries every election year.

Ever since 2016 the DNC has gone out of its way to tip the scales in all of its own primaries, not just the presidential primaries,  in an effort to keep leftism at bay. In 2016 the superdelegates lined up behind Hillary Clinton well before the election started, creating an insurmountable lead for her that Bernie Sanders never had a chance to overcome, and when he finally did overcome that in 2020 after the Nevada primary, Barack Obama himself led the charge to push all of the other moderate Democrats out of the race to consolidate support behind Joe Biden, for the same reason as above.

This is unequivocally how we got into this mess to begin with, and the inability (or unwillingness) for the DNC to deal with the issue of Biden’s age with any sort of meaningful dialogue before the debate last month all but cemented the reality that we as left-leaning voters would not be allowed to choose our candidate once again this year. Some will argue that it’s not fair to lump in 2016 and 2020 with this situation and call them sham primaries and I understand that, but I think there’s no argument against the fact that running on a message of Trump trying to destroy democracy while not embracing it in your own primaries is weapons-grade hypocrisy, and people are absolutely right to call it out. 

I have no intention of switching to the other team next year, but once this election cycle is over I’m not voting for a candidate I can’t truly get behind ever again, and I’m not casting a protest vote or a vote “against” a candidate ever again. I know for a fact that I’m not alone, and I don’t believe we’ll ever keep authoritarianism at bay in our country if we can’t even keep it out of our own party. We deserve better than this."

""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --**That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,** laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. **But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**""

I take the meaning of this to be that it is our(the citizenries) God given right(or Natural Right if you're non-religious) to arm ourselves sufficiently in order to defend against our government if it has become tyrannical and if ultimately necessary to overthrow that government and instate a new government that ceases to be tyrannical. Now what exactly constitutes a tyrannical government and if we currently have a wholly or partially tyrannical government currently is up for debate but should the time come where the majority or at least the overwhelming majority of the citizens of this nation ever did get to the point to where they were in agreement that the government had become tyrannical that at that point they would need arms to fight or oust the government. I think this is interpretation is just the plain reading of the text but I would offer in support of this interpretation the context of the time when these documents were written(The Revolutionary War for Independence) and the events that were going on at the time(Overthrowing the existing government of England and turning the Colonies into a new Nation) clearly support my understanding of what the 2nd Amendment is about.

Now the part that you can help me on. I understand that there are some people out there who just outright disagree that this is the right and proper understanding of the 2nd Amendment and I would like to hear from those of you with this mindset lay out your understanding and make a case for it. Do you agree in principle with me but just think that 18th century England was uniquely tyrannical and that it's not possible for our government to ever become tyrannical? Do you think that technology has advanced to a point that the citizenry of a modern nation could never have a successful revolution against a tyrannical government? Do you think that the proliferation of mass shootings or just the general number of gun related deaths in 21st century America should overrule our 2nd Amendment and make it moot? Do you just think that it means something entirely different from what I've laid out above?

Both of these factors dont have that much effect on each other. But together they will cause a terrible end for us. Why I believe this is that the global declining birthrate will eventually cause all countries to face total collapse these collapses would not just end the countries but make them weak to being invaded and add a higher chance of civil war. The wars and collapse would crush the populations of these countries one by one until all of them were very affected most probably only have 25% left. During this period of collapse technology would stagnate as a result of people focusing on the collapse rather than anything else. This 25% would then start growing again due to bad life conditions forcing higher birthrate. But so much time would have passed by then the sperm count which is currently half of what it was 50 years ago would now be 0% or had reached 0% a while ago. This would stagger then stop the rebound of the population.

",u/Adept-Engine5606,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eay25x/cmv_euthanasia_should_be_considered_a_fundamental/,changemyview,"The right to choose one's own death, or euthanasia, ought to be recognised as a fundamental human right.

It is possible to set a time limit for it, like 75 years. Hospitals should be prepared to assist anyone who wishes to dispose of their body after the age of 75. Dying patients should have a designated area in every hospital, and they should receive extra support and care. Their demise ought to be exquisite.

There ought to be a meditation instructor in every hospital. The terminally ill person should be granted a month of grace and permission to change his mind; he is under no obligation to do so. Suicidal individuals who are emotionally unstable cannot stay that way for a month; their emotional state can fluctuate. Most suicide victims would not have taken their own lives at all if they had waited just one more second. They lose sight of the worth of life because they are enraged, jealous, hateful, or motivated by another emotion.

The entire issue stems from politicians' belief that legalising euthanasia implies suicide is no longer punishable by law. No, that is not what it means. Suicide remains illegal.

The medical board must give its approval before euthanasia can occur. A month-long hospital stay, all available support to help the patient become peaceful and quiet, the arrival of friends and family, as well as his wife and kids, are all necessary because he is about to embark on a lengthy journey. He is beyond all possibility of being stopped; he has lived a long life and feels that his work is done.

In addition, he ought to learn how to meditate during this one-month period so that he can practise it until his death. Additionally, medical assistance for death ought to be provided in a manner similar to that of a deep sleep—that is, gradually, concurrently with meditation. We have the power to transform the enlightenment of thousands of deaths.

Additionally, there is no fear of suicide because he will not attempt suicide; even if he did, it would still be illegal. He's requesting authorisation. With the medical board's approval... and he has a month to make up his mind, any time during that month.

""I don't want to die"" is something he can say on his last day and then return home. Since it is his decision, there is no issue.

Many countries are currently experiencing extremely peculiar circumstances. Individuals attempt suicide; if they are successful, great; if not, the court sentences them to death. It's odd that they were acting in that way. They found themselves in the midst. The trial will now last for two years, during which time the man will have to be hanged once more after judges and advocates argue and this and that. In the first place, he was working alone on that! What's the point of all this nonsense?

Additionally, as medical science advances and people live longer, euthanasia is becoming more and more necessary. There isn't a single skeleton from a person who lived more than forty years ago that has been discovered by scientists from 5,000 years ago. Life was extremely valuable five thousand years ago, when the average lifespan was forty years old and nine out of ten newborns would perish within two years. Only one would survive.

Hippocrates also bestowed upon the medical community the duty to preserve life in all circumstances. Since he was not a seer, he was unaware. He lacked the wisdom to realise that one day all ten children would survive. That is currently taking place. Nine more children are living, but medical science also makes it possible for people to live longer—living to be 90 or even 100 years old is not uncommon. It is quite simple to locate someone who is 100 years old or 90 years old in developed nations.

Thousands of patients in American hospitals are just resting on their beds while being connected to a variety of devices. Many people use artificial respiration devices. If the person is unable to breathe, what good is it? How do you think he will respond? And when there are so many starving and dying on the streets, why are you burdening the entire country with this person?

Thirty million Americans live on the streets without access to clothing, food, or shelter. Thousands more occupy hospital beds, using the services of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals as well as their labour and medications.

Although everyone is aware that they will pass away eventually, you should try to prolong their life.

Their desire is to pass away. They yell that the doctor is powerless to stop them from dying. These people are being forced to live, which is obviously against democratic principles. They should have some rights.

That's why I want it to be extremely logical. After 75 or 80 years, life has been sufficiently experienced. The kids are grown up; when you reach eighty, your kids will be fifty or fifty-five years old; they are ageing. You don't need to worry or be bothered right now. You are a burden now that you are retired, and you are unsure of what to do.

And for good reason—they have no job, no dignity, and no respect—which is why elderly people are always annoyed. Nobody is concerned about them or pays attention to them. They're prepared to yell, get angry, and fight. They are merely expressing their frustrations; their true desire is to pass away. They can't even express it, though. The concept of death itself is nonreligious and unchristian.

They ought to be allowed the freedom to not just die, but also to be trained in death techniques for a month. Physical care and meditation should be fundamental components of that training. They ought to pass away soundly, completely, quietly, and peacefully, slowly sinking into a deep sleep.

Additionally, if meditation and sleep are combined, they might pass away enlightened. They might be aware that they are a part of eternity and that only the body remains.

Their death will be preferable to an ordinary death since the latter denies you the opportunity to achieve enlightenment. Indeed, an increasing number of people will choose to pass away in hospitals or other specialised death facilities where all the necessary arrangements have been made. You can pass away from this life with immense gratitude and in a joyful, exuberant manner.

I support euthanasia, but only under these circumstances.

We had a bad experience with a man\\a white person\\a black person\\a teacher\\a parent\\a Christian\\gay man\\lesbian\\etc. and we want to avoid people who are similar to them on an individual level. What I think education and liberal values should mitigate is how we respond to our prejudice: i.e. it is not okay to go on a stabbing spree and hurt random women because your school bully was a woman. It is not okay to ban all men from entering public transport because a man harassed you on a train. It is not okay to advocate companies stop hiring religious people, because you had experience with a religious worker preaching to you during work hours. If you work a job that gives you power to refuse vital service or not hire someone you must also take responsibility and be professional, i.e. you must separate your professional role and your own preferences. But any prejudices and preferences outside of that are your right and there should be nothing morally wrong with avoiding anyone for any reason. 

I.e. I do not see anything wrong with crossing the street when you see - you name it, a dude wearing ""I love Jesus"" shirt, a man, a woman, a black person, a white person, a doctor, etc. - as far as you do not shout at them ""WHY ARE YOU WALKING HERE, THIS IS MY STREET!!"" (which is silly), you should be able to openly admit that you just do not like being around the group X. I think not forcing people to interact with each other will only benefit society - those who do not like you, will stop faking it and f\*ck off. There will be less violence because people will be able to just leave whenever they are uncomfortable without being judged, and things would escalate less often. I also think that, ironically, this will make people more accepting, because they will feel less pressure and therefore have more energy to genuinely try to understand the other party.

0,2024-07-24,Cmv: Odin is better on attack in valorant if your team can entry,u/FarConstruction4877,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eaz8mo/cmv_odin_is_better_on_attack_in_valorant_if_your/,changemyview,"Iv been around imm3-rad since season 5ish, and Odin is a seriously underrated gun. It kills to the body faster than most ppl can aim on ur head if you hit ur shots first, can prefire based on sound out of the wazoo for free kills, can single handed ein almost any post plant if you have smokes, even against 5 enemies retaking as long as u aren’t down more than 2 players in comparison, and is not much more expensive than a vandal.

Let’s analyze the pros and cons of the Odin:

Pro:
- one of the highest dps in the game, absolute shredder against light shields and no shields
- prefire is super strong, if u hear sound u can tell when someone is about to swing just prefire and 8/10 times he will walk in and die. This works against radiants too because once ppl made up their mind to swing u most of them won’t have time to react to ur last second prefire.
- large mag, good pen, great for smoke spamming
- relatively slow skill to use, but actually very rewarding for good aim/tracking

Cons:
- slow, can’t peek anything
- very poor performance past mid range due to gun being inaccurate and requiring to stand still to spray
- visible tracers, easily counter spammed if you hold ur fire.
- have to crouch to be effective, no fall back option

What does this mean? U got a gun that’s almost unlosable in mid to close range 1v1 as long as they don’t instantly headshot you, but very weak to flashes and other util that will force you off an angle. A gun that needs you to play an off angle to not get instantly prefired, but gives away ur position through smokes and lacks the mobility for you to retreat safely. You have to be in control of your range and fights with the Odin, which is why it’s better on attack if your team can reliably get on site without ur help.

You might think that on defence u get to choose your fights, when in reality u often don’t. You either take the initial fight for delay or for kills to cripple their push, or u play for retake. For the most part, holding a common angle with the Odin isn’t a great idea, and unless ur some specific characters getting off an off angle would be tough due to the Odin needing to be crouched to be effective. When spamming a smoke, there are too many players to counter spam u as ur tracers tell them where you are but the smoke is too large to accurately kill them. Since it’s the first fight, there are too much util in play that counters a gun that forces u to commit to fights. If you were to die as a defender, even if you do good damage, you would leave ur other teammates on site helpless. It’s not worth.

On retakes the Odin is slow, can’t peek anything, and has a long pull out. It’s not great.

However, on attack, if 4 of ur teammates can take site, which they should be able to, u can almost always play for post plant as long as they don’t have specific ults. If you get counter spammed, ur teammates beside u can pick up ur Odin and cycle it. Since defenders have to tap bomb, it greatly narrows down where they can be and gives you free kills. U can also better control ur engagements, as if you commit to a fight crouch spraying and die u have 4 other teammates to trade you vs on defence often you are forced to fight alone on an angle. Also as you must have killed ppl to take site, defender in general will have less util than the initial fight against attackers u take as a defender, thus less chances to get forced off good angles.


Winning post is so trivially easy if you don’t troll with this thing, it’s lowkey absurd."
0,2024-07-24,CMV: Most of women problems are due to her Father.,u/Comfortable-Pass7962,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eazktb/cmv_most_of_women_problems_are_due_to_her_father/,changemyview,"From the start, when a father treats his daughter like a princess, she may grow up expecting her partner to do everything while she does nothing. Secondly, this dynamic often results in the father making all the major decisions for her, such as forbidding her from going out or insisting she dresses more traditionally. Meanwhile, the daughter spends most of her time socializing with friends and not helping around the house. 

I believe both men and women should know how to clean around the house, cook, change the bulb, etc. Additionally, the mother may also have some influence, but the father is typically seen as the primary decision-maker regarding the children's behavior. This could be because the father is perceived as a bigger authority or threat. On the other hand, when the mother makes decisions, she often does so subtly, without the children fully realizing it.

I believe that women are undoubtedly different from men, and that it is a beatiful thing.

One **common** trait between women is being good at caring, they often are better at showing love, while men are often more ""tough"".

In a traditional family both parts are fundamental,  and research shows that kids raised in such families are less likely to get depression and such illnesses (probably because divorce rates are lower in such families)

The lack of a ""fatherly"" or ""motherly"" figure often leaves a door open for depression and other mental problems.

I want to make clear that all of this, does NOT mean women should be treated as they were years ago, it does NOT mean women shouldn't be allowed to have jobs and vote.

All I'm trying to say is that, while women are as free as men are, the choice of becoming a housewife is not a sign of bigotry.

0,2024-07-24,CMV: Achievements in life are less impressive when you're privileged.,u/2252_observations,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb073h/cmv_achievements_in_life_are_less_impressive_when/,changemyview,"Before you tell me ""*oh, you're just jealous*"", I will write this post based on the following premise: **I am privileged and my achievements are therefore less impressive.**

Growing up, my mother always told me ""*don't envy others, they might have some big problems in their lives*"". And for years, this lesson has instilled me with gratitude because as I've read in books, newspapers, etc. life can definitely be a lot worse than what I have. But now I'm 28. [I have failed a PhD](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9m15p/cmv_i_find_it_unfair_that_society_values_the/) and my other achievements, such as a Masters, are not really that prestigious when you consider my age. To go back to the lesson my mother instilled in me, other people have achieved impressive stuff (e.g. PhDs, high-paying corporate jobs) at my age despite ""*big problems in their lives*"", whereas I grew up with a supportive family who isn't hurting for money. **In other words, I am exactly the sort of privileged person that this post is about**.

Whenever my friends and family tell me that I should feel pride in what I achieved in life, I tell them that when you consider how privileged as I am, such achievements are insignificant. Whenever I achieve something good, there are generally people who help me, so I rarely deserve all the credit. Also, I know people who have achieved greater things (e.g. completed PhDs) at a younger age than I am now.

Put it this way:

* Would a person take part in volunteering (e.g. blood donations, environmental conservation efforts, being a straight ally) if they had no time, money or blood to spare?
* Would you hold it against poor people for having lesser academic success than rich people?
* Would you hold it against poor people for having less money to take risks and start businesses?
* The answer to all of the above should be **no**. Being privileged makes it much easier to achieve great things compared to those too poor, busy or unhealthy to do so.

Considering that I am not financially stressed, I am, for the lack of a better word, privileged, considering the cost of living crisis ravaging the Western World right now. Whatever I have achieved, there are people less privileged than me who have greater achievements at an earlier age, so there's no reason to be proud.

To illustrate my point, imagine a hypothetical scenario where I somehow invent an arc reactor while enjoying the rich country privileges I enjoy now. Such an achievement wouldn't be as impressive, for example, as a hostage inventing one from only a box of scraps (yes, [I ripped that one off from Iron Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJngbyHgS8E)) - or if someone living in poverty managed to invent one while barely making ends meet.

To Change My View:

* Show me how my achievements can possibly be considered impressive when people younger, poorer or otherwise more disadvantaged than me have achieved more.
* Show me how someone who lacks privileges and has an uphill battle does not deserve extra praise for their achievements.
* Show me how people with the privilege of wealth, good health and supportive families aren't facing an easier time with a given challenge compared to those lacking those privileges.
* Please don't just tell me ""*stop caring about how impressive your achievements are*"".

On a final note, the reason I ask this question is because I have a new co-worker, and she saw me being very harsh to myself when I screwed up. I told her that it's necessary for me to be cruel to myself in order to avoid repeating the failures of my past, and she asked me ""*are you going to be cruel to me if I screw up*"". I realised that I can't possibly justify being cruel to a co-worker. After thinking it through, I realised that the real reason my failure stings so much is because I'm more privileged than most people in my position, and I've failed to turn that privilege into success."

For Biden, relinquishing power would certainly be seen as a more selfless act than withdrawing from a campaign due to the growing number of Democratic knives accruing at your back side. 

For the Democrats (and Kamala specifically) the benefits are numerous.  To wit:

Kamala gets the visual of being inaugurated into the office she is currently seeking.  A nice look to be sure.

She will have 3 1/2 months to carve out a record of sorts and possibly distance herself from some of Biden's more unpopular policies. 

She will have the opportunity to meet with world leaders, helping to allay fears in this area. 

She would have the opportunity to run as an incumbent, a distinct advantage since voters tend to stay with the party in power absent a national malaise of some sort or a scandal.  

Finally, as a sitting President, she would be on equal footing with Trump in a debate situation and in a superior position from an electorate standpoint since Trump must now convince voters to remove her from the post she already holds.

It's clear that abortion access is going to be a major factor in deciding the 2024 election. While it is still in the best interest of abortion rights advocates to avoid a Republican majority, which might lead to a nationwide ban, I don't believe any of the three options above are feasible for Dems to accomplish. So, at best, Dems can hope for a result that will not reduce abortion access further.

Option 1 isn't feasible because there is absolutely no path to getting 60 Democratic Senators.

Option 2 isn't feasible because the Democrats will be lucky if they have even 50 Senators after the 2024 elections. They would be AMAZINGLY INCREDIBLY lucky if they kept their 51-seat position. That being said, I don't believe that there is enough unity behind eliminating the filibuster to get together 50 votes to accomplish this.

  
Option 3 is the most likely scenario I've listed, but it is still very unlikely. It would most likely require Alito and Thomas to die while the Democrats maintain a majority in the House.

0,2024-07-24,CMV: It is possible to indefinitely serve as president.,u/NaturalSelectorX,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb3rya/cmv_it_is_possible_to_indefinitely_serve_as/,changemyview,"My argument is that you can indefinitely serve as president under existing law. I'm not saying it's likely or uncontroversial; just legally possible. The 22nd Amendment is what sets term limits for presidents. It reads as follows:

> No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

The rules are basically:

1. You can't be elected more than twice.
2. If you acted as president more than 2 years, you can't be elected more than once.

People often cite 10 years as being the limit. That is not part of the amendment, however, it's the result of adding 2 full terms and 2 years. There is no explicit time limit set on serving as president.

Theoretically, you could run straw candidates over and over with the VP being the desired president. The straw candidate immediately resigns and makes the VP president. The VP never gets elected, therefore, does not violate rules 1 or 2. There are no limits for how many times you can be a VP.

The Supreme Court make a decision turning the implied 10-year limit into a hard limit. Given their recent decisions on presidential immunity and the 14th Amendment, I don't believe it would go that way (especially if the eternal president were a Republican). Their ""will of the people"" argument in the 14th Amendment case applies to this scenario as well. The public would have to vote for this situation to continue."

Now due to statistics I am well aware that black men are more likely to be targets of police brutality and unfair killings by police officers, but black women also get involved with police brutality and sometimes even killings of police and social media almost never protest as hard for them as they do for black men. 

With the death of George Floyd we had protest and lootings for weeks and probably even months on end. We had social media going in flames talking about George Floyd and his death. We also had large protest for other black men in previous years who were unjustly killed by the police that reached a lot of states and a lot of people, but the minute a black woman unfortunately has the same fate society in America is mostly silent. Thankfully people are seeing the camera footage and acknowledging what the cop did was so wrong but it doesn't seem like any real anger is returning back to law enforcement and the system as a whole like with what happened with George Floyd. 

A large reason for this in my opinion is that black women are not respected both in the black community and outside the black community. If it's not a cop killing a black woman it could be a civilian killing a black woman in the media in the public don't give much of a damn. When a black woman is missing she doesn't get as much coverage on the news as compared to when a white woman with blonde hair is missing."

""Man vs Bear"", or ""Would it better for you (if you're a woman) or your daughter (if you're a man) to encounter a bear or an unknown man in the woods?"" is a hypothetical question meant to highlight the issue of violence against women by drawing attention to the number of women choosing the bear thinking about their actual past trauma.

## Positives
- The discussion allowed/provided platform for many women to speak out about their past experiences, which is an important step in recovering from any trauma.

- It raised awareness of violence against women. Given the short news cycle it is important to keep such issues under the media spotlight.

## Negatives
- It generated a lot of discussion from people who took the question literally (e.g. ""statistically..."" or ""how many bears you meet everyday vs how many men..."").

- Criticism (e.g. generalization/comparison to a violent animal) was largely rejected with variations of ""you don't listen to women"", insults (e.g. ""if you're upset, you are a creep / reason why women choose bear"" or ""the only type of man getting insulted are the ones that know they are the problem"") or statements like ""we're only talking about violent men and you know that"", which only reinforced the idea that men should not speak about their feelings / will not be heard.

- This shaped opinion of a huge chunk of men, especially young (apparently the origin is TikTok), about feminism as a movement dismissive of men's feelings / movement that generalizes or demonizes men.

- Given all of the above, it shifted a lot of men towards the right wing (e.g. Peterson who is willing to talk about men's problems, albeit in an unhealty way), due to desire to feel understood (or at least not demonized). (I acknowledge that there are a lot of people talking about men's issues in a healthy way, but they are quiet in comparison)

(For the next point: in my opinion, a lot of men are bad at controlling their feelings/emotions due to being taught by the society that the only acceptable feeling/emotion for them is anger.)

- The generalization provoked some men to respond with (passive) aggression (e.g. ""we'll see when the bear eats you"" or ""I hope you will get eaten by the bear""), which reinforced some women's opinion that men are violent, don't want to understand them or simply don't care.

29,2024-07-24,CMV: The Elam Ending aka Final Target Score should be adopted as the default end-of-game system for basketball competition.,u/gangleskhan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb4y67/cmv_the_elam_ending_aka_final_target_score_should/,changemyview,"Let me start by summarizing what the Elam Ending actually is. It is a system, also called ""final target score"" where the clock is turned off at the first dead ball occurring with under a certain amount of time remaining in the game. Then the game switches to a ""first to a certain score"" (target score) wins, becoming like pickup ball where the first team to 21 or 15 or some pre-determined score wins. 

The target score is chosen by a formula of: leading team's score + a predetermined number (which I'll call the target score differential) set by the league. The timing of the change is also set by the league. In The Basketball Tournament, for instance, they start the Elam Ending at the 4-minute mark and set the target score differential to +8. So if the score at at the first dead ball with <4 mins left is 70-66, the target score is 78. The game clock is turned off, and whoever gets to 78 first wins. (As an aside, the TBT also makes any foul during the Elam Ending result in only a single free throw + possession to further neutralize ""strategic"" fouling and flopping. I support this as well, but isn't technically part of the Elam Ending so not what I'm arguing for.)

This system transforms the end of basketball games. If you watch or play basketball, you know that games within 10-ish points (which is most of them) turn into the leading team trying to run out the clock and the trailing team fouling intentionally to stop the clock and in hopes of rebounding a missed free throw and scoring quickly to eat away at the score differential. Even very close games often turn into this at the very end, depending on the score.

The Elam ending makes the end of the game highly competitive and exciting and neutralizes the fouling strategy. I was a skeptic for awhile, but having watched more games using the Elam Ending, I have found it so refreshing. Now the end of the game is filled with exciting, quality play, not just clock stoppages and free throws. This makes for a much better fan experience. I don't see compelling reasons why this shouldn't become the standard for basketball leagues of all levels worldwide.

Several leagues have adopted it entirely or for specific situations, including The Basketball Tournament, the NBA G-League (for overtime only), the NBA All-Star Game, Canadian Elite Basketball League, and more. I think it's time for the sport to embrace it wholesale.

One objection I can see is that it could mean more minutes played. To which I say it doesn't need to. Every league can determine when to trigger it and how to set the target score so that it comes out about the same on average. So the NBA, where the average points per game last season was 114.2 over 48 mins (2.38 points/min), they could switch at 4 minutes and make the target score differential +9 or +10 (2.38x4=9.52) or they could switch at 5 mins and make the differential +12 (2.38x5=11.9). If the average rate of scoring holds, players will average about the same number of minutes played. Plus, you'd never have overtime minutes. Meanwhile a high school league that plays 2 20-minute halves and averages 60 points per game (1.5 pts/minute) could set their switch to happen at 5 minutes (1/8 of a game) and set their target score differential to +7 or +8 points (1.5x5=7.5). And so on. Point being, it can be adapted to fit the league it's used for to avoid players having to play excessive minutes.

So, why should leagues NOT adopt the Elam Ending? I am very open to having my mind changed, but I will not be convinced by

- ""It's always been the current way."" Leagues can and do change rules all the time.

- ""It would mess up the historical stats."" Again, leagues make changes all the time the impact stats.

- ""The current way makes free throw shooting skills matter."" Free throws are shot throughout the course of the game. They always matter. And the current system even leads to teams sometimes intentionally missing free throws to get the offensive rebound or use a little more clock."
0,2024-07-24,"CMV: There are no good and sound arguments to encourage voting on a micro level and people are scared to address it because they know voting is objectively pointless on an individual level
",u/adoreroda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb5h5m/cmv_there_are_no_good_and_sound_arguments_to/,changemyview,"Note for title: micro level means individual level. Macro in this context would be more of a broad meaning such as overarching or group level, such as an entire demographic(s)

I believe voting to be largely a social and emotional thing; people vote out of emotion and/or out of social pressure. They vote for things they believe in to make themselves feel good and to validate their feelings, or sometimes out of social pressure because of whatever environment they're in to stay en vogue/in good graces with their peers. On a macro level, voting has its purposes and is sound, but on a micro level, it has no real world impact as one vote is meaningless. As said above, aside from swing vote elections which are irrelevant and not worth bringing up, you cannot point to me an election where there is a real world impact because of one vote (anonymous vote, at that). For someone like me who genuinely does not care or have a community that I need to be represented on a legal level, there are zero incentives for me to vote and I think in general on a micro level, for anyone to vote.

I notice when people talk about voting they only talk about it on a macro level. I understand why this is so, but considering how in some places (or perhaps a general trend worldwide) that younger people are a lot less inclined to vote compared to their older counterparts, trying to encourage people to vote/making arguments on a macro level is outdated and the convincing arguments for incentives on the micro level are basically none or the arguments are so bad that it’s almost embarrassing.

The argument for voting on a macro level, or collective voting, is sound. The issue with this however is that it’s argued on a micro level to a specific individual as if it’s their responsibility to garner enough attraction to vote, especially for a particular candidate. The reality is that some people see the issue of voting predominately in two ways: macro level or micro level. And the argument for the latter is really pathetic as of late and it only gets worse as time goes on because it showcases how traditional arguments for voting have gotten so fucking bad.

Anyway here are other bullet points for my argument:

- The argument to encourage voting is absolutely pathetic and outdated on a micro level

- People fail to engage with the impact of voting on a micro level.

- People also tend to get super emotional when you shoot down their arguments against voting when they’re doing it from a macro perspective. It often times reduces to ad hominems such as calling you immature, sometimes slurs or other insults, etc. Not voting has nothing to do with intellect or maturity.

* A common tactic is to try and bully and/or harass people who a) vote for someone you don’t like (in particular) or b) don’t vote in general. Whether you like it or not, choosing to vote (just like who you vote for) is a personal matter, and the fact that it’s so common place to bully/harass people who don’t vote makes voting even less attractive, ironically.

- The individual is not responsible for the collective unless you can show niche situations where one vote would’ve had a major impact, such as something like a swing vote. Even still, you kind of have to pick a side to argue for one at a time, not do a combination of both.

* An individual isn’t responsible for how the collective behaves and so arguments like “well if everyone acted like you \[not voting\] then elections would get nowhere” is a fucking terrible argument considering how that’s objectively not true and whether or not you convince someone has no real world impact on how **the lot of others** are going to act. So this means even something like trying to encourage the said individual convincing friends and family isn’t enough to impact almost any election, and it’s also unreasonable to expect all of them to vote let alone vote in the same way if they even did.

- “People died for your right to vote” Ok that’s great, I don’t care. That’s kind of an appeal to emotion. I don’t care. Many younger people like me also do not care. Moot point. Sounds like a dismissal but it’s a fair rebuttal since the right to vote =/= obligation to vote and how one feels about it *is* important in context of this conversation.

- People often conflate voting for someone and having their desired candidate win as being responsible for them winning when that’s not the case. Simply because you participated doesn’t mean your vote was impactful enough to actually mean anything. This common notion also implies the inverse was a waste of a vote if they voted for someone who ultimately would lose.

- People fail to acknowledge that often times people who don’t vote don’t care enough about “one side” or any particular candidates enough to vote, so the fact that they do not feel like there’s anyone who is worth voting for in the first place is already another problem. Even if it’s a “lesser of two evils” situation.

- Common arguments like “well if you don’t vote then you can’t complain” is basically trying to say that you’re voting for the right to complain, which implicitly showcases the shallow value of voting on a micro level

- Using arguments such as showcasing to people how they didn’t like X and person Y in a previous election was responsible for it and so things like that don’t happen again is why they should vote is also another bad example unless you can showcase how their individual vote would’ve changed the election if you’re going to look back on the situation in retrospect like that. Otherwise, their vote is...worthless.

- it’s your “civil responsibility”. I don’t know about all throughout the world, but in some places like Australia you get fined for not voting, and I’m not sure if you have to vote for a candidate or not or if you can leave your voting option on the ballot or whatever blank. Even in this instance it’s mostly a moral superimposition onto the person you’re trying to convince that voting is important and it’s basically “I *think* it’s important and so should you.” Not very convincing.

- People fail to acknowledge the emotional motivations many have for voting. People *feel* like they are making an impact, so they vote. People want to vote because it makes them feel good, etc. And there’s nothing wrong with that, but people never address these points when it comes to motivations for voting and try to mask it behind a bunch of other reasonings that aren’t really accurate to why they’re actually voting.

* I think this point could be mostly me but I don’t doubt other people feel this as well, but people also fail to address that many times there are candidates that you have no push towards. I’m an American, and the past few presidential elections had candidates that were not good that didn’t encourage me to waste my time and take time off of work to go vote, even if it would still count as a break. If I vote, I generally want it to be someone who I support somewhat wholeheartedly, and no one did. Let’s say I kind of favoured Biden for whatever reason (I did to a little degree), how would my individual vote change anything? It wouldn’t.

- Voting encouragement arguments never address the point of trying to showcase the impact of voting on a micro level, and I understand why this is so because there is none. Especially in major elections, a singular vote for a candidate doesn’t matter and has zero real world impact on the direction of an election unless it’s a swing vote which virtually does not exist anymore and is unrealistic to expect.

- Whether or not you vote, unless it’s a swing vote or virtually the same, your vote has no impact.

* Whether or not your desired candidate won and you voted, it didn’t matter; the result was going to happen anyway."

It's true that many people have managed to have rich children who have helped them in life.

But that's only 10% of the time.

Having children not only leaves you with no money and no rest, it also leaves you with the possibility of seeing your child destitute when they grow up, which can't be very pleasant to see.

It can also create your biggest enemy for the rest of your life, the person you hate the most, but also a person who was inside your womb.

If my parents hadn't had me, maybe they could have gone skiing in the mountains or on holiday in the Caribbean.

But no, they had me because they had to follow my great-grandmother's Catholic ideals and have a son who cost them space in the apartment, vacations, money on renovations, what made matters worse was that this son had learning and socialization difficulties, was unable to speak or read."

1,2024-07-24,"CMV: Conservatives shouldn't complain about Identity Politics when they engage in it as well. In this Case, their Version of Identity Politics made on the Basis of Religion.",u/StatisticianGreat514,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb6p8g/cmv_conservatives_shouldnt_complain_about/,changemyview,"**Caution: Long Post**

One of the many Criticisms that we hear a lot from Conservatives towards Liberals is that they always accuse them of playing Identity Politics. They constantly criticize them for using such a tactic to divide people into certain groups whether it be Race, Religion, Gender, Sexuality, etc. and letting them think one way as a result of that. In this case, it's voting for the Democrats and any other Left-Wing Party and not what is best for the Country, which technically means voting for the Republicans and any other Right-Wing Party. Doing so has lead them to accuse them of playing ""Real Racism and Sexism"", as well as the ""Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations"" because they think view them as oppressed and immune from Independent Thought. But there's one problem though. Conservatives also play Identity Politics, too and and it's mostly based on Religion.

We always hear a lot of Conservative Politicians and Voters refer to themselves in the following terms: Christian, Conservative, and Republican in that order. They lean into their Religion a lot to influence their Politics when it comes to important topics both Domestic and International. Examples would be Abortion, Family Values such as Marriage and Family, Education such as bringing God back in School, and the Affairs in the Middle East such as Israel. Simply put, their Overall Belief is God, Family, and Country. Unfortunately, they don't think a lot of Non-Christians are capable of being Conservative and Republican. An Obvious Example involving an Event that took place last week expresses that point brilliantly.

On the First Day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the event closed off the night with a Series of Prayers with the majority of them obviously being delivered by Christians, most notably Evangelicals such as Franklin Graham, a Greek Archbishop, and a Trump-impersonating Pastor. There were also two Non-Christian Prayers with one of them being Jewish. But there was another Prayer that stood out from the crowd and it was delivered by a woman named Harmeet Dhillon. If you don't know who she is, she is a California Attorney who is the former Vice Chair of the State's Republican Party. She has constantly defended Freedom of Speech on College Campuses for Conservatives as well filed lawsuits against attacks on Conservatives. During the Covid Pandemic, she filed lawsuits against Stay-at-Home Orders, criticized the use of Face Masks, opposed Mail-In Voting, and called for the reopening of the Economy. Last year, she unsuccessfully ran for Chair of the National GOP. But there's one aspect of her that stands out the most. She's a Sikh, an Indian Religion that originated in the 15th Century. There's 300,000 of them living in the US so far and they're often mistaken for being Muslims because of their Turban making them susceptible to attacks for being Terrorists. This takes me back to the the topic being discussed here. Not only was she one of two Non-Christian Delegates that night, she was one of two that delivered a non-Christian Prayer. In this case, it was a prayer known as an Ardas, which she recited in Punjabi (one of the numerous South Asian Languages) praying to Waheguru, a God they worship. While she did receive some praise for the prayer, she also faced Intense Backlash from Christian Conservatives who criticized it for being ""Anti-Christian"", ""Blasphemous"", and ""Demonic"" even going further by accusing the RNC for ""promoting False Gods"" instead of the One True God, Jesus as well as being ""Woke and Inclusive"".

If anything, this goes to show that Conservatives and Republicans not only have a huge Image Problem among the General Population, but they also engage in Identity Politics as well. As a matter of fact, it's their Creation. Furthermore, I think it's safe to say that the Identity Politics that you see on the Left is basically a reaction to the Toxic Rhetoric spread by the Right. And it's issues like these that exemplify it greatly. So, they better not blame the Media for dividing the Country when it's them who is promoting the Division. And it also doesn't help that any form of Community Outreach particularly towards Non-Whites and Non-Christians is seen as Pandering, being Politically Correct/Woke, and DEI in the eyes of a lot of Conservatives saying that all it does is spread Division, reduces people into Special Interest Groups even going further by stating that they will never vote for them, as well as trying to alienate their Core Base, who as I mentioned earlier are obviously Christians, Evangelicals especially. This is especially true when promoting events such as Black, Hispanic, and Asian History Months. In reality, all they're doing is acknowledging the many Demographics that have contributed to America. And let's not forget the Hate towards Republican Vice Presidential Candidate J.D. Vance's Wife, Usha. When promoting Non-Christian Holidays, they always resort to good Old-Fashioned Christian Nationalism by condemning the Religions that follow them even going further by stating that they still won't vote for them. I mean, who hasn't forgotten the Hate and Vitriol towards Former President Obama for supposedly being Muslim when he's actually a Christian. That Belief still exists in the minds of many Republicans to this Day. That's one of many reasons why the Muslim Community votes Democrat. And let's add to that by including Former Republican Presidential Candidate and supposed ""Anti-Woke"" Advocate Vivek Ramaswamy, who's Hindu, another Indian Religion and the Original One there. He has faced a lot of hate towards him due to him being Non-Christian with some going further by stating that he's Muslim. And now with Harmeet Dhillon, the same Tactics are being used towards her. And this isn't the first time she faced such Vitriol. When she was running for Chair of the National Republican Party, a Whisper Campaign against her by her Rivals which included then-Incumbent Ronna McDaniel and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell was made against her Faith.

I mean, things such as this are the reasons why Non-Christian Conservatives/Republicans aside from certain Jewish Factions are largely nonexistent. Conservatives should've used this as an Opportunity to expand their Voter Base considering every Religion shares their Values and hence, topics such as Marriage, Abortion, Family, Education, Religion, and less Liberalism would resonate with them. But since they mostly don't see other Religions as equals, it's highly unlikely. Seriously, what makes these Conservatives think that being reaching out and being Inclusive to Non-Christians, let alone Non-Whites is Pandering, Politically Correct, Woke, DEI, etc.? It's called having Decency and Respect. And besides, look at their Party, not only is their Party 85-90% White, it's 84% Christian with 30% of them being Evangelical. What more do they want? Have they been pandered to enough? Yes, they have. But to me, their constant Nagging and Complaining is a result of them failing to realize that the World just doesn't revolve around them and only them. It revolves around everyone. But as the old saying goes: ""When you're so accustomed to Privilege, Equality feels like Oppression.""

So in Conclusion, Conservatives believe in Identity Politics, too and they play it much more harder than Liberals with Religion being the Main Cornerstone of it and occasionally, Race. If anything, this goes to show that there's no way we can get rid of it. Everyone has an Identity. How you carry, express, and identify yourself have Real-World Implications on how you're treated every day. And that's emphasized even further when it comes to Voting Records, Policy, Candidates, etc.

So the Moral of the Story is this: You can't have Politics without Identity because it influences what you believe in.

But in reagrds to the messages to Lava. I do not think this is a case of grooming.  
Is it weird? Maybe. But as far as I could tell the public messages and statements, do not appear like grooming and are not harmful.

For it to be grooming, I think the intent is important. A groomer is building a relationship with the goal of creating a sexual relationship. I just do not see that from the messages. It looks like someone joking and sending memes to a friend. And both Ava and Lava have said the same thing, it was not grooming, it was not inapproriate, and nothing happened. 

The biggest discussion I have seen is comparing this to the Dr D stuff. And these are not the same. Dr D messaged a minor for sex and admitted as much. That is grooming, that is harmful. And if it was just as innocent as Ava's messages, than he should post the logs and redeem himself. 

But people comparing these two situations are just wrong. Lets be real, we know why this is blowing up way out of proportion. And seeing big ""ally"" creators condeem Ava in response to the people demanding they do so, is just disheartening. "

At room temperature and standard pressure, water tends to be liquid. It takes more effort to make it a gas or solid than to keep it a liquid.

Objects with mass tend towards gravity. It takes more effort to raise an object than to drop it.

A tiger tends to be predatory. It takes more effort for it to turn it vegan than for it let to hunt.

*Second, humans tend to evil; it takes more effort for humans to be good than to be evil.*

If you’re married, it takes more effort to remain faithful than to cheat when a very attractive woman is seducing you (lust).

If you’re obese, it takes more effort to go to the gym than to down 2 pizzas and play Fortnite on the couch (sloth).

If you’re passed for promotion, it takes more effort to acknowledge the promoted’s merits than to hate them for beating you (wrath, envy).

If you’re rich, it takes more effort to give away your wealth through building wells in Africa than to start a vintage Porsche collection (greed).

These are everyday examples that you or someone you know can probably identify with. Restraint from evil takes more effort than doing evil.

This is apparent based on contradictions with Democratic actions and raises concerns about deception, ignorance, and agenda on the left.

- Project 2025: Created by The Heritage Foundation, it aims to weaken federal agencies and consolidate power with the president. It’s an extension of previous Heritage initiatives and not a new hidden agenda. Released earlier to set up the next administration more quickly.

- Center for American Progress (CAP): Founded by John Podesta, CAP similarly creates road maps for incoming Democratic presidents, advising on policy and placing employees in the administration. CAP's 2008 document *Change for America* outlined plans to transform the energy base of the economy, centralizing power in the White House.

157,2024-07-24,CMV: Politics Have Been Reduced To Complete Fandom ,u/dannyrules101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eb87lj/cmv_politics_have_been_reduced_to_complete_fandom/,changemyview,"Ever since about 2012 American politics have been less about political ideals, and political viewpoints and objectives, and more about which candidate you are a bigger fan of regardless of their politics. Looking at the way family and friends discuss politics now, it draws similarities to what you would expect from 2 opposing fans at a Lakers and Celtics game. 

I know Republicans who are full supporters of abortion and do not want it outlawed, yet would rather die than vote democrat. And I know Democrats who are extremely opposed to open borders, and support mass deportation, yet would never even consider voting republican. How can America continue like this?

What an election should be is that you come into it with an open mind, the people are the interviewers and managers and the politicians are the one trying to get the job. And after both candidates have said their price and made their viewpoints known that is when a candidate is selected. 

As an independent voter I couldn’t care less about the personality or the charisma of a candidate, as well as how they make me feel. They are not a sports team in which I am rooting for, or a celebrity in which I am entertained by. To be 100% honest I don’t care about them the person. My one and only deciding factor is what are their political ideals and how do those align with me. As well as what are their plans for the future. 

I feel like just blindly supporting a candidate because they are on the republican or democratic ticket is a misuse of one’s power to vote. And only further leads to a greater divide in the country. 

And no don’t just tell me that each party has basically the same set of ideals. Otherwise what would be the point of have republican and democrat primaries? 

Edit: I will be voting for Robert Kennedy Jr this election

Kamala could have Netanyahu arrested right now while on US soil. There is an international arrest warrant out for him. 

The ICJ just made a ruling, from a case brought in early 2023, that the occupation of Palestine is an illegal endeavor and the Israel is an Apartheid state. The ICC has also ruled that Israel needs to do everything in their power to stop civilian deaths in Gaza and that it is likely a genocide is going down. Israel hasn't done anything to stop the current genocide, not even restore the flow of food. They are continuing to do exactly what the ICC judged to be genocidal actions. 

A poll from April shows that a majority of Americans disapprove of 'Israel's military actions in Gaza.' A majority of the world recognizes Palestine and demands an end to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. 

There is massive disapproval for Trump and his policies for a majority of Americans as well. But many people don't want to vote for Harris due to their history as a self pro-claimed 'top cop' and as the VP of genocide. 

Harris would win this election in a land slide if they just arrest Netanyahu and hand them over to the ICC. Harris won't do this of course because 1. It implicates Americas arming and assistance of a genocide, which runs contrary to international and the Leahy laws. 2. AIPAC has bought Harris with over $5 million in campaign contributions. 

Convince me I'm wrong not by pointing out why Harris wouldn't do this, but by proving it wouldn't win them the election. "

Research has shown that punitive measures, such as handcuffing or isolating individuals, can exacerbate their distress. According to a study published in the *Journal of Clinical Psychiatry*, individuals who experience compassionate, patient-centered care are more likely to engage in treatment and express feelings of hope and connection.

Locking someone in a hospital room or placing them in a cop car can reinforce feelings of shame and isolation, which are significant risk factors for suicide. The *American Psychological Association* emphasizes the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment. Conversations, active listening, and empathetic engagement can significantly reduce the immediate risk and provide a foundation for ongoing support. These approaches help individuals feel valued and understood, which can be life-saving.

Moreover, evidence suggests that human connection plays a vital role in recovery from suicidal crises. A study in the *Journal of Affective Disorders* found that patients who received supportive interventions, including open conversations and emotional support, had lower rates of subsequent suicide attempts. By prioritizing compassionate dialogue over punitive measures, we can better support those in crisis and promote their long-term mental health and well-being."

# Funding Corruption:

# 1. 2008 Financial Crisis Bailouts

* **Summary:** The U.S. government bailed out major banks and financial institutions with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), injecting hundreds of billions to prevent a financial system collapse.
* **Corruption:** Executives of bailed-out banks received large bonuses, despite their companies' failures. Some government officials had close ties to these institutions, leading to conflicts of interest and favoritism.

# 2. Automobile Industry Bailout (2008-2009)

* **Summary:** The U.S. government provided over $80 billion to General Motors and Chrysler to avoid bankruptcy and save jobs.
* **Corruption:** Executives retained high salaries and bonuses. Political connections influenced the distribution of bailout funds, benefiting certain stakeholders disproportionately.

# 3. Airline Industry Support during COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)

* **Summary:** Over $50 billion in government aid was given to major airlines to cover payroll and prevent bankruptcies.
* **Corruption:** Some airline executives received significant compensation packages. There were instances of misuse of funds, with companies prioritizing stock buybacks and executive pay over employee support.

In all cases, corruption involved individuals within corporations and the government benefiting personally, often at the expense of taxpayers and the broader public interest.



# Bonds being outpaced by Money Supply Inflation:

When examining the return on bonds relative to the rate of debasement (the percentage increase in money supply) over the past decade, we observe that the average growth rate of the M2 money supply has often outpaced bond yields, leading to diminished real returns on bonds.

1. **Money Supply Growth**: Over the past ten years, the M2 money supply in the U.S. has grown significantly. For example, data from the Federal Reserve shows that the M2 money supply increased from approximately $10.5 trillion in 2014 to around $21.02 trillion in 2024​ ([FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL))​​ ([YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_m2_money_supply))​. This represents an average annual growth rate of about 6-7%​ ([YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_m2_money_supply))​​ ([CEIC Data](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/m2-growth))​.
2. **Bond Yields**: During the same period, the yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have averaged around 2-3%. These yields are often influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and global economic conditions. For instance, post-2008 financial crisis policies kept interest rates low to stimulate the economy, resulting in lower bond yields​ ([ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list))​​ ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/government-financial-bailout.asp))​.

Its a whole bunch of BS and time money effort rejection self improvement. And your prize if you succeed and get a girl to agree to a relationship with you? You can't sleep with anyone else! Like what??

Why would any man with options trade having sex with multiple women to give one (1) girl princess treatment? Like make it make sense.

I get being in love and I assure you I have been in love but love is a mutual benefit there needs to be something else. Like we men actually know romance we grew up and saw all the way and methods to be romantic to a woman. But umm how does a woman be romantic to a man? I ask this because most women do not know.

I'm just being frank but consistent sex is by far the the biggest benefit for men in relationships but now that situationships exist like what really is the net benefit that men get from a full blown relationship?

Ah yes, children right? A man needs a woman if he decides to have children. Wait a sec, men can't really decide to have children they need the consent of a woman. So actually men cant (and shouldn't) really be the ones to decide if they should have children. In fact only 40% of men in history have procreated while 80% of women have. So a man can't really plan his life around having children because odds are: he isn't. And in the case of divorce usually the father doesn't even get custody.

So I've been in wonderful loving relationships and I genuinely love the idea of romance and relationships but logically it makes little sense to me. Maybe I'm missing a key part of the puzzle but atp someone will really have to sell me on the idea of being in a relationship with women."

I truly do not believe that Harris and the Democratic Party stand a chance this coming election. And I am fully expecting a landslide victory for Trump. Due to the fact that the DNC is run by a bunch of idiots.

1. The DNC waited too long, and Biden dropped out way too late(there is literally fucking 3 months left). It should have been established since 2020 that Biden would be a one term president. And when Trump announced he would be running for president again early 2022, that is when Biden should have dropped out. It was evident to a lot of people that frankly Biden had not been cognitively all the way there for a while now. Allowing him to stand up there and debate with Trump was an utter embarrassment to the party. 

2. If the main focus is to beat Trump no matter what, why are they doing such a shitty job? Why are you not calling a a convicted felon and a sexual abuser 24/7? Why are you not actively advertising Project 2024 to the American people non-stop? Why are you not directly attacking him and going for the kill? 

3. There is not enough time for Kamala (who in her own right is not very well liked democrats as evidenced by polling at less than 1% in the primaries). Despite her being the VP for the last 4 years she does not have a prominent political identity. She just comes off as a regular politician
The general public has no idea what her plans are, and what her political ideals are. She has no time to connect to undecided voters, and she will just be shoehorned in as a defacto 2nd term Biden. 

4. The main reason the Democratic Party won in 2020 was due to the political climate at the time. And how much people really hated Trump. Coming off of Covid as well as the riots and BLM protests , the Democratic Party in my opinion was the most energized and United. I also feel like independent voters sided with them the most and there was large voter turnout. With all this the Dems only won each swing state by an average of 0.4%. But this year it does not feel the same at all, people do not hate Trump nearly as much anymore. 

5. And finally I have 0 faith that Kamala has the charisma, personality, or the political pedigree necessary to win over swing state voters specifically middle class straight white American voters in key swing states. Not to mention how the Democratic Party has also lost favor amongst Hispanics, Black American Men, and Jewish Americans. 

Edit: Also to add a lot of people have not been pleased with how the country has been economically the last 4 years. And how the Democratic Party has handled the border.

The current welfare system is complex and often inefficient, leaving many people without the support they need. UBI would simplify this by providing a guaranteed income to everyone, regardless of their employment status.

Critics argue that UBI could discourage people from working, but I think this concern is overstated. Many people work not just for money, but for a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Additionally, UBI could empower individuals to pursue education, start businesses, or engage in creative endeavors without the constant stress of financial insecurity.

Another common argument against UBI is its cost. However, I believe that the long-term benefits, such as reduced poverty, improved mental health, and increased economic activity, would outweigh the initial expenses. Moreover, UBI could be funded through progressive taxation and the reduction of redundant welfare programs.

I understand that UBI is a radical change and may have unintended consequences, but I think the potential benefits make it worth considering. Change my view."

However, I believe its importance is overstated for several reasons.

First, the primary use of writing in today's world is digital. Most communication, whether personal or professional, is conducted through typing on keyboards or touchscreens. The need for cursive writing has significantly diminished as a result.

Second, the time spent teaching cursive could be better utilized. Schools have limited time and resources, and dedicating a portion of the curriculum to cursive writing takes away from other subjects that may be more relevant and beneficial to students, such as coding, critical thinking, or financial literacy.

Third, the argument that cursive writing improves fine motor skills and cognitive development is not entirely convincing. There are many other activities, such as playing musical instruments, drawing, or even typing, that can equally contribute to these developmental aspects.

Lastly, the argument that cursive writing is necessary for reading historical documents is weak. Most historical documents have been digitized and transcribed, making them accessible without the need for cursive literacy.

While cursive writing may have some nostalgic or aesthetic value, its practical importance in modern education is minimal. I believe that the focus should shift towards skills that are more applicable to today's digital and fast-paced world."

Many protests had the protesters burning American flags and calling president Biden “Genocide Joe”, and speakers calling for the overthrow of the US government and threatening to turn the Western countries into Islamic societies. The protesters also openly support terrorist organizations, especially Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al-Qaeda.

This is literally the same as what the MAGA people want to do should they win in November and implement their Project 2025. They have attempted to overthrow democracy on January 6, 2021, and they promised their supporters that they will succeed if Trump wins the White House again.

The behaviour of the pro-Palestine protesters has turned me away from supporting them and towards supporting Israel, which is a functioning democracy with lots of freedoms especially for LGBTQ people, unlike what the protesters support: an Islamist authoritarian government that abuses gays and restricts freedoms and human rights, which is what Hamas is doing in the Gaza Strip."

Résumés are treated differently when submitted by Thomas Wentworth and by Jamal Washington, even if they are otherwise identical. Homes are assessed by professionals at lower values if the decorations and photographs inside show an African-American family lives there. Identically-dressed pedestrians have different rates of success in hailing a cab, depending only upon their skin color.

Applying this recognition to the current presidential race, it seems certain to me that VP Harris' loss (if it happens) will be explained in part by the bitter recognition that the United States is racist and sexist.

So I ask myself: knowing this, wouldn't it be better -- especially in a year in which the opponent has been described as a threat to democratic norms -- to choose a candidate that doesn't labor under those twin encumbrances? 

But THEN I think to myself: if we do that, do we not perpetuate the very ills we're decrying? Can't pick a black woman candidate; she might lose because of racism!

Put that way, there's almost a moral imperative to challenge this restriction, to break the barrier. 

But if this effort fails, I am absolutely certain that the post-mortem for choosing VP Harris will include bitter recriminations at the racism and sexism that contributed to her defeat.

And given the relative closeness of the Electoral College and the polarized nature of political contests generally, I think that this intersectional set of ""isms,"" will in fact sink her candidacy, or at the very least creates a risk of loss that's unacceptably high, given the alternative.

This stems from the underlying reality of three main points:

* Humans are emotional, therefore irrational 
* Humans are social, therefore prioritize connection over truth 
* If socially engineered at scale and tactically, this results in mass social movements that facilitate change

The main theory behind this is Reflexivity. A low level of reflexivity would result in individuals shaped largely by their environment (or ""society""). A high level of social reflexivity would be defined by individuals shaping their own norms, tastes, politics, desires, and so on. 

Low levels of reflexivity result in unrealized change at scale if organized correctly; impacting core pillars of society such as corporate structure, or political structure, ultimately advancing the interest of the special interest behind the organization of the low reflexivity. 

If we are to take a movement such as BLM which started in 2013, and began *oddly strategic, very organized* protests in 2014, the data is telling.

 Total U.S. hate crimes in the following years:

* 2002: **9,222**

* 2014(BLM riots begin): **5,479**, 40% decline 

* 2015(first time in 13 years hate crimes increase): **6,121**, 7% increase

* 2016: **6,121**, 5% increase 

* 2018: **7,120**, 16% increase 

* 2022: **11,634**, 63% increase 

This begs the question: was BLM necessary given the trajectory the country was on, and what it is now in 2022?

2,2024-07-24,CMV: Modern Protests Are Mostly Performative and Ineffective,u/GermanInDept,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ebidjk/cmv_modern_protests_are_mostly_performative_and/,changemyview,"I've been thinking about the effectiveness of modern protests, and I can't help but feel that most of them are more about making noise than achieving real change. Sure, they might raise awareness, but do they actually lead to tangible results?

Take, for example, the animal rights protests at horse racing tracks. Who's going to turn around and leave after already paying for parking and tickets? Or the COVID protests—did they really think they could overturn state-level mandates by yelling on street corners? And don't get me started on environmental protests that block roads. Do they honestly believe that gluing themselves to highways will make multinational corporations change their ways?

It feels like protests today are more about being seen and feeling part of a group rather than driving actual change. Historically, protests that led to significant change, like the civil rights movement or labor strikes, had clear, disruptive goals that hit where it hurt economically. Nowadays, it seems like we're just inconveniencing people without any real strategy.

So, CMV: Modern protests are largely performative and fail to achieve their intended goals. What am I missing here?"

Whether it's blocking traffic, making noise, or vandalizing property, protesters just end up alienating potential supporters and giving their opponents ammunition. No one's mind is changed by these disruptive tactics. If anything, it makes people less sympathetic to the cause. Real change happens through voting, lobbying, and working within the system - not by throwing temper tantrums in public. Protesters are just attention-seekers who care more about feeling self-righteous than actually solving problems. Change my view."

Critics argue that this will lead to mass unemployment and economic instability. But I say, why cling to outdated job structures? Embracing this change can lead to a better quality of life, reduced work hours, and increased focus on personal growth and community engagement.

0,2024-07-24,"CMV: Gun control targeting rifles, including AR-15s, is specifically disingenuous. More so than other forms of gun control. ",u/CloudDistrictHooker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ebjdfo/cmv_gun_control_targeting_rifles_including_ar15s/,changemyview,"In 2022, 541 people were killed by rifles in the US. Yes, that includes AR-15s. Meanwhile, 1,105 people died while cycling on public roads. Let's not forget the estimated 500 to 1000 people that die each year due to autoerotique asphyxiation. 

The persecution of rifles in the US is absurd. They account for a MINISCULE number of deaths each year. To be precise, of the 3,273,705 people that died in 2022, 541 of them died via rifle homicide. That is around 0.01% of mortality in the us. That's also known as a rounding error, or a ""negligent"" difference.

The proposed laws to alleviate this alleged slaughter are outlandish. Government over reach in its purist form. I live in Colorado, and this year the state government attempted to pass a ban on ALL semiautomatic weapons, clearly targeting AR-15s, which are rifles. To clarify, in 2019, there were 164 firearm homicides in Colorado. That's ALL firearms, not just rifles. I could not find a stat for rifles. But, going off 2022 national stats, 6.8% of all firearm homicides use a rifle. That means that roughly 12 people were murdered via rifle in Colorado in 2022. Let's be generous and call it 25. In no way should 25 deaths warrant a violation of the US constitution. According to a 2013 survey (its likely only gone up since then) 34% of Colorado residents own at least one firearm, many of those being semiautomatic rifles, the target of the 2024 bill. How on God's green earth does the death of ~25 people justify a tyrannical bill affecting the roughly 1,000,000 people in the state that own a semi-auto? It doesn't. It's smoke, mirrors, and scare tactics.

For some reason that I do not clame to understand, the left wing in this country has it out for firearms. Not just rifles, but all firearms. I personally chalk it up to the leftist fetish for bureaucracy and government regulations. The thing is, public opinion won't change without good optics. What makes gun control look better than a mass shooting? Nothing. THAT is why the left has this bizarre fixation on ""assault rifles""  in spite of the fact that they actually account for very VERY few deaths in the US each year. 

It is my personal opinion that any and all gun control is an abomination to our freedom and a violation of our rights. That being said, if you're going to try and take away my guns, wouldn't you want to focus on handguns? Handguns are responsible for the most firearm homicides in the US each year and it's not even close.

If you're going to pretend to care about the ""gun violence epidemic"" in this country, at least go after the right guns.

Prove me wrong."

0,2024-07-24,CMV: The education system should prioritize practical skills over traditional academic subjects.,u/GermanInDept,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ebjimu/cmv_the_education_system_should_prioritize/,changemyview,"I believe that the current education system places too much emphasis on traditional academic subjects like mathematics, literature, and history, at the expense of practical skills that are essential for everyday life and future employment. While I understand the importance of a well-rounded education, I think that a greater focus on practical skills would better prepare students for the real world.

**Reasoning:**

**1. Relevance to Real Life:**

Many students graduate without basic financial literacy, such as understanding taxes, loans, and budgeting. These are crucial skills for managing personal finances, yet they are rarely covered in depth in traditional curricula. Prioritizing practical skills would ensure that students are better prepared to handle their finances and avoid common pitfalls like debt.

**2. Employment Preparedness:**

Employers often report that graduates lack essential skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These soft skills are critical in almost every job but are not explicitly taught in traditional academic subjects. By integrating practical skills training into the curriculum, students would be better equipped to enter the workforce and succeed in their careers.

**3. Adaptability:**

The job market is rapidly changing, with new industries and technologies emerging all the time. Practical skills, such as coding, digital literacy, and vocational training, are increasingly in demand. An education system that adapts to these changes and provides students with relevant skills would better serve their future needs.

**4. Engagement and Motivation:**

Many students find traditional academic subjects unengaging and struggle to see their relevance to their future lives. Practical skills training can be more engaging and motivating for students, as they can see the direct application of what they are learning. This could lead to higher levels of student engagement and lower dropout rates.

**Openness to Change:**

I recognize that traditional academic subjects have their merits and that a balance is necessary. However, I am open to hearing arguments for why the current emphasis on traditional subjects might be more beneficial than I currently believe. I am also interested in hearing suggestions for how practical skills could be better integrated into the existing curriculum without sacrificing the benefits of a traditional education.

I think that the farther you get towards the fringes, the closer you get to authoritarianism and tyranny. Even center right, laissez-faire moderate conservatism is in some respects pro-liberty, even if they are misguided as to what it takes to ensure economic equity, since they don't seem to value economic equity at all. 

Here's the rub: The farther right you go into Nazi-land, and the farther left you go into tankie-land, the more conspiratorial, the more antisemitic people get. The conflict in Gaza has been very disturbing to watch, to be sure, however some of the leftist protests have gone too far for the specific reason that some of these protestors seem pretty buddy buddy with Islamic extremist groups. Their willingness to turn a blind eye to the hate-filled extremists among them is deeply saddening. It speaks to the problem of the Nazbol/fascist tankies and their affinity for Russia, Iran, and other authoritarian regimes. That is to say the Jackson Hinkles or MAGA Communists, etc. 

The marketplace of ideas is complex and fraught and wherever there has been extremism, there has been authoritarianism. And wherever there has been authoritarianism, there has been antisemitism.

You can know there is a problem without having a solution yet. 

1. Politics, economics, law, etc.. are all wayyy too complex for the average person to understand. To be frank it’s so complex that it would likely have to be your career to really have a wide grasp on how things work at home and internationally. 

2: A lot of Americans are actually illiterate. There’s a stat from Google that shows that 54% of Americans have a literacy below a 6th grade level. I also saw a stat that showed that more than 20% of Americans couldn’t find the United States on a map. I don’t think uneducated people should be voting. They simply don’t know what they’re doing! Policies that effect people’s live is not something where you just want wing it.

3: American politics has become way to toxic and is radicalizing people . People are getting radicalized on both sides. Left wing voters call conservatives nazis and right wing voters call liberals child groomers on and on. Most people don’t have the emotional control and are unable to find common ground. You’d be surprised on how much you actually do agree with. This is just really bad for unity of the country and not to mention really bad for people mental health. Iv seen some say they will delete themselves if trump gets in. Some people just are not built for it and that’s ok! 

4: In this age of hyper technology, social media and ai, misinformation and propaganda is incredibly rampant. The average person is not equipped to decipher this cluster. This can emerge in way like conspiracy theories, and indoctrination just for example. Peoples minds are essentially being programmed. I find it unlikely this won’t carry over to their voting efforts.

To conclude, In a nutshell I don’t think the average person is equipped to be able to understand nor handle politics. They should just stay in their lane and enjoy their life.

""Haven’t read the paper, just this article, but there seems to be an important question entirely overlooked.

Why should it be legal for couples (or entire dungeons of consenting adults) to explore such fantasies, but not legal for a lone masturbator, playing with a sex toy? It doesn’t seem to make an awful lot of sense, unless you’re proposing that consenting adult partners should also be forbidden from engaging in role-playing of this kind.""

If an adult engaging in such activities with an inanimate doll or robot is unacceptable because it indicates a degraded moral character and fuels a hunger for the real thing, then why exactly should the same logic not also apply to an adult engaging in such activities with one or more consenting adult partners, assuming that these activities were equally realistic in both cases? I don't see the meaningful difference between simulated non-consent when it is done by another adult vs. when it is one by an inanimate doll or robot. While one can say that dolls and robots can't consent at all, this applies to all dolls and robots, not just those that look like children, and yet AFAICT people generally don't want to ban sex dolls and robots that look like adults."

Much as people may dislike it, the Taliban is the recognise government of Afghanistan and further isolating them from the rest of the world will only punish the Afghan people more.
While  it’s true that the tourist will spend money in the country which will fund the Taliban, some of that money would also go to the local shopkeepers and stallholders and the Taliban are not expansionist like other islamist groups.
If tourism becomes a significant source of revenue for the country then this gives the west another way to pressure the Taliban, by increasing the flow of tourists if they liberalise a little on human rights and women’s rights  like what’s happening now in Saudi Arabia."

1. It is well known Palestinians by and large are anti LGBT, as such its totally fine to feel uncomfortable promoting such a group at whats meant to be a pride event. After all, said group is against you.

2. It's fine to not want to be associated with another movement you don't fully agree with. Some supporters of Palestine go fairly extreme with outrigt supporting Hamas or spreading outright antisemitism. Its fair for anyone to not want their flag flying alongside another flag they may disagree with itself, or disagree with elements of.

3. It's fine to want pride marches and events to actually focus on Pride. Attaching other social causes to all of them just kinda dilutes the message and energy. Its totally fine for someone to prefer focusing on Pride Flags and the Pride community first and foremost; and thus wanting to avoid the inclusion of other flags."

Abortions aren't easy . 
Having to grow your child and giving up school because your parents can't or don't support you isn't easy either . 

And even if they support you , getting pregnant or a parent at young age sucks. 

You have your whole fucking life coming at you . 

You have enough resources to at least know the risks pregnancy not only as an adult but also a minor THAT IS GROWING can bring . 

You just have to chill 18 years of your fucking life but are too horny or stupid to control your sex drive . 

Why ? 

Pills don't work for everyone.  

A condom still has the risk of getting you pregnant. 


I really hate how for many teens it is ""sex everywhere and sex with everyone"" 

You legit have at least 60 years of adult hood and 20 years of childhood / teenhood . 

Why would you risk that? 

I have NEVER heard of a women in my life that she wouldn't have rather gotten her children later than at the age they did.  


Don't play around with sex in your children / teen days .

In my opinion, there is nothing special about with whom you have sex or rather to whom you're attracted to why, you just are. It does not change you as a human you're neither more nor less special because of it.

My first real introduction to LGTBQ+ spaces and communities was through an ex-girlfriend of mine. Prior I had some friends in school who identified as homosexual but there wasn't really a separate community for them so to speak, they just liked dudes and that was it.

This community was quite obsessed with gender identity and sexual identity, it felt more like a hobby or a trend they were following than anything else. I learned a lot of new words at this table and they were frantic about asking about my gender/sexual identity. They as well as my girlfriend at that time build a lot of their personality around their sexuality. I can vividly remember that after talking with my GF that i would try having sex with guys because why not the thought isn't a bad one she got very happy and welcomed me into the LGBTQ Community. She basically started treating me like i just succeeded on some kind of test to enter a hidden society.

This to me was and still is very strange and something i would experience a lot more. Like suddenly just because im not solely attracted to the opposite gender makes me a better human being. I see this online a lot as well.

It feels like LGBTQ moved from an important thing to fight inequality and show people are free to love to a trend that people chase after. The amount of new labels I've been seeing on dating apps alone is staggering.

I understand it to a certain degree, that you want to identify yourself so that people know even tho i personally woud never do that since i dont wanna be put in a drawer of some sort, im just myself and while my sexuallity is part of myslef its not even close of being a defining feature of me or my personality i woud say.

And here lies my core issue. We dont need a label for everything. Sapiosexual is the best example. Being attracted by intelligent people is just normal there is no need for a special word for it. Being attracted to people you have an emotional connection with is also just normal. (The same goes , in my mind for beeing homosexual or bisexuall its normal and it dosent matter if youre on or the other but i understand the usage and community building much more)

On the otherhand we have people who are labeling themselves with such specific things that it dosent make sense either. Do i think goth mommy are hot? Yea but i wouldn't label myslef as Gothicamatersexual.

All of this just leads to weird tribalism and in turn, discrimination which is pretty ironic.

To boil it all down: People are just people their personality is not defined by their sexuality neither does your sexuallity makes you more or less special and modern LGBTQ feels more like a trend people chase.

Student visa holders, green card holders, illegal immigrants and refugees engaging in this type of behavior should be immediately deported.

If they dislike the United States so much that they are willing to engage in blatantly anti-American behavior, they are more than welcome to go to one of the 192 other countries on Earth.  Any who refuse to go willingly, in spite of their hatred of the United States, should be immediately deported back to wherever they came from with no opportunity to appeal or return.  

I'm not even asking for gratitude for all the things provided to non-citizen residents of the United States.  Just don't be actively hostile.  I have absolutely no interest in providing support or protection to those who despise me, my values, and my country.

It occurs to me after writing this that I should provide some view that I want people in this subreddit to try to change.  I guess what I would say that for most of my life, I have considered myself largely a free speech absolutist.  However, in the last year in particular, I have seen a massive increase in negativity towards the United States, particularly from those who are not originally from here, and I have lost any patience and sympathy over time.  This all came to a head watching the protests unfolding in D.C. over Netanyahu's speech to Congress where thousands (a large portion of whom I would assume are not U.S. citizens) pull down my flag and burn it, raising Palestinian flags instead while vandalizing monuments.  Convince me that non-citizens who have such a visceral hatred of the United States should be allowed to stay."

Anyways, I see this all the time and it legitimately bothers me. Human thought and achievement is not inherently devalued by it's age, even if most seriously old ideas and media sort of suck. Actually, that should still hardly matter, because the majority of ideas and media suck in some way, regardless of how modern they are.  

I'm convinced that when people say ""X is old"", it's typically a way of saying ""I'm not a fan of this"" and making it sound objective, rather than simply admitting that something isn't for them. I'd go as far as to call it cultural bullying.  

Particularly in the realm of ideas, this flimsy criticism leads to the impression that someone couldn't have ""gotten it right the first time"" or at least far earlier. Either _that's_ true or all ""it's old"" means is that you didn't have the context to enjoy or at least understand it, in which case you should just acknowledge that rather than baselessly shitting on things.  

Better ways to criticise things:  

– Acknowledge that language barriers or a lack of shared cultural context makes something inaccessible (this is a relatively valid reason to use ""old"" in this way but it's often flung at media where there's no way this is true)  

– Note objectively untrue statements made in the media

– Explain why you believe some other aspect of the media deserves objective criticism 

– Explain why you simply dislike some aspect of the media (""it's old"" isn't a coherent reason)  "

The statement makes a different impression depending on how much 500 pounds in 1928 are. If they are like 20’000 $, then she is saying that a modest income is sufficient, enough not to starve. If it’s 200’000$, then the same statement has a different impact.

Obviously one can look up online how much 500 pounds would be today but 1) it’s not so easy to find reputable sources on inflation that go far in the past (feel free to suggest if you have one) 2) i still need to interrupt my reading to make an internet search.

A novel and a version of that novel in which the language has been made more accessible, are two different things. 

A novel and a version of that novel in which the prices are changed are, in practice, the same thing. A footnote can be added to mark where the original text was adapted.

The obvious objection is that the inflation adjustment in the book will itself become obsolete. But if I read a Pride and Prejudice printed in 1970, prices adjusted to 1970 will anyway be more relatable than the original. Also this would not be an issue with ebooks."

To me- this is a complete non sequitur and irrelevant to the conversation at hand. If this is an argument truly for the gay community the only point these arguments seem to be making is that any support of the Palestinian people during the ongoing crisis, or support for autonomy for the people living there is an automatic endorsement or Acceptance of homophobic violence that occurs there, similar to the ways anti-women violence has been propogandized. 

Otherwise- this seems like more obviously an attempt to discredit gay people who sympathize with Palestine as idiotic reactionaries. The fact that imagined circumstances of violence are used as punchlines, such as the dehumanization and slaughter less than implied by Netanyahus 'chickens for KFC'. It's hard for me to get past the ridiculing of gay people and actually believe there's a concern for queer people in these arguments. Arguably- I see them as inherently Homophobic arguments that assert that render the gay community objects in a conversation rather than active participants."

•	⁠has been caught plaigiarizing his entire life, including in law school and during his failed 1988 presidential campaign

•	⁠smeared Anita Hill and castigated her during her testimony in the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.  Whatever happened to “believe all women”  ?????????????

•	⁠refuses to interact with or acknowledge his 7th grandchild, Navy Joan

•	⁠[cheated on his wife](https://nypost.com/2020/08/17/jill-bidens-ex-husband-accuses-her-of-having-affair-with-joe-biden/) with “Doctor” Jill, according to Jill’s ex-husband

•	⁠cleared over [20 confirmed lies](https://thefederalist.com/2024/06/28/here-are-the-20-biggest-whoppers-biden-told-during-his-debate-with-trump/) during the last debate

- he and his inner circle have lied about his deteriorating mental condition for over 4 years.  We knew it when he hid in the basement during all of 2020, but he made the representation to the entire world since then that he was “fit for duty.”  He risked  the security of our nation and the world out of pride.  

- blamed the death of Beau for why he didn’t run in 2016, when it turns out, as he just admitted, that it was because the “Democrat” party passed him over to select Hillary instead.  

- literally touted Kamala Harris as a DEI hire on the White House website, and now denies it since it is politically inconvenient for her.

I’m sure I’ve left some out, but these are the low-hanging fruit.

- You want a place who is safe for peoples and building.  You don't want your mega capital to be destroyed by a seism, or a tornado, or a tsunami. So place like island or coastal cities have to be excluded. Plus a coastal city is too easy to attack.

- But you don't want a continental climate either, a place where the weather would be too hot, too cold, or both. You don't want your 50 millions inhabitant to turn on the AC all day cause it's hot enough to cook a chicken on the road. 

Concretely the best is an oceanic weather. Which offer stability. But you want the place to be a bit in the land. Enough to be safe. 

And the best oceanic weather is the medditeranean one, where you bath all year in a warm, but not too hot, weather. 

Which lead us to some places. California, Oregon, Peru, the south of France, Grece, Italy.

Next part, the global position. You want your capital to be close to the rest of the world. Which imply not only to be near a large river (so you can access the sea easily), but a short road to the rest of the world from here.

And this is where California, Oregon and Peru are an issue. They are facing the pacific, with a forest/desert on the west.

On the other hand, the european medditeranean coast? It's close to pretty much everything. Africa, the caspian sea through Istanbul, the atlantic ocean through Gibraltar, China and India through Suez, and the north sea through the European rivers.

France and Italy have an advantage here. They are protected. Mountains on one side, ocean on the others. The whole area form a natural fortress. 

Now, between France and Italy, the competition is hard....but France is better. Why? Because of the weather who tend to warm up. Italy is more than livable, but still a bit too hot. In the future it could become a bit problem.

So, the best place is french south. But where exactly? 

Well:

- You want a place where rivers flows, if possible several. To use them as naval road.

- You want a place which is flat, to make construction easier, and a ground not too hard, but enough to avoid building sinking

- You don't want to use a fertile land. But it's better to have a fertile land (if possible in the opposite way of the river stream), so you can grow food and feed your city with local products.

- You want a good supply of drinking water.

  
And the best place is...avignon. Flat. Weather hot but stable and dry enough. 2 rivers leading to Marseille, perfect ground with a rock ground nearby to be used for construction and sources of water below.  The land on the north is made of pretty productive farmland. 

I defy you to find a better place in the world, with all these advantages, to build a city."

If your life is such a mess that you don’t have identification I can’t imagine that voting is on your list of concerns and worries. 

I don’t fully know the reasoning behind felons being unable to vote, but shouldn’t that same reasoning apply to people who are so disoriented and disenfranchised that they don’t have a basic form of ID?

As a last point, I do also think a free form of valid government ID should be available to all citizens.

Then you put all your re-usable bags into the cart and start shopping. Each item you scan and put directly into your bag. You can remove items if you change your mind, and it shows you a running total of what you are purchasing. Weighed items you weigh and get a printout with a code to scan, same for deli items.

Then once you are done shopping, you go to checkout (could be self-checkout or a real person) and scan your scanner, pay and go. Your groceries are already bagged and it's very quick.

Where I have seen it implemented, there are occasional random checks to make sure you are scanning everything, which I think is fine, and (as per the title) in areas where theft is an issue this solution may not make sense.

It makes shopping much faster and more convenient and really encourages using reusable bags. If a shop uses the phone scanner option, the hardware cost for them is minimal. I'm not sure of the software cost, but it has been implemented for many years in some supermarkets with scanner hardware, so it must be cost-effective in some areas at least for bigger supermarkets."

The only logical thread in the immigration panic seems to be xenophobia. The VP pick’s family politics really highlights this since calls to stall immigration are paired with calls to have more babies or face “civilization crisis.”

> ""The fact that we're not having enough babies, the fact that we're not having enough children, is a crisis in this country,""

To have a platform of shutting the border but increasing native birth rates out of necessity…. How is that not basically a just a “great replacement” dogwhistle?

This is like German family ideology in the 1930s…. More “good” babies while getting rid of the “alien” population who “won’t assimilate.”

For a delta please explain without resorting to claiming that immigrants are inherently untrustworthy or dangerous.. that is untrue and still confirms the xenophobia argument."

Therefore every time a government approves a draft or conscription, the politicians who authorized these actions should themselves be conscripted.

I’m not talking about sending the politicians to some office job in a base. No, it’s front-line combat roles that they should be sent to.
Those who are too old get their children sent instead. Also to combat roles. 

Rolling-basis (eg. 10% of a Congress or parliament on the front line at any given time, with deployments lasting 1 month each).

Politicians would certainly be less trigger happy in sending whole generations of men into the meat grinder if they themselves had to sleep in the jungle rain or desert heat surrounded by enemy fire and the smell of death.

But recently I’ve been thinking to myself… what have the governments been doing to change this division or fix it? A bit of background I’m an immigrant livid in England right now. And recently online I’ve seen so much anti-immigrant sentiments and xenophobic sentiments on the news on social media articles and the main one, politics. At first I was like do people genuinely believe all the stuff they say about immigrants in general? Like ye there are bad immigrants in the uk but those are a minority and they genuinely are, so are people just ignorant? Some are yes but the thing that feeds this ignorance and division is mainly the government. I saw it in the European elections and the main thing politicians kept attributing to the failing of economy and other things is immigrants. “We let them in and now they are ruining it for us” or “this is what happens when there’s diversity”. And this is usually the comments in the video of a person of color or different ethnicity doing something bad and usually people end up generalising all immigrants. Could some people be doing it out of hate purely? Yes.. but there’s a body that doesn’t discourage the hate and that’s the current government. And in the broader sense I’m not just blaming the government for problems with immigration but a lot of things as a whole. They are so out of touch with today’s people younger generation and sometimes even older generations. I used to always think that people just blindly support some shit the government does and I’ve come to know that’s false. Most governments today feel like business running a company instead of intellects governing people and that makes me sad."

I’m also saying this in highlight of how recently a police officer used excessive force in kicking a Muslim man who just before that attacked a female police officer and broke their nose. The Muslim community then started protesting because of this and then called the police racist. I’m not too bothered by why they’re protesting as I suppose if you feel like you’re specific group of people are being attacked you can protest. However it frustrates me as they’re not also highlighting other issues are going on in the world. I’m also saying that the Muslim community specifically in the UK aren’t also willing to point out their own wrongdoings too which shows they only want to view themselves as the sole victims in the worlds problems. Also I dont protest on any matter so I suppose I’m even more ignorant but I just believe that if you want to protest issues going on in the world you need to protest one that aren’t just affecting you.

0,2024-07-25,CMV: 18 year olds can consent even less than 17 year olds can,u/RevolutionsAgain,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ec94e1/cmv_18_year_olds_can_consent_even_less_than_17/,changemyview,"The fundamental idea is that the power imbalance, maturity and cognitive development of minors are too great in difference compared to adults that minors cannot consent to them. But I argue it's even less off a difference between a 17 year old and 30 year old than an 18 year old and 30 year old. In terms of maturity and cognitive ability the difference between a 17 year old and an 18 is nothing if not less. Nobody would look twice at comparing an 18 year old to a 17 year old or letting them date and so on and so on. They are really the same. Half of all 18 year olds are still in highschool, the other half are figuring out what to do with their life.

This period of confusion and possible premature responsibility at 18 coupled with the legal safety net of being a child being stripped away from them make them fundamentally unable to consent to an even greater degree than a 17 year old. An 18 year old can be kicked out of their home at any moment if their parents are shitty. Need I explain how that might cause a power imbalance between them and the older partner? If yes then the reason is that they probably don't have a job, neither do they have significant work experience and even if they do they might not have the time to get a job using that experience before they're kicked out. Especially nowadays with it becoming harder and harder for young people to find jobs.

Is it a surprise then that so many ""sugar babies"" or young people that ""date"" adults are college aged students? No money, no work, no life experience, impulsive thinking of an underdeveloped brain, and a total devestating amount of bills to pay if they want to afford college and pay off their debts they might have already incurred.

Now compare this to the 17 year old who has the same maturity and cognitive development but who has nothing of this to worry about. How is it somehow possible that 3 months ago it was rape and now living with the threat of being kicked out and dreams you can't affor you are perfectly allowed and able to consent to somebody who might help you with all your troubles?

I think it's too much of a blanket statement to say that 18 year olds can consent."

0,2024-07-25,CMV: Morality Is Objective With One Core Component Integrating Subjective Factors,u/fogrampercot,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecbfbn/cmv_morality_is_objective_with_one_core_component/,changemyview,"I believe morality is a product of evolution and has a **single objective part** achieved by considering **various subjective factors**.

This is how I would define morality. Any act is considered immoral **iff** by the promotion of it results in long-term collective harm to the community from an evolutionary perspective. This is the only core part that is always objective with regard to morality.

Sometimes the act might bring some short-term or long-term benefits for an individual or group, but at the end of the day, it will still be considered immoral if the long-term harms outweigh them. Meaning that from an evolutionary standpoint, it will be bad for the species if that action is promoted amongst them. The definition of long-term is also subjective. Since evolution is a continuous process and ever-changing, it's hard to be objective in such matters.

A few examples:

1. **Violence is immoral** because a community promoting it holds a lesser chance to thrive than a community that doesn't from an evolutionary perspective.
2. **Self-defense is moral** because it ensures self-preservation in the case of threats or attacks from other members or species outside the community.
3. **Lying is immoral** because it promotes an environment of mistrust thereby hindering collaboration, which is crucial for a community to prosper.
4. **Kindness is moral** since it nurtures people and allows for redemption and correction.
5. **Violence can also be moral** in some situations, one can say self-defense as a necessary means can also employ violence sometimes.
6. **Self-defense can also be immoral** in some situations if one gets carried away. If there were some other means to use non-lethal methods but still the individual chooses lethal methods it could be considered as immoral. Because in these cases, it wouldn't promote the welfare of the community in the long run.
7. **Lying can also be moral**, for instance, to save someone's life, to cool down a riot, etc.
8. **Kindness can also be immoral** if it is misplaced like showing kindness to repeated offenders and not taking any action against them out of kindness.

So as we can see the situations are very subjective and can contain so many different nuanced factors. But at the end of the day, the core objective component remains. We can have similar arguments and it is not always easy to decide which would be collectively better for the community as there are different trade-offs and there isn't a concrete way to measure all of them. Consider moral dilemmas like The Trolley Problem. From an utilitarian perspective, it makes sense to pull the lever but it also comes at the cost of significant distress, trauma, and burden on the individual who pulls the lever. As we can see these situations are very complex and it is hard to define a situational objective viewpoint regarding what would be moral in such cases. Regardless, the objective component remains the same here.

0,2024-07-25,"CMV: Conservatives believe in Identity Politics, too and it's mostly based on Religion.",u/StatisticianGreat514,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecc1y5/cmv_conservatives_believe_in_identity_politics/,changemyview,"One of the many Criticisms that we hear a lot from Conservatives towards Liberals is that they always accuse them of playing Identity Politics. They constantly criticize them for using such a tactic to divide people into certain groups whether it be Race, Religion, Gender, Sexuality, etc. and letting them think one way as a result of that. In this case, it's voting for the Democrats and any other Left-Wing Party and not what is best for the Country, which technically means voting for the Republicans and any other Right-Wing Party. Doing so has lead them to accuse them of playing ""Real Racism and Sexism"", as well as the ""Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations"" because they view them as oppressed and immune from Independent Thought. But there's One Problem though. Conservatives also play Identity Politics, too and and it's mostly based on Religion.

We always hear a lot of Conservative Politicians and Voters refer to Themselves in the Following Terms: Christian, Conservative, and Republican in that order. They lean into their Religion a lot to influence their Politics when it comes to Important Topics both Domestic and International. Examples would be Anti-Abortion, Family Values such as Marriage and Family, Education such as bringing God back in School, and the Affairs in the Middle East such as Israel. Simply put, their Overall Beliefs are God, Family, and Country. Unfortunately, they don't think a lot of Non-Christians are capable of being Conservative and Republican. An Obvious Example involving an Event that took place last Week expresses that point brilliantly.

On the First Day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the event closed off the night with a Series of Prayers with the majority of them obviously being delivered by Christians, most notably Evangelicals such as Franklin Graham, a Greek Archbishop, and a Trump-impersonating Pastor. There were also two Non-Christian Prayers with one of them being Jewish. But there was another Prayer that stood out from the Crowd and it was delivered by a Woman named Harmeet Dhillon. If you don't know who she is, she is a California Attorney who is the former Vice Chair of the State's Republican Party. She has constantly defended Freedom of Speech on College Campuses for Conservatives as well as filed Lawsuits against Attacks on Conservatives. During the Covid Pandemic, she filed Lawsuits against Stay-at-Home Orders, criticized the use of Face Masks, opposed Mail-In Voting, and called for the Reopening of the Economy. Last Year, she unsuccessfully ran for Chair of the National GOP. But there's One Aspect of her that stands out the most. She's a Sikh, an Indian Religion that originated in the 15th Century. There's 300,000 of them living in the US so far and they're often mistaken for being Muslims because of their Turbans making them susceptible to Attacks for being Terrorists. This takes me back to the the Topic being discussed here. Not only was she One of Two Non-Christian Delegates that Night, she was One of Two that delivered a Non-Christian Prayer. In this case, it was a Prayer known as an Ardas, which she recited in Punjabi (one of the Numerous South Asian Languages) praying to Waheguru, a God they worship. While she did receive some Praise for the Prayer, she also faced Intense Backlash from Christian Conservatives who criticized it for being ""Anti-Christian"", ""Blasphemous"", and ""Demonic"" even going further by accusing the RNC for ""promoting False Gods"" instead of the One True God, Jesus as well as being ""Woke and Inclusive"".

If anything, this goes to show that Conservatives and Republicans not only have a huge Image Problem among the General Population, but they also engage in Identity Politics as well. As a matter of Fact, it's their Creation. Furthermore, I think it's safe to say that the Identity Politics that you see on the Left is basically a Reaction to the Toxic Rhetoric spread by the Right. And it's issues like these that exemplify it greatly. So, they better not blame the Media for dividing the Country when it's them who is promoting the Division. And it also doesn't help that any Form of Community Outreach particularly towards Non-Whites and Non-Christians is seen as Pandering, being Politically Correct/Woke, and DEI in the Eyes of a lot of Conservatives saying that all it does is spread Division, reduces People into Special Interest Groups even going further by stating that they will never vote for them, as well as trying to alienate their Core Base, who as I mentioned earlier are obviously Christians, Evangelicals especially. This is especially True when promoting Events such as Black, Hispanic, and Asian History Months. In Reality, all they're doing is acknowledging the many Demographics that have contributed to America. And let's not forget the Hate towards Republican Vice Presidential Candidate J.D. Vance's Wife, Usha. When promoting Non-Christian Holidays, they always resort to good Old-Fashioned Christian Nationalism by condemning the Religions aside from Judaism that follow them even going further by stating that they still won't vote for them. I mean, who hasn't forgotten the Hate and Vitriol towards Former President Obama for supposedly being Muslim when he's actually a Christian? That Belief still exists in the Minds of many Republicans to this Day. That's One of many Reasons why the Muslim Community votes Democrat. And let's add to that by including Former Republican Presidential Candidate and supposed ""Anti-Woke"" Advocate Vivek Ramaswamy, who's Hindu, another Indian Religion and the Original One there. He has faced a lot of Hate towards him due to him being Non-Christian with some going further by stating that he's Muslim. And now with Harmeet Dhillon, the same Tactics are being used towards her. And this isn't the first time she faced such Vitriol. When she was running for Chair of the National Republican Party last Year, a Whisper Campaign against her by her Rivals which included then-Incumbent Ronna McDaniel and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell was made against her Faith.

I mean, Things such as this are the Reasons why Non-Christian Conservatives/Republicans aside from certain Jewish Factions are largely nonexistent. Conservatives should've used this as an Opportunity to expand their Voter Base considering every Religion shares their Values and hence, topics such as Marriage, Anti-Abortion, Family, Education, Religion, and less Liberalism would resonate with them. But since they mostly don't see other Religions as equals, it's highly unlikely. Seriously, what makes these Conservatives think that reaching out and being Inclusive to Non-Christians, let alone Non-Whites is Pandering, Politically Correct, Woke, DEI, etc.? It's called having Decency and Respect. And besides, look at their Party, not only is it 85-90% White, it's 84% Christian with 30% of them being Evangelical. What more do they want? Have they been pandered to enough? Yes, they have. But to me, their constant Nagging and Complaining is a Result of them failing to realize that the World just doesn't revolve around Them and only Them. It revolves around Everyone. But as the Old Saying goes: ""When you're so accustomed to Privilege, Equality feels like Oppression.""

So in Conclusion, Conservatives believe in Identity Politics, too and they play it much more harder than Liberals with Religion being the Main Cornerstone of it and occasionally, Race. If anything, this goes to show that there's no way we can get rid of it. Everyone has an Identity. How you carry, express, and identify Yourself have Real-World Implications on how you're treated every day. And that's emphasized even further when it comes to Voting Records, Policy, Candidates, etc.

So the Moral of the Story is this: You can't have Politics without Identity because it influences what you believe in.

Europe has 50 countries, each with unique cultures and folklore. I don’t see how it’s my place to demand that they diversify their culturally inspired stories so that I, an asian person, can feel more included. It doesn’t enhance the story and disrupts the immersion of settings often rooted in ancient Europe. To me, it’s a blatant form of cultural appropriation. Authors are writing about their own cultures and have every right to feature an all-white cast if that’s their choice.

For those still unconvinced, consider this: would you race-swap the main characters in a live adaptation of *The Last Airbender*? From what [I’ve read](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/xvff1q/the_lack_of_black_representation_in_netflix_live/), the answer would be a resounding no. Even though it’s a fantasy with lightning-bending characters, it’s deeply influenced by Asian and Inuit cultures. Swapping characters for white or black actors would not only break immersion but also disrespect the cultures being represented.

  
The bottom line is that taking stories from European authors and race-swapping them with POCs in America doesn’t help us. Europe has many distinct cultures, none of which we as Americans have the right to claim. Calling people racist for wanting their own culture represented properly only breeds resentment towards POCs."

Most of the non-politically minded people in my life dont like Trump at all, but also didn't really want to vote for Biden, either. Maybe they would have in the end, but they weren't highly motivated, and that affects turnout.

Now they are excited. It seems like people feel  optimistic for the first time in ages. They are going to show up to vote, and they're going to feel good about it.

0,2024-07-25,"CMV: Similar to how the right wing neglects women's issues, the left isn't so much better when it comes to men's issues. ",u/KA_82205,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecd14o/cmv_similar_to_how_the_right_wing_neglects_womens/,changemyview,"First, I want to say that I am on the left, with that being said It's widely acknowledged that the right wing has significant shortcomings in addressing women's issues. Policies that restrict reproductive rights, oppose measures for equal pay, and fail to support protections against gender-based violence clearly demonstrate this. 



However, it's important to recognize that the left also falls short in adequately addressing men's issues. While the left-wing champions progressive causes and gender equality, it often overlooks the specific issues faced by men. Traditional notions of masculinity discourage men from seeking help for mental health issues, leading to high rates of male suicide and depression. Despite this, left-wing discourse often prioritizes women's mental health, leaving men's struggles under-addressed. Men are less likely to receive support for their mental health issues, and the societal stigma around men showing vulnerability exacerbates the problem.



 Boys and young men are increasingly falling behind in education, with lower college enrollment rates compared to women. This educational disparity can lead to long-term economic disadvantages. Policies aimed at supporting male education and addressing dropout rates are often lacking in left-wing agendas. In family courts, men frequently face biases regarding child custody and parental rights. While the left emphasizes women's rights in these areas, there is less advocacy for equal parenting and paternity leave, which are crucial for supporting fathers. Men's health issues, such as prostate cancer and testicular cancer, receive less public attention and funding compared to women's health issues like breast cancer. This disparity can lead to inadequate awareness and support for men suffering from these conditions. While domestic violence is predominantly perpetrated by men, male victims also need support. The left's focus on protecting women from domestic violence sometimes overshadows the need to support male victims, who may feel stigmatized and less likely to seek help. Social media often features anti-man rhetoric, portraying men's feelings as a burden and invalidating their experiences. This toxicity can discourage men from expressing their emotions and seeking help, leading to a sense of isolation and increased mental health struggles. 



The left, which dominates much of social media discourse, sometimes fails to address or counteract this harmful rhetoric. This imbalance in addressing gender-specific issues has contributed to a growing divide between men and women in terms of political affiliation. Women, seeing the significant advocacy and campaigns around their issues, often align more with the left wing, which visibly supports their rights. Men, feeling neglected and underrepresented in left-wing discourse, might gravitate towards the right or become politically disengaged altogether. It's undeniable that women's issues receive considerable societal attention. Campaigns for reproductive rights, equal pay, and protection against violence are widespread and rightfully so, given the historical and ongoing challenges women face. However, the disparity in attention can sometimes overshadow the significant issues faced by men, leading to a perception that men's problems are less important. In conclusion, both political wings have areas where they can improve in addressing gender-specific issues. 



The right wing's shortcomings in dealing with women's issues are well-documented, but the left wing also needs to enhance its support for men's issues, after all that is what true feminism is about, I struggle to see how it hasn't taken a toxic turn."
0,2024-07-25,CMV: Harris is a terrible pick,u/Swimreadmed,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecdpih/cmv_harris_is_a_terrible_pick/,changemyview,"I believe Kamala Harris is an extremely weak choice to lead the Democratic ticket. She has very poor credentials for either conservatives or progressives. She doesn't promise anything other than ""Not Trump"" which is pretty much anyone other than Trump including Joe Biden. Biden should've ran while appointing someone with strong progressive/popular credentials, so he could say if I go, I leave you in good hands. Harris is weaker than Hillary and Hillary actually had built a resume and popular appeal. This gaslighting of the populace that Harris is some iconic American figure is going to be a Hillary 2.0.. The Democrats have better people to run, Walz, Beshear, Warren etc

The only real difference is that left wing nationalism is for nations that have nothing to proud of. Other than that they are the same: they both teach hatred, they both cause war, and both are anti-individual.

Left wing nationalism ruins leftism because the whole point of leftism is internationalism, peace and cooperation, not blaming and hating other people based on their nationality because you come from a failed country.

Left wing nationalism is justified when and only when your country is not independent and you want to form a seperate country. Once you have attained that goal nationalism becomes more and more right wing over time."

0,2024-07-26,Cmv: drama shows are bad,u/Yogurtcloset_Choice,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecik6z/cmv_drama_shows_are_bad/,changemyview,"I really hate drama shows, and I'm not just talking about the reality tv shows, I mean all drama. I remember getting wildly disappointed by game of thrones and walking dead because they just turned out to be drama.

Drama shows have no pay off, every drama show that exists when it reaches the finale the pay off is the end of the drama, compaing that to every other genre it just pails in comparison. Action has the people finishing the fight/mission, mystery is the culmination of all the clues to find the solution, adventure has the heroes returning home after a wondrous journey, drama is the Katie decided she will invite her ex to the wedding. That's just terrible in comparison.

The writing is awful, they always have to write these characters to over react to every little thing, ""oh my God what do you mean you got them a pink ball when they asked for purple?"" And if it isn't something in those lines it's ""oh well they did this horrible thing, they killed someone"" or ""oh they're cheating on their partner, they steal money from the business"" and the solution is either they get killed usually in a scene where it isn't built up well or they get arrested. I know that feeds back into my previous point but still.

The LIGHTING, my god I swear these directors and filmographers are shooting on a shoe sting budget because they don't seem to be able to AFFORD LIGHTS, its ALWAYS so DARK, drama can happen in the day time too

The music, why does it need to be so loud? Why does the music have to be so loud that it will drown out people speaking? And idk if it can really be called music half the time its just loud clunks to try and raise tension 

Now this doesn't mean all drama is bad, of course any story needs drama to progress otherwise there's no reason for any of it, but the pure drama is just terrible 

Edit: I forgot to add in that everyone is always whispering! You have people speaking as quiet as a mouse, then the music is as loud as a truck horn and in an effort to hear the dialogue you turn it up then go deaf from the music"

0,2024-07-26,CMV: Implementing an adequate cap on personal wealth would have virtually no downsides.,u/Equivalent_Pilot_125,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecls1w/cmv_implementing_an_adequate_cap_on_personal/,changemyview,"Lets say the cap is set at 50million$ - a level that already allows a lifetime of luxury without the need to actually work again. It would offer more than enough incentives for people trying hard to get rich while also capping off the point of diminishing returns (by a wide margin) as we know at these levels extra wealth does not actually increase someone's happiness in the long run. If rich people arent happy because of their wealth and poor people arent happy because they simply dont have enough for a stable life then the logical solution to maximise human happiness becomes clearly evident.

Now of course the question is what is ""wealth"" really - easy answer all assets (including but not only cash) that an individual owns.

1.""But rich people will just park their assets in shell companies?"" - any company you own in any capacity is added to your personal wealth. If you try to hide assets from the government then thats fraud which could be punished by % fines. Plenty of money to pay government investigators.

If they park the money in an organisation without being the majority shareholder then someone else has to be shareholder and it will count towards their wealth.

2.""rich people will give money to their friends"" - sure - liable to taxes you can gift your excess wealth to anyone up to their own cap. Good luck giving away 50 billion this way. If you dont then after the deadline your wealth will be seized by your country of residence or by the location of the asset.

3.""politicians will try to cheat the system"" - once its law they will not be able to without breaking set law. This whole premise can only work if enough major powers make this the new law - so that the foundation we need to accept here.

4. ""Is human happiness really the goal we should strive for?"" - Even if your goal is productivity its actually counter productive to have high wealth inequality. More money for the middle class means increased consumer spending and increased productivity which benefits the whole country.

5.""it will require a lot of bureaucracy"" - naturally the ministry would focus only on relevant cases - not to constantly check if someone's new couch puts their asset value above 50 million now. Readings could be taken once a year just like your tax declaration - if your stock value drops just below 50mill in that time then lucky for you, if it climbs way above then thats bad luck. Such is life. Invest in less volatile options if it bothers you or stay clear of the cap.

Currently we are talking about only 300K people worldwide which is a very small number of people to investigate. Their wealth however is the GDP of the United States and half of Europe combined - pretty low effort for governments to secure vast amounts of funds.

Edit: since I see a lot of people got confused about this: a cap on PERSONAL wealth does not restrict companies or organisations. It is exclusively about individuals - humans. A corporation can still exist but a single person can not own 10% of its stock if its valued billions."

72,2024-07-26,CMV: Western societies would be vastly improved if a quarter of our educational curriculum was replaced entirely. ,u/ambientbreezeblock,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ecnln5/cmv_western_societies_would_be_vastly_improved_if/,changemyview,"((I am from the UK, so my specific points of reference will be to the educational system here, but I believe them to be generalisable))

In school, particularly from ages 11 to 16, students are inundated with information geared towards standardised testing, much of which is ultimately useless.
Our brains are so malleable and curious during this time, and yet we are forced to absorb and regurgitate surface-level general knowledge which is arbitrary and almost immediately forgotten afterwards. 

I am not proposing that standardised examination is entirely removed from the curriculum. However, it seems that very few children actually need to understand trigonometry, modal verbs, ancient Egyptian history, and the structure of cells. Additionally, for those that do need a more in-depth, subject-specific understanding, there are external resources, summer schools, and - in theory - an improved access to the time and expertise of teachers, if they are under less pressure to prepare students for exams. 

In place of the time, energy, and pressure of our current exam model, I believe that schools should incorporate far more wholistic and humanistic learning. Teach students how to understand and regulate their emotions, maintain their health, overcome adversity, empathise with those outside societal norms, and value themselves without succumbing to materialism or self-destructive behaviours. 
These are broad examples, but there are so many incredible thinkers in the world whose contributions are largely ignored, at the expense of us all. If we want to raise strong children, we need to teach them that they are anti fragile, capable and inherently worthy.
These lessons are far more difficult to learn and apply in adulthood; especially if they are sought out only after one's life, health or happiness is jeopardised.

The biggest objections to this idea that I can think of are the setbacks to individuals going into specialised fields, such as engineers, doctors, and physicists. This could be off-set both through more individualised learning (as previously mentioned), and with the gains accrued by raising more functional, self-aware, capable children in general. I have seen friends in university who would undoubtedly have thrived far more in their field if they were less anxious, turmoiled, or image-obsessed (myself included!). 

Current generations are developing in an increasingly confusing and precarious age. We are witnessing the first ever humans raised with constant exposure to 24 hour news cycles, personalised advertising, social media and AI. Concurrently, societies are becoming more polarised and unequal. 
I will spare you the countless statistics affirming that young people today are not thriving (unless asked specifically), but the threat that this poses to future generations and society as a whole necessitates radical change.


EDIT: Can commenters leave the country in which they were educated and how long ago they went through this stage of education (if they are comfortable doing so), please? it seems we are all coming from more disparate perspectives than I had realised. 

SECOND EDIT: You are very unlikely to change my opinion by misrepresenting me as opposing the use of a standardised, multi-disciplinary curriculum. You do not need to convince me that this is a good thing; I am arguing that some of the specificities are functionally irrelevant to the personal, psychological, and relational development of young people. 
Convince me that memorising the cosine rule is doing more to address the skyrocketing rates of loneliness, mental illness, identity struggles, polarisation, self-harm, and technological addiction in young people than allowing them to understand how life in the 21st century is screwing them up. "

I'll give a few examples:

• Speeding - it is normal for the flow of traffic on a highway to be 10-15 mph higher than the posted speed limit.

• Underage Drinking - this is rarely policed, to the point where some college bars will cater specifically to underage students with fake IDs

• Underreporting Income - tax evasion and falsifying income is expected in many industries, especially on tips and cash sales

All of these things are technically illegal, but for various reasons are not enforced  - or are enforced selectively by police. This inconsistency undermines the principle of the ""rule of law,"" causing individuals, particularly younger generations, to lose respect for legal institutions and the government. It provides a sort of ""gateway drug"" to normalize breaking laws, and discourages the application of a consistent legal standard across the board.

To address this issue, I propose that laws be revised to better align with actual behaviors and societal norms, making enforcement more consistent and predictable. For instance, speed limits should be adjusted to reflect the safe speeds at which people commonly drive and we should strictly enforce these new limits. Ideally, this would create a clearer, more transparent legal system, and reduce the discretionary (and discriminatory) power of law enforcement. Citizens will have a better understanding of and respect for legal boundaries and the consequences of crossing them."

**The Golden Age (2009-2012)**

*MW2/BO1/MW3/BO2*

I started playing COD when I was about 6 years old at my older neighbors house. I used to watch him play and would occasionally play with him and other friends when I was over.

I got pretty into it, and eventually bought it myself on my Wii. I played BO1/MW3 until 2012 when I got an Xbox 360. I remember buying all the old CODs past their prime when they were filled with hackers and such, but I still had a blast.

When BO2 released, it was a game changer for me. I remember sitting on the title screen watching the countdown and just enjoying every bit of that game for years. The campaign, multiplayer, and zombies were simply an incredible experience for me as a child.

COD has definitely never reached BO2’s peak in my time, especially after it was followed by titles like Ghosts/AW, but I do believe BO3 changed that for me.

**The End of the Road (2015)**

*BO3*

I’m someone who was never even a crazy fan of BO3, considering I switched to PS4 because of no campaign on old-gen just to play a campaign with a horrible plot. Still, the game grew on me over time.

The story in the campaign wasn’t great, but I still did love the gameplay. Even the zombies weren’t my favorite, as I found the game starting to get too easy with the gobblegum and lack of creativity with too many repeating maps from old games.

However, I still think the game was *good*. The multiplayer had the best movement I’ve ever seen in a COD game, and I loved the water mechanics, which have tended to be lackluster in every other COD title. The graphics were also amazing.

Even with all of this, nothing, and I mean nothing touches freerun for me. Freerun carried the game for me and was that perfect mode to play when you wanted to have some real fun. The leaderboards, difficulty, glitches etc. were all just great to me.

Pay-To-Win supply drops were utter garbage though, which is part of why I can’t consider this game as “great”.

Now let’s get to post-BO3.

**The Beginning of the End (2016)**

*IW/MWR*

Infinite Wafare was my least favorite COD of all-time for years. I distinctly remember that people weren’t ready for jet packs again, and were even less thrilled to find out that they had to pay the full $80 for both IW AND MWR just to play MWR. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t find either game to be that good. I think IW had a very good campaign, but that’s about it. The MP was horrendous with such a downgrade in graphics/gameplay that I barely even touched it. I didn’t care for the zombies either.

Some people try to defend the zombies by saying “Zombies in Spaceland” was a great map, but I was truly never that into it. Even if I was, I don’t think one map defines the zombies as a whole. 

I feel like MWR simply missed the mark for me. I was never that big of a fan of COD4 in the first place, and even though I did appreciate the easter eggs in the campaign/improved graphics, I still found the MP to be pretty weak.

MWR added supply drops and new weapons which I really didn’t like. I was hoping for the same exact game with better spawns, better hit- detection, and newer graphics to hopefully change my view on the game, but instead this ruined it for me.

**Sledgehammer Sucks: Part I (2017)**

*WWII*

WWII was garbage. The campaign was so predictable and on the nose that it made me cringe and roll my eyes throughout most of it. The cutscenes looked good, but the story was so bleh for me. The MP was straight dog water though.

WWII had some of the buggiest gameplay and worst gun mechanics I’ve ever seen in a COD game. The graphics were also underwhelming. I didn’t know this at the time, but poor servers/washed out graphics are the staple of SH.

I genuinely don’t remember any good moments in this game outside of crouch-sliding around in pre-game lobbies looking for the easter egg balls.

Zombies were just as tedious as the MP.

**P.S.** Bring back interactable pre-game lobbies. It’s the only thing you did right in this game.

**Treyarch’s Downfall? (2018)**

*BO4*

BO4 was a weird one because I was honestly expecting a lot from this game and was very disappointed. 

The community seemed to be happy to be back to boots-on-ground again, but this game just didn’t quite hit like the last Treyarch installments. No campaign was a huge buzzkill for me and I found the gameplay to be very dull. 

Zombies was so boring to me that I despised it. I remember getting to round 100+ on my first time ever playing it with my cousin and we eventually just quit the game out of boredom. This is nothing like the days of adrenaline pumping by round 20+ on all OG maps.

**The New Age (2019)**

*MW19*

I actually think MW19 was a decent COD and it definitely was a turning point for the franchise (not necessarily in all positive ways). Personally, I still find it difficult to consider this game “good” for a few reasons.

Firstly, the campaign had some of the best missions I’ve ever played, but it also just felt weird with some of the complete character changes in the “new universe”. I would’ve preferred an OG MW3 sequel or completely new story with new characters.

The MP had some of the best graphics I’ve ever seen in a COD game and added so much to settings to maximize your experience. However, this still doesn’t *save* the game for me.

Being forced to stay on 80 FOV (console players) on a game with huge maps that were too big for its own good and new movement felt so weird and really steered me away from this game right when the next title dropped. 

Another note on the maps: they were so poorly designed for 6v6 that it felt like Ground War at times.

I also really don’t like how they would intentionally make weapons OP, then take so long to nerf them (usually not nerf them enough). Allowing people to sit behind DOORS with a 725 shotgun nerfed 4+ times with the same firepower is beyond me. How about the AS Val shooting through unlimited walls?

Finally, making the foosteps loud with dead silence being a FIELD UPGRADE was a horrible decision and seriously ruined the pacing of an already slow game.

**Treyarch Mediocrity (2020)**

*CW*

I’m sorry, but Cold War was not that good. I also found this game to be a complete snooze fest and couldn’t find any enjoyment out of a game ran by OP snipers with maps designed specifically for them.

Campaign was good, but nothing I couldn’t write myself with enough time on my hands. Very predictable ending is all I will say.

Also, I really didn’t care for the graphics or maps in this game either. I think most of the new maps were horrible and milking the same “OG” maps has gotten old at this point. The graphics weren’t *bad*, but they just felt outdated in comparison to MW19.

I will say that CW had great movement and I miss no tac-sprint. This game also probably had the best comp scene (ranked/wagers/cdl) due to the change from 100 to 150 HP.

In regards to Zombies, I found it far too easy and didn’t care for it.

**Sledgehammer Sucks: Part II (2021)**

*VG*

Vanguard is easily the worst COD of all-time. For some reason, SH got perms to make a game again and went down the WW2 route…again to make this disaster of a title.

Campaign was so bad it’s not even funny. The amount of wokeness and horrible dialogue alone makes it hard to get through.

MP was horrific. Easily the worst servers I’ve even seen with the packet burst, ping issues, mute bug etc. Maps were horrendous, visuals were trash, and the spawns were nearly as bad as COD4 shipment logic. 

Zombies is easily the worst I’ve ever played. Easiest zombies in history and a spit in the face to any OG zombies lover.

**P.S.** Remember when the last SH title had one good feature and didn’t bring it back with interactable pre-game lobbies? They did the same thing here with pacing modes. Bring it back. I miss 4v4, 8v8, 12v12 etc. It’s the only thing you did right.

Surely this company won’t get perms to make their own game again…right?

**More IW Mediocrity (2022)**

*MWII*

This game was okay in some aspects, but still pretty bad in others.

Campaign was really disappointing and a bad look on the company playing it too safe.

Multiplayer had its up and downs. The graphics were very good and I really liked the feel of the guns/hit-detection, but the loud footsteps and field upgrades are back…like WHYYY.

This game had some good maps, but also
horrible maps that the entire community hated, and still took 4 seasons to be removed from the rotation. These particular maps also flooded lobbies, since they removed map voting (like why??) and people constantly backed out. These maps were called “Border Crossing” and “Black Gold”.

It also didn’t help that some maps were literally buildings made out of straw and you could wall bang everything.

Ranked was good on release, but got flooded with cheaters quick and instantly became unplayable.

**Sledgehammer Sucks: Part III (2023)**

*MWIII*

This game is better than WWII & VG, but still is mediocre at best. 

The campaign is so bad it’s not even funny. This may be the worst campaign of all time if it isn’t VG’s. 

MP greatly improved the movement (hybrid is cool) and perk system, but graphics were tremendously decreased. I’m not sure how SH is so bad at making their game look colorful, that even in a copy/paste DLC, it looks bad.

I think it’s important to note that I am saying this while having been on console and a TV for most CODs leading up to this point and now have an expensive PC with a monitor…the game looks bad.

Servers are still bad with packet burst/loss being adamant again, as well as the same horrible UI from MWII & constant lag in games. 

We also kept asking for some fan-favorite maps to come back and after getting basically none in MWII, they decided to give us every single OG MW2 map on release with 0 new maps (talk about laziness). Nobody wanted Derail. Yes, some new maps were great, especially for ranked/comp, but too little too late for me.

Zombies can be fun at times, but it’s still a spit in the face to OG zombies fans. It’s a mix of WZ/VG zombies, but I suppose it’s not that bad if you’re into that stuff.

**P.S.** It really bothered me that people tried to excuse SH for their mistakes and same lack of care for their player base by putting all the blame on Activison. 

Just remember, servers were at its worst, graphics were at its worst, storylines were at its worst, and zombies were at its worst under SH titles. IW/Treyarch didn’t have these same issues under Activision. I wonder why.

**The Next Step (2024)**

*BO6*

Obviously, the COD fan base has Highrise hopes for BO6, as they do for the new title every year, but I’m hesitant. 

Omnimovement sounds cool, but I’m still not gonna be a fan of a CW sequel-ish game with tac sprint implemented.

I’m also fairly certain we still won’t get Pick 10 back and they will probably keep recycling old maps.

Apparently, round-based zombies are back, but until I see an official announcement, I’m not trusting anything, especially after the false rumors about MWIII being a 2-year game.

Anyways, there’s my opinion! If you read it all, here’s a 🍪 

I am very open to having my mind changed in this, as it’s very possible I am being biased in some ways and have forgotten/false memories as a kid.

Thanks!

**Tl;dr**

• I think BO3 was a good game because of its movement, gameplay, maps, and most importantly to me, freerun (a very innovative and fun mode that I never got sick of).

• I believe games like MW19/MWIII weren’t that bad, but still have too many issues to be considered “good”, such as bad servers, tac sprint, poor weapon balancing, and weak map implementation.

• I think every other game since BO3 is simply bad or painfully mediocre due to bad similarites they face from certain developers or just bad gameplay/story overall.

Everyone just thinks they are correct due to ego, which causes most problems with traffic. Perception of right and wrong. Traffic laws vs. personal rules. Regional differences and unwritten rules. 

I think a lot of the road rage and bad driving we see comes from people being too attached to how they think traffic should flow. Everyone has a set of rules in their head and they get upset when people don’t follow them.

But here’s the thing: there is no one right way to drive. There are traffic laws, but even those are up for interpretation sometimes. Plus, traffic patterns change all the time. What works in one situation might not work in another. If you're thinking to yourself, ""But \[insert city/state\] *really* does have the worst drivers. That's your ego talking. There's a high chance some other person thinks the same thing about \[insert city/state\] 1000 miles away. Everyone can't have the worst drivers. Then no one has the worst. Instead of getting mad at people for driving differently than us, we need to be more understanding and adaptable. If someone isn’t following the unwritten rules of the road, it’s probably not because they’re a bad driver. It’s probably because they were taught differently and believe it to be correct.

The concept of the ""fast lane"" alone, should cause some pause. Scenario: You are on a two-lane highway. The speed limit is marked at 75mph. How fast are you going? If you said anything other than 75, you're a bad driver. One for breaking the law and two because you are causing issues due to ego. Why? How much over do you go? In Texas, I've heard everyone goes 15-20 mph over. In Florida, it's 10. Cutting across Mississippi go about 10 before the cops look at you funny. That alone is a problem. Everyone wants to have regional unwritten rules but those cause issues because if you don't follow them others deem it responsible to dole out justice. Back to my scenario. Two lanes. I'm doing 82 in the ""fast lane"". No one in front of me for miles but here comes a car doing 87 in the lane I am in. Who gets over? Why do they get over? If it's unsafe for you to get in the right lane at 87mph to pass me, how is it safe for me to get over at 82mph to let you pass? States have passed laws that aren't enforced unless the officer in question is actively noticing it. 

What about a wreck or construction? The great zipper merge debate. It's been studied and proven to be more efficient. However, ego gets in the way and no one wants to do it. Teach it to the next generation. Those that do use it will try to enforce it and cause more problems. Then the person who was treated to 'traffic justice' is now upset and will more than likely rage about it. 

I don't want this to seem like I have an issue with those two things. I just feel it's they are the biggest offenders. If everyone just took a deep breath and relaxed a little bit, maybe we’d have less road rage. Remember that there is a standard set of rules and laws. Rule enforcement is a tall task but I feel it falls to ego.  If you go outside of those laws because you think you're a better driver, it's your ego. You by default are the bad driver. "

States could eliminate the spring and fall time switching without federal intervention as long as they pick standard time. Currently there is no way to switch to permanent dst until a federal law is passed allowing for the change.

My first argument for switch to standard time is that it would be the fastest way for states to eliminate the time changes.

If you want the time changes to stop and you're ok with standard time please contact your state lawmakers.

My second argument is that we've tried adopting permanent Daylight Saving Time before, back in 1974. It lasted less then a year before they reverted back to the fall and spring switch. The general consensus was that people deeply disliked the late mornings and there was some evidence of an increase of children's fatalities in the early morning. 

The National PTA, National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, National School Boards Association, and Start School Later are all in favor of permanent standard time. They cite both the health benefits of circadian alignment, and the safety advantages regarding morning commutes.

Digging more deeply into the health ramifications of daylight savings time.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine, National Sleep Foundation, American College of Chest Physicians, National Safety Council, American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Canadian Sleep Society, World Sleep Society, Society for Research on Biological Rhythms, and several state sleep societies all agree we should adopt permanent standard time.

Disruptions to sleep caused by DST can impact mental health, cardiovascular health, obesity and cognitive function. 

Right after the spring time change there is 6.59 percent increase in the number of suicides and drug related deaths.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36000150/

Most people are unaware that the months with the highest rates of suicide are May, June, July and August. Because of the frequency of media attention to seasonal affect disorder people are often under the mistaken impression that mental health issues are highest in winter month, but that simply isn't true.

https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/suicides-dont-spike-around-holiday-season-americans-think-they-do

(I have a second reference to a pdf if you'd like it)

In recent years there is more research being done into circadian rhythm disorders. One prominent symptom of circadian rhythm disorders is depression and anxiety.

https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214756121#:~:text=Sleep%2C%20circadian%20rhythms%2C%20and%20mental,circadian%20disturbances%20can%20alleviate%20psychopathology

DST also has an impact on obesity. Melatonin the hormone that regulates many of our bodily functions like sleep and appetite is regulated by the sun. When we are exposed to more sunlight in the evening our bodies don't know when it is time to stop eating and people end up eating closer to when we go to sleep than is healthy for us and active digestion can make it more difficult to fall asleep.

Even the American marketing association is seeing an issue that DST causes people to make unhealthy lifestyle choices.

https://www.ama.org/press-releases/press-release-from-the-journal-of-marketing-does-the-onset-of-daylight-saving-time-lead-to-an-unhealthy-lifestyle/

Sleep disruptions also impacts cognitive function and cardio vascular health.

https://creyos.com/blog/daylight-savings-and-brain-fog

https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heres-your-wake-up-call-daylight-saving-time-may-impact-your-heart-health

And finally there is the environmental impact of dst. One of the main selling points of dst has always been a conservation of energy because people would use less lights. However, in the last 10-15 years there has been more studies done that call into question whether there are any energy savings or even an increase in energy consumption. As global temperatures increase the use of air conditioning continues to rise. While on dst the extended daylight hours means people are using their air conditioning more in the evening which increases energy consumption.

The contrast is brutal. I'm originally from Canada and currently living in Europe. I've worked and spent time in the UK, both London and Manchester itself. I also lived in Dublin, Ireland. 

I'm pretty familiar with different English accents. My favorite accent is Southern US and its variations but all in all, the General American/Canadian Accent is just beautiful. I've met many Europeans who insisted that they have a much easier time understanding the mainstream American accent than the British versions.

That being said, the Received Pronounciation accent in the UK is music to my ears. It's beautiful. But some of the accents in the UK are just too regional, sometimes pretty difficult to understand . Don't get me started on Scotish accent (no offense guys, you're a lovely bunch) but the accent (which has its origins in Gaelic) could be considered a dialect. In England itself the further north you go, the rougher the accents get. 

So here is the deal, out of all the colonies set up by the British, the accent developed in the US and Canada, has enriched English language in the most practical way. The Standard North American Accent is a blessing taken for granted. 

Unfortunately in some areas of the US a subset of newer accents is being developed, influenced by other languages. 

The Standard American/Canadian Accent should be cherished and protected. As for how it was developed, there're different theories but there's centuries behind it. 

I'll go out on a limb and insist that RP English in the UK be protected as well. 

No native English speaker should have a hard time understanding another native speaker of English, more so when dealing with the public and with other nationalities, tourists.......

Long Live Standard American/Canadian Accent !

Protect it !

There is no physical force of nature that is “time”. There is simply the present. Minutes, seconds, days, years, the past and the future, are merely abstract concepts humans have created in order to help us organize our lives as we exist in a constant state of the present. The “future” is merely an anticipated state the present will achieve, and the “past” is merely a state of presence that has died.

If this is of high level of a concept, think of this way: there is no such thing as a kilometer beyond the value of measurement humans place on it. A kilometer is not a force of nature. It is an abstract human concept.

1. To get a better view of incoming traffic, they drive and stay ON the crosswalk. So I'm forced to walk into traffic to go around them.

2. They swing right when the crosswalk light is on without checking the crosswalk since they're so preoccupied with the incoming cars.


Please, just make it so green means go for EVERYONE 

Edit:
Ok I might have worded some things badly so to clarify:
I only walk when the person appears.
When I say green means go for everyone, I mean cars.

The reason i posted this was to illustrate how much time we are wasting on this whole situation of who is going to be our ""leader"" and also touch on why having a cornerstone in government (ie. president) is a problem. Considering we have two major parties we are split in half every year pretty much and have been split into half since the civil war, we are never really unified like the name of our country tries to convey. The reds and the blues are the team colors and we love to cheer for our favorite team that represents where we are from right? This is almost feeling like a game of football or anything that is one team vs another. This too is like a form of entertainment for most Americans and if they find themselves actually acting like fans of one side it makes the other side doing the same for their team.
The future of America isn't entertainment neither is the rest of the world. Think about what happens when a coach gets fired for an affair he had off duty.
Or a preacher who turned out to be doing some heinous acts in the church. We hold these people that lead our team up to a standard that is more than a human when we are supposed to be all made equal and for the people everywhere. This analogy of the teams is a true and sad example of how blinded we are by drama and unraveling the truth of what our favorite politicians said about another or what the said they were going to do but didn't do.
Holding someone up to a standard of leadership is never going to work because we are all human right?
There for if you are digging for something wrong w someone you will find it. Things need to change in America and I am full sending this message out tr everyone that wants change in America because the same racism and power driven men that killed the nation that inhabited this land before the American people today still are using that same old money to make money off the American people by using this red vs blue diversion to keep us from becoming united as one people who are free from social and economical oppression. Think about why you are born. Was it to put all ur hopes in one man to run ur country so you and other upper middle classes can make the pay gap even worse for minorities that don't have the same opportunities as white people. Don't forget that if you don't think racism is still the main problem in this county you need to watch more police cam videos, and look at the pay gaps and education. Just because you live your quiet life in ur comfort zones doesn’t mean that u should stay quiet and watch this country go down all for the sake of one man’s ego you place on a pedestal just to look like a fool when he eventually fails. Stop being so scared of new ideas because it’s just repeating ideas every generation like father like son or daughter and mother are you not excited to see what humans can accomplish together with no restrictions or awkwardness because of your color, beliefs or party?"

Your iphone is made with cobalt mined by child labor, cocao beans for chocolate are collected by children and slaves. Why arent we boycotting these and boycotting hogwarts legacy? Its fine if you want to boycott it because you dont feel comfortable supporting someone like that but to call people who do bad people is stupid and hypocritical.

I support trans people but Im also against child labor and slavery so why is it ok for me to buy a laptop made with cobalt but not to buy a harry potter game made by a transphobe? Buying chocolate doesnt mean you support child labor and buying hogwarts legacy doesnt mean you hate trans people, it just means you’re a 40 year old millennial.

This terrible war has been going on for a long time. While I can see why Russia isn’t willing to accept a white peace, (Putin is probably afraid he would be overthrown if it ended in a white peace after so much loss, both monetarily and in human lives) 

While it is impacting Russias economy severely, I think it is a much more catastrophic situation for Ukraine, they are loosing an entire generation of working age men and women, both in war but also in the form of emigration to European countries. Sure, a lot of those will return, but if their families get settled down and get a job in much richer countries, it is not hard to imagine that a lot of people will stay. 

Perhaps an indefinite ceaseless (like in Korea) with the current land borders would suffice?

I personally think that Russia has suffered enough in this war to not want to do this again, as it definitely would not be worth it, even if they get all their claimed territory.

Granted, Putin has shown himself to be incredibly unpredictable."
0,2024-07-27,CMV: Everyone who commits suicide is mentally ill.,u/YEET9999Only,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edefiz/cmv_everyone_who_commits_suicide_is_mentally_ill/,changemyview,"So for a long time I had this belief and i think it's time to discuss it.

Wikipedia lists ""Diagnosed mental problem"" as a cause for 50% of suicides , but yet it seems like if humans are created by evolution, there should be no people who suicide , because that is highly selected to be avoided.

People who suicide and don't reproduce will not pass this behaviour to others. I know that schizophenia and other mental problems are always a part of our society and things such as eugenics dont work to remove them.

Now on the other side, we all know that every of our choices are mostly based on our subconcious. We make choices on past behaviour and on the base of what happens around us. Some conditions (such as the ones listed as ""**Precipitating circumstances**"" on wikipedia) may cause people to suicide, yet we can't diagnose them.

I know that now my view becomes on what should be classified as a disease, but wikipedia has a pathophysiology section which says ""Low levels of [brain-derived neurotrophic factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor) (BDNF) are both directly associated with suicide"". So if there was a substance (which we closely have nowdays as antidepressants) to change the brain so we can't commit suicide would that make it possible to call it a disease?

Imagine that in the future we finally understand every section of our brain, and such as medicine help cure bodily diseases, by targeting a particular enzyme or doing something to the cells, we make a medicine that inhibits certain synapses so people cant make such choice such as suicide. Would then persons who suicide be ill?

And I know about japanesse kamikaze pilots, but clearly they were influenced by what happens around them, I guess ""brainwashing""..."

0,2024-07-27,CMV: The citizens of the USA would be better off if the Republicans and Democrats split the country into two separate countries ruled by each party so that they can be content of living under only one ideology that fits their way of life.,u/Evoxrus_XV,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edf54m/cmv_the_citizens_of_the_usa_would_be_better_off/,changemyview,"I’ve been reading a lot comments about the elections both here on Reddit, YouTube and Twitter about the elections and someone needs to say this, Americans are not compatible with each other. It sounds like they are ready to go to war and kill each other. It’s getting out of hand and the only solution is to split the country in two and form two new countries based on the Republican and Democrat parties.

This solves three things.

1: Americans will feel less stressed about politics, stability and voting because they can rest comfortable that they only have to vote for one party instead of two that follows their ideas and just vote for who leads that party instead.

2: Americans will feel more cohesiveness and unity by knowing they are surrounded by people who share their ideology, promoting unity and togetherness instead of the division America is facing.

3: Violence, tension, riots and murders will decrease now that Americans can feel they do not have to fight for their way of life.

If Americans achieve unity, happiness, stability and fellowship by splitting into two a country that they know everyone shares their views and way of life, it would lead to peace, happiness and prosperity. America has been on a decline and you must face the facts, you are not compatible with each other. A country must not have multiple parties, just 1 party. I guess it’s okay to have multiple parties but you should have 1 that dominates all and wins 99% of the time otherwise it causes too much division and suffering.

Democrats and Republicans are both Americans in an unhappy marriage, it only makes sense they they divorce and go their seperate ways to be happier. The division had grown too much and staying will only lead to civil war, they need to make their own countries now there is no other option to avoid violence."

Even if a person works hard and has a defined goal, they might not reach it. 

Take these people in the following fields. Their success has been due to being in the right place at the right time, or just being born that way:

  
- Lady Gaga - born pretty and with a good signing voice

- Messi/Ronaldo - born to be athletic and in countries with a strong footballing foundation and tradition. Had they been born in India or Yemen, they would not have been as geared to be GOATs of football. 

- Pewdiepie and Mr. Beast - were raised in a culture where computers and the internet were the norm. And just happened to start channels that grew massive.

- Tim Cook - probably happened to impress Steve Jobs and work his way up to being his replacement as Apple's CEO. 

- Elon Musk - was a poor South African immigrant, but due to meeting the right people managed to be a big tech billionaire.

  
- Kate Moss - if she were born ugly, there's no way she'd even have been chosen to be a supermodel.

These are just a selection of noted people or outstanding figures in their respective fields. It's not as if Kate Moss said as a little girl ""I will become very pretty and I WILL be a supermodel!"" looks are genetic. she was born that way. There are probably people she grew up with as a teen in the UK who were as hot or hotter and never became models. Some may right now be housewives, senior or middle managers, or doing low-paid/low-skilled jobs somewhere. She just happened to be spotted at that time and place by a modelling agency rep, and the rest is history. 

So when noted people lord it over being successful, it's often due to just having the right circumstances presenting, and not due to actual dedicated goal-setting. 

People might say ""luck is when opportunity meets preparation"". Is it? often people don't actively prepare for scenarios. Sometimes, success just happens, even if a person has no intent to be mega-successful at a given thing. Most huge content creators like Pewdiepie or Mr. Beast didn't actively plan to have hundreds of millions of followers on all platforms. They have planned somewhat to be content creators or stream, but not to the extent or result they've attained. Because such mega success isn't likely. 

Let's take Messi and Ronaldo for instance. Messi isn't ugly, but Ronaldo is perhaps more extroverted and chiselled. If he were not as good-looking, which is of course genetic largely, he couldn't get even more money/fame from modelling or his looks generally. 

A person can work hard with a defined goal, but all manner of shit might affect them and not others. Favouritism, bias, systemic oppression, nepotism, accidents, foreign wars, etc. iall affect this. What if persons A and B independently invent new kinds of motor vehicles, that run on a refined plant-based oil?  But person A in a heavily patriarchal society is male and person B is female. What if person B's carriage is superior in performance, but it's ignored since she's a woman? So in the years after their invention, person B's creation has less sales attached, and she's not as wealthy or well-known as person A's. She didn't chose to be born female. Or in a patriarchal society. But then this shows how the environment and one's setting or factors beyond one's control can affect success.

If true, I don't understand how any parent could possibly think involvement to that level within an adult child could possibly help them land a job. Honestly, you're just doing your child a disservice as we all have to eventually learn how to survive on our own. Kids also need to learn how to fail as that is a learning opportunity as well.

To clarify, I'm not talking about 17-year olds getting their first job, but their first after-college ""real job"".

I'm a Millennial and I encountered some of this in college as well. I was always flabbergasted that parents of students would bug professors about their kid's grade or call campus safety to bitch about their kid's dorm room being too cold or too hot. I told my parents that this was happening at the time and they were both mortified. They wouldn't have interfered to this level and I wouldn't have wanted them to.

The goal of raising kids is to create humans that can stand on their own without this sort of ""help"" from mommy and daddy. I'm totally understanding when it comes to letting adult children live with you - the housing market sucks and rent is astronomically expensive (but that's a whole other issue). However, the type of parental involvement is a serious problem in my view.

Helicopter parenting is a failed parental methodology that needs to die a quick and painful death.

They've set back the chance for Palestinian statehood by like several decades. 

But the PLO, back when they were an active organization, burned down so many bridges. First, the PLO/PFLP fought with the Jordanian monarchy in Jordan. This led to the expulsion of the PLO. 

There are still millions of Palestinians who live in Jordan but they are treated as second-class citizens and I imagine it's largely because the monarchy is afraid of losing power since Black September. 

After that, the PLO's new base became Lebanon and the Cairo Agreement of 1969 allowed them to carry out operations against Israel. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Agreement_(1969)#:~:text=The%20agreement%20established%20principles%20under,regulated%20by%20the%20Lebanese%20authorities. 

Many Lebanese Christians were sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians until the PLO started forming a state within a state. The PLO's actions made Palestinian civilians become a target of Maronite Christian militias and led to horrific massacres like the Sabra and Chatila incident. Today, Palestinians in Lebanon all live in camps that are rife with violence between the various factions. 

Finally, Kuwait was home to half a million Palestinians. They were actually pretty well-educated and most of them were teachers. The logical choice for the PLO would've been to support Kuwait over Saddam, but I am guessing Arafat thought no one was going to intervene. Arafat's decision to side with Saddam led to the majority of Palestinian workers returning to Jordan."

0,2024-07-27,CMV: Love is an addiction like any other addiction and should be taken more seriously,u/NewFoot762,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edjypm/cmv_love_is_an_addiction_like_any_other_addiction/,changemyview,"Because our feelings and behaviour are like those of an addict, one can consider love as another form of addiction. Because when people fall in love, their brain starts releasing chemicals that make them *feel* good (dopamine & oxytocin) – not unlike drugs. The release of all these chemicals makes the individual feel an intense need to be with that person and may even drive them to obsessive and compulsive behaviors, making the effects comparable to how addicts treat their substance. A breakup often generates such emotional misery that the person suffers from symptoms of withdrawal for a long time. The in-love person will ignore other important areas of their life (such as work, friends) to hang out with the beloved just like an addict plans everything else around when they can consume. Like couples in long-term relationships looking for new ways to relight the flame from the old fire, seeking merely a different experience with yet another high and who will eventually push their dosage or snoot more before they attain that initial passion. This is an example of tolerance and escalation, where greater amounts become necessary in order to reach the same level of satisfaction. Love can cause a psychological addiction such as maintaining the idea that they will never be called to really feel, capable of being happy without their partners and acting on impulse until all it ends is pain. Like addiction, this need is an enslaving dependency. The desire for an ex-partner after breaking up is like a relapse in addiction recovery, which highlights the seemingly endless circle between love and substance abuse. Imaging studies showed strikingly similar patterns of brain activation when people experience the fervor of romantic love or become high on drugs. When taken together, they literally persuade that love and addiction ride neural pathways. Furthermore, due to the nature of this type of poetry and discourse, references to love as an addiction occupy our cultural consciousness. The days of romance are filled with the violent, often irrational things fueled by passion — which help sayings like “madly in love” and “love-sick” force. This has been compared to the destructive qualities of addiction; both are consuming, and neither makes life standing on wobbly foundations any easier.

He literally tells Joshua — when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down — go and kill everything that could walk or crawl within that city: Man, women, child and beast. 

He then tells the Israelites to go on a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the land of Canaan because it’s their land, he gave them, and the people within it are so sinful, so evil, so debased, that they’re not worth saving. At least that’s how the Israelites interpreted it. The problem is we’re relying on a book written thousands of years ago to somehow reflect the morals of the 21st-century.

The fact of the matter is the Old Testament, and the New Testament to a lesser extent, has plenty of material within it that can be used to justify war crimes. We may not like it but it’s there. The same way that Muslims could — if they searched hard enough — find justifications for taking sex slaves during a “just war” against nonbelievers in the Quran.

0,2024-07-27,CMV: feminists should focus less on social role theory as it supports their argument less than other theories,u/mr-obvious-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edl5v0/cmv_feminists_should_focus_less_on_social_role/,changemyview,"
Social role theory describes something like the blank slate, things like gender roles are societal and has nearly no biological basis...

Other theories put more emphasis on things being biological 

Social role theory isn't supported well in research, those are some examples:

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10690727221148717#:~:text=Male%20adolescents%20have%20higher%20interests,inequality%20ratings%2C%20or%20scale%20type.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8791526/

When I read research in psychology, I see social role theory defended as if it is good for feminism.
 
Of course, theories linked to evolutionary psychology could be used for those arguing for patriarchy, but I think social role theory is even worse for feminism

My argument:

Well, even proponents of social role theory will at least acknowledge the big sex differences in strength(95% of men being stronger than 90% of women) and the sexual dimorphism in pregnancy and breastfeeding being biological in nature

Even if we agree to accept that most other things are totally societal, proponents of patriarchy could use those two big and clear sex differences to order society around them.

Meaning one can argue that men and women should be socialized to build society around those sex differences, for example: women should be socialized to find the most happiness in being with children and caring for them (as they breastfeed anyway) and men should be socialized to work outside home.

Worry about men abusing women and women not being able to escape, that could be solved if we assume abuse is purely because of socialization, so boys should be raised to appreciate whatever their wives are socialized to do and to never abuse them and women to never abuse men too.
This worry can be solved in another manner by making the society accommodate for those abused in someway whether they have financial ability or not.

Also, evidence showing financial independence of women reduces abuse isn't strong, this is one study showing a correlation in the opposite direction:
https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/25/6/1105/2467225

But as I said, if we accept socialization being the reason for abuse, then we can just socialize boys not to be.

Another benefit to this socialization for absolute gender roles is that equality between households will increase. As we know, similar minded people tend to partner  (Assortative mating in psychology)  , so if we have a couple with two very intelligent man and woman and another with two not so intelligent man and woman, the inequality between the two couples will be higher if both the husband and wife have jobs.

Now, for other theories that take biology as a main thing, they aren't as bad for feminism as social role theory because although they say sex differences in psychology, behaviour and interests have an important biological component, they still acknowledge variability inside the sexes, so they acknowledge that some girls could be biologically predisposed to behave like boys or like the things boys like.

This is basically like the talk about homosexuals, is it the way you are born or is it the environment?
For those who say it is biological, at least they can argue they have no control over this, but if you argue it is societal and it is the environment, then people might try to argue that we should see what environments predispose to that and get rid of them.

Feminists will explain the anti-suffragates being more than the suffragates by saying that it is due to those women being socialized to like patriarchy, but if this is true, then socialization by patriarchy is pretty strong for it to make the vast majority of women like it, and if this is true, then why not do it?

I think the biggest argument against this is people mentioning the importance of financial independence for women, but is this proven to be beneficial for women or their children?

https://www.sole-jole.org/assets/docs/16140.pdf

This study shows that increase in women's employment slightly increases child poverty 

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-009-0257-4

And this one also contradict the narrative that financial independence is important 

The problem is that most papers on this matter is correlational in design and doesn't prove causality"

0,2024-07-27,CMV: Democracy is inevitably a doomed form of government,u/Atomic_Fire,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ednmbg/cmv_democracy_is_inevitably_a_doomed_form_of/,changemyview,"Democracy is inherently doomed in any plausible form. In its modern western form, it's a relatively recent thing, with most of these governments having only existed for 100 years or so. 

Any kind of democratic government follows the main principle of representation. Elected officials typically with limited terms represent the interests of the citizens. This is typically done through regular, free, and fair elections where citizens vote for their representatives as well as potential laws. Everyone has rights and democratic governments typically have a system of checks and balances with a legislative body for creating laws, an executive body for enforcing them, and a judiciary for interpreting them.

Here's my argument:

- Regular people are stupid and extremely vulnerable to manipulation. This leads to populist leaders and demagogues gaining significant traction and inefficient laws being passed. Media misinformation can easily direct voters at the wrong issues. Those with the financial means to reach more ears are more likely to win elections and pass laws, so laws favor them.
- All democracies experience partisanship. Too much partisan polarization leads to no party willing to compromise and complete government gridlock where nothing gets done and, for instance, any new public works project needs 3 committees to review it for 10 years before it's approved.
- Inherent weakness. Elected officials have limited terms, and so for most of their term they often are concerned only with getting re-elected. You'd think this means they want what's best for their constituents, but this just means they work only on a timeline of however long the term limit is, even if true positive change takes longer, because again, average voters are stupid and want change NOW. This also often leads to corruption, especially if elected positions aren't compensated particularly well.
- Crisis management. The nature of having to debate and reach consensus on all issues means democracies can be slow to respond to pressing issues like natural disasters or economic downturns.

All these together means any democracy will inevitably experience increasing inequality and partisanship until a crisis happens that it cannot respond to effectively. A populist leader comes in and promises change and effectively ends democracy once in power or a powerful enough other group outright commits a coup against the ineffective government."

That’s just family right? We learn to live with it. But when Trump’s permanently-grumpy running mate called childless women “cat ladies” , I thought: this type of behaviour needs to stop.

I don’t have anything against having children. If that’s part of your journey in life, then I wish you well. Maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life, and if so, I’m happy for you.

However, in my personal observation, many more people are less happy than when they were childless. And many more people regret having children than not having children.

So a lot of people, especially my age, are realizing that beyond economic limitations, we just aren’t interested in having children because we’d be less happy if we did. I, for one, would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games.

And I don’t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn’t harm anyone else.

So if you’re someone who thinks there’s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called “cat ladies” for having them, I’m happy to discuss."

As someone who spent some time studying the topic in my own, and drawing my own conclusions not just listening to what a professor tells me. It is very clear that slavery was not the main concern of the North, I would even go as far and say they really couldn’t give less of a fuck. 

The reason the ACW happened was due to a number of factors above slavery in the pecking order: The unions refusal to acknowledge the rights of the state, deals regarding border security issues, addressing Indian encroachment on southern states, unfair and biased taxation, unions refusal to give up Fort Wayne, and the biggest one of all to stop the South from succeeding and braking off into their own country. I will admit that yes the issue of slavery was the straw that broke the camels back, the war did not happen solely because of it.  

The only reason the North and Abraham Lincoln, decided to outlaw slavery was because their was simply no longer a need for it. Due to the technological advances that had been made that was more cost efficient and effective than owning slaves. Another argument in my favor is that we know that only about 1%-3% of southerners even owned any slaves to begin with. So if the ACW was about slavery why on earth would they risk their livelihood to fight for something that did not even benefit them?

I hate the idea that Abraham Lincoln has turned into some sort of hero for African Americans. (Despite being a racist himself) Or that the white men in the Union were some brave soldiers who put their life in the line for the good of African Slaves. It’s all complete BS and just white savior propaganda.

0,2024-07-27,"CMV: The childless care *more* about the future than parents, not *less*",u/ShortUsername01,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edrm8j/cmv_the_childless_care_more_about_the_future_than/,changemyview,"In 2006, debates over the idea of abolishing child tax credits and/or restricting procreation seemed to range from “people are so bad for the environment, we need to rein in their numbers by any means necessary” to “no, that’s wrong no matter what. Besides, you wouldn’t know what it’s like to want kids.”

Gradually, the narrative shifted to pronatalists trying to pretend they’re doing society a favour by reducing “demographic collapse.” Funny how you didn’t hear that talking point much in ‘06. On top of that, pronatalists tend to ask people concerned about high birth rates’ environmental impact to off themselves. That alone tells you a lot about the sort of person a philosophy like pronatalism attracts.

So either pronatalists were telling the truth the first time, in which case breeding is just an emotional indulgence at mother Earth’s expense and only the right to procreation held back doing anything about it, or they were telling the truth the second time, in which case they have little credibility left for not stating their real beliefs the first time. Furthermore, in the latter case, their “real beliefs” correlate with the aforementioned requests made towards those concerned of the environmental impact, which shows you how dark a side of human nature pronatalism appeals to.

So when I hear the likes of J D Vance claim parents have more emotional stake in the future than the childless, I think he gets it backwards at best. They are turning down an emotional indulgence pronatalists themselves once claimed the childless couldn’t comprehend. And the end result is fewer people, meaning less pollution, and more natural resources per person. The only downside, supposedly, is that in order to keep a steady supply of workers, we have to import immigrants.

And this is only a downside according to the same group of people who, for the most part, ask people concerned about the environmental impact of “too many people” to off themselves. This is who you’re siding with if you call that a downside.

Childlessness is a virtue. Some people might be childless for selfish reasons; I’m one of them; but in and of itself it is a virtue and I would presume it for the most part attracts people more virtuous than myself, much less the sort of people who, by breeding, forsake the environment and in the process do exactly what pronatalists, with their aforementioned awful philosophy, want them to do.

And if someone is ignorant enough to genuinely think they’re doing society a favour by breeding, what good is having “skin in the game” if the worldview through which you protect your kids is steeped in ignorance?"

0,2024-07-27,CMV: Most men just want sex and not a relationship if given the choice,u/spit_on_a_dog,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eduy30/cmv_most_men_just_want_sex_and_not_a_relationship/,changemyview,"I think most men are just in relationships because it's the best that they can do because most men are not able to have sex with beautiful women whenever they want (oops maybe that's why there's a huge market for prostitution).

I think that at least 90% of men would prefer to have sex with different women for the rest of their life instead of trying to find a ""soulmate"" or whatever story they tell themselves to get rid of the cognitive dissonance. I'm not saying that most men wouldn't prefer to have that soulmate but if given the option to only have one of those they would choose the sex with women thing because they understand how almost impossible it is to find a soulmate.

It's the opposite of what most women would choose hence all the drama between the genders. 

When you look at the gay community and how much crazy sex action is going on there it shows what men actually crave. There's not nearly as much of that stuff going on in the lesbian or straight community. It shows what men actually want most. 

It's not like because you're straight suddenly you have no desire for orgies and multiple sex partners anymore. It's just that as a regular straight dude you just don't have the option. 

My point is that many hetero relationships wouldn't even exist if not mainly motivated by male lust (at least up to a certain age before the desire for partnership takes over at maybe around 50 - 60, but even in that case most men would choose the sex with multiple women thing instead of an old nagging witch (exaggerating for comical effect :))

So basically most relationships are completely mismatched in the actual desires. Hence all the drama because men just pursue it to at least get some action on a ""best I can do"" basis. Somehow both sides, male and female, cannot accept that fact and try to make it work somehow which is obviously not going very well most of the time.

It is a basic biological difference between men and women. That's why it's so frustrating for women to be dating and for men to be sexually fulfilled. Yet we still hold on to this idea of a soulmate or partner for life (basically lying to ourselves) instead of just trying to find fulfillment in some other way. I'm pretty sure this pursuit of partnership is a total net negative generally speaking for both sides.

I think that if we would create humanoid sex robots 90% of men would be removed from the dating pool and we would finally accept this basic difference. The amount of relationships would be removed by at least 90% which makes total sense since only a maximum of 10% of relationships where ever actually a happy relationship that are based on connection."

583,2024-07-27,CMV: cultural appropriation seems to be a concept that's not really used outside of USA and i think it also doesn't make much sense,u/Own_Wave_1677,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edv9v0/cmv_cultural_appropriation_seems_to_be_a_concept/,changemyview,"I'm not completely sure if this is one issue or two separate issues. Anyway, it seems to me that pretty much only americans (as in, from the USA, not the continent) tend to use the concept of cultural appropriation and complain about it. I don't think i have ever heard the term IRL where i live (Italy) and at the same time it seems like on the internet i never see it used from other europeans or asians. The example that triggered this post was a comment exchange i saw online that was pretty much

A: pizza is american  
B: don't appropriate my culture

I immediately thought that B was not italian, but an american of italian descent. I sent the screenshot to a friend and he immediately agreed.  
I can't be sure if i never hear this term bacause of the bubble i live in or if it really is almost exclusively a thing for americans, so i thought to ask the opinion of people from all over the world.

Apart from this, the concept of cultural appropriation doesn't make sense to me. I'll copy the first paragraph from wikipedia just to make sure we are discussing about the term properly.

>

You don't own a culture. You don't own dance steps, music, etc. The union of all of these things makes a culture, but if someone sees your haircut that has cultural origins, likes it an copies it, it's not like you can stop them. The paragraph i copied says ""against the wishes of the members of the originating culture"" and that's really strange to me, like why should anyone be able to comment on you getting the same haircut?

Off the top of my head two things that were deemed cultural appropriation were twerking and dreamcatchers, just to make a couple of examples. Iirc twerking was used mainly by black people and then became a trend for white housewives and this was considered disrespectful. Again, how do you say to someone that they can't do that type of dance. For dreamcatchers, there was a reddit post with a white person that liked native american dreamcatchers so he just made some and put them up in his room and the comments were flooded with people saying that it was cultural appropriation. Again, you can't really stop people from making the handicrafts they want.

I also don't see why this would annoy anyone. If they are copying your dreamcatchers it means they find them beautiful and that's a good thing, isn't it? Same for the twerking. I feel like for most people from around the world the reactions would go from being honored to laughing at the copycats doing something nonsensical, but pretty much the only ones being angry about cultural appropriation are americans, maybe because of how important race issues are there?

There are cases where culture is copied with the explicit intent of mocking it, in that case it is obviously fine to get angry, but that's not what cultural appropriation refers to usually.

P.S. i'm pretty sure saying pizza is american isn't even cultural appropriation, just someone being wrong about something, but i didn't point it out earlier because that wasn't the interesting thing about that exchange."

Not even in bigger cities where they settled all over. That experience for women is horrible being harrased, and for men too. And its never just one of them, they are always in packs.


Uneployment is astronomical as they prefer social welfare and have 5+ children and refuse to assimilate. Statistics show that they are the worst refugees that exist and nobody can lie to them selves otherwise. Ukrainans in Sweden hade adopted to the country better in 2 years than Arabs and Africans have in 30 years. And they are rather regressing than progressing. Turning Sweden from the safest country in the world to the capital of crime, bombing, shootings, ISIS recruting & rape.

They provide absolute zero for progression to humanity. Technology, economy, medicine, human rights. On the contrary, the world has to donate everything to them for free because they cant keep being alive without Europe and America. Which is kind of funny, because they hate the west and everything it stands for but still migrate there and try to change the country to be more like home, which they left because its hell on earth for a good reason.

In summary, the vast majority of them dont do anything good to the world and would not be missed in any way. And all the suffering they cause in Europe and America would be gone. Crime, drugs, rape, stealing, social welfare, bullying and so on. I dont feel anything like this for any nationality/race and a lot of people in Europe. All other groups contribute to society by working, respecting human rights and not being criminals and violent.

The person is actually guilty and has not shown remorse from what I've read (he admitted it but said he doesn't believe what he did was wrong initially though later changed his chance). And only served a year in prison (despite him not only admitting to it and being convicted but also showing little to no remorse initially)

Reasons why it's unethical 

Recidivism) while one could say that he's not at a risk of recidivism i suppose. But one could alternatively argue since sexual crimes are underreported , the statistics on this are not reliable and that one child that could have been saved is one child too many 


Deterrence) one could argue that allowing this to happen emboldens other potential or actual sexual abusers that they can live their life happily without consequences for doing such things 

 Retribution) one could argue that by allowing this to happen , the victims would be re victimised and so would countless other victims.  And re traumatised 

Rehabilitation) this mostly benefits the perpetrator but I guess rehabilitation is achieved ? Assuming it's the only goal of punishment. Which isn't true anywhere 


Overall it seems very unethical. 

People Might argue that he served his time but that doesn't mean he is excluded by social consequences. There's no country in the world that shields ex criminals from social and non state consequences of their actions. It's mostly states can't retroactively punish. 


By shielding perpetrator from non state social consequences would only cause chaos and less people would see the state as legitimate. "

Just stumbled across a post where a little person (Idk the proper name) got limb lengthening surgery and everyone was congratulating her.

I find it a bit amusing that the people I see criticizing it are usually very liberal/left women but maybe that's just cause those are the people around me.

I don't see any problem with the surgery at all. While it's relatively new, it seems to work as intended and will only improve as more data is collected. To me it's not different than something like braces.

For those who are against it, please explain why?

*Note that it’s 1:42AM in my time zone so I may not respond to everyone until the morning, hopefully that’s ok with the mods.*

I just watched a video from a war influencer (god, 2024 is cursed…) who laid out some basic info. I recommend you watch it first, it’s very short and to the point: 

The specific city is [Majdal Shams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams)

> The inhabitants of Majdal Shams are considered Syrian citizens by the Syrian authorities. Since 1981 they have also been considered permanent residents of Israel. While they are entitled to full Israeli citizenship, as of 2011 only 10 percent of the Golan Druze had opted to become Israeli citizens. However, the number of Druze who took Israeli citizenship jumped to over 20% by 2018 and is still rising. 
> 
> Those who apply for Israeli citizenship are entitled to vote, run for Knesset and receive an Israeli passport. For foreign travel, non-citizens are issued a laissez passer by the Israeli authorities. As Israel does not recognize their Syrian citizenship, they are defined in Israeli records as “residents of the Golan Heights.” 
> 
> Residents of Majdal Shams are not drafted by the Israel Defense Forces.

Here’s a (potentially American-biased?) map of skirmishes: https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/mapping-clashes-along-israel-lebanon-border

It clearly shows that Majdal Shams is so far untouched in this war, other than regular drone and rocket attacks on an IDF base outside town to the north called [“Ma’ale Golani”](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T3XmHH3JPvaTmoAk7). I do suppose it’s *possible* they were targeting the base and something went extremely wrong - I can’t really find accuracy info on their [Katyusha rockets](https://missilethreat.csis.org/country/hezbollahs-rocket-arsenal/), but common sense says it’s possible they over-aimed and hit the city directly behind the base. Any experts able to weigh in?


Another slight possibility, IMO, is a smaller splinter organization doing something dumb, as they sometimes do (throwback to the Hamas collaborators that blew up a packed Gazan building on accident early in the conflict). What possible reason could Hezbollah and co. have to change tactics now and target occupied Syrians…? From the link above:

> To minimize the risks of full-scale war, Hezbollah has simultaneously been playing a calculated and coordinated game of plausible deniability, often allowing other groups to launch rockets against Israel from south Lebanon

**IMO parsimony agrees with this guy; seems like an awfully convenient development for Netanyahu’s regime in particular.** It’s at a perfect time to save his troubled image, it’s on occupied peoples rather than “”true”” Israeli citizens, and it’s such a remote inland location that US warships might not be able to monitor it directly. Just check out what AP [says about it](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-golan-kfar-kila-141600af654f48f733b33f9f0a26dbfe): 

> Israel blamed Hezbollah for the strike in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, but Hezbollah rushed to deny any role. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Hezbollah “will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far.”
>
> “There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Channel 12. “We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war.”
>
> Hezbollah chief spokesman Mohammed Afif told The Associated Press that the group “categorically denies carrying out an attack on Majdal Shams.” It is unusual for Hezbollah to deny an attack.

That’s absurdly damning, in light of this accusation. How often do they use such insanely war-bound rhetoric against Hezbollah, and right out of the gate at that? I guess Netanyahu gets to muse off the hip, but presumably the foreign minister had to consult with lots of people before saying something so brazen.

0,2024-07-28,CMV: Keynesian Economics just doesn't work,u/brandygang,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ee37ec/cmv_keynesian_economics_just_doesnt_work/,changemyview,"The central idea of Keynesian Economics is unlimited monetary and societal growth. Say we have a tribe selling flour, sugar, strawberries, eggs and milk for 1$ each, and we give 100 people 1$ each to buy one. Then as society advances someone discovers a way to put them together, and now we have Cake- Cake costs 10$ in ingredients to make but is deemed at 25$, because it's worth more. Additionally the other ingredients get more expensive because they have more value. However everyone only has 1$- to keep up with the rise in value, the tribal leaders allow some inflation to occur by pouring money into their tribe. More people are born, more ingredients are found which devalues them, so more inflation is needed. In the future more advanced and tastier cakes may require upping the price too in a higher population with more goods and more money.

This idea of growth is central to Keynesian Economics.

The problem is in reality it doesn't actually happen. Let's say for instance, people were starting to put together they can make more money by letting a few, cheaper ingredients go rotten and sell what amounts to shit, while demanding higher prices. They make more money while putting in less Worth- inflation happens but the worth of both money and product goes down, this is bad for everyone except the one exploiting the product. 

There's another issue at hand, in that the cake maker, who owns shops and distribution as the richest in the tribe can keep the prices of ingredients and transactions constant with their value- An egg will always be 1% profit with them, they may raise inflation to make more money but they'll keep constant profits.

This doesn't happen with the consumer because their money is worth less, and they're not getting more worth or value. They have no control over the prices, and their payments and wage will not increase either- they're still given 1$ after years while that egg has quadrupled in price, and only the one selling it reaps the profits.

The Inflation benefits the top wealthiest people and seller disproportionately, as a more insidious form of trickle down economics.

This is why Keynesian Economics just doesn't work in the long-run. More money is pumped into the economy to try to force spending, but transactionally the suppliers and property owners reap the benefit while the consumer gets fucked over. We see this corruption on every level of infrastructure, from consumer goods to construction jobs and public housing. Inflation forces people to buy worse quality goods, spend more on things, and the cycle continues and creates a growing wealth gap. Innovations happen, but the benefits of innovation in economic terms will never match the benefits for society at large because it's not enough to keep up with the inflation or the economic growth, and the monetary value of those innovations will never reach the consumer in the big picture. We see this right now with the rise of AI which might revolutionary every industry and earn them record-breaking profits with cost cutting and job replacements, but that innovation is a net negative for employees and not-an-economic boon for consumers.

In a capitalist society the economy cannot grow, because the growth of a capitalist economy is measured in transactions, not goods, services and quality of life. The only growth that happens is artificial- we might see GDP rise and Annual salary rise but 90% of this is because of the law of averages at the top, the quality of life for the average person goes down. This means that if we take our cake, and multiply it a thousandfold (Inflation!), but give the crumbs to the layman at higher costs, while the rest gets swallowed up by the Cake Provider.

You might be asking yourself, how do the top even get away with this inflation while the bottom gets fucking fucked over? The answer is central banks. Monetary Control is achieved by control of the Central Bank, not Government. We can see this clearly in the recent events of the US and UK. If we look at government and control, we have Keynesian economics and neoliberal (But not Left-wing) ideas. But if we look at central banks we have control of monetary policy to keep inflation and transactions at a rate which is profitable for the seller but also doesn't stagnate growth.

The only solution in my opinion would be some form of Socialism or drastic economic reassessment that does not involve simply pumping more money into the economy that, like Trickledown economic scams, does not actually reach the average person ever."

Imagine a growing person with broad nose whose adapted to breathing warm tropical air, gets moved to Russia where the air is dry and cold, obviously it won't workout, the immigrant will suffer from breathing issue which would consequently lead to bad facial development (mouth breathing). 

With bad facial aesthetic, it will be harder for the immigrant to find dating success in foreign land, thus decreasing their chance to pass on their gene. 

Not only does immigration pose a health concern, it also poses a social issue. 

Immigration also impact natives negatively by disrupting the economy, increasing inflation, causing more difficulty in finding jobs. More population also means extreme competition in all areas, dating, jobs, etc. 

To conclude, immigration is unethical for the immigrant as well as te natives. One should not settle down in lands they dont belong to (genetically, culturally) however vacations are fine. "
2,2024-07-28,cmv: Adults can be groomed,u/vaults_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ee4jyj/cmv_adults_can_be_groomed/,changemyview,"I've seen people say that adults cannot be groomed and that only a child can. I disagree with this and here's why.

For one, I think it's important to establish that grooming doesn't just mean sexual abuse. The definition of grooming is ""the practice of preparing or training someone for a particular purpose or activity."" I hate that this is my only example, but the Star Wars prequel movies are the story of Palpatine grooming Anakin to be his apprentice. But notice what was missing in that definition? Any mention of a child.

That's because what I think is the most important aspect of grooming is power. Having power over someone is a gateway into being able to groom someone. This can be a parental figure, a boss, even a therapist or doctor. It's about the 2 parties not being entirely equal and the party in power abusing that power for their own malicious benefit.

The reason why it's often related to kids is because kids are more likely to be in a power dynamic with someone than an adult, and are also more likely to be vulnerable. Generally for most adults, those 2 aspects aren't as common as they are for kids. However it isn't impossible for an adult to be in a vulnerable position and to be able to be abused by someone who has power. I think that only using grooming for situations where kids are involved is an oversimplification of what grooming means, and also unintentionally undersells an adult victim of grooming."

In short, the hotter a woman is, the worse her character. 

due to being spoilt and conditioned by society and family, they don't develop a good character and are loathsome to be around apart from for sex.

they are bad co-workers, as in being unhelpful and doing the bare minimum.

they are loud and in your face and ""demand"" being the centre of attention.

they are bullies and try their best to keep people down based on THEIR standards of life.

They are terse and nasty but get away with it because they are encouraged by people who pander to them based on their looks.

they aren't good managers in the workplace, since they cannot relate to people, be professional, or just do a JOB. 

they are shallow, nasty, and unscrupulous, and get away with it due to being pandered to their looks. 

so it's best to ignore them, since there is more to life than sex, and they are sensitive and they cannot handle it if others aren't enamoured by them. they never realised that nobody HAS to care about them, and they apparently lack basic mental thinking or filters. i guess its a lifetime of being spoilt that causes this.

I think patriarchy theory overlooks a lot of power and privilege that women have in society, and it's possibly overextended. Now that we live in ""female empowered"" society, we can reference what life looks like when women have more power. IMO: while patriarchy correctly points out the power and privilege men have regarding laws and social hierarchy, it completely overlooks the power and privilege women have over reproduction and child upbringing. This is constantly downplayed in modern society. For example: we say that motherhood is effort, responsibility, risk and disproportionately effects women. While having sex is ""easier"" for men what is being overlooked here is that reproductive access for men is contingent on him being a successful individual which would have required effort, responsibility, and risk.

Reproduction and child upbringing give leverage over men because men aren't ""equipped"" to raise kids and reproduction is a biological need for men. Women are more valuable and are typically protected in society. Women have more genetic selection options. Women can extract resources out of men. I think it's kinda funny that we complain about the pay gap but women represent something like 70% to 80% of all consumer spending... Where is the money coming from? Child custody favorablility towards women. Marriage, which reduced financial risk of divorces in single income households and disproportionately benefits women. Women have historically controlled what children think including feminist ideology which inevitably influences the laws that are created. etc...

A part of me hates this topic because it requires you to play the ""oppression Olympics."" Also this isn't motivated by sexism or misogyny. I believe in sexual dimorphism and that men and women have evolved to compliment each other, not argue over are differences."

We are living in a time where both sides of the political spectrum operate off completely different sets of facts, creating two entirely different realities. This divide is not only unhealthy but also dangerous for our nation's future.

Each side wholeheartedly believes in their candidate and is convinced that the opposing candidate is a liar and a threat to the country. The rhetoric from both sides has become increasingly hostile, with claims that political opposition to Trump signifies the end of democracy, or that voting for Harris will lead to the destruction of the country. On the other side, there are those who believe that Trump is saving the country from ruin. This kind of polarized thinking is tearing us apart.

Because both sides are entrenched in their own versions of reality, they cannot find middle ground or compromise. Instead, one side is often seen as completely evil while the other is seen as wholly good. This black-and-white thinking is wrong and prevents meaningful dialogue. It is also unacceptable that politics has shifted away from policy discussions and has become a battleground of creating and spreading lies about the opposition.

The media plays a significant role in this problem. Both liberal and conservative media outlets systematically and deliberately try to influence the public's views, often presenting opinions as facts. This manipulation undermines the American public's ability to make informed decisions and fosters further division.

In sum, the current state of political discourse is not sustainable. It is eroding the foundation of our democracy by creating an environment where dialogue and compromise are replaced by hostility and misinformation. For the sake of our society, we need to find a way to bridge this divide and restore a more constructive and honest political discourse.

Because it’s incredibly easy to get a gun. All you can do is simply be of age, not have a criminal record or a (diagnosed) mental disorder walk in and purchase a gun. Now boom you can drive into a school and start shooting people.

Here’s what I propose.

1. First, you need to obtain a license to even purchase on in the first place and in order to get one you have to read a handbook on gun safety.
2. After reading and studying the handbook, you’ll have to take a test. You must get 100% to pass the test and you have to be in a strictly monitored and controlled test room. 
3. After you take the written test, you have to take classes on how to use and aim firearms and you must pass the aim practice test.
4. Finally, you need to be psychologically evaluated and if you have any mental disorder or are mentally ill, you are barred from obtaining a firearm.
5. If you get through all of that, you will obtain a license and you will then be allowed to purchase a gun

These things I’ve written down will reduce the problem in my opinion because most school shooters wouldn’t go through all of that and would lose motivation by the time they get their license.

Some of them are even longer than Macbeth and the US Bill of Rights!

But here's the thing - these are legal documents that spell out what companies can do with our info. It's pretty wild that we've gotten so used to our data being accessed and sold that we're just clicking ""I agree"" without a second thought.

Some of the stuff hidden in these agreements is pretty intense:

You might have to legally defend the company if someone sues them over your content

They can delete your account or stuff you've posted whenever they want, no explanation needed

They might be tracking you even if you think you've turned that off

They can collect all sorts of data about you - IP address, browser type, what pages you visit, what you search for, etc.

They can share your content with other companies and use it however they want

You're giving up some of your rights to your own work

The service could shut down at any time

They can use your personal info for ads

Your data could end up stored anywhere in the world

Crazy thing is, all of this is in Reddit's ToS. Another example is OpenAI's change in ToS. It was a hot topic from, I think, way back in March 2023, thanks to a Reddit thread that I read and Reddit emailing/notifying me about the topic.

If you're worried about keeping up with changes to these agreements, you could use tools like [~Visualping~](https://visualping.io/) or Distill IO to monitor for updates. And if reading the whole thing sounds like torture, there are ways to get the gist—you could use ChatGPT, Bing AI, Perplexity, or Terms of Service; Didn't Read (ToS;DR), or other summarizers.

0,2024-07-28,CMV: Asian guys in the USA must live in or travel in large cities (1 M+ pop. may include tourists) to have any dating life,u/beatfungus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eebn3i/cmv_asian_guys_in_the_usa_must_live_in_or_travel/,changemyview,"This one hits close to home but I’m finally in a good headspace to tackle it. My view on this was gained through the simplest, yet poignant lens: personal experience. During high school and college, I never once went on an actual date or hooked up with anyone, and not for lack of trying. I had normal conversations with girls, met for coffee, then got ghosted about 10-15 times throughout college. Dating apps were comical. If you’re a guy in a non-metropolis, (maybe even girls and the general public know this too by know), you know that dating apps for guys is a demoralizing experience of 0 matches for consecutive weeks while the girls get 99+ matches and exhausted in the other direction. It’s no secret that Asian guys somehow got stuck with negative stereotypes on their sexuality. A crock of propaganda shit brought on by other race’s insecurities for sure, but with the advent of Japanese culture, kpop, and more asian males getting cast in movies/TV, I do think now is better than even 10 years ago.

Once I graduated and moved to Sacramento, the dating apps were still unkind, but I was able to at least meet girls more regularly in person.

Now I hit New York City and Sydney three years later. It’s like I’ve stepped into an alternate universe. I actually feel desired. I feel the need to be somewhat picky. 

I recognize possible confounds of course. The first is that I grew up. I never peaked in high school or college and I’m still nowhere near a peak at 27. A 19 year old nerd is probably less attractive than a late 20s guy who is better styled and less afraid of everything. The second is that I got richer, both in absolute terms and career potential. I went from broke college student to $200k net worth at 25. I never lead with this though, because I don’t want to attract with my money, but I’ll acknowledge that I might come across as mentally more confident knowing I have personal security. The third is my own mom getting divorced when I was 2 and not dating any non-white guys except one time, then marrying a white guy when I was 18 (my mom never made bad choices before and this is an amazing husband for sure). The fourth is my age group. I can’t speak to the 30+ crowd and I won’t try to. There’s no need to change my view there because I don’t have one yet, other than the general sense that it’s probably just like the 20s, but slightly worse.

Overall though, I think it is still safe for me to say that Asian guys can expect to stay single forever if they don’t live in a huge city. I’m not saying it’s a guarantee, but it’s the expected outcome by default in non-bustling locations. I saw this through my friends’ experiences too. Let’s hear the perspectives though, particularly if you’re an Asian guy, have ever dated (or rejected) an Asian guy before; or my personal insecurity: never in your life even thought of an asian guy in a romantic sense until this post."

This came from a tweet that (falsely) stated that Vance himself wrote about this experience in his book, *Hillbilly Elegy*. 

That tweet was debunked pretty much immediately, but many people ran with it, either believing it to be true or just spreading memes that JD Vance is a “couchfucker”. At this point the majority of people sharing these jokes understand the story to be false, but continue to make them. The main reason I’m making this post is because I watched Stephen Colbert affirm that the story is false, but then multiple times look to camera to emphasize “JD Vance had sex with a couch”. Obviously Colbert is an entertainer, not a journalist, but he’s been a barometer of the cultural zeitgeist I generally have found to be pretty rational, even when attacking what he disagrees with. 

To be clear - I have no love for JD Vance or Trump. I think it’s totally fair when people call Trump a rapist, because he is, I think it’s great to call JD Vance a misogynist, because there’s certainly plenty of evidence pointing to that. But spreading a dumb joke that is entirely made up is the kind of thing the right does, and the left decries it. Regardless of which side you’re on, I believe this sort of ad hominem is like, 100% damaging, 0% good.

That is stupid, unfair and dangerous. 

Look at MAGA Republicans: It’s a cult. Most (not all, but a significant enough amount to profoundly impact election results) of them have no concrete idea of what they are voting for, and are just voting that way because everyone around them is. Same for younger voters who just systematically vote left-wing. The problem is not unique to either party, which makes it all the more pervasive and worry some. All you need is a demagogue (like Trump) to come along, and there goes any hope of having a beneficial election cycle. 

Either we enforce civics test to insure that we don’t have 1) happening, or we replace democracy with something altogether. 

(By the way: The reason I choose “not advantageous” instead of, say, “working”, is because democracy is, indeed, working as it should, by reflecting the will of the people through free and fair elections, and therein lies my criticism.) "

God created humans and the universe.

Therefore, he is responsible for all good and bad in the universe.

He is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing) and omnibenevolent (all good).

“Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.”

“Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.”

“For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.”



He created a universe that contains bad (which he would know in advance due to his omniscience).

Basically I think whether a man is single in his youth is reflective of his value as a person, if he’s single in his youth he’s an incel and when he dies he will descend to the deepest circle of hell and be tormented for ten thousand years for disrespecting women, and if he’s in a relationship, especially if he’s never single when he’s young, then that means he’s a god guy, respects women, and will get 70 virgins in his afterlife. Basically this is the case, if a man “grows as a person” such that he gets a relationship later in life but was single in youth then fuck him he’s still a horrible person and worthless and only can get women to like him due to power. No this does not apply either way to women in old age managing to avoid being single.

31,2024-07-28,CMV: The US economy is partially a ponzi scheme made possible by the status of the US-dollar as the global currency,u/RandomGuy92x,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eedbp3/cmv_the_us_economy_is_partially_a_ponzi_scheme/,changemyview,"So according to the dictionary a *ponzi scheme* is defined as the following:

>a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.

I believe that the US economy is partially a ponzi scheme. The US economy is heavily reliant on imports from other countries. Among wealthy countries (GDP per capita = $40,000+) only New Zealand and the Cayman Islands have a higher trade deficit as % of GDP. And[ aside from Italy, Japan and Singapore the United States has the highest debt to gdp ratio of any wealthy, industrialized country in the entire world. ](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/debt-to-gdp-ratio-by-country)

The difference in imports vs exports allow Americans to consume at the levels they do. And that is made possible only via debt. A lot of countries own large amounts of dollars as a result of exporting goods to the US. So if the US wants to borrow money they often do so by selling treasury bonds from other countries that typically have a maturity date of 20-30 years and pay annual interest. But then those loans are largely not being paid for via taxes but by recruiting new investors, meaning issuing even more treasury bonds. And those loans once again are not financed via taxes but by issuing even more treasury bonds. 

And a lot of those shifts seem to have occured only in recent decades. [From 1870 - 1970 the US actually had an average trade surplus of 1.1%. ](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2019/05/17/historical-u-s-trade-deficits)Only in recent decades has the US persistently run an ever-increasing trade deficit. [For a long time debt as percentage of GDP seemed to be relatively stable, ](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S)then rising at a fairly slow rate from 1980 until 2008 but pretty much skyrocketing post-2008. And while the US government had a fairly balanced budget until around the mid 1970s, [the federal budget deficit has gone through the roof recently.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD)

And since 2020 interest payments on loans taken out by the US government [(bond yields) have gone from just under 1% to now over 4%. ](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10)There is a good reason to suspect that this is because investors are losing trust in the US economy and therefore demand higher interest rates. As a result in 2023 annual interest payments for the first time crossed the $1 trillion threshold. This number may soon go even further through the roof if the US continues to rely on ever-larger amounts of debt at ever-higher interest rates. 

So in essence this means that the current lifestyles enjoyed by Americans are partially based on a ponzi scheme. Loans are taken out that are then paid off by new loans, which are then paid off by obtaining even larger loans. In the long-term Americans have no other choice but to make significant sacrifices in their lifestyle. Either the US pays back back its creditors via massive tax increases or it can just print money or default on its debt which will massively devalue the dollar and make imports much more expensive. 

We can probably make the same argument about other wealthy countries but I wanted to focus mainly on the US here. 

The US economy is partially a ponzi scheme, made possibly mainly by the status of the US-dollar as a global currency. "

	•	Kamala has raised over $200 million in a week, which is a clear sign of huge support. This surge, especially from younger voters, shows there’s real excitement and a desire for change. The “brat” incident wasn’t just a lucky break; it showed she can connect with people on a personal level.

	•	Trump has never been enjoyed majority support among the American public. His legal issues, unpredictable nature, and the fallout from January 6 make him an easy target for Harris. He’s simply not as strong a candidate as some might think.

	•	The GOP seems rattled now that Biden isn’t the main opponent. Their focus on petty attacks, like mocking Kamala’s laugh or calling her a “childless cat lady,” shows they’re not prepared for her. It looks like they don’t have a solid strategy against her.

	•	People are tired of the chaos and divisiveness of recent years. Kamala offers a calm and capable alternative. She’s experienced and poised, and voters are ready for someone who can bring stability and competence to the role.

	•	Ironically, Trump, who once targeted Biden’s age, is now the oldest candidate in history. This change highlights the shift in the race dynamics and raises questions about his viability as a long-term leader.

**Project 2025: Preparing for a Conservative Administration**

**Introduction and Purpose:**
Project 2025, also known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, is a bold initiative by the conservative movement to ensure that the next conservative administration is fully prepared to govern effectively from day one, starting at noon on January 20, 2025. This effort is spearheaded by The Heritage Foundation and involves a comprehensive plan and a trained cadre of personnel ready to implement conservative policies.

**Historical Context:**
This initiative takes inspiration from the Heritage Foundation's ""Mandate for Leadership,"" which was first presented to President-elect Ronald Reagan in 1980. That document provided a set of policy prescriptions that played a crucial role in Reagan's successful administration. Project 2025 aims to build on this legacy to address the challenges posed by the federal government's growth and complexity.

**Strategic Approach:**
The project emphasizes that a president's power to implement an agenda is strongest in the early days of the administration. Therefore, planning and preparation must begin well before the election year. Project 2025 seeks to ensure a coordinated and well-conceived plan to support the next conservative president, addressing the rapid growth and complexity of the federal government.

**The Four Pillars of Project 2025:**
1. **Pillar I: Policy Consensus**
   - This volume consolidates a consensus view on how major federal agencies should be governed. It identifies areas of agreement and highlights where the next president may need to make choices.
   
2. **Pillar II: Personnel Database**
   - A comprehensive database allows candidates to build professional profiles, which coalition members can review and recommend. These recommendations will be shared with the president-elect's team to streamline the appointment process.
   
3. **Pillar III: Presidential Administration Academy**
   - An educational system, primarily online, will provide training on government functions for newcomers and advanced training for experienced individuals. This includes in-person seminars to set expectations for senior leadership.
   
4. **Pillar IV: The Playbook**
   - Agency teams will draft transition plans to be implemented upon the president's inauguration.

**Call to Action:**
Project 2025 is a call for a new generation of Americans to serve in the government, emphasizing the importance of being ready to deconstruct the administrative state from day one. It invites readers and supporters to join the mission through participation and support.

**Conclusion:**
As the nation approaches its 250th birthday, Project 2025 seeks to restore the Republic to its original principles of freedom and liberty. It aims to reverse the tide of what it views as cultural Marxism and to return power to the states and the American people.

The project is a collective effort of over 50 conservative organizations and more than 360 experts, all working towards the goal of advancing conservative principles and solutions for America's future.

0,2024-07-28,CMV: The American political system should be improved according to my ideas,u/Unlucky_Fisherman_11,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eeia1o/cmv_the_american_political_system_should_be/,changemyview,"I am an American patriot and I have good ideas.



All the changes I describe below should be implemented at once through a hypothetical amendment to the Constitution and will apply to all entities of the federation. To make it clearer and less boring to read, I will divide it into topics.



1) District voting must be abolished and replaced by proportional voting with multiple choices: the voter will have the right to vote for as many candidates as there are seats in his state in the House of Representatives. If he wants to vote for just one candidate, two, three or for all the seats, he will have that right. And, of course, he also has the right to not vote or to vote null (which will not be considered). Currently, the voter has no democratic power if he is a minority in his district.

The candidates with the most votes in the state within the total number of seats in the House of Representatives will be elected. Thus, if state A has 20 seats in the House, then the 20 candidates with the most votes in state A will be elected.



2) Both Senate seats in each state must be filled in the same election cycle: If the House of Representatives is controlled by the majority, the Senate should be the body where the majority-minority deadlock exists, precisely to prevent the (sizable) minority from being oppressed by the majority. Therefore, hold elections to fill both seats and allow voters to choose only one option. Also, require that a senator can be elected only if he or she receives at least one-third of the total valid votes. Under this criterion, if one or both seats are not filled, repeat the election until this occurs.



3) The term of office in the House of Representatives must be 3 years. In the Senate, 9 years: this is so that the House of Representatives can function better, with elections slightly further apart, without compromising its ability to respond to the demands of the electorate. As for the Senate, the goal is to make it even more independent. I note that this is especially important if I am saying that the majority and the minority will have equal influence in the Senate. The goal is to create a healthy stalemate for democracy, not a stalemate that paralyzes any change. This can be achieved if senators enjoy a high degree of independence from their electorate. This can only happen if they have a sufficiently long term.



4) The vice president must lose his position and casting vote in the Senate:  the Senate should be independent and decisive in its own right, without influence from other branches of the republic to favor one side.



5) The winner-take-all system in the Electoral College must be abolished: the president should be elected by electors chosen by a majority of the people, regardless of their state of residence, in a proportional vote along the lines I described in point 1.



6) The president's term must be 6 years, with no possibility of re-election: the goal is to compensate for the greater popular influence in the selection process, making it so that the president does not have to think about the next election when making decisions.



7) The president must only be the head of state, maintaining the veto power in its current form: the appointment and dismissal of the head of government must be proposed by the president and approved by the Senate (this last step is to prevent the head of government from being a puppet of the president, who can only be removed from office by impeachment). This system (also called semi-presidentialism) allows us to combine an advantage of pure presidentialism, which is the separation of the executive power from the legislative power, and an advantage of parliamentarism, which is the flexibility, without trauma to the country, of replacing heads of unpopular government or those in serious conflict with parliament.



8) The number of state delegates in the electoral college must correspond only to the number of seats of the state in the House of Representatives: this will eliminate the somewhat disproportionate influence of the less populous states in the process of choosing the president. On the other hand, they will still have some control through their influence in the Senate. But as I explained, due to the long terms (9 years), it will not be very receptive to its electorate."

Super liberal states like CA and NJ put a lot of tax burden on the working and middle class, yet barely any houses are built for the poor due to NIMBYism.

I agree with progressives about taxing the top 1% more, but I don't agree with middle class people giving 1-2 months of their salary to the state, on top of paying federal taxes.

As an example: A person who a few years where their income increased is finally able to afford a starter home.  Then they lose their job and have to get a lower paying job.  But the property tax they pay doubles because housing prices have inflated too."

While undeniably two of the most recognizable names in American sports, their selection feels like a glaring misstep that undermines the true essence of the Olympic Games.

The Olympics have traditionally been a platform to celebrate the underdog, to shine a spotlight on athletes who have dedicated their lives to pursuing excellence in often overlooked sports. It’s a stage where dreams are realized, where personal triumphs are etched into history. For countless athletes, the Olympics represent the pinnacle of their careers, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stand on the world's stage.

LeBron and Coco, on the other hand, are already enshrined in sporting lore. Their careers are defined by constant media attention, endorsement deals, and sold-out arenas. To bestow upon them the honor of carrying the flag feels like gilding the lily. It's akin to awarding a trophy to the perennial league MVP.

The Olympic spirit is about more than just winning medals. It's about the journey, the sacrifice, the unwavering pursuit of personal best. It's about representing your country with pride and humility. While LeBron and Coco undoubtedly embody many of these qualities, their selection overshadows the countless other athletes who have poured their hearts and souls into their respective sports.
Imagine the impact of choosing a less celebrated athlete, someone who has overcome adversity to reach the Olympic stage. Their story would inspire millions, their moment in the spotlight a testament to the human spirit. Instead, the focus will inevitably be on the star power of LeBron and Coco, diluting the impact of the entire opening ceremony.

It's not about diminishing LeBron and Coco's incredible achievements. They are undoubtedly icons of their sports. But the Olympic stage should be reserved for those who can truly benefit from the global exposure. Let's celebrate the unsung heroes, the athletes who embody the Olympic ideal in its purest form. Only then can we truly capture the magic and inspiration that the Games are meant to provide."

Yet the MAGAs have no issue with Trump stacking the White House staff and Supreme Court with unqualified nepo babies, loyalists, and political allies.

MAGA collectively agreed that ACB was the *most qualified* candidate for SCOTUS despite having limited experience as a judge.

You see this in Trump’s business as well. Do MAGAs really believe that Eric and Don Junior are the *most qualified* businessmen to be heading Trump Organization? Would they be there if they weren’t Trump’s sons?

And of course when SCOTUS ruled college admissions can no longer DEI based on race, the MAGAs rejoiced without denouncing legacy admissions (Nepo babies) and pay-to-enter (donor babies). In other words, DEI for the elite.

Given these examples, my argument is that the anti-DEI crowd are really just closeted pro-DEI for the elites they follow, such as Trump and his posse.

I’m not saying DEI or Harris are without their faults. This is not a pro-DEI or pro-Harris post. But if you’re going to preach meritocracy, practice meritocracy without the nepotism and sycophancy.

I used to when I was 13-14, I’m 17 now about to be 18 which really ain’t a big age difference but my mindset has changed. I am 5’6, so I am not short I am not that tall either and I don’t think I need someone who is 6’0+. It will just look weird side by side, not to mention having to look up at him or him bending down to kiss, both of our necks would hurt lol.

I like guys my height or just a bit taller, they’re just as attractive and masculine as the taller ones and I never had a problem with their height and it doesn’t make me feel small. Only thing is when wearing heels it sucks when I am taller than them lol but I just switch to flats instead, overall I think we shouldn’t shame guys who aren’t tall because it’s not their fault and there’s nothing wrong with being short, they’re just as cool as the tall ones. It’s okay to have a preference/requirement but just don’t be mean about it!

**""Upper Class Income"" definition: Top 20%. This is the most common general standard I've found for what's ""upper class"" when using income as the standard. For this specific post, it's the top 20% of annual income earnings for an individual person in Chicago, IL. Individuals with no kids, no spouse, no one else to be financially responsible for.

**Based off 2022 data from the Census Bureau, the median income for ""Family Income - 1 Earner "" (so basically for an individual with no kids) was (pre-tax)$52,095, ±$3,408 (margin of error).**

**Note: 2022 Census Bureau data for median-income in Chicago is in ""2022 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars"", so $83,352 in January 2022 should be equivalent to $93,143.52 in June 2024.**

By what I know as the general standard (at least one of them) for what numerically is ""upper-class"" income, is the top 20% of earners for a given area. So, I see that as meaning that for individuals in Chicago (not couples, families, etc., but for an individual person), as of June 2024, that earned **at least** $93,143.52 (pre-tax) (With the"" low-end"" being $87,050.17, and the ""high-end"" being $99,236.87 in annual income) would be considered  to have ""upper-class"" income.

The household income amount that'd be considered ""upper-class"" increases (I'd say) significantly when you have 2 or more earners. Also, kids, debt, more expensive neighborhoods/areas/living-spaces, etc., all can/likely shorten how much you can save/stretch your $$$."

I keep up with political stories on the moderate politics subreddit and listen to the PBD podcast and TYT routinely to get an idea of both sides of current topics.

I believe that if we continue with our current political structure we will never achieve our ideal country which imo includes opportunity for upward economic mobility, bodily autonomy, freedom of speech and free/affordable healthcare. Furthermore, I want the United States foreign policy to eliminate its imperialist mindset and stop involving itself in every military conflict around the globe. 

I believe that our current system is restrained primarily due to lobbyists being the most powerful influencer of both elections and policy decisions. It's the reason Bernie Sanders didn't win the democratic primary in 2016, big banks were bailed out in 2008, the United States continues to become involved in wars around the globe and the military swallows a larger percentage of the discretionary budget every year. I acknowledge that although Trump is not captured by the traditional lobbying interests, he is governed by his own self interests and a select few mega donors in the Evangelical church and previously Sheldon Adelson.

All of that being said I am currently leaning towards Trump because I think he is the candidate who will help improve the economy for the average American (through tax cuts, tariffs, increased oil production, encouragement of repatriation etc.)and put an end to our immense financial support to both Israel and Ukraine. Obvious reasons I dislike Trump is his insistence on dog whistling to a base which certainly includes all the racist individuals in the United States, his divisive rhetoric and his electing of conservative justices who overturned Roe v Wade and his age. 

VP Harris in contrast doesn't have me excited for anything in particular because I have no idea who she actually is as a political candidate. During her time as a senator and VP she has either flip flopped or given intentionally vague answer based on who she was talking to in order to not decrease her popularity with anyone. This extends into the fact that she has no particular issue or legislation she is passionate about.

As VP she was deemed the ""border czar"" which is probably the least successful endeavor of the Biden campaign. If we attribute other policies passed under Biden to her I was in favor of the CHIPS act, but disgruntled with the massive amount of money spent in the IRA that only added to inflation post COVID. Her resume as a prosecutor for me is mixed as she has some big legal wins vs large corporations and a valid crusade against truancy, but also huge blunders such as keeping prisoners locked up longer to have their assistance as volunteer fireman, taking a a large amount of plea deals to ensure a good conviction rate and withholding evidence on a death row inmate that would have freed him. Because of how muddy her views are my main pros for Harris is that she is a woman and an individual who knows how to engage in respectful public engagement. "

- Election Day should be a federal holiday or moved to a Saturday.

- Failing to cast a ballot, even a blank ballot should result in a fine. This fine can be gotten out of with demonstrating a good reason you could not vote.

- Employers should be required to give anyone working on Election Day a reasonable amount of time off to vote. 

- Optional, but a part of the system that we should copy, even if not mandated by regulation or law. Fundraisers selling sausages at polling places, colloquial called “democracy sausages” a beloved part of the Australian voting culture.

It seems almost criminal to me that it’s not the norm for everyone in the world’s “bastion of democracy” to vote, and that it’s considered a point of concern to query and possibly fine everyone who didn’t cast a ballot.

My central view is that voting should be mandatory, the exact method by which we do this is not important to me, I was merely offering the Australian model as an option. I welcome being convinced why mandatory voting is a bad thing.

0,2024-07-28,"CMV: There are only the 3 spacial dimensions, and no more. Time is not a dimension.",u/RedditExplorer89,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1een49q/cmv_there_are_only_the_3_spacial_dimensions_and/,changemyview,"There are theories out there, such as String theory, that there are many more dimensions which we cannot measure, or observe.  I also hear people often refer to time as the 4th dimension.  As intriguing and mind tickling as this is, I think this is all fantasy; there are only the 3 spatial dimensions we are familiar with.  Here's why I think that:

1.) Every living thing can consciously move through all 3 spatial dimensions.  Why would we not be able to move through the other dimensions if they existed?  And I mean freely move, so time gets close because we can move forward in time, but if time were a dimension we should be able to move backwards through it as well.  We can't.

If there were some living creature that were stuck in 2 dimensions or less, I could comprehend us being stuck in less dimensions than exist.  But I see no reason that every living thing would be stuck in 3 dimensions only, unless those 3 dimensions were the only ones to exist.

Basically, there's no precedent for something being stuck in less dimensions than exist.

2.) Even if we were stuck in less dimensions than we could move through, even if we could only see in those stuck dimensions, it would still be easy to know if any object or thing is moving through more dimensions.  Imagine a 1-D creature; it can only move along a line.  If it existed in a 2-D world it would know it, because other objects moving through the 2D space that crosses its 1-D line would pop in and out of existence as it passed.  So if there were more dimensions in our real world we would see any objects moving through those other dimensions pop in and out of existence as they pass through our 3-D section of vision.  We don't see anything like this.

It just seems unlikely that 3 dimensions are unlocked for us to move through while everything else is not, and that no objects are moving through the other dimensions to pop into our view, definitively alerting us to other dimensions.

**What would change my view**

* Show an example of a creature living in less than 3 dimensions, or objects that are moving through higher dimensions as they pass in and out of existence.

* Give a good reason why every single lifeform is locked to exactly 3 dimensions, while more dimensions exist, and/or why we wouldn't see any evidence of objects moving through higher dimensions.

**What probably won't change my view**

* Smarter people than me have studied this longer and think there might be more dimensions.  On its own, this isn't persuasive to me.  Complex ideas can be shown to be understandable to commoners like me, even if I don't fully understand them.

**Why do I want to change my view**

* It sounds fun to believe that there are more dimensions; more possibilities than we can sense."

I feel like people are going to accuse this of being a poor attempt at rage bait. 

I concede that a large reason why I believe this is probably trauma informed. But even when I try to take the trauma glasses off and be objective about it, I still can’t shake this viewpoint. 

I think money is way more important than romantic love or sex in general. Money gets you the things you need to survive. But on top of stability it buys opportunities and experiences as well. And if you have enough money you can improve the lives of not only your family and friends, but the lives of your greater community or even the world. To me, romantic love doesn’t have any real benefits. And beyond sometimes feeling good, sex doesn’t have any merit in and of itself.

When making important decisions about my life, I try to evaluate things on a risk vs reward basis. 

As a woman, here are the risks I face whenever I have sex with a man: 

First on the list is pregnancy. If I get pregnant I have multiple options open to me. But none of them are easy and, excuse the flippant language, but that all suck. I could get an abortion. Which could cost anywhere between $600 or $1200. It’s also a traumatic and often times a painful event. I could give birth and risk death or permanent disability. If I gave birth I could raise the child (I don’t feel like I have to list all the all the downsides of this option) or give the child up for adoption (as a foster kid and an adoptee, no. Just no). I would most likely go with an abortion but that’s not exactly the sunshine and rainbows option either. And it’s definitely not with going through all that for the “reward” 

Of course contraceptives exist. But at the same time they can become expensive over time (condoms) or have long lasting negative side effects (all types of hormonal birth control) or just don’t work in a capacity I’d be able to trust (pulling out or tracking my cycle). 

And then there’s STIs. I feel like this is pretty self explanatory. Every time you have any kind of sex, you put yourself at risk for infection. Which can cost money to treat and/or have lifelong consequences. And it’s not even about how many people you have sex with or whether or not you’re promiscuous. I’ve seen plenty of people (not just women) get STDS from cheating partners.

The benefits I get from having sex:  it feels good. Allegedly. Or children (I don’t understand why people want kids at all but that’s a different discussion). Or emotional connection. 

For me personally sex has never felt good. But even if I was having the best sex imaginable I don’t see how the sex itself is supposed to be its own reward when faced with all the risks it has. And even then, I can masturbate and get the exact same reward without any of the risk. 

The only way sex would have any positive impact on my life would be if I was getting paid to have it. And getting paid *a lot*. 

It’s not even just a gender thing, though I will say sex poses more risks for AFAB people than any other demographic. But I don’t understand how *anyone* thinks sex is at all worth the risks it comes with. "

Anti-capitalist worldviews ultimately derive from the idea that capitalism allows people to enrich themselves without actually providing new value to the world. One of the most common ways this happens is via artificial scarcity. Take landlords, a common target of anti capitalism. They buy up housing and rent it back to people, allowing them to take advantage of a scarcity in the market that they created in order to continually generate revenue without actually providing any new value to society. The same is true of scalpers; they buy a lot of something to create scarcity and sell back at a higher price.

I believe that this is something which intellectual property does. Ideas and information are fundamentally not scarce. They can be freely duplicated an infinite amount of times, at no cost to whoever ""originally"" created the information. This means that people who sell information (intellectual property) are taking an unscarce resource and intentionally making it difficult to access in order to charge money to access it. Furthermore, after originally putting in effort to create the information, the person can continue to make more and more profit off of it without putting in more effort. It is for these reasons that I believe intellectual property causes rentseeking behavior and mirrors the problems of landlords and scalping, and should be placed alongside those problems at the top of any anti-capitalists' problem list for society."

Though people can be tribal and not racist. they may favour people of the same religion or ethnicity, irrespective of race, for instance.

The idea that ""everybody is a little bit racist"" is based on the following tenets:

  
- Tribalism. well yes, we are tribal. But this doesn't necessarily mean one will or should be racist.

- It assumes that we have this ""racist brain"" from birth and it just manifest once we become socially aware. that's complete nonsense and unscientific.

- I am not a racist. therefore, this rationale should apply to me as a fellow human. Yet it doesn't. Nobody in my family or immediate friend group is like this either. So what's the deal then? It's clearly not as ""ingrained"" to human nature then, by definition. 

- Some might interpret ""everybody is a little bit racist"" to mean we're all influenced by societal biases. This is true. However, this even differs. Even in heavily racist societies, the extent to which people are such differs. There were abolitionists in the antebellum Southern USA. Even in the North, abolitionists would differ in their views of how to deal with freed blacks. Lincoln wanted them sent back to Africa, whilst others believed in full integration. 

  
I think people who promote this ""everybody is a little bit racist"" belief are just closed-minded or unintelligent racists who project their own views. Like they think ""buuuh..gawwwww well I'm racist and my brain works that way so everybody else's does too!"" No, it doesn't. How we think at a root level is a mix of genetics, environment and experiences. A person who grew up in a non-racist family or environment is less likely to be racist, but even this isn't absolute. 

We're also affected societally by classism, sexism, homophobia, etc. So are we all ""a little bit sexist""? I am not. I don't hate any woman for being lesser than me by virtue of being a man. I would call out any sexist joke in my midst, even if were being edgy and not hateful. I don't hate poor or rich people, nor do I despise ""by nature"" LGBT people. 

I can accept everybody has the capacity to be bigoted. But not all bigotry is racism. 

Whenever I hear somebody say ""everybody is a little bit racist"" I just dismiss them as a retard who assumes everybody shares his or her psychology. It's as dim as me saying ""I love films - and does everybody!!"" no, nobody has to. i don't give a fuck if people like films or not. It's a free world. Let people do and like what they wish.

This may be true, but handguns require more precision and practice to hit your targets. Semi-autos are still used in mass shootings even if the number is lower the handguns, and I think banning semi auto rifles will still lower victims in mass shootings. I also believe we should prioritize human life over being able to hunt more efficiently. 

2. Semi-autos are the most efficient weapons in hunting. 

Once again, hunting is a sport people do for fun, I prioritize human life, EVEN if it’s a very small number of humans/children dying and being traumatized, to someone being sad they can’t most efficiently kill deer for fun. There’s also plenty of alternatives to semi-auto rifles for hunting, including snipers, bolt actions, and slug shotguns.

3. Semi auto rifles are the best weapon in home defense.

I disagree, I think there’s no scenario where a shotgun/handgun would not be able to ward off any home invader any better than a rifle. 


4. Felons will be able to find them on the black market anyway. 

This may be true but it’s about making it as hard to access as possible. It would be a lot harder to find a semi-auto rifle on the black market rather than being able to just obtain it legally wouldn’t it?

My second statement about magazine caps speaks for itself, I don’t really see any disadvantages to a magazine cap on semi-auto handguns.  "

Now Trump, I don’t like Trump I believe he is an A hole but I don’t think he supports PR25, trump has high charisma and he seem to have a lot more support after the assassination attempt, Trump has been to a lot of rally and Harris has only been on 2 or 3 so far. Kamala is out of touch right now and her not Being Trump doesn’t mean that she’ll be a good president, there’s a reason that she was hated by the public during her time as VP

Trump seem to be more favorable with the  common man and trying to gain sympathy and Kamala is gaining votes from women,  LBGT, and other minorities group"
0,2024-07-29,CMV: Whoever Wins The State Of Pennsylvania Will Win The Election,u/dannyrules101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eeqncu/cmv_whoever_wins_the_state_of_pennsylvania_will/,changemyview,"There are so many debates all over the internet and mainstream media on who will win the election or wtf the polls are saying. I mean just scroll down this page and you will see numerous debates in who people are anticipating will win/who do they want to win. But after spending some time looking at polls, and playing around with road to 270 simulators it is pretty clear that the path to the presidency is Pennsylvania. 

Based on polling and voter history we can pretty much predict as of today what states will vote what party. For example everyone knows that California and New York will vote blue, while Texas and Florida will vote red. Knowing these general trends we can expect that 43 out of the 50 states are pretty much already decided. Based on demographics, polling data, senate and house race votings, etc. And if trends stay the same and polling data is accurate even with an error margin, the path to presidency resides strictly in who the people in PA vote for. 

The state of Pennsylvania is a true tossup and the largest one at that with 19 delegates at stake. I am not saying either candidate cannot win the election without winning Pennsylvania but the path to 270 becomes extremely difficult. 

Based my hypothesis if you will this means that Trump and the Republican Party will win the election come November. They have consistently polled better than both Biden and Harris at a margin of +4. If the trend continues Democrats would have to win all the other swing states. Which isn’t impossible but very very unlikely. 

Edit: I forgot to add this was also the state Trump almost got killed in so take that how you may.

There are other reasons an immigrant's green card can be rescinded including being out of the country for too long, a potential travel ban as done by the Trump Admin and the possibility for the government to set new reasons to throw them out.

Even with the ability to work and live anywhere, it doesn't seem like you fully belong in the country as you are after all, under a visa status. If you vacation beyond 6 months, that green card somehow is not valid and you need to enter using some passport-like travel document. With these reasons, being an immigrant is not a full member of American society, but rather a foreigner with authorization to stay as long as they like and work."

130,2024-07-29,"CMV: using MMA as a benchmark of what martial arts works in a ""real fight"" and what doesn't isn't actually a good method at all. ",u/AlexFerrana,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eeudak/cmv_using_mma_as_a_benchmark_of_what_martial_arts/,changemyview,"Alright, hear me out. MMA is great and I like it, but when MMA fans are mocking so-called ""TMA"" (traditional martial arts) by saying that ""it won't work in MMA"" or ""a mediocre amateur MMA fighter would mop the floor with a high level aikidoka/taekwondo fighter/wing chun fighter/karateka/krav maga adept/etc"", it makes me very disappointed.

First of all, MMA has plenty of rules depending on the promotion, which sometimes just makes a certain martial art impossible to apply in MMA context. Like, small joints manipulation is banned in MMA and it makes aikido look ""useless"" there. Use of gloves names wristlocks also hard to apply, even though wristlocks are legal in MMA. Eye gouging, biting, throat strikes and other illegal blows are making the krav maga ""useless"" as well. But what about to test it in a no holds barred street fight without any sport equipment and rules, as well as without referees, judges and limits by rounds and overall time. I'm sure that it would make the whole thing completely different.

Second, some martial arts aren't for cage fighting or for fighting in the ring. It's purely for self-defense in the streets, where rules are non-existent, such as Krav Maga or Keysi. Aikido is designed for defending against a charging opponent who is armed with a bladed weapon or for defense against wrist grabbing or against unwanted holds on your arms or shoulders. Wing chun was created for women and small people in order to help them to defend against bigger and stronger opponents. Etc, etc. 

Third, just because someone doesn't fight in MMA doesn't mean that he or she isn't a legit fighter. Not everyone need to do that just to prove naysayers that they're wrong. For example, you don't need to be a UFC champion if you're studying Krav maga and want to defend yourself from an untrained street punks or against a drunk and aggressive person. Or if you're a bouncer or a cop who needs to know wristlocks and wrist control in order to properly handcuff a criminal or restrain an aggressive clubber and kick him out of the club without hurting him too much. 

Fourth, there's examples of traditional martial arts that are successfully used in MMA. Steven ""Wonderboy"" Thompson, George St. Pierre and Lyoto Machida are known for their karate, Anderson da Silva and Chris Barnett are known for their taekwondo and Jason Delucia is known as having the background in aikido and kung fu. It's all about martial artist, not about martial art itself. 

And fifth, all martial arts has their own value and not all of them are for fighting under the set of rules in the octagon or ring. Using MMA as a ""proof"" why that martial art works or doesn't work is a dishonest and manipulative method.

I think that I said enough. I'm ready to change my mind if you can prove me wrong. "
0,2024-07-29,cmv: Doggy paddle should replace Butterfly at the Olympics,u/goodluckall,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eev986/cmv_doggy_paddle_should_replace_butterfly_at_the/,changemyview,"1. Practicality:
Butterfly is a sub-optimal stroke with no advantage over freestyle in terms of speed or efficiency
Doggy paddle has a use as it is the only swimming stroke you can do silently as your limbs don't break the surface of the water.

2. Universality
Highly technical strokes like butterfly give a big boost to rich nations with lots of pools and a highly developed coaching infrastructure. A cynical person might even say that having so many medals in swimming has historically been a way to pad the USA's medal tally.
Doggy paddle requires less resources and technical coaching and is more instinctive opening it up to less well resourced countries.

3. Challenge
Butterfly, like freestyle, backstroke and breaststroke is very technically challenging.
Doggy paddle although less technical is uniquely tiring as it is very inefficient.

Arguments against:

1. Spectacle
Butterfly is more impressive for spectators to watch. Maybe, but most of the excitement in a race comes from watching the race unfold rather than how difficult what the athletes are doing is. Furthermore, really fast skillful Doggy paddle at Olympic standard might be just as impressive.

2. Standardisation and recognition
Most of this can be dismissed as an appeal to authority/tradition so I will just say FINA could create standard rules for doggie paddle. Removing Butterfly from the Olympics would not even affect the athletes that much as few swimmers seem to specialise in one discipline to the extent they fo in other sports (another reason to add something which requires very different skills)"
0,2024-07-29,CMV: Solving the voting issue,u/BeamTeam032,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eevd9t/cmv_solving_the_voting_issue/,changemyview,"Registration: Simple solution, make both men and women register for the draft when they turn 18. And when you register for the draft, you're automatically registered to vote. This way there is no ""same day registration"" issues. You can register at the DMV, post office or Public library. (give the post office and library something else to do to easy to burden on the DMV)

Voter ID: In act voter ID laws. But, allow all public libraries, DMVs, post offices to print up new IDs. In 2010 in college, I registered, took my picture and they printed up an ID with my picture on it with a scannable barcode. 14 years later and it still takes weeks to get our new IDs in the mail. Every citizen gets 1 free replacement a year. All new voter IDs must be obtained Thursday night 8pm is the cut off. 

Patriot Weekend: The General election should be a holiday weekend. All businesses are required to give their employees at least 1 paid day off to vote/participate in ""Patriot day."" Polls open on Friday at 8am - Sunday 8pm. Businesses will take a hit due to giving Friday off, but businesses will receive a boost because more families will be taking their families out after the polls. Going out to dinner, the movies, shopping, etc. And more people would be willing to spend money because they're making 8hrs pay without having to work. Of course the employer can pick Friday, Saturday or Sunday depending on the schedule. 

Votes aren't counted until Sunday 8PM. There is an issue of people wanting only paper ballots, but also complaining that it's taking too long to count the votes. But those same people don't trust voting machines, make it a scantron and use a scantron machine. And make it a stamp in a box instead of a bubble to circle in. And make the boxes 25% bigger than the stamp so it's most likely that the stamp will stay within the box. If a stamp is on the line, or unable to read the machine will put the ballot aside and human will judge the ballot and determine the result of the ballot. And those would be made public (with information blocked out) for public review. And if the stamp is still too tough to call, that 1 question will be void, but the rest of the ballot will count. 

When voting for measures or laws, the question needs to be clear. In California they worded the question of making gay marriage legal, you had to vote NO, in order to make it legal. This kind of trickery is disingenuous and unamerican. 

Also, all states should allow their voters to vote on laws directly instead of voting for representatives who will vote for them. We hate corruption in our politics, let the people choose what laws they want to live, instead of having a middleman that can be bribed or corrupted. 

  
So reddit, does this solve our voting issue? I understand conservatives and liberals won't be happen with some part of this, but I tried to appease everyone and piss off everyone at the same time. I figured if everyone was mad, it's probably the right thing. So change my mind why this is wrong. "

I'm not convinced it will be all rosy for society. People were not made to lie down and rest all day long, we've always been at least somewhat active - to the degree necessary for ensuring our survival. A lot of people derive their meaning from their occupation.

I mean, look at all the tech giants who create these systems - Elon Musk, Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman. They're all billionaires. They could've all retired long ago and spend the rest of their lifes in leisure, doing whatever strikes their fancy. Yet they continue to work in very demanding, intensive conditions, because this work provides them with satisfaction and a sense of purpose.

Some jobs are shitty and grueling, a lot of people are overworked and would definitely like a break. But if we automate not just the shitty jobs, but all jobs - including those who give people meaning and satisfaction - I think it will make a lot of people find life pointless and depressing. I think it will be especially the case with all the aforementioned tech billionaires, actually, because their egos require constant achievements to be sustained.

Our society is already dealing with record statistics of mental illness, birth rates are constantly dropping because people don't want to have children - all of this is happening because human beings did not develop to live in 21st century industrial society. I think automation will only exacerbate these conditions and make more people feel listless and depressed."

11,2024-07-29,CMV: Generative AI art makes the self lazy and is inherently shallow.,u/Banned_In_CP,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eexee0/cmv_generative_ai_art_makes_the_self_lazy_and_is/,changemyview,"For starters, let's look at the impact of selling it alongside human art, and not holding it to the same standard as humans.

If we simply are using it to showcase the features, then Yes generative art is okay. Or as a simple little meme or joke not to be taken seriously. However, when this person intends to sell it as a final artistic product alongside human artistic products in all seriousness, and we start giving it excuses for lower quality, this is a problem.

To ensure we have quality products, then we must hold anything marketed as a final product to a baseline standard. Such as correct number of fingers. Or character consistency. Or use of color palette and symbolism. Consistent dialogue aesthetic. Consistent use of at least some compositional standards. Same with literally any product that exists.

By not holding AI art marketed as a final product when it is alongside human art lowers this baseline standard. While it may feel good in the moment, the effect long term is it lowers the overall quality of standards, and we end up with products of lower quality.

Art specifically also supersedes the material. Art is not as simple as a vacuum cleaner. I would have no issue with AI being used to make vacuum cleaners so long as we never lose that standard of quality. Vacuum cleaners are made to fill a practical purpose. The final product is all that matters.

The problem with art specifically is that its value is not just in how it can be used, but also in how it is created. This is why we see corporate art as having less artistic value than a Michelangelo. Art is a process of the artist bringing order to the chaos of emotion and thought. Art is more than pretty pictures because really art is about self expression, and we like to see the self expression of others because we can relate to it on a deeper level.

When you use AI as a replacement of this process, then you lose sight of this. You begin to see art as JUST a product to be profited from. You JUST see the pretty colors. You lose sight of this deeper connection. However, if you use AI to assist in this process--like say you want to colorize a drawing you actually drew--this does not really replace your self expression, you already drew it. You already brought order from the world's chaos through your mind's lense. It is when we replace the process entirely that makes it problematic. Because AI is not sentient. AI is not expressing itself consciously, it is a cold hard statistical algorithm. This is not how humans make art. And it loses sight of art's intrinsic value. Human art has a deeper level of meaning and symbolism and self expression that is not coded into the file. Its not a cold algorithm, its a hot mess of human thought. Art made entirely by the AI loses this depth. This is why people say it feels soulless. This is why I would say it is lazy, is because you are replacing your own process of self growth. It is at this point it is no longer a tool and a crutch. Because art should have a piece of you not just in the idea of the art, in its very fiber.

Many people say that because they sell ""cheap"" art at TJ Maxx it means human art doesn't have depth. This is a very shallow way of seeing art. It assumes that because it is in large numbers and in a chain store that there cannot be this depth. This is untrue. By virtue of being designed by a human, it inherently has added layers of depth in its composition that ai art doesn't have, it has even less than corporate art. 

For instance that quantity does not negate quality, even though the Mona Lisa is copied and sold in thousands of stores, it does not negate its intrinsic artistic value. It does not negate the role of the artist. When you negate the role of the artist, you negate the self. You negate the vastness of human potential. You tell yourself you CANT do something, when you CAN and you SHOULD. Because art is a process of the mind. Anyone can learn art. Sure, you may not be able to pump out a super lifelike portrait of  landscape, but if that's your goal then perhaps you should try photography. Or you could take it as an opportunity to better yourself. But working with limitations is also what makes human art so powerful. Don't focus on what you can't do, focus on what you CAN do. For yourself.

This is why I get angry at AI art. Because it implies that the role of the mind is negligible. It implies that the process of expressing yourself and improving yourself is something that should be outsourced because it implies you are incapable. But you are capable, and people don't see this and it makes us artists angry.

Think of a song that has made you cry. You don't cry because of how objectively nice it sounds. You cry because of how you can relate to it and because you can appreciate the process of the artist and how it relates on this deeper level. This is human art at its most powerful. To negate this by comparing tearjerking music to Temu art is just simply not a solid argument.

Believe in yourself and your potential. Don't limit yourself. Push yourself. That's the message here."

I recently watched the show and don't understand the hype around it. It's a good show and I can see where people might have been able to sink their teeth into but I need someone who has been able to be drawn into it fully to tell me what I am missing. Before I start please don't come after me. I don't want to seem like I'm making fun of the show or am greater than thou for not liking popular show. 

  
Firstly I felt like there wasn't any complications or twists within the plan. For the most part the first half is the crew setting things up and the second half is undoing them with little to no complication or snags. The erasure of one doesn't prevent or interact with another. There are moral issues with the changes but these are really easily solved by going on a date or saying ""Sorry about your dad"". Big changes also didn't seem to have much effect on the other characters. The whole structure of the city changes and no one really seems to react or have any complications after the first minute.

  
Twists were really predictable to the point where I was shocked when they got revealed to be twists or something that wasn't known. I did not know that the characters didn't know faris' dad was the change to this timeline until the episode where they had to undo it. Characters wave death flags like they're trying to communicate with planes and when character deaths do happen or people return to their timelines, it doesn't change anything. I kept waiting for an ""Oh shit"" moment where this tips a domino that complicates things but there wasn't one. The time travel just seemed to be putting pegs in the ground and then turning around and taking them out one by one.

  
A major theme of the series is your actions having conciquences and how you need to calculate your options and deal with a character death trolley problem but they find a way to have both cakes. No one needs to die to protect this timeline and it's all good.

I wanted to like the show and I would love to have someone tell me passionately what they like about it and what appeals to them about it.  I know that I'm pulling a risky move here by going after a beloved anime and asking redditors to give me their opinions on it but I want to see what others see in this because I want to be hyped for it too. I've been a fan of anime since I was little and love stuff that makes me think or is able to play with the ethics of a topic. I want to enjoy this show, I couldn't get into it and I want to hear someone who was caught by it so they can tell me why"

0,2024-07-29,CMV: Voting rights should be (slightly) weighted in line with income tax payments.,u/Bojack35,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eeyyfj/cmv_voting_rights_should_be_slightly_weighted_in/,changemyview,"My premise is simply that a large amount of voting is based on what you want the government to do with tax / how to spend it. 

As is; an 18 year old student, an 80 year old pensioner and a 40 year old working full time all have the same voting power despite only one actually contributing tax. 

My suggestion would be that those who do not pay income tax have a vote worth 0.5, those who do it's worth 1 and those who pay in excess of £100k a year income tax worth 1.5. 

Currently in the UK the top 10% of taxpayers contribute 60% of income tax receipts. It seems fair that on an individual basis someone like Gerko who paid £664m in tax last year has a greater say than myself who paid nothing. 

Alongside that I would lower the voting age to 16 as there have been calls for. But the reality will be most of those under 21 will have a vote worth 0.5, so a bit of balance there. 

The hardest hit would probably be the 'grey vote' , but I think there are solid arguments for them having a lesser say. There is an added bonus of the self employed plumber who earns a fortune but pretends to make a loss now has a small motive to actually pay taxes, or a small restriction for not doing so. 

The qualification would be at least 1 of the last 5 years of government. You could also include foreign nationals who qualify on income tax, perhaps also at 0.5? 

So nobody would be fully disenfranchised, lots would actually gain a say, but that say would be slightly weighted on you contributing to the money that voting decides how is spent. 

The weighting is not so disproportionate that there is much incentive to cater towards super high earning individuals, they are easily cancelled out by the greater number of lower income voters . There are 540k people who pay over £120k tax in the UK, so weighting their votes at 1.5 would only create another 270k votes. Significant but not enough to dictate to the millions of regular votes

You end up with imo a slightly fairer system that puts a bit more focus on the rights of working people.

I realise that the actual implementation would be very difficult, while we can talk about that can I ask the focus to be on the theoretical idea?"

This method, unlike what the majority of internet users seem to believe when searching up the topic, will not result in acid rain (acid rain was caused by SO2 being released from chimneys, which rains down in a matter of weeks, while in the stratosphere it lasts much longer, 1-3 years), visibly block out the sunlight (blocking 1% of sunlight will reduce the absolute temperature of Earth by 0.25%, or approximately 0.7 degrees Celsius, just enough to mitigate climate change for a few decades) and is certainly not some sort of secret plot to destroy the planet (there are people who seem to think so).

Moreover, it will be relatively cheap (injecting a few million tons of aerosols annually requires a small fleet of high-flying aircraft, with a combined payload of around 10,000 tons if we assume each one can fly twice a day, costing 10 billion at most, with the sulphur and fuel around the same magnitude, compared to a significant portion of global GDP required for aggressive transitions away from fossil fuels or just receiving the impact), as well as non-permanent and therefore safe as much of the aerosols will leave the stratosphere within a few years."

If you think about it for more than a few seconds, there are several glaring flaws with this logic. 

The first of these is that ""antisemitism"" simply means a prejudice against Jews. It has nothing to do with ""Semites."" Applying the term across the board based on technical root words is like calling a spider an octopus because it also has eight legs. 

Second, and related to the first, is that ""Semites""... aren't really a thing. It's part of an outdated racial ideology that was used by the Nazis. According to Wikipedia, for example, ""*Semites* is an obsolete term for an ethnic, cultural or racial group associated with people of the Middle East, including Arabs, Jews, Akkadians, and Phoenicians."" Calling Arabs (or Jews for that matter) Semites are borrowing from pseudoscientific racist ideologies.

Third, this comeback is clearly disingenuous because people don't call themselves or other groups ""Semites"" outside of their attempted refutation of accusations of antisemitism. Nobody speaks about how Egyptians/Armenians/Jordanians/anyone else are a proud nation of Semites, etc. 

Finally, even if all of this was untrue, if these terms fit the scenario perfectly, it **still** wouldn't make sense. Let's give a similar scenario: accusations of racism. Imagine an Asian person accuses a Mexican person of racism. Would anyone in their right mind consider ""Well, Mexicans are also part of a race"" as a fair way to address those accusations? Of course not, people would immediately point out how ridiculous such a statement would be. 

I'm not interested in debating criticism of Israel vs antizionism vs antisemitism (at least here). I'm just sick of this ridiculous claim. "

So let's look at the big guy: Elon Musk and Twitter, Tesla, and anything else he's got his fingers in.  

Boycott those companies with me all you want, but it's not going to cause any change.  He's still going to be in control of them.  He's still going to have absolutely fantastic amounts of wealth that will allow him to pull strings in the political and corporate worlds.  

Even if boycotting every single thing he's involved in caused him to lose *literally* 99.9% of his net worth, he'd still have nearly a quarter BILLION dollars.  He's still going to be buying lobbyists and politicians as desired.  He's still going to be able to do pretty much anything he wants.  And if that money is in investments, he'll be back up to billionaire status in no time.  And let's be honest: there's no realistic path to him losing that much of his wealth in the first place, is there?

The major focus on the movement currently is the pro-choice position, and you can disagree with that for whatever moral reasons, but it’s a civil liberties issue, not an anti-man issue. Another big issue for feminists is pay equality which doesn’t mean men would be paid less. Corporate profits are so huge that all workers could be paid more, and no one would immediately lose money.

Additionally, there are lots of feminist positions that would DIRECTLY help men. Feminists discuss child care lots and almost all support an expansion of paid family leave for both men and women. Further, the alimony system is biased against men because of an expectation that men are breadwinners, and women are caretakers. Feminists are much quicker to recognize this sexism that non-feminists and mostly support a fairer alimony system that would help out lots of men.

As for the idea that feminists are mean to men on a personal level, I’d say that firstly, people need to have more spine and learn to judge political movmeents on their POLITICS rather than on how they make them FEEL personally. And, in my experience, feminist women AND men do not hate men, and I think you’d have to do lots of mental gymnastics to argue the great number of feminist men all hate men.

How did I come up with this theory? Here's my (crude) methodology for transparency's sake. I tend to deactivate my twitter accounts completely when I'm working on a project because it's the main culprit for slowing down my productivity, and hence have had to set up new accounts with no followers multiple times. In addition I don't follow users on twitter, I usually just use the search function to see where the public discourse is going in certain topics (e.g. the olympics). So I would consider my accounts to be a ""control"" case study. 

I've noticed that through the for you page, the platform is amplifying the most polarising takes from the left (from either bots or humans), and this is firstly brainrotting the progressive base by creating a new normal of what people think is the median progressive position. It's human nature to try and stand out and outdo each other, and I think this sort of algorithm is really pushing the edges of what's acceptable within the progressive base. Secondly, the platform is presenting these extreme posts to new users (like my account) to mainstream this certain perception of the left; I can only assume that the political goal is to make the left unpalatable to the general public. Just looking at the for you page for my 0 follower accounts, it looks like they are eating each other alive! None of my friends' for you pages on their long-term established twitter accounts look like this at all.

What do you guys think of my theory? any holes you can see?

With tha being said: I do recognize the importance of age and maturity in an objective debate, and I do agree that bringing age into a conversation holds merit. 

What I *don’t* agree with, but often see happen, is that some people seem to think that they therefore won the argument, even though the assumption that the other party isn’t mature enough inherently means that the playing field isn’t level so there is nothing to win.

Let me illustrate with an example what I mean: if a child insists that they should be able to vote and that they for sure know that a certain political party is best and try to step into an argument with an adult, the adult DOES and SHOULD be able to bring age and maturity into the discussion.

BUT if an adult enters the conversation with the goal of proving that they are correct, age is NEVER relevant [~Here~](https://www.reddit.com/r/nattyorjuice/s/BGgVDlTgqQ) is an example of what I mean which also, coincidentally, incentivized me to make this post (relevant context: I am a 19 year old who disagreed)

- by birthing and caring for children, women provide a service to society

- this service involves labor

- society benefits from this service, but doesn't pay for the labor it requires



Wether and how society benefits from childbirth could be the subject of lengthy discussion. At the very least:

- companies benefit from population growth through an increase in demand for goods and services

- companies benefit from population growth through a more crowded labor market, which lowers the cost of labour



How much money should be handed out is to be discussed. I would take as starting point the lower end of the cost for surrogacy. I couldn't find good numbers on this, let's say 50k $ per birth. In the US in 2023 there were 3.6 million births, so the cost for the federal government would be around 180 billion dollars, around 3% of the federal budget (6.1 trillion $ in 2023). Medicare as a reference is 10% of the federal budget.



I think what I propose differs from a more conventional subsidy in the following ways:

1. the money is handed to the woman, not the familty. She is the one that carries the labour of childbirth, she is the one that gets compensated.

2. the money is handed no strings attached. When I get paid for my work, I'm free to spend it as I wish. Should be the same here. Mothers would not be required to demonstrate that that money was spent on childcare."

For me, it all boils down to this: **Eminem fans don't actually like hip hop.** At all. They like Eminem. They may pay lip service to a couple OG artists but ultimately, Eminem fans don't like or respect hip hop as a genre or culture in any way, shape, or form. Very frequently you will hear the refrain, *""I hate rap but I love Eminem""*. *""I don't listen to rap but I always listen to Eminem's new stuff""*. Is Eminem not rap? What about Eminem sets him apart so much that other artists in the genre are unlistenable compared to him? Even Eminem, himself, admits that he owes a large part of his success due to his being white. People like seeing hip hop performed by a white person but they don't like the actual genre itself. 



It's fine to just like Eminem but his fans also have a tendency of inserting themselves into hip hop conversations just to proselytize about Eminem and his standing as the greatest MC of all time. He's not. Not even close. But they think he is because they don't like or listen to anyone else. It would be the equivalent of me listening to the Beyonce's Cowboy Carter record and inserting myself into country conversations and communities to shit on every country artist that isn't Beyonce. Eminem fans have been doing this for decades and I honestly think Eminem's fanbase is a large reason of why Eminem doesn't get the flowers, even he feels he deserves, for his career. Because frankly, while his music was good, I think he was ultimately a detriment to hip hop. A horrible, toxic fanbase that has no respect for the culture, genre, and everyone else within it that felt invited to participate in it and become self imposed gatekeepers for ""real"" hip hop. ""Real"" hip hop just being anything that Eminem does. "

0,2024-07-29,CMV: individual rights and liberties is the main determinant of prosperity ,u/honeyetsweet,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1efcbmx/cmv_individual_rights_and_liberties_is_the_main/,changemyview,"Scroll to bottom for a summary of my argument.

I will be using a time series and cross sectional analysis to support my argument that individual rights and liberties is the single largest determinant of prosperity.

Part 1 - time series 

The worst time in modern Chinese history coincided with the lowest amount of individual rights and liberties enjoyed by its people. 

In the mid-20th century, the government offed, imprisoned, and sent into hard labour millions of “upper class” people while imposing strict economic directives upon the remaining population. 

Practically, former upper class all ran away or got smashed. Former common class got told what to do for work while government owned their means for production. It’s hard to argue that this was a time when *perceived* collectivism was taken to the extreme at the expense of all individual rights and freedoms.

Then after some 40-60 million people quickly died and the economy went to dust, the government did a 180 and massively expanded individual rights and liberties. The former upper class that were still alive were freed from the hard labour camps. Private ownership of property and means of production were encouraged. Intellectual pursuit and education became rampant.

With less government intervention, free-market effects of efficient allocation of resources and entrepreneurship propelled China to the world’s number two in a few decades. Why isn’t China number one? Because number one grants its people even more individual rights and liberties.

Part 2 - cross sectional

Remember the worst time in modern Chinese history that I mentioned? At that same time, right across the bay, Hong Kong flourished as an economic center of the world. Under British rule, Hong Kong society enjoyed individual rights and freedoms, prosperity, and a high standard of living.

The same can be seen in Korea, where the North has harsh limits on individual rights and liberties while the opposite is true in the South. Again, the more-free people of the South are much more prosperous.

Conclusion

The most fundamental driver of prosperity is individual rights and freedoms. The concepts of capitalism and socialism are only symptoms of more or less individual rights and liberties (especially when corporations also enjoy similar legal status as individuals).

Therefore, my argument as that between two otherwise identical societies, the one with greater individual rights and liberties will necessarily be the more prosperous one. Then it follows that all societies should strive towards emphasizing individual rights and liberties instead of collectivism in an effort to maximize prosperity."

Ever since Kamala Harris officially entered the presidential election, libs have RAMPED up their assertions that Trump is too old (he is), calling him ""the oldest candidate in history"" and earnestly accusing anyone who brings up Joe Biden's age and recent developments as ""projecting.""

Do you people not hear yourself? You propped up this 269 year old corpse for the last 4 years, and deflected from his age and diminshed cognitive acuity until you literally couldn't any longer. He agreed to that debate for whatever God forsaken reason, got ostensibly wrecked, and there was no room to hide or make excuses. Thrust into an unprecedented (and completely unmitigated) PR nightmare, the guy who y'all said was sharp as a tack, who Morning Joe called ""the best Biden ever and f you if you disagree"" suddenly faced insurmountable calls to step aside, and finally did so at the 11th hour and 59th minute, leaving the DNC to select a new nominee without voter input, at the same time y'all are crying that democracy is on the ballot.

I'm not here to whitewash Trump's own age or unfitness for office. I'm simply baffled, frustrated and honestly a tad angered that liberals know full well how hypocritical this behavior is, but are so God damn smug that they don't care.

This whole mess could have been avoided if Biden had pledged to be a one term POTUS all along and had laid the framework for an open primary from day 1. He didn't, you went along with the delusion that he wasn't too old/too diminshed, forced an unnecessary and totally preventable PR disaster, and all but completely eroded your political capital. You also didn't like Kamala very much until 12 minutes ago, now you act like she's the second coming of JFK?

Spoiler alert: Trump is gonna win, and any damage he does is YOUR fault."

I’m 20, I’ve followed politics for literally all my life, I’ve been both a (soft) Biden and Trump supporter at various points, and now I genuinely can’t find a reason to support either major party.

I’m not politically disaffected, I love my country and I believe in voting, I vote every year and I know it counts. However, all I see within the two parties is hatred. Biden and Harris preach about unity, but then proceed to call Republicans autocratic, and Trump’s does nothing but talk in all caps about the border on TS.

We are in a 50/50 country whether we want to admit it or not, and because we’re a democracy (where the peoples’ will is objective above all else), I can’t get down with the idea that our ideological disagreements are just differences of opinion, but differences of right versus wrong. This isn’t a comic book, I don’t want to hear about good and evil.

So, I’ve come the conclusion that the best solution lies in the middle, utilizing both parties to our advantage. I think our most effective leaders are the ones in the middle (like Joe Manchin, Susan Collins, etc), and my belief is furthered because they don’t rant about most social issues like the major parties leaders (fr, stfu about the border and abortion, I fundamentally do not care). I really just believe in limited government, and not in a libertarian “get rid of all the military bases” sense, but more just stop spending a shit ton of money Congress, don’t make me pay taxes, and make sure the Russia/China/Iran/NK axis is weak and broken.

However, I’m not just here to rant, I have an election to vote in this November. I could vote for RFK Jr., but I’ve lost faith in him recently, I agree with a lot of what he says about the lockdowns, but that’s about it. I think functionally speaking he’s running a pretty bad campaign. So I’m likely gonna vote for either Harris (pending the nomination) or Trump, and I’m really not leaning towards either rn. However, whoever I do vote for, I’ll have a reason for picking them, and it’s possible that I’d stick with that party for the foreseeable future. So, in light of this community’s “change my view”, sell me on the party of your choice, assuming anyone’s read this far."

Major obstacles for:

Dems- The big reason i didnt vote Biden was due to comments made during the 2020 riots by Dems. Kamala Harris told them not to let up despite unions asking all politicians to calm the rhetoric. I had my head split openand got a bad concussion during those riots. Whilst reform of police is necessary i feel the anti cop sentiment is hard to swallow. ACAB. I think Bidens foreign policy has been very poor. Continuing the supply of weaponery to the IDF (and yes Israel deserves to be safe), afghan etc. I also think therevwas dishonesty around the capabilities of Biden. I think Kamala and Dems lied about his vitality. Bidens border a disaster.

GOP: why should I vote a criminal, as a law enforcer it seems hypocritical. Words against our vets like McCain are disgraceful. His rhetoric was unhelpful during the Capitol riot. Whilst i actually think Trump is not anti gay (and i respect comments he made at the UN) Vance has a history of homophobia. Both of them of misogyny. Hes given no clear policy on almost everything. I support Ukraine and i think hes a danger for them.

Both: i think both sides rhetoric is actually a threat to democracy. Weve had an attack on the Capitol and an assasination attempt on a former President. Project 2025, i dont think is a Trump handbook but the foundation are a bunch of creeps and im glad Trump booed it. "

Red States: The opposite ie, Florida, Texas, Utah, Arizona, etc. 

In recent years dating back to even 2012 millions of Americans have been moving out of blue states and into red states, at crazy high numbers. The states in which people have been leaving the most being very blue including California, New York, Illinois, etc. Into more widely recognized red states such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona. A lot of the people who are making this move, studies have shown are heavily liberal and religiously vote democratic. 

My main point is that these people are absolute hypocrites. Everything positive that they like about the Red state in which they decided to move too have a lot to do with the work that republican voters have voted for, for many years. All the rules and regulations as well as the political ideals that make you want to move to these states, we’re all fought for by the voters and Conservative politicians. Everything from the low cost of living to the low crime in said areas. I feel like it is extremely disingenuous for you to leave the blue states you came from, and the policies in which you voted for, the same policies that made you want to leave in the first place. Then come over to a conservative state and bring those same political ideals with you. 

This is extremely hypocritical shouldn’t living in San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Seattle, etc, be your preferred destinations? These cities fully encompass liberal policies and principles. This should be your heaven in which you made and voted for. What is the point of coming to red states and turning them blue? Just for all states to end up like California? Now we all just have shitty crime infested places to live in. I simply just do not understand the logic behind this.i have never met a Republican voter with strong conservative viewpoints, say that they want to move to a blue state 

We see how these things have already started to affect the national stage. We saw in 2020 how millions of democrats from California flooded into  Nevada and Arizona (which used to be strong republican strongholds) and turn them blue come election time. We see this same trend happening in Texas, Utah, Florida, and Georgia. 

Again I believe these people are very hypocritical and do not actually believe in anything that they vote for. Otherwise why would you not want to live under what you voted for?

He stood up to them when they were bullying a helpless kid. Where is the accountability on the part of the black gang?

What that means for me:

* I lack any strong emotions (joy, anger, sadness, etc., all feel 'hollow' to me. They don't come from my mind nor do I feel them in my skin and bones, they're just 'there.')
* I lack basically any empathy and compassion (I imagine there's a little bit given I don't actively hurt people, but it's not as though I would throw up from the disgust of doing such a thing, at least I can't imagine I would.)
* It has influenced my practical romantic and sexual attraction despite my lack of desire for such a thing to happen (aroace in practice despite having homosexual/homoromantic urges in fantasy, because I literally cannot feel attachment when it comes to romanticism and sexual attraction, no matter how hard I try - the only thing that even has a chance of working is an intense regimen of prescribed and novel drugs like intranasal oxytocin or empathogenic drugs, and even those probably won't work.)
* Speaking of 'lack of desire', I have no hobbies or interests, and I physically cannot feel any urge to live for anything. Not my parents, not my pets, not my friends or the hope that I might find a partner (see above bullet point for why...)
* I do not feel strong platonic attraction/companionship at all, despite how 'close' I am to my friends.

All in all, I am kitted out for what can only be described as a miserable existence. I'm aware of it. You reading this are probably aware of it, no matter what you type in the comments while feigning the idea that I can have a good life regardless. Despite the fact that the above things (or the lack of the above issues) are my greatest 'wants', I will not live to see the treatment for this condition, if there even can be such a thing that doesn't directly, manually alter brain chemistry and structure through some magic, and even if I do, I will have wasted half my life away being this miserable, at which point there is very little point anyways.

  
No matter how hard I try to better myself, I will always be this way. That is a fact, if my diagnosis for Schizoid Personality Disorder ends up, well, being diagnosed (which it certainly looks to be, given I check basically every box on the list in multiple ways.) I will never be cured. Despite this clear injustice, however, I am not given agency over my own life. The government of the country in which I reside does not allow me to legally access services that would allow me to take my own life, and those don't even exist where I live. I would have to go abroad. In fact, I would be forcibly admitted to a ward solely for the expression of a desire to commit suicide with mental illness in front of any professional.

  
Given that suicide quite literally is the only thing I have that can remotely be considered a 'cure' in any sense at this point, it seems unfair that I am incapable of being 'cured' this way, and that's an understatement. It is infinitely more cruel to force someone to push through something that is entirely immovable than it is to simply let them stop pushing. The wider population of my country and of the world seem to believe that everyone can push the boulder of life like this, and the people who can't push it, a lot of the time they end up being treated and can push it, at least a little bit, and with great difficulty. However, there are people like me who don't have any strength to push it from birth. We are incapable of doing such a thing. They look at us, and try and treat us, try and make us muster the strength to push this boulder, and when we inevitably can't, we are left to fend for ourselves with no way out. We're strapped to this boulder, forced to push it, even if we can't. It seems offensive on a whole other level to deny people this way out.

  
I still maintain this position on conditions that are curable, too, albeit with very long treatment periods. There are probably only a few instances of this, but I imagine that personality disorders like my (probably) own apply to this as well. With time, and with extensive, intense treatment such as weekly therapy, constantly pushing your limits, you may no longer fit the symptoms or be treated in my case, or 'cured' in others. On the other hand, though...this takes years. Decades for some. By the time it does end up working, as I've mentioned above, I will be old. Far too old to pursue what I desire in the primetime of my life. It's like you've skipped the best parts of your life, and have gone from a plateau of disappointment to either another plateau of disappointment or only very mild increases in quality of life because you're far too old to enjoy it in the same way anymore. It doesn't seem any more fair to me to prolong someone's life like this, even if you are making it 'better', if all you're doing is removing the problem when it's too late to make use of the time when it actually would have been nice to have it gone.

  
When it comes to assisted suicide, however, I do believe it should be vetted. Full sanity checks to make sure a severely incoherent person can't just get access to the service without even knowing what they're walking into, ensuring the person actually has the condition that they're talking about (so multiple diagnoses from different individuals), a full write-up of every short-term treatment that's been tried, and only then should you be allowed the service. I do think this service should be made easy and streamlined to get (let alone actually available in the first place) for the people with these conditions though.) It's not fair on those who are suffering to keep pushing them when there's genuinely no hope. Not everyone was born with the capacity to be happy inside of them, at least not for most of their life anyways. There are outliers that society conveniently ignores because this topic is so taboo and because ignoring this level of pain is easier than trying to address it, which I think is a view that can really only be described as merciless, or inhuman. I'm more than happy for someone to try and CMV though, as I expect this is rife with personal bias thanks to my (probable) condition."
0,2024-07-29,CMV: Usain Bolt is the greatest “GOAT” athlete of all time,u/72iniwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1effp60/cmv_usain_bolt_is_the_greatest_goat_athlete_of/,changemyview,"Now that the Olympics are back on, and we are witnessing greatness from so many athletes across so many different types of sports, it has me even more impressed with Usain Bolt’s accomplishments and makes me even more convinced that he is the greatest GOAT athlete in sports history. 


Obviously, it’s nearly impossible to really compare athletes across different sports, but I feel like there are two things that you CAN use to compare: how dominant an athlete was over their peers in their sport, and how popular that sport is to play. For instance, Wayne Gretzky was by far the most dominant ice hockey player  of all time, but he loses some points by my GOAT metric because ice hockey just isn’t played by very many people on the international stage and generally has a high barrier to entry even in areas where it is popular.

To me, this is what makes Usain Bolt the most dominant athlete of all time. Not only was he extremely dominant against his contemporaries, but he was dominant in sprinting, an event that most people in the world have tried at some point in their life, whether in a formal track setting or just running around on the playground. I genuinely believe that if there was someone on Earth that was a faster sprinter than Bolt, we would know about it. 

So, what do people think? Are there any metric-breaking GOATs that are just too good that I’m underestimating?"

Whenever I see spelling reforms that go any farther than using thorn, it just ends up looking strange, since it’s both recognizable and not recognizable at the same time. It has all the problems of using a completely new alphabet and all the problems of not using one. I think the futhorc is better than Shavian because it would be easier to get going. There’s already plenty of literature that uses the futhorc, and it is widely considered cool because it’s associated with Vikings. What’s more, it’s historically significant, which, for purists like myself, adds to its appeal. Secondly, many of the glyphs will already be familiar to folks because they share roots with the Latin script. ᚱ looks like r, ᚠ looks like f, ᛗ looks like m, ᛏ looks like t, ᛁ looks like i, ᚻ looks like h, etc. So it’s actually easier to learn than some might expect. Thirdly, it was made specifically for English. Some spelling reformists will use glyphs like æ, Ð, ŋ, and even ø, all of which were originally used for languages that are not English. The futhorc has glyphs for pretty much all of these, and they look way better (ᚫ᛫ᚦ᛫ᛝ᛫ᛟ). Also, some spelling reforms remind me all too well of the revolting IPA (I’m saying this as a linguistics nerd). Anyways, those are my reasons, so go ahead and critique away!"

230,2024-07-29,cmv: Reddit is dying,u/Key-Abalone-3948,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1efjhht/cmv_reddit_is_dying/,changemyview,"It seems that most subreddits are dying. The active users per subreddit on average are less than 1/50 of the total subscribed. For example, wallstreetbets has 16 mln followers and 25 000 active users. The posts dont get more than 10k likes usually. The same goes for the other subs if you check: it seems that users are disappearing.

Why are they disappearing?

Barrier to use: Reddit is a little bit different from other socials. I think it is more similar to Twitter than to Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. If you have Reddit, you should know english. I convinced my friends to install Reddit, but since they dont know english, they created an account and never used the app. Furthermore, before posting or commenting you have to wait to get karma or your account must have a minimum age. This led my friends to stop using Reddit and unistall it. 

Non political subs becoming political: Reddit popular subs are only a few. Interestingasfuck, Facepal, Pics, Worldnews, and so on. If you noticed, almost every sub I mentioned, has become propaganda. This completely ruins the user experience. Reddit has become one sided social, where liberals ""are in power"". You wont see any anti Biden posts on Facepalm, but it is filled with anti Trump posts. Pics subreddit is becoming the same. 

Bans: Reddit is famous for banning people for no reason at all or banning for stupid things. Mods decide what an user posts and what he can comment, if they dont like it they ban you. Most of posts get deleted at the moment you post them, because there are a lot of rules that you have to follow. You end up not posting anything because you get frustrated. My accounts were banned 5 times always for the same reason, I commented on a subreddit that banned me, I forgot. 
Anyways, I wish Reddit was more like Twitter. A place where hate speech is allowed for all and not only for liberals. On twitter liberals and conservatives can post and comment, here only liberals. 

Bugs: I am using the app. At time of writing, I cant correct mistakes because when I click on the text I wrote before, it returns automatically below. Reddit has problems showing notification correctly. 

Content: Content I see on Reddit is mostly taken from Twitter and other social. Most of the content is always the same, also because you cant really see if something was already posted on the sub because your query has to be precise. For example, I am a fan of Southpark and there is the subreddit for that. I left it after posts where always like ""who is the best character?"" ""what is your favourite ep?"" and so on. 

This is why people are leaving Reddit. There is also a bot problem, there are a lot of them lately. They can post and comment and it is difficult to spot them. If Reddit changed those, issues their userbase would boom. "

0,2024-07-30,CMV: Germany is not a free country,u/Most-Travel4320,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1efmymp/cmv_germany_is_not_a_free_country/,changemyview,"As the title says, I do not believe that the way that Germany is run constitutes a ""free country"". I believe it essentially functions similarly to how Russia and Hungary operate, with a politicized judiciary and the idea of ""social order"" being more important than the individual liberties which define liberal democracy, with the primary difference between the two being Germany is progressive and Hungary/Russia are right wing. Here are a few reasons why  I believe such things

1. The treatment of AfD by the German courts.

Despite the fact that there is nothing the AfD advocates that is explicitly undemocratic or against the German constitution, the AfD and its members have been targeted by the German courts for what I believe are political reasons related to its anti migrant stance. The AfD has been surveiled and wiretapped by the BND and various local and regional police forces, this surveillance has been upheld in court, its members have been ruled unable to possess firearms at a time when statistically they have faced much more political violence than any other group, and, and it has baselessly been placed on a list of ""suspected extremist organizations"". Despite my reservations towards their pro-Russian position, this, in my opinion, is bare faced political persecution that is unacceptable in any society which calls itself free, or liberal.

2. Censorship of right wing media

Germany has been notorious for banning the sale of various media from other countries, not all of which has any connections to fascism or authoritarianism. A good example of this would be the game "" The Great Rebellion"", which a German court ordered Steam to stop selling somewhat recently (This game has right libertarian themes and does not promote authoritarian ideology in any way shape or form).

3. Some of the most strict hate speech laws in the western world

Self explanatory, this violates the concept of free speech inherently, hate speech is in fact free speech

4. The very idea that certain ideas need to be protected with the force of the law

Being a free society is not simply based on having a strong constitution. Being a free society means individual liberties are protected, including the right to disagree with the constitution.

5. Protest suppression

Germany, unlike other western countries, has been notorious for suppressing pro-Palestine demonstrations in the past year, and in many cases all but virtually outlaw such protests. While I am a US conservative and found the recent protests in DC deplorable, I also recognize that people have a right to assembly and a right to speech, and Germany seemingly doesn't.

You won't change my mind by trying to re frame my definition of a free society where individual liberty does not hold primacy. I frankly do not see such justifications as all that different from the ""social harmony"" line of countries like China and Russia. You can only change it by demonstrating to me that Germany in fact does respect individual rights to a degree that would make it fit within the purview of the classical liberal ideas which underpin modern democracy.

I don't measure my happiness based on my wealth relative to someone else. I just want the best standard of living I can have. So long as my standard of living is increasing, it doesn't matter to me that the people at the top could be increasing their standard of living however many times faster that I am.

If I had a magic button I could push which would give everyone 5 times the wealth they have now (say its given in resources or something so we don't ruin it with inflation)
then I'd happily push the button fully knowing that its going to make wealth inequality considerably ""worse"".  For me taking Billions out of poverty and drastically improving the standard of living of all the people on lower incomes would be absolutely amazing and the button would be an amazing thing with no downsides. I don't see what harm it would have done at all?
I can see that it creates a power imbalance but I don't fully see the damage? Yes the rich will have more power but everyone's lives have still drastically improved so its not like anyone would want to go back to how things were before.

It would be possible to reduce wealth inequality by getting in the way of the people generating the most value and thus stopping them from being able to be rewarded with so much for themselves because you have capped how much value they can generate for the world in for the first place. However you would then be taking away even more value from the rest of the world who miss out on the good and services and also tax revenue.

The other option which I think is what responses will suggest is to still allow them to create the value for the world but just tax them much more highly so they they are not rewarded so much for it. The less they are rewards for their efforts the less value will be created. This is just a simply fact of incentives. It has absolutely nothing to do with whether ""they are getting enough already"". Its just how incentives work."

For reference, I (21M) am a college student and soldier in the National Guard. I am fortunate enough to be on a variety of military and academic scholarships and will not pay a dime for my education. I am pretty moderate politically but topics like this make me much more right leaning than I would like to believe.

Obviously, I am extremely biased in this topic. I joined the military for the purpose of being debt free upon graduation from college, and it seems more and more like that was pointless. I feel like the act of forgiving those who took out loans they couldn’t pay back totally discredits those who made sacrifices to avoid said debt. Those sacrifices include (but are not limited to) joining the military, attending cheaper state schools instead of private universities, working/paying your way through school, paying your debt off post graduation, receiving academic/athletic scholarships, etc. This does not even mention the huge number that choose to go into trades to avoid a debt burden.

I understand that there are predatory student loan agencies that prey on ignorant young people, and I agree these companies need regulation. However, there are 5 predatory loan agencies on every main street of every town in America. If you say an individual that has graduated high school is not capable of making a decision to take on debt, when are they? Why are those same people capable to join the military/get a car loan/gamble, etc? 

This whole rant doesn’t even begin to discuss the strain on our increasing deficit this will induce. The idea of loan forgiveness is inconsiderate and unjust to those who make difficult decisions to avoid a debt burden.

Please try to change my view, I have yet to hear a compelling counter argument. "

6,2024-07-30,CMV: real fur is cruel and unnecessary and the fur industry should evolve into something better,u/ProfessionalThink497,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1efxxlb/cmv_real_fur_is_cruel_and_unnecessary_and_the_fur/,changemyview,"There are two basic reasons why I oppose the fur industry. The first is that I do not agree with killing animals for frivolous, luxury items. The second is that there is a lot of cruelty in the fur industry. In short, fur is cruel and unnecessary.

Animal fur is derived from either fur factory farming or trapping. Most of the animals raised in fur factory farms are mink, though several million foxes, raccoon dogs (not related to the American raccoon) and chinchillas are also raised in fur farms.

Mink and foxes are carnivores who, in the wild, would have a range that extends from a few acres to a few miles. Yet on fur farms they are kept in tiny cages. Extreme confinement of the animals allows the farms to maximize production, cramming as many animals as they can into the space they have. This leads to animals becoming neurotic and engaging in what are called stereotype behavior. Basically, this means the animals go crazy and spin around in circles because they have nothing else to do.

Mink are semi-aquatic animals who, in the wild, spend much of their time swimming in streams and creeks. In fur farms they are denied access to swimming water. Meanwhile, foxes often cannibalize their young in fur farms. This is believed to happen because fur farmers can’t figure out which vixens are alphas, and a beta caged next to an alpha may naturally be inclined to eat her young.

The animals are eventually killed by gassing or electrocution. Nether method damages the fur, though gassing can be particularly scary for mink. Remember that I mentioned mink are semi-aquatic animals. They can hold their breath for longer periods of time than most mammals. They become frantic when the carbon monoxide gas enters the chamber and die in misery.

Fur farming arguably causes more misery than fur trapping, just because the animals spend their entire lives in cages. But fur trapping has it’s own cruelty concerns.

Leghold traps are designed to close on an animals paw and restrain the creature until a trapper comes back and clubs the animal to death. These traps have steel jaws and they have to close very tightly to restrain a fighting mad wild animal. Animals in leghold traps often have broken bones, torn tendons and ligaments and even shattered teeth from biting the trap.

Other animals are killed in body crushing traps, like Conibears, that close with a metal bar breaking the animals back. Others are strangled in wire snares or drowned in leghold traps that are set under water. That would be for beavers and muskrats primarily.

There is a lot of suffering in the fur industry. It takes an average of 40 animals to make a single, full length fur coat. For fur trim, each two trims mean the death of one fox. With coyote a manufacturer might get 3 trims from one animal, but what’s the point? We have many alternatives.

We no longer need to kill animals for fur. That is my case, and I now await to see if anyone changes my view."

Media literacy is a skill that everyone should have. The media is gonna meedj. They are obviously going to push narratives. They are going to distort facts. But if you cant identify when that is happening, thats on you. You should always corroborate stories that might resonate with you, and you want to amplify on your networks. If you disseminate something, make sure its accurate; it covers all the logical bases; or short of that, say something like ""90% of this is horseshit, but they have an interesting point about X."" 

And also, all media is useful. Even media that is clearly wrong. Read it anyways. Understand what they are saying and why they are saying it. Be critical about the BS they spout, but dont ever disregard it out of hand. "

If I don’t respond to you it means that you didn’t read the following nuance. Otherwise I will try my best to respond to everyone (may be earlier for some than others, but I won't cherry pick).

So for this cmv, before I step into any debate I need to clarify by what I mean by the word “viral”, as it is a subjective statement. If you are in a more niche community (like knitting) going viral will mean a different thing compared to if you are in a very popular community (like gym). For the purpose of this cmv, there won’t be a set definition for the word “viral” (like if I said 100,000+ followers or whatever). So here is more or less how I define it: 

""Viral"" refers to content that spreads rapidly and widely within a specific community or across multiple communities, resulting in significant engagement and visibility over a short period of time. For this cmv, when I say “making it on social media” I mean going viral.

So I only recently thought of this and am genuinely not sure if I fully believe in this statement. But the more I dissect it in my head, the less and less arguments I can find to disprove this point. I am very interested in what this fascinating community has to say.

1. Jupiter’s atmosphere has an abundant, unlimited, and self-replenishing supply of hydrogen gas, which also happens to be extremely flammable

2. Humans inherently enjoy setting things ablaze and would get profound happiness and utility from igniting the largest object in the solar system that isn’t already on fire

3. Jupiter would become a second sun, providing Earth with another source of sunlight and warmth, which would have immense benefits on agriculture, renewable energy, and mental health in the arctic circle

Therefore, my argument is that humanity should set Jupiter on fire as soon as it’s feasible by flying a hydrogen bomb rocket into its atmosphere and detonating it.

Seeing tons of blackpill content and being exposed to all of these things, it really gives you a different view on the entire world and dating market in general, simply because the things that are said in the blackpill are TRUE and can be noticed everywhere, not to mention the studies (r/blackpillscience).  

Now, to come to my main point, with all of the information that I have consumed from the blackpill I can now tell u my points of view on why women have it significantly more easier than men in dating and life IN general. When you are born into this life, what do you do? Go to kindergarten, go to school, and all for WHAT? To get MONEY. Which brings me to point number one. 

1. Women have easier ventures of making money just by looking decent (ALOT EASIER TO DO WITH MAKEUP). With OnlyFans and other pay to see platforms on the rise, women have it easier than ever to open OnlyFans and whatever platforms to get money. Imagine working for 10 years in college studying to be a doctor and the second u start working an OnlyFans girl outearns u with barely any work or effort. This isnt only ofcourse limited to OnlyFans but other platforms like Twitch (just take a fucking gander at the Pools and Hot Tubs section) or streamers like Pokimane etc who have literally made their career just from simps (seriously, has anyone ever here opened a Pokimane stream and thought YEAH this entertaining). I could only speak on about this stuff like women using men for free food during dates and getting their pills baid or just straight up scamming down bad men. 

Now that point is out the way, lets say that u have money in life. WHAT else do u look for after that? Love. 

2. Women have it infinitely easier to find partners with dating apps existing. Before you say that online is not real life, just do a quick Google search and u can find out that close to 50% of couples meet online in recent times. In these apps, women get insane amounts of attention NO matter how good they look. Just type in tinder experiment into YouTube and just check out some of these profiles created, unattractive, overweight women with bad bios, still hundreds of likes every day, while the average, well groomed man gets practically only a couple per day. Just check out r/Tinder, the whole sub is full of men asking why do they only get barely no likes, and them being gaslighted into heaven with stuff like (ohh bad pictures bro, bad bio bro, your personality isnt being shown off in ur pictures bro) while the most obvious answer is that they just dont look that good enough. With these apps, truly no woman can be lonely, and the women that refuse to use those apps say that men there want to use them only for their body are just stupid. Youre telling me the hundreds of likes everyday are all men that want to use you for ur body? No, they arent, its just that these women arent really attracted to most men on those apps and the ones that these ''lonely'' women are attracted to probably have better options than you. 

3. Women can easily look better than most men with the use of makeup, increasing attractiveness by 2 to 3 points with it on, which ofcourse makes finding an ideal partner easier. 

4. Height barely matters for women, while height is the second most important trait for men only getting beaten by facial attractiveness, even if u look decent as a man, u will still be disqualified cause of ur height by a good amount of women."

I'm very involved in the metal scene and absolutely love the band I'm apart of. I'm 18 years old and I wear lots of chains spikes and leather. I catch a lot of stares, I know I look strange and unusual but I love it. 

Now, about the wrong generation part. It's a very common saying and mostly comes from regular Joe's who think just because they wear a hat backwards they should have been apart of the 80's. My case comes from not fitting in at all. I was never bullied, I'm tall and muscular. However, I have never met someone else who dresses or thinks like me.

I've tried to make friends but most people are either scared or weirded out by me. I simply follow the style of my favorite bands. Another thing is modern lingo and what's considered cool. All the phrases people use sound so moronic to me. The only social media I have is Reddit and Facebook. My Facebook is only used as promo for my band. I feel lonely and outcasted. 

All in all, I think when things started taking off in the mid to late 80's I would have been a better fit."

Also im from the UK but these trends seem to be global.

I want to start by saying that topics on race and the social implications of a persons race is important , in terms of understanding how a racialised person will be treated in society(e.g institutions like police , healthcare , education and accounting for interscetionality etc) .

But I’ve found that pushing race to the forefront and being hyper aware of race is both bad for the racialised (the other) and white people . I’ve witnessed firsthand and  gathered from many social platforms that white people - at the mention of race - will feel : sympathy/empathy/understanding , discomfort , hostility - or will straight up invalidate the racism you will try and talk about .

However, with the global rise in far right politics/attitudess/racism , its likely that  the negative reactions are predominant .

Even as someone who literaly reads about race related topics , and is very well versed in socialogy relating to racial dynamics and race relations - unless you have a range of statistics at the ready (keyword - range ) , speaking about race in any anecdotal form , or qualitatively - will likely turn off white people . 

Honestly , I dont know what needs to be done , but talking about race and racism in the current way we do just isn't working . And this is coming from someone who has experienced a books worth of racism and the extensive psychiatric effects of it . It just does'nt help to harp on it with anyone who hasn't experienced what you have - lest they feel uncomfortable and and you feel invalidated.

0,2024-07-30,cmv: Nazi rule over euope would be similar to taliban and Islamic republic over Afghanistan and iran,u/SpeakerSenior4821,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eg584w/cmv_nazi_rule_over_euope_would_be_similar_to/,changemyview,"my point is that nazi's had unrealistically extremist views about the world, very similar to what Taliban has right now and very similar to what iran had in the day of 1979 revolution

here i will talk about what happened in iran in the past 40 years with extremists ruling the country and what will happen to taliban and what would have happend to europe if hitler ruled it

iran had extremely socialist - Islamist - internationalist view's on the beginning of the revolution, they invited all shia's(an school of islam) to do similar revolutions and create islamic utopia in their countries, it quickly lead to war with saddam whose country was almost half shia

the harsh reality hit hard, khomeini(leader of iran between 1979 till his death on 1989) had seen failure of his stupid idea's by his own eyes, mass human wave assault's with slogan of do it and god will win the battle for you, had turned into disaster, sales of expensively bought weapon's for cheap prices before the war to other countries in wishes of a peaceful Islamic utopia which god protects it had turned into another war-determining disaster

as time passed, iran had to leave more and more of its Islamic revolution values behind, once they executed you for having used drugs and women having their hair's a little bit out, you were arrested if you had tv's with global channel's access

now its all gone but in name, none the laws are really practiced, they tried to practice the hijab one in 20200 and it ended up in a disastrous protests for government

they are leaving more of their values and giving up more everyday to just catch up with the world

  
Taliban has to do the same, they have banned women from educating, leaving home without a male guardian(only brother-father-husband) and many worse things, they have banned their only business(opiom) because now they have an Islamic utopia which god will feed, why do bad things to gain money when god can feed you for practicing?

they eventually will lift all this crazy stuff, or else? they will remain behind and get destroyed, the same way that native ame4ricans not modernizing with the world never could survive and were subjected and destroyed

hitler and his followers would see the same thing and stop their extremism by pass of time, they would eventually understand that killing all other ethnic groups will never make germans better nation, it would only make them less powerful than their enemies

and a request, dont talk a word about jews in the comments, they were less than a fraction of people nazi's killed and had no role on front lines, while Ukrainians could have made germans win if nazi's were not idiots, im sick of hearing 6 mil jews died every time i talk about why 80 million people died in a war, more Muslims died in ww2 than jews, both killed by hitler and with guns

can anyone change my mind?"
0,2024-07-30,CMV: people should only be allowed to vote in an election if they know what the election is for,u/Own_Wave_1677,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eg5d1r/cmv_people_should_only_be_allowed_to_vote_in_an/,changemyview,"I think this is a pretty common discussion most people had with their friends at least once in their life, something along the lines of ""people should pass a test/quiz to be allowed to vote"". It isn't always clear what the quiz should include, and there is obviously the argument that everyone being allowed to vote no matter what should be a positive.

I think there is one specific that people should know to be allowed to vote and that is who or what they are electing through the election. If voters don't know that it is kind of a mess.

This happens mainly in parliamentary democracies, but this isn't a post about the pros and cons of parliamentary democracy. I will use it for my example because i think it illustrates the problem well.

In a parliamentary democracy you elect the members of the parliament. The members of the parliament then have to choose a prime minister that has the support of the majority of the parliament. Not knowing this damages the democratic life of the country in two ways in my opinion.

First, let's say there are three parties running and they get 30%, 30% and 40% of the votes. Nobody can choose the prime minister alone. The two parties with 30% have pretty similar ideas, so they ally with each other, they have the majority and elect the prime minister. People that don't know how that works than come out of the woods and start saying that it is unfair because the party with 40% (usually their party) won the elections and that other parties are bad because they won't let them govern even when they win the election and that changing things through voting is impossible because ""the establishment"" wouldn't let them vote if it actually changed something etc.

Second, there are people that see that the prime minister is someone that is not the leader of the 40% party and they say that ""this guy wasn't elected"" ""this guy is governing without winning an election"" etc. As if the prime minister was... illegitimate because it is not the guy they voted for. This usually coincide with the scenario in point one, but it also has some extra factor, for example the fact that when two parties come to an agreement they could choose a figure that is not the leader of either party as the prime minister to keep each other in check. There is also the fact that in some parliamentary democracies it is pretty common to change government without having an election: the government loses the support of the majority, but it is not time for new elections yet. The members of parliament can just find a new majority that can support a government. Not knowing how this works and why this happens makes it seem to these people as if they were robbed of something they should have, which generates hunger and makes elections seem unfair.

If i had to make a parallel for the US election, i guess in the US before a presidential election you should make sure that people that think that the one with more votes wins shouldn't be allowed to vote? Because in the US it doesn't work like that, it depends on the electoral colleges and stuff, democrats pretty much always have more votes if you only look at the aggregate number across the US. If someone thought like that, every elections won by republican would be stolen because ""we got more votes but somehow we lost the election"". That would create distrust in the democratic process of the country.

This is not a post about government systems. I'm not looking for stuff like ""don't have a parliamentary system then"" or ""abolish electoral colleges"". Changing the system is always an option, but this is about people that vote without knowing how the system works, not about people that want to change it.

Also, yes, testing every voter would be incredibly impractical. This is not about whether we should do it or not based on logistics. It's more like, if it was possible to test people without logistic problems, would it be the right thing to do to test people before letting them vote? Or is there a reason everyone should be able to vote?

I also aknowledge that part of the people complaining about ""non elected president"" or ""but we won"" aren't actually dumb, they know what's going on but they are complaining because they lost. I still think there is a part of people that don't actually know how their democracy works, and because of that they become resentful against democracy. If they had to learn this stuff to vote, some of them would be forced to learn about it and actually improve the democratic life of their country."

The reason that your videos do not grow is because they aren’t engaging enough people.  And if the algorithm sees that a video isn’t engaging, it will not push it out as much. You need to make better videos if you want your channel to grow. You need to add tags, relevant keywords, good description, good editing and humor (sometimes, case by case basis) in order to make your videos engaging. 

You also need a good eye catching thumbnail in order to reel people in to watch your video in the first place and a good hook. If the algorithm detects all these things then your video will be pushed out to more people. You also need to center your content around a theme, for example if you upload gaming videos and then you randomly upload a sports commentary, it’s going to flop because people only follow you for one thing.

In the end, it’s not the algorithm’s fault you don’t get views. It’s you.

This is happening all over the place online, you go to dating apps, men looking for companionship, you have escorts on there, scammers, women trying to exploit men in any way they can to come up financially, and it's often the lonely or unattractive men that are targeted. 

  
I believe this is just as bad if not worst than a wealthy man exploiting a woman who needs help financially. Women give you a set amount of time, and then you're out. At least in the case of a man exploiting a woman she gets a place to stay, resources, etc.. Not saying it's a vacation, but she is getting something to help her in life.

Lack of predators, a fast rate of reproduction, and the casual nature of current hunting have resulted in a resilient and ever-increasing population of wild pigs.

Therefore, I believe the federal government should form the Swine Eradication Corps, a collection of professional hunters fully funded and equipped to eradicate the wild pig population.

QUANTITATIVE

Quantitative research can be vulnerable to certain biases, such as information bias, omitted variable bias, sampling bias, and selection bias.

quantitative research can indeed be vulnerable to various biases. Here's a brief overview of each:

Information Bias: Occurs when the data collected is inaccurate or misrepresented. This can result from measurement errors, misclassification, or errors in data collection methods.

Omitted Variable Bias: Arises when a relevant variable is not included in the analysis, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between variables.

Sampling Bias: Happens when the sample is not representative of the population being studied. This can result from non-random sampling methods, leading to skewed results.

Selection Bias: Occurs when the process of selecting participants for the study introduces systematic differences between groups. This can happen if the participants are not randomly selected or if certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented.

Each of these biases can significantly impact the validity and reliability of quantitative research findings.


QUALITATIVE 

Qualitative research can be vulnerable to certain biases, such as information bias, omitted variable bias, sampling bias, and selection bias

qualitative research is also susceptible to these biases. Here's how each can manifest:

Information Bias: In qualitative research, this can occur if the data collected is inaccurate or misrepresented. This might be due to interviewer bias, where the researcher's expectations influence the data collection, or due to respondents providing socially desirable answers.

Omitted Variable Bias: Though less common in qualitative research, this can happen if certain relevant themes or variables are not considered or explored during data collection and analysis, potentially leading to an incomplete understanding of the phenomenon being studied.

Sampling Bias: This occurs when the sample does not adequately represent the diversity of the population. For example, if only certain groups are interviewed or observed, the findings may not be generalizable to the broader population.

Selection Bias: In qualitative research, this can occur when the selection of participants is not random or systematic, leading to a non-representative sample. This might happen if participants are chosen based on convenience or accessibility, rather than purposive or theoretical sampling strategies.

Awareness and mitigation strategies for these biases are crucial to ensure the credibility and trustworthiness of qualitative research findings."

WRONG. There’s value in hard work that’s inherent to the work itself, even if it’s just that focus can take your mind off of the inevitable, even if it’s just for a moment. You might fail. You might be humiliated. GOOD. That’s how you know it’s a worthy endeavor.

It’s the negatives that you get to write off using the nothing matters statements, not the potential positives.

You had the guts to get on stage and try standup but you did poorly and got humiliated? Awesome! You did something the vast majority of people are terrified to do, and you failed and you weren’t funny and you were an embarrassment. Whatever. One day we’ll all be dead. It doesn’t matter.

You want to learn the guitar but it’ll be hard and you’ll have to figure out how to afford one, and it might not matter anyway because even if you get really good and everyone loves it, it still will eventually be thought of by humanity for the last time and freeze in the inevitable heat death of the universe? Boo hoo. Get that job, focus on them fingerings. Welcome to the game.

If you say you’re important or you say you’re unimportant, you’re right."

The title is pretty self explanatory.
I have points to back up my way of thinking.

Most western social norms and moral frameworks are from Christian values and are the cornerstone of modern ethical thought. Cool sociologist dude Rodney Stark argues this in “Victory Of Reason” 

The church has played a crucial role in the development of education and health systems.

In “Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years,” Diarmaid MacCulloch explores how Christian charities laid the groundwork for modern social services and humanitarian efforts.

Also the reason humans rights are so highly valued is because of Christian doctrine. Historian John Witte Jr. in “The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion, and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism” writes about Protestant reformers that were huge in promoting ideas of individual rights and human dignity that pretty much defined the development of modern human rights.

That’s also not talking about how the entire scientific community was inspired by Christian doctrine.

I’m open to changing my view if someone can demonstrate that cons of Christianity outweigh the pros.

0,2024-07-31,CMV: The Hypothetical Scenario of a Christian Flipping a Switch to Instantly Send All True Christians to Heaven Reveals a Fundamental Flaw in Christian Theology,u/Ab0ut47Pandas,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egdts0/cmv_the_hypothetical_scenario_of_a_christian/,changemyview,"I did my best to organize this in the best possible way so I am as clear as possible. The only thing I care about in this discussion is the result of someone going to Heaven (or hell, I suppose). I've brought this up to several family members and friends. Of them, those who are religious say it's impossible or ridiculous. It is hypothetical, so of course it isn't plausible, its why it's a thought experiment.

***DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE HARM OF ANYONE IN ANY SCENARIO THIS IS PURELY A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT TO ENGAGE WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CHRISTIANITY*** 

Hypothetical Scenario:

Imagine a Christian who hyper-analyzes their faith and decides to sacrifice their own eternal happiness for the sake of all other Christians. They devise a process to identify true, good Christians—those who would be accepted into heaven according to their understanding of the Bible. This Christian then discovers a switch that, when flipped, instantly kills all these identified Christians, sending them to heaven where they will experience eternal happiness in the presence of God.

# Core Argument:

1. **Eternal Happiness**:
   * Christians believe that true, good Christians who die go to heaven and experience eternal happiness.
   * From the perspective of those who are killed, they end up in heaven and are eternally happy.
2. **Earthly Suffering and Redemption**:
   * Those left behind on earth would suffer from the loss of their loved ones.
   * However, these individuals would have more time to seek redemption and atone for their sins, potentially avoiding eternal damnation.
3. **Proportion of Suffering to Happiness**:
   * **Defining Suffering**: Suffering is experiencing something that doesn't invoke happiness in the moment.
   * **Defining Eternal Happiness**: Eternal happiness means experiencing everlasting joy and peace, with all past, present, and future viewed through a lens of happiness.

# Key Points:

1. **Perspective of the Deceased**:
   * Those who are killed and go to heaven would arguably be eternally happy and free from suffering.
   * Their earthly suffering and the manner of their death would be insignificant compared to their eternal bliss.
2. **Impact on the Living**:
   * Immediate suffering and grief would be profound for those left behind.
   * However, this suffering is minor compared to the eternal suffering they would face in hell if they did not seek redemption.
3. **Flaw in Christian Theology**:
   * This scenario suggests a potential flaw: If the ultimate goal is eternal happiness in heaven, then the actions leading to this outcome might seem less significant in comparison.
   * The scenario challenges the notion that the immediate moral and ethical implications of actions are paramount, highlighting a tension between earthly actions and their eternal outcomes.

# Theological Background:

1. **God’s Omniscience and Permissive Will**:
   * **Lucifer's Rebellion**: God knew that Lucifer would rebel. He could have prevented it by force or by doing things differently, but He allowed it to happen.
   * **Adam and Eve**: God knew that Adam and Eve would eat from the Tree of Knowledge. He could have not placed the tree there or educated them better, but He allowed it to happen.
   * **God’s Plan**: Because God knows all of this is going to happen and then it happens, it is included in His plan. This encompasses God’s permissive will, where He allows events to unfold according to human free will.

# Potential Counters:

* **1. Moral Stance**:
   * **It’s Not Moral**: Yes, the act of killing is fundamentally immoral. However, this thought exercise is not about justifying the act but examining the outcomes and theological implications.
* **Counter to the Counter**:
   * **Focus on Outcomes**: The ultimate outcome of eternal happiness for all true Christians might outweigh the immediate immorality of the act, highlighting a potential inconsistency in the emphasis on immediate moral judgments versus eternal outcomes.
* **2. Divine Authority and Human Free Will**:
   * **Human Responsibility**: Humans have free will and are responsible for their actions. God’s foreknowledge does not remove moral accountability from individuals.
   * **Divine Justice**: God’s justice ensures that all actions are judged appropriately. The individual flipping the switch would be judged and condemned for murder, regardless of the outcomes.
* **Counter to the Counter**:
   * **Permissive Will**: If God allows all actions to happen as part of His permissive will, then even morally wrong actions like this are part of His plan. This raises the question of why God’s plan includes such actions and whether the ultimate outcomes justify them.
   * **Ultimate Good**: If the end result is eternal happiness and avoidance of eternal damnation, the temporary suspension of free will and earthly life could be seen as a necessary sacrifice for a greater good.

**4. Bearing Witness**:

   * **Purpose of Earthly Life**: Earthly life serves as a journey and testimony of faith. Living through trials and tribulations is part of bearing witness to one’s faith and growing spiritually.
   * **Moral and Ethical Development**: Experiencing and overcoming suffering can lead to moral and spiritual development, which is a key aspect of Christian life on earth.
   * **Impact on Others**: The lives of Christians can serve as examples and inspirations to others, helping to spread faith and encourage others to seek God.

   * **More to Offer**: People often say those who died young were ""taken too soon"" and had more to offer on earth, implying that their earthly life and potential contributions were cut short.

**Counter to the Counter**:

   * **Eternal Perspective**: If believers are destined for eternal life, their earthly life is just a small part of their existence. The idea of being ""taken too soon"", or bearing any witness to anything doesn’t hold as much weight if their eternal life in heaven is the ultimate goal. The contributions and experiences they miss out on earth are insignificant compared to the eternal joy and fulfillment they will have in heaven. It's not like the Christian would be punished for dying early.

# Conclusion:

This thought exercise does not justify the actions of the hypothetical individual, who would knowingly go to hell for their actions. Instead, it highlights a potential inconsistency within Christian theology. The scenario points out that, from the perspective of eternal outcomes, the immediate suffering caused by morally wrong actions might seem insignificant. This raises questions about the balance between moral actions and ultimate spiritual goals in Christian ethics.

**Change My View**: Given this hypothetical scenario, does it reveal a fundamental flaw in Christian theology? How do we reconcile the immediate moral and ethical implications of actions with their ultimate spiritual outcomes?

Trouble is that it tends to attract the worst who use their charisma and their office to attract power. To solve this issue, I suggest this

Political office is only for scum and you're treated like one. Rather than said offices being a prestigous position, all holders of political office are treated like crap. You don't get paid, you are locked up in a cell with no human contact until the end of your term and you can be killed for any reason at all with your murderer getting off scott free and a replacement randomly selected from the genetal populace (better than elections since they are faster and instant) .  No political parties are allowed as well. Form one here and you will be killed alongside your associates.

Sure it may result in suicidal politicians who would only look forward to death as the ultimate release and are willing to defer to anyone who marches up to them. But this is better than anyone seeking office interested only in themselves.

 I want people to view political office as a incredibly crappy job and a fate worse than death rather than as a postion to get richer. And if your're interested in power and happens to be randomly selected? We'll beat it out of you. How does 4 to 6 years of harsh treatment in a cage do to you and your self interest, huh?

And well, who will be the power behind the throne? The citizens who would press gang people to serve us.

The way we select and view political office is wrong and we need to make sure that political office. And screw the 13th Amendment for politicans. They are supposed to serve the people regardless of their well being. No self interest allowed.

0,2024-07-31,"CMV: Religious people who thump their Bible whenever they disapprove of something, have no understanding of morality, right or wrong, as long as they rely on what has been written in the Bible",u/DiscussTek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egg77f/cmv_religious_people_who_thump_their_bible/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I'll say ""Bible"" a lot, but this is a generic statement that applies to every religious person who keep attacking others based on the Bible. Please consider that I only say ""Bible"" to keep it short.

For the most part, people who claim that the Bible is a moral guide, but refuse to understand the reasoning between the rules, and refuse to reject the rules that no longer make sense even after extensive explanation, do not partake in moral behavior, but in obedient behavior.

This becomes a problem when those rules are assumed to be good, in good faith, and valid, because they are in the book seen as a moral guide for their entire life, and thus if they are good, in good faith, and valid, then they must be morally sound and should thus be applied to everyone. If your attempt at being good and following the Bible is actually what's causing the harm people are being supposedly protected from, then you are completely detached from morality, and have replaced it with a rule.

Rules can be immoral. Tomorrow, you can see a country make a rule to kill off everyone who jaywalk on-sight, no trial, just, jaywalk, and you're dead. That rule would be horrifying and severely immoral, but it's a rule now.

I can already easily foretell a few responses, so I'll address those I can foresee already, so that I do not have to address them every time someone posts it:

* ***""But those rules are given to us by God, who knows what is right and wrong, so those rules follow morality.""*** - Yet we already filtered a fair amount of them we consider to be no longer valid. Christians tend to say that everything in the Old Testament that was a rule is no longer necessarily applicable, except in the cases that make them happy to justify a bias or bigoted view. While homosexuality is often brought back from the dead here, we also have a non-zero amount of people who use the Old Testament to justify being against interracial marriage, for instance. If we can dismiss rules based on our own opinion of those rules, but then mark those we chose to follow as morally absolute and good, in good faith, and valid, then it's not about the morality, it's about following rules, and having the ego to decide which ones are so much better than the rest.
* ***""You're lumping every religious person in one lump group. I'm religious, and I can tell you that harassing someone just because I disapprove of them is clearly wrong.""*** - Take the following words to heart: Then I'm not talking about you. What I'm talking about is the group of people who take actively large amounts of their day, week, month, and sometimes entire life, just to go to Rainbow Umbrella events and yell at them for hours, or outside abortion clinics trying to shame women who are having miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies and can't get a life-saving abortion from a fetus that's killing them, or at the very least severely damaging them irremediably. I'm talking about those who go to government assemblies, or even get elected to government positions, and say that ""The Bible says X is bad, so we need to ban X"", without actually stopping for a second as asking themselves if it's really that bad, and what could be done instead of banning it to ensure it doesn't get actually bad. If your beliefs do not lead you to persecute people, just that they are beliefs that you live by, then this post isn't attacking you.
* ***""Well, clearly you hate Christians.""*** - Assumption, clearly an attempt at dismissing the entire opinion as hateful, thus irrelevant... But also definitely wrong. I don't hate Christians. I hate behavior that comes from being a Christian who was raised not to think for a second, and to assume that a law passed by someone who claims to know what God wants is moral and good, without wondering why what their behavior on the matter is causing in terms of harm. Hate the sin, not the sinner. I hate the behavior of persecution, not the person who thinks they are doing a good thing.
* ***""Then what do you propose as a new moral compass?""*** - A point often used as a ""gotcha"" moment, where if I dismiss the Bible as a source of morality, I must replace it with one who can be measurably superior. However, this has two very major issues with what argument I'm making: 1) I did not say that the Bible's morality guidelines were wrong or bad, just that accepting the rules the book gives based on those guidelines is a display of obedience, more than a display of morality. You can still say ""killing someone is a solidly immoral thing to do, even the Bible says so"", and that's very much still true. But it's very weird to say ""The Bible say murder is a sin, so it needs to be banned."" 2) Even if I did, the litmus test should be ""was someone forced, coerced, tricked, killed, or harmed (either physically, emotionally or mentally) by this action I did on purpose?"" If yes, someone falls into one of those categories, then the action is generally speaking immoral. If no, or at least, it doesn't seem to be, then you're good. It's not hard to say ""Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Anything reasonable I can do to make it better?"", and that's a valid morality litmus test, much better than ""did I ask God for forgiveness?""
* ***""What gives YOU the right to judge people's morality compass?""*** - I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll realize I'm not judging the morality compass itself, but the lack of establishing one to begin with because a book did it for them. The base principle of my opinion is to say that people need to start using less of a pre-established, pre-cooked moral compass, and start looking at who they are actively harming instead. You'll find that a lot of people could learn a lot about people if they didn't dismiss the ""sinner"" as an evil person who needs redemption, but rather as someone who is currently undergoing a major life problem and needs help dealing with it in the way that is the least harmful to them. I'm all for don't kill, don't lie to the authorities to get someone in trouble, don't steal, don't rape, don't break someone else's stuff... All that jazz. But it's not rules. It's guidelines. It should be guidelines. Not everything you consider bad is malicious, and malice should definitely play a role in how you judge people.

Now, you can change my view in one of two ways:

1. Demonstrate that having a book of absolute moral values is better than using a litmus test of ""was someone made a victim?"". (Paraphrasing one of the lists up there, thought it was too long to repeat.)
2. Demonstrate that people who follow rules without questioning have a concept of morality, even if they have to bend it to follow the rules.

Looking forward to the conversations!"

The problem is AI categorizes things literally with no flexibility, while humans are more complex and context dependent in a way AI is not able to be. 

For example, when describing a sandwich one could say it’s two pieces of bread with stuff in between. Well what about pizza? An AI program would see that as an open faced sandwich based on that guideline. 

These technicalities exist everywhere, is cereal a soup? Is darts a sport? 

For humans it’s much easier to resolve these and apply that information but for AI it’s far more difficult. 

Humans have a more abstract view of the world which AI could not replicate. 

Maybe I’m being far too optimistic and there is an easy way AI could understand these categories."

0,2024-07-31,CMV: the most effective labels Trump can use against Kamala involve her promiscuity and not her quirks I.e. how she laughs. ,u/original_og_gangster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egibsw/cmv_the_most_effective_labels_trump_can_use/,changemyview,"I suppose this is a marketing philosophy cmv. The tl;dr is that I think trump should stick with something like ""heels up harris"" for his catchphrase for his opponent, and his recent attempts at stuff like ""laughing Kamala"" are shockingly poor choices for a supposed marketing savant. 

Trump currently appears to be struggling to come up with a catchphrase that sticks with Kamala, as he clearly was not prepared for Biden dropping out. 

I suspect that an (albeit small) factor in his 2016 victory vs his 2020 defeat was his strategies for how he labeled his opponents. ""Crooked Hillary"" reminded you that she had gotten her hands dirty over her career and implied that, if she had sold out before, she will probably sell out again. It was his most successful branding yet. 

Meanwhile, I'd argue Trump's branding for Biden was much less successful in 2020. ""Sleepy joe"" didn't really sound intimidating to voters, and Biden (at the time, anyway) didn't really show the kind of cognitive decline to give that label much credence anyway. So that label felt simultaneously forced and unthreatening. It woulda worked better in 2024, largely because of that historically terrible debate performance, but it still wasn't the perfect catchphrase.

An ideal label needs to both feel authentic and threatening. 

I'd argue that ""laughing Kamala"" is an equally terrible branding choice, if not worse. Kamala laughing kinda funny does nothing to tell voters how she's gonna harm them in any way, it doesn't say much of anything at all in fact. 

Something like ""Heels up Harris"", meanwhile, points to her ""sleeping her way to the top"", which at least has some theoretically plausible arguments for it, and starts to get back into crooked Hillary territory (the implicit argument being, if Kamala is willing to sleep with guys to work up the ranks, then she is willing to throw away whatever core values she has for a quick buck, power, etc.) 

It also reminds me of other very effective catchphrases trumps used, I.e. ""Pocahontas"" referencing Elizabeth Warren's dubious use of her supposed Indian blood to get into Harvard, undermining whatever progressive policies she would claim to espouse as it showed a lack of integrity. 

A potential counter to this viewpoint could be that trump himself has been pretty promiscuous, but I'd argue that's a less effective counter-label because you couldn't really argue that trump used that promiscuity to get power.

I'd be curious what alternative labeling strategies you'd argue would be more effective. I suppose I largely made this cmv because this all just seems so obvious to me that I'm surprised trump isn't doing it, and I wonder what other factors I'm not seeing that he might be. "

0,2024-07-31,Cmv: Israel has decided to dig its own grave,u/DryEmploy4637,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eglm9s/cmv_israel_has_decided_to_dig_its_own_grave/,changemyview,"The historical context of Israel's actions and their international implications is rooted in a consistent pattern of war crimes and humanitarian abuses. Dating back to the 1920s, well before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the region of Palestine witnessed significant conflict and tension. Their actions will lead to their inevitable end.

**Historical Atrocities**

The creation of the State of Israel in 1948 led to the first Arab-Israeli War, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, an event Palestinians refer to as the Nakba. One notable instance of violence during this period was the Deir Yassin massacre, where over 100 Palestinian villagers were killed by Zionist paramilitary groups. This massacre set a precedent for subsequent actions characterized by extreme violence and disregard for civilian life.

**Ongoing Violence**

The Six-Day War in 1967 resulted in the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, leading to further accusations of war crimes. The occupation saw the implementation of policies such as house demolitions, forced evictions, and land seizures, all considered violations of international law. The Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982, where Israeli-allied Phalangist militia killed thousands of Palestinians in refugee camps in Lebanon, remains a horrific example of Israel's indirect involvement in atrocities.

**Intifadas and Collective Punishment**

The First Intifada (1987-1993) and the Second Intifada (2000-2005) highlighted severe tensions and human rights abuses. Israeli military responses, including the use of live ammunition against protesters, mass arrests, and the destruction of Palestinian homes, drew widespread international criticism. Reports from organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented numerous instances of disproportionate use of force and collective punishment, including curfews and blockades that severely restricted Palestinian movement and access to essential services.

**Control Over Resources**

Israel exerts significant control over water, fuel, food, and medicine in the occupied territories. Palestinians face severe water restrictions, with access to water often limited to a few hours a week, while Israeli settlements enjoy uninterrupted water supplies. Collecting rainwater is illegal for Palestinians, exacerbating water scarcity. Fuel and electricity shortages in Gaza, resulting from Israeli blockades, cripple essential services, including hospitals and sanitation facilities. Food and medicine imports are also heavily restricted, leading to malnutrition and inadequate medical care.

**Gaza and Recent Conflicts**

The Gaza Strip has been a significant flashpoint in recent decades. Israel's military operations in Gaza, such as Operation Cast Lead (2008-2009) and Operation Protective Edge (2014), have been characterized by heavy bombardments and high civilian casualties, drawing widespread condemnation for their humanitarian impact. The blockade of Gaza, imposed by Israel and Egypt, has created dire humanitarian conditions for its inhabitants, limiting access to food, medicine, and essential supplies.

**2024 Incidents**

In July 2024, alarming reports emerged of Israeli officials justifying the rape of Palestinian detainees, highlighting ongoing severe human rights abuses. This justification has sparked international outrage and calls for accountability. Additionally, Israel has destroyed schools, hospitals, mosques, news outlets, and UN buildings in Gaza, further drawing condemnation. The continued expansion of settlements in the West Bank and frequent military operations in Gaza have drawn renewed international scrutiny and condemnation.

**International Response and Accountability**

Despite numerous allegations of war crimes and violations of international law, Israel has often avoided significant consequences on the international stage. Strategic alliances, particularly with the United States, have provided substantial diplomatic support. Efforts to hold Israel accountable through international mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), have faced significant political obstacles and opposition.

**Digging Their Own Grave**

Israel's recent actions seem increasingly self-destructive. The brutal treatment of Palestinians and the expanding settlements have intensified global condemnation. The international community's patience is waning, and the rising awareness of Israel's oppressive tactics has galvanized global movements advocating for Palestinian rights. These movements, coupled with increasing political and economic pressures, suggest that Israel's continued defiance of international law could lead to significant repercussions. The ongoing human rights abuses and blatant disregard for international norms are unsustainable and could ultimately undermine Israel's own security and legitimacy. The mounting global outcry and potential for intensified sanctions or diplomatic isolation may force a reconsideration of their policies, potentially leading to an end of the illegal and unethical occupation of Palestine.



**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is marked by numerous war crimes and humanitarian abuses by Israel, dating back to its pre-state era and continuing to the present day. Israel's wealth and corruption, including bribery, blackmail, and threats, have shielded it from facing significant repercussions for its actions, perpetuating a cycle of violence and impunity. However, their recent actions might ultimately compel the world to take decisive steps and end this illegal occupation and all the injustices it comes with."

I mean that if a person looks upon the world in a proper way then he/she can start to see that we are still part of evolution. I mean that we have always been - just - part of evolution. All of our thoughts are made by matter - we are ""biological machines"". If you watch people clap, dance, rage, whistle, boo, love, etc. - then they are all things that come from our path in evolution. If people clap in audiences it's because it comes from evolution. By taking the ""ape theory"" further we can even understand that there isn't good nor evil because all the actions which we take come from natural actions that come together in the universe. Good and evil should be changed to just emotions like love and hate or selfishness and empathy, etc. Of course good and evil kinda exist in our minds, but if we think about Chinese people eating dogs - it's because what kind of species we are. Only way how free will could exist is that it would be tied to the fabric of space and would exist without any kind of latency between the consciousness and matter, but we would most likely do the exact same choices depending upon in what stage the universe is - therefore why to think that there is free will in such? If we think about the Pope then can be clearly seen that he is an ape who does weird rituals and Dalai Lama is like some kind of wise orangutan from the Jungle Book. If a person denies the ""ape theory"" then he/she just denies the obvious. For an example, a good example of the ""ape theory"" is Nicki Minaj's and Megan Thee Stallions's song ""WAP"". If a person looks closely it's just a thing of evolution, but I don't have anything against such - because it's funny.

It is said that Arab Americans do not vote because they dislike both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Or they say they're voting for other candidates (Cornell West, Jill Stein). In this case, Trump has an advantage. In the first place, Trump is more pro-Israel than Biden and wants to ban Muslims from entering the country.

In the major religions Christianity and Islam (I don't know anything about Judaism, so, I'm not going to claim anything about it) God is described in a positive light.   
  
In Christianity God/Jesus is described as being the embodiment of love. For example, **1 John 4:8:** ""Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."" Also, ""agape"", which is the form of love god has for humanity, is the highest form of love. It describes gods unconditional, self-sacrificing love for humanity.   
In Islam, god is also described as being all-loving. For example: ""And He is Oft-forgiving, All Loving"" ([85:14](http://www.islamicity.com/MOSQUE/ARABICSCRIPT/AYAT/85/85_14.htm)). Allah is also described as the most merciful and most compassionate.

A god that is all loving, all merciful and all compassionate, cannot do/be evil. That would be a contradiction. 

Now, here are two reasons why I think the christian and islamic gods are - not only, but also - evil.   
  
In both christianity and islam, god is described as the creator of all things (if you want me to provide sources, feel free to ask). God is also all knowing, so, he also knows the future. So, god also knows who will believe in him and who will not and also created non-believers, knowing they would never believe in him and also knowing that they would go to hell for eternity. Now, hell is most commonly described as fire in christianity and in Islam it is described in different ways (blazing fire, boiling water, chains, shackles). Now, in both cases you could argue that it is meant metaphorically, but it clearly states that god will punish the non-believers for ETERNITY, which cannot coexist with the idea of an all loving god, that loves his whole creation. 

Now, let's take a very extreme example. Let's take the abuse of a baby. Not only has god created the abuser and the abused baby, but he created these two individuals knowing the abuser would abuse the baby - since he is all knowing. So, it's no one others than gods fault that an innocent baby, that didn't even yet have the ability to sin, got abused and basically got traumatised for life. If you don't condemn that and see it as evil, then you are an immoral person. 

Also, as for christianity, why does god punish us for our ""sins"" (a baby can't sin), if Jesus died for them on the cross. 

What's also interesting is, that considering all of this, we cannot possibly have free will, if god was real, all knowing, the creator of everything, because god is also the creator of every situation that takes place within its creation etc. 

So, either god doesn't exist or the biblical or islamic god - by their own standards - cannot be all loving, the most merciful, the most compassionate or any of that stuff. "

For example, non-binary was a label that encompasses all genders that weren’t strictly 100% man and 100% woman. But then people started creating a bunch of genders which made others more difficult to find themselves as there’s so many labels that mean the same thing.

Also the whole bisexual and pansexual thing, it’s basically the same thing. You guys like both genders, so why do you need two labels for the same thing?

Creating more labels makes people confused and unable to figure themselves out which is counterproductive to the goal of labels. 

Next up, I don’t understand why people create new labels if something doesn’t fit them by 0.0001 of an inch. If it doesn’t work for you then don’t use labels. Just say you’re unlabeled.

Why do we even need labels anyways? Just say “I like boys.” or “I like girls” or “I like girls and boys.” because adding labels creates unnecessary discourse about who’s allowed to use what label.

Just say how you feel instead of attaching 5000 labels to it.

0,2024-07-31,CMV: True diversity is the diversity of minds and ideas,u/GunMuratIlban,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egszx3/cmv_true_diversity_is_the_diversity_of_minds_and/,changemyview,"""Diversity"" and ""Inclusion"" are among the most popular words in Western politics and culture as things stand.

Though I think the concept is completely misused, only referring to diversity with people's skin colors and sexual orientations. 

While I think diversity should mean people with different ideas and opinions being able to exist together. Being civil enough to share their ideas, discuss on matters in a respectful manner.

What about an example:

We'll host a TV debate and the subject is taxes on different economic groups in the US. And we'll invite 4 guests to discuss.

What the current culture suggests, you'll have a diverse group in the studio if all 4 of the speakers have different skin colors and you invite 2 males and 2 females. 

All 4 of them could have the exact same ideas, support the same thing. Which is pretty much always the case in mainstream media for both sides. 

Shouldn't diversity mean inviting 4 people with all 4 of them supporting different approaches? They can all share the same skin color or gender, it doesn't mean you don't have diversity in your studio. Just the opposite, this is the only way you can have diversity.

I see so many people completely stuck in their own worlds. Completely excluding people who don't agree with them from their lives. They won't listen to them, only talk to them in a very aggressive manner.

So again I ask, where's diversity? What's so diverse about having people who all look different; but think exactly the same? 

As someone who worked in International Marketing, I've had the opportunity to meet and work with people all around the world. 

I've known people who look nothing like me, from countries I didn't even know existed. And found out to have very similar outlook in life and share many opinions, hobbies.

While a lot of people who were born in the same neighbourhood, looking similar to me can have completely different views and lifestyles. 

Your skin color, gender, culture don't make you who you are. So you are not getting a diverse environment if everyone there looks different, while speaking the same thing. 

In the end, my question is. How many of you really want diversity in their lives? If you're a Republican for example, do you think you can sit down with a Democrat to have a civil discussion and vice versa? If not, doesn't that mean we are more and more living in our segregared worlds, rather than opening and and be more diverse."

1. It simply sounds weird. ""Washington DC"" is clunky. Having two letters at the end feels excessive. 

2. It's confusing. 90% of the time It's just shortened to ""DC"" or ""Washington."" Washington is already a US state. Which I am aware came after the city was named, but it's unnecessarily confusing. DC ties back to my original point.

3. Nothing about it feels classy like other country capitals. Think of any other- Mexico City, Mexico. Paris, France. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. London, England. Ottawa, Canada. Nassau, The Bahamas.

Almost every single capital city flows so nicely with the country it's from. Except Wash. DC. Even with all of The US's different names.

Washington DC, The United States of America. Washington DC, The United States.
Washington DC, America.

I believe we should have it changed. My picks would be: **Washington City**, to keep the tribute to him. **The United City**, as a reference to the US. **Columbia,** to keep the C part in DC.

Anyway, I just don't like it. I would however like to hear why I'm wrong about this, because it's the only way I might like it."

The burden for passing a constitutional amendment is simply too high. 

Instead Biden should propose an amendment that ends presidential immunity *only* for himself and all future presidents. This defeats the argument that the amendment is only so that the Trump prosecutions can continue. If you're a republican, this deal looks pretty good for you because the current president is a democrat and other democrats are likely to be elected in the future. You *want* the president to have less power in that scenario. 

If republicans still rejected the amendment then it would be much clearer that they are no longer the party of small government - that they just want to give more power to the president, which is not a very popular idea. 

I think the democrat base would feel betrayed that Biden is letting Trump keep his get out of jail free card but if you care about the political stability and well-being of our country beyond just the next 4 years I think ending presidential immunity is the singular thing that is more important than preventing a second Trump term.

I think that the only way a person can actually change their viewpoint on something is from a personal experience that would contradict what they think leading to alternative view points.

Pick a topic it doesn’t matter. Let’s do racism.
Lets set you have a kkk level or nazi level racist.  I think he could sit down for hours and have all his view points talked about and he would always contradict the info or push it back no matter what he was presented. But if he was to maybe experience a person he hated doing something he respected or affected him he would start to change his mind.

Essentially I’m stating everyone is egotistical. Something has to puncture that ego to actually change how that person is. Just telling the racists that blacks don’t commit crime as much as whites, they just as smart ect he doesn’t actually care about that info his minds made up.

This dude gave JD plenty of strangely generous opportunities. 

Thiel is also gay, and he's Gay openly. If the Republicans win and Project 2025 comes to fruition, his money wouldn't be able to save him. He has everything to lose if Republicans win.

Honestly, I think JD is gay. He didn't get these opportunities because he was impressive. Maybe I'm talking out my ass, but when a generous gay billionaire is showers some peasant man with money... The dots are right there...

Thiel was able to get quite far in life, mostly staying in the shadows. He's not a moron. There's absolutely no way that Thiel thought that JD would play this role well. Thiel certainly must be smart enough to know that installing JD into the campaign was political suicide. 

It doesn't matter how much wealth Thiel has, under a system like project 2025, he's in serious danger. His wealth would be stripped away the moment he isn't useful anymore. Fascism doesn't spare their targets because their targets are wealthy, they take wealth from such individuals.

Thiel knew this would be a clusterf\*ck. Maybe the JD from way back when, well maybe that is the real JD. It seems like this has all been an extremely deliberate ploy, elevate him in MAGA until he's in a position to really screw it up.

This of course made sense because Biden was down in all 6 swing states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin). This wasn’t because Donald Trump was this exceedingly popular candidate that most Americans supported. Trump and Biden both have negative approval ratings. So of course the thinking that getting a more popular Democrat as the nominee would give the Democrats the edge made sense. But, after Biden dropped out, everyone coalesced around Kamala Harris. Harris has an equally low approval rating to Biden and polling shows she is also down to Trump in all of the 6 swing states. Polling shows that Kamala Harris is either tied with or 1% away from Trump in the popular vote. However, polls show that in a race between “a generic Democrat” and Trump. “A generic Democrat” wins. There are plenty of Democrats who have higher approvals than Harris and would do better than her as the nominee. Any of the Democrats who have been floated as her potential Vice President would all do better at the top of the ticket against Trump. I understand that only Harris has access to the funds Biden raised, but in my opinion that’s way less important than getting a candidate who actually beats Trump in the polls. If the Democrats could get a different and more popular nominee, I’m convinced they would have an easy path to the presidency. But with Harris, it looks like the Democrats are inevitably heading towards a loss in November."

Supreme court reform is Obviously needed, and one common suggestion on how to do that is to pack the court. The concept is quite simple, with a larger court, a small biased minority will have a harder time influencing rulings, among other benefits.

There are issues with this however, the first being why and how the packing would begin. The most common suggestion for expanding the court is for Biden or Harris once she steps up (Assuming she wins) expanding the court to 13 justices, one for each circuit. The implication of course being that all five of the new judges would be young and liberal. This will cause issues down the line however, since republicans will be watching closely. The republicans will likely win at least one of the next 3-4 presidential elections, and when they do they'll be nothing to stop them from packing the court again, say to 17. Then Dems win again, and bump it up to 21. You see where this leads, the court will start ballooning, and justices will be blatantly political. With so many positions opening up, prospective justices may start all but campaigning  for them, hoping to be selected by party leadership on either side. If the packing doesn't stop then within decades the court will be a bloated, partisan, ineffective office where any pretense of them still ""interpereting the constitution"" will be long gone, as the SC becomes a third legislative chamber."

So I understand why Biden left. I think the reason he didn't try to renegotiate was that he had no leverage with the Taliban since he had already promised to leave and even if they did renegotiate the Taliban could just violate the deal. 

The reason the case of Afghanistan is different from the many other countries currently under tyranny is that invading the other countries would violate international law. We had the backing of the international community in Afghanistan. That was a rare opportunity to spread democracy. "

And someone has to pick that laundry up and clean it. The laundry is taken to a large industrial factory where, on an assembly line in heavy protective gear, in an ungodly heat, men and women have to unfold those nasty, putrid shit towels and barf sheets, scrape off the chunks, and wash them. 

Every day, 8 hrs a day, usually 5-7 days a week. 

You think people want to do that? People dream of having that job? No of course not. People do it because they lack the training, skill or lifestyle to work elsewhere. Usually it’s done by migrants or people desperate enough to work for anything. 

And there are hundreds of not thousands of those jobs. It’s not that an otherwise willing job force is being driven away by low wages, though that’s a part of the problem, it’s that the job itself drives people away.

People who are the least effected by the turnout of the match seem to care the most, distracted from the difficulties of their life"

65,2024-07-31,Cmv: soft skills (people skills) are the single most important quality in a person to make money. ,u/Astrid-9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egztu0/cmv_soft_skills_people_skills_are_the_single_most/,changemyview,"Yeah, thats it. Ill reverse the statement too, but adjust it a bit: if you have all other traits of a successful person, but lack soft skills (people skills), you won’t make a lot of money. 

Success: whatever the general population defines as success
A lot of money: whatever the general population defines as a lot of money

Disclaimer: Like always, I will try my best to respond to everyone. Just thought of this cmv. My goal is to debate this statement with someone respectful. I dont give a single shit about if im right or wrong. If I deem you are disrespectful, I will not take you seriously. Otherwise, I will keep an open mind with every single person, within reason. Once someone disproves my cmv (which I feel like is inevitable with my terrible track record lmao) I encourage those who enjoy having a conversation to stay. But please primarily focus on disproving my cmv to adhere to this subs rules, I will do the same.
Lastly, I will not respond to people who I deem are arguing semantics.

I will edit my post to reflect any changes in perspective I have.

In the past, I have been quite loose with giving out deltas. I will only give out deltas if I feel that you have changed my view, or I feel that you genuinely deserve it because you introduced a new perspective in my head. Moderators, I *encourage* you to warn me IF you deem that I am giving out deltas where not appropriate, or any other offence. I have read the rules many times over.

Feel free to go after me for using precise terminology, or any other facet of my argument. 

With the formalities out of the way, change my mind you bunch of intellectuals hahaha!

32,2024-07-31,CMV: Space Sci-Fi is way better when it stays in the Solar System ,u/sgwashere29,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eh0m0q/cmv_space_scifi_is_way_better_when_it_stays_in/,changemyview,"There’s a rapidly growing genre of space sci-fi that got surprisingly little attention until that last decade, staying in the solar system as opposed to going interstellar. By this I’m referring to shows and movies like The Expanse, For All Mankind, Mars, and The Martian.

Don’t get me wrong, Star Trek and a lot of other shows that go interstellar are cool, but I like the solar system space shows because they just feel more realistic and based in science. Shows that have FTL tech are cool, but to me they’re more fantasy than sci-fi. But when I watch I show that’s set on Mars or somewhere in the outer solar system even, I think “yea, some of this could happen within my lifetime”, which makes it a lot more exciting, and the quality of the science behind the shows I’ve discussed also makes them a lot more interesting.

They have their reasons I guess, but people are so gloomy these days, it’s like they enjoy being infinitely pessimistic. So when I see a show that’s about colonizing Mars or something like that, undertaking an inherently optimistic project of massive proportions, I find it cool, way cooler than sci-fi shows that go all over the galaxy.

0,2024-07-31,"CMV: Reddit's outrage about Twitter and Elon's ""censorship"" is insane hypocrisy and they never wanted to hear about the issues with letting big tech control narratives until it was someone they disagreed with.",u/MazrimReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eh0ppy/cmv_reddits_outrage_about_twitter_and_elons/,changemyview,"Hard to take people seriously when it comes to crying over social media censorship when they loved twitter previously booting Trump and banning ""for being a bad person"".

Elon isn't censoring you, he is showing you the door. Here is the previously endlessly linked smug XKCD about the topic.

https://xkcd.com/1357/

It was never a good thing that completely unaccountable billion dollar companies controlled what people saw, and that includes on reddit which is shaped by questionable moderation and anti-evil teams removing the ""wrong"" opinions. 

Yet now Twitter is actively removing things to benefit Trump's campaign this is suddenly outrageous that he is ""allowed"" to do this, and redditors are completely oblivious to the hypocrisy. 

I have no doubt if Twitter was not doing these things they would have been happy with the status quo of supressing every viewpoint they disagree with on every major platform.

Either push for regulation on all of big tech or shut up.

For the record no I am pro right wing in any way, I was just raising the alarm long before a right winger finally got their hands on a big platform about the risks of offloading moral policing to these corps."
1,2024-07-31,CMV: From Dinosaurs to Galaxies: Rethinking Religion's Focus on Humanity,u/nikhilvoolla,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eh0pso/cmv_from_dinosaurs_to_galaxies_rethinking/,changemyview,"Greetings, fellow thinkers. As a newcomer to philosophy, I've been contemplating religion and our place in the cosmos.

Even from a theistic perspective, considering the universe as a creation of a god, pantheon, or multiple deities, our current understanding of the cosmos presents some thought-provoking scale comparisons:

If we condense Earth's lifespan to a single year:
- Earth's entire history: 365 days
- Dinosaurs' reign: 14.38 days
- Human existence: a mere 34.56 minutes

This timeline highlights our infinitesimally small presence in Earth's history.

Now, consider the vastness of our galaxy:
- The Milky Way contains approximately 200 billion stars.
- Each star likely hosts at least one planet, with many harboring multiple worlds.
- Conservative estimates suggest between 100 billion to over 1 trillion planets in our galaxy alone.

Expanding further, recent studies using the Hubble Space Telescope and other advanced instruments suggest the existence of roughly 2 trillion galaxies in our observable universe.

Given this cosmic scale, isn't it rather presumptuous for humans to believe that deities constructed elaborate metaphysical frameworks (e.g., karma, reincarnation, heaven, hell, Valhalla) solely for our benefit? By this logic, wouldn't dinosaurs be more deserving of divine attention, given their longer tenure on Earth?

In this context, the existence of humanity—or even our relatively young solar system—would hardly register on a cosmic, god-like perception. It's akin to a single amoeba believing the entire Earth was created just for its species, focusing solely on its immediate needs and environment.

Therefore, wouldn't it be more beneficial for humanity to focus on improving our lives, fostering harmony, and advancing civilization rather than attributing such significant importance to religious or belief structures?

I'm curious about your thoughts on these concepts and conter arguments to change my view."

Im back already lmao. Yes, I am being 100% serious. I will ONLY award deltas if I feel that you have CMV, or if you introduced a new perspective in my head. Moderators, I have read the rules multiple times and I encourage you to call me out on *any* rules I break. 

I dont know what other context to add. i will edit this post with context when appropriate.

This one is an interesting one to me. And to prove my point, *I will also only reply to you with a couple sentences*. I do not give a single shit if I am right or wrong. Why do I say this? I have no problem giving away deltas (see my recent posts for evidence). Therefore, I am not trolling and will respond to everyone (within reason).

Before anyone tries to argue semantics: Heres how I define “a couple”: whatever a reasonable person would define as “a couple”.  

You can scrutinise any statement I have made here.

Oh and just to make it more fun for me, I will only reply with a few sentences too. I will give a delta to anyone who forces me to use more than a few sentences, since I would be contradicting myself.

This is for any mods reading: Yeah lmao, this post is meta as hell. I however do not believe to have broken any rules, and you can remove this post at your discretion and I will understand. I encourage you to participate in this post by always being ready to call me out when I should have given a delta

Thats it. Go do your magic, wonderful community!
