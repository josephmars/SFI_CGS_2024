We're going to bury the lede *just* a bit by first discussing the state of /r/Showerthoughts.

It has been a week since we started rolling out the redesign, and we have to say, we've actually been really surprised by the amount of positive feedback that you've given us! Usually when things change, there are more complaints than anything else... but in this case, the vast majority of what we've heard has ranged from ""cautiously optimistic"" to ""openly pleased."" In fact, if we disregard things from users who didn't read [the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) and [the requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/requirements), there has really only been one criticism that has cropped up multiple times:

""It would be nice if moderators dealt with reports more quickly.""

Believe it or not, we agree with you: When rule-breaking content stays up for too long, it gives people incorrect impressions of what is and isn't allowed in the subreddit. Granted, not every report that we receive is accurate, but for those that are, it would be great if we could deal with them in a more-timely fashion.

That brings us to the point of this post:

**/r/Showerthoughts is looking for new moderators!**

If you – yes, *you* – have been reading /r/Showerthoughts for a while, if you understand what a *showerthought* really is, if you know the difference between ""a man devouring lobster"" and ""a man-devouring lobster,"" and if you can straddle the line between being a compassionate guide and a rules-enforcer, we'd love for you to apply!

Applications will be open for the next week, so if you're interested, [please fill out this form](https://forms.gle/EhxAbYHWQ5gjFPQC8).

Until then – and as always – happy thinking!"
