283,2024-07-25,We are Olivia Carville and Cecilia D'Anastasio and we cover online child safety issues and the video game industry at Bloomberg News. We recently finished an investigation on Roblox's struggles to keep pedophiles off the platform. Ask us anything!,u/bloomberg,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ebyd3x/we_are_olivia_carville_and_cecilia_danastasio_and/,technology,"For years, kids raised the issue of predation on Roblox. They’ve filmed To Catch A Predator-style YouTube videos, mass-reported sex games and complained–loudly–to Roblox about creepy characters on the multibillion-dollar childrens’ gaming platform.

In one instance, kids called out a well-known Roblox developer–who went by DoctorRofatnik–for sending predatory messages to a 12-year-old. Months later, he kidnapped and raped a 15-year-old he met on Roblox.

We've been reporting on the intersection of child safety and the digital world for years. So we took the complaints seriously. For the last eight months, we filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act requests for police reports linked to Roblox for [this story](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/). We found at least 24 men have been accused of abducting or abusing minors they either met or groomed through Roblox since 2018.

Roblox has 78 million daily users and more than 40% are under the age of 13. The platform is so popular with children it's started to appeal to an unwelcome user base: predators and registered sex offenders.

We both made Roblox avatars to test the company's safety features for kids, and we were shocked by what we found. It took less than a couple minutes for a stranger to try and groom Cecilia–after she said she was 4.

Meanwhile, Olivia flew around the country to piece together the story behind DoctorRofatnik–whom the FBI would later discover is actually a man named Arnold Castillo.

Do you want to learn more about predators on Roblox? Drop your questions in the comments and our reporters, Olivia and u/cecianasta, will respond in our AMA **today from 1 - 2pm ET**.
