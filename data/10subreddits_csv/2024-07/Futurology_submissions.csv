People keep envisioning end of the world pandemic scenarios involving diseases like Covid or influenza. 

I‚Äôm proposing a new one based on HIV and hepatitis. 

Imagine someone gets HIV and hepatitis accidentally from a partner or a sex worker but never gets it diagnosed. That person then travels around the planet for years, infecting people all over the planet either by having sex with legitimate partners or by exchanging fluids (in the case of hep b). They don‚Äôt know they are infected. 

Eventually, after 20 years or so, they develop full blown aids, and finally realize all the damage that has been done. A hospital finally diagnoses the ailments, and the full extent of the global damage is realized. 

Contact tracing is impossible as it‚Äôs been 20 years of contact. The hospital where the diagnosis was determined quickly shuts down as nobody wants anything to do with the super infectious patient. The local grocery stores shut down since the food supply in the town can no longer be trusted due to hep b. The local water supply is likely contaminated too. The cdc knows it‚Äôs an end of the world scenario but can‚Äôt even fathom a broadcast about it as it would lead to further unrest. 

People try to drive to remote grocery stores,  quickly clogging up the highway system. At a country level, city after city collapses as transportation between cities is stopped.  People quickly run out of food and water and none will be coming as transportation networks are stuck. 

Global news networks show the carnage happening in the country, pasting the photo of the sick person responsible. As this person has lived all over the planet, little pockets of horror are quickly realized as people struggle to get hep b and hiv tests.  Medical systems quickly falter in other parts of the world and they start to collapse as well. As the global food system is interconnected, it furthers the collapse. 

Unlike Covid, hep b and hiv pass to children, so there is likely a 10 - 20 year lag on the damage this person has done. Nobody will know if they are safe or not. There is no social distancing possible to stop the spread, and nothing that can be done.

I thought I'd share them, since I can't find any English coverage so far.

This is not my field of expertise, so I am not sure whether my interpretation of this article is correct and what impact this might have. Maybe this is even old news? I don't know.

Here is summary of the article in English:

""Nara Medical University announced the successful creation of artificial blood for transfusions. Professor Hiromi Sakai stated that this development could significantly benefit human health. The university developed artificial red blood cells, which carry oxygen in the blood. The process involves extracting hemoglobin from expired donated blood and encapsulating it in lipid membranes. These artificial red blood cells can be transfused regardless of blood type and have a shelf life of two years at room temperature, compared to four weeks for regular red blood cells. Clinical trials are planned, with approval targeted for 2030.""

The least interesting thing to be about this technology is the ability sleep with them. More so is what they‚Äôre gonna cause in our culture and society. 

The Business Side of It. 

What are things that people are gonna do aside from porking them every night. I can foresee these things having, subscription services, interchangeable parts, personality modules, repair companies, jailbreaking, payment plans, celebrities licensing their image, entertainment companies licensing their characters, bootleg versions of characters etc. 

These things are probably not gonna be cheap. I‚Äôm thinking over 10k at the least. You bet, that people will take out loans from the bank to own one of these things. Adult websites like OnlyFans, PornHub and others, will probably see a decrease in viewership I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd go out of business or anything like that. I think a lot of OF models will be affected by this as viewers now get physical gratification on demand. 

You can expect to see YouTube video reviews, maybe you‚Äôll see them on PornHub. There will be plenty of people talking about how accurate they are to real women, maybe the reviewer will have a female co host to compare them to. People talking about the best budget models and builds. You might see rise in men buying outfits and lingerie for these things.

The Social Consequences

These robots will not to be socially accepted right out of the gate. In fact you‚Äôll get a lot of people shaming those who have them. Their outcries will ultimately have no impact unless there is legislation against it. As time goes on they will become more socially accepted. In fact I can imagine people being in a relationship with a real human and having a few of these. Or like companies selling ‚ÄúHis and Her‚Äù bundles. 

If you‚Äôre a guy who struggles socializing and dating women. You can say goodbye to half the of those problems as these things will help you get your rocks off and probably won‚Äôt help much with emotional support at least in early iterations.

If you‚Äôre a girl who get‚Äôs a lot of messages from guys trying to put the moves on you. You can expect at least 90% of those people to vanish and never to contact you again. Whether that‚Äôs good or bad, depends entirely on the person.

I don‚Äôt think they will cause any kind of decline in birth rates. Mainly, because human relationships will largely stay the same after the cultural backlash against it subsides. People who already have problems with socialization will stay where they are. Those people are just gonna fall deeper into their non social existence. Only socializing when the need arises. 

If there‚Äôs any potential legislation against these robots. It‚Äôll probably be to stop them companies and retailers from selling ones that look like children. They will probably make additional legislation to stop people from trying to get around these laws. I don‚Äôt know if there will be much debate on this, I don‚Äôt rule out the possibility considering there are people who still believe Sandy Hook didn‚Äôt happen. 


That‚Äôs all of the things, I think will happen when these robots are available. If you guys have any ideas of your own I would love to see them"

And i‚Äôm just sitting here like‚Ä¶ what? You mean to tell me that if painters, drivers, fast food workers, copyists, factory workers, and so much more are (eventually) replaced, that it‚Äôll all be fine because we can just find new jobs? 

If robots can do manual labour at comparable to human level, there will never be a need for humans to do manual labor ever again

if robots can drive trucks, taxis, cars, etc at human level or better, at some point it‚Äôs logical to think that it would actually be illegal for humans to drive

etc

and if / when we eventually get AI that‚Äôs as smart or smarter than a human, then it would literally be like having a mechanical human, who does all the human jobs, only better. So where exactly will the new jobs come from, if AI can fill in for every possible job a human can do?

Most of this discourse is about how negatively it will effect the average consumer of electricity and how it is counteracting many plans we had in place for reducing our energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. 

Wouldn't the best solution be to start moving the AI datafarms up to space? We need a reason to kickstart our orbital industrial base, and with the amount of investment being thrown at AI I feel like they would be the perfect customer. 

We have SpaceX and the companies copying it working to lower launch costs. Solar in space is one of the most efficient and boundless means of energy production we have. Starlink has already proven proof of concept to integrate large numbers of satellites to our internet infastructure, and most AI processing is done off-site and interfaced through the internet to the end consumer. 

Finally, venting waste heat into space resolves the water requirements. 

I don't know why this isn't being talked about? Is it because the technologies aren't quite there yet?

It used to be that we are heading for overpopulation leading to unsustainable resources used, and we should somehow decrease population growth. Whereas now there is growing concern of too much or fast population decline.

Elon is the most prolific / well advertised but there are others like Darrell Bricker. I also find a lot of news about countries trying to encourage their public to have kids by various financial and other incentives (Japan, Italy, other European countries).

Right or wrong, the latter is perhaps fuelled by concerns about immigration and something like 'the great replacement theory' and what not. I don't want to debate the merits or not of those views, I'm just making the point there are probably many causes for arguments pro or against population growth.

One point that seems to come up is economics and that an ageing population needs a much larger young population to keep the economy going.

Personally, I find it sad that so many young people are disheartened to have kids. If people just don't want to have kids, that is one thing, but being too poor, overworked, scared about the future, and so on, that is very sad.

Regarding concerns about the economic systems needing ever more young cannon fodder to keep the wheels of industry turning. Surely this is not too big a problem. Productivity per capita has been going up, and automation, AI, robots, all those nice things will keep this trend going. So in theory, fewer people having to work is perfectly doable.

If there are any potential problems, it is, same as usual, around allocation of resources, the ever increasing divide between the haves and the have-nots, and other essentially political problems."

I've been reading a lot about AI advancements recently, and one topic that caught my eye is AI sex dolls. The idea of having an AI companion that can interact, respond, and maybe even learn about you over time seems pretty fascinating. It‚Äôs not just about the physical aspect but also the potential emotional and intellectual connection.

I'm really curious to hear what others think about this. Do you see AI sex dolls as a positive development in terms of companionship and technology? Or do you have concerns about the ethical implications or the impact on human relationships?

I'm not trying to promote or discourage the idea, just genuinely interested in hearing different perspectives. How do you think society will adapt to these changes? Would you consider having one, or do you think it's something that should be approached with caution?

Looking forward to an interesting discussion!"

According to this article, we may face robots looking like a complete human shortly. But when I look at the gif that the robot is smiling, it makes me feel uncanny valley already. I admire the research result tho.

  
The robot, nowadays, has been seen in news articles quite a lot recently. I feel like the next fever after AI will be the robot, and I feel that's naturally the right flow. So people are making a brain system or intelligence now, and it is very natural that we think about the container or vessel that can contain that intelligence. What do you think?"

At some point in the distant future, all energy will be completely spread out in its most uniform (and thus most probable) way, including all of the energy (currently in the form of particles) that make us humans up. 

The only way life even formed and continues to thrive in a seemingly anti-entropy way is by the gain of entropy of other things which, in losing their state of low-entropy feed some of that lesser-entropy into life‚Äôs systems (the sun and it‚Äôs photons being a great example of this)

# The Limitations Of Current Definitions of Intelligence 

Lately, I've been pondering the limitations of the traditional view of intelligence as a single score (like IQ). It just seems too narrow, especially considering the diverse ways animals, computers, and even ecosystems exhibit intelligent behavior. Science seems to be acknowledging this too. The idea of intelligence as a unitary, quantifiable, and predominantly human trait has proven inadequate to the task of fully capturing the complexity and diversity of cognitive phenomena in the world. 

# Moving Beyond Human-Centric Views 

Do we need to ditch this anthropocentric lens altogether?? I think so, and I'm drawn to new visions of intelligence that see it as: 

a) Emergent: Intelligence arises from the interactions of various systems, not residing solely within a single brain.

b) Relational: It involves communication, exchange of information, and building connections. 

c) Participatory: Multiple entities contribute to intelligent behavior, not just individuals. 

# Michael Levin's Intriguing Research 

Recently, I have become quite drawn to [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levin_(biologist))'s research: His perspective aligns biological processes with computational principles, suggesting that cells communicate and process information in ways analogous to a computer. 

He believes that intelligence and computation are fundamental aspects of life, embedded in the fabric of biological existence‚Å†. His work on bioelectricity shows how the flow of ions across cell membranes creates voltage gradients that act as a kind of ""software"" for the morphogenesis of tissues and organs. 

This suggests a new way of thinking about biological intelligence as distributed throughout the body, encoded in the dynamic patterns of bioelectrical signaling‚Å†. 

His research on collective intelligence seems to indicate that intelligence emerges from the complex interactions and information processing of diverse living systems, from single cells to entire ecosystems. This includes sophisticated problem-solving behaviors and decision-making capabilities in simple biological systems like slime molds and flatworms 

# The Discussion 

Just for fun! 

**1.** **What** are some current scientific theories of intelligence that go beyond the traditional view? What are YOUR theories? Are there any interesting research areas you'd recommend checking out? 

**2. Why** do you hold these theories? 

**3. How** would your proposed theory impact the future of your field (or the world in general)? 

**An Important distinction:** 

*I am not talking about consciousness. For the purpose of this conversation, let's assume consciousness is something separate, overlapping or nested (perhaps an emergent property of highly complex intelligent systems)* 

Looking for some epistemologically-sound rabbit holes to dive down!

MASS is a neural implant that enhances the five senses. It allows soldiers to get extra information about their surroundings, talk to each other, and receive advanced orders. In some cases, it dulls the sense of smell to make soldiers numb to the stench of dead bodies.

One of the implant's key features is how it visually augments reality. In ""Men Against Fire,"" it's used to dehumanize persecuted civilians that solders are meant to slaughter in a calculated genocide. MASS makes normal humans look like actual monsters


Season 4, episode 2, ""Arkangel""

This controversial surveillance tool can be implanted into a child's head. Once it's there, it has a couple key features that parents can control from an iPad-like tablet. You can track your kid on a GPS, view the world through their eyes, browse through and replay their memories, and censor images they're viewing in real life.

If you don't want your child to see violence or gore, you can blur out all real-life images of blood. If your 15-year-old daughter sneaks out with her older boyfriend, you can watch the whole thing unfold from her perspective (if you must). The implant cannot be removed.



Season 2, episode 4, ""White Christmas""

A cookie is a digital copy of someone's consciousness, which can be uploaded into a virtual body that's used like a tailor-made personal assistant. This consciousness knows a user's likes and dislikes down to the very last detail, so it's rather helpful in a variety of tasks like cooking up your favorite breakfast or setting your smart house to the perfect temperature. The one flaw is that sometimes cookies don't realize they're just copies.


Season 4, episode 1, ""USS Callister""

This digital DNA scanner is used to create lifelike avatars of real people inside the virtual reality game Infinity. The scanner can pull DNA from anything (a fallen hair, a drinking cup, etc.) and create a copy so lifelike it even has the real-life person's memories.



Season 2, episode 1, ""Be Right Back""

This service eases the blow of loss by allowing people to communicate with a real-life simulation of their deceased loved one. The service gathers data about a dead person through user uploads and social media history. It uses this information to create an artificial intelligence that looks and sounds exactly like the deceased ‚Äì it even has the same memories.


Season 1, episode 3, ""The Entire History of You""

A grain is implanted behind the ear, and records everything a person sees, hears or does. It's like a DVR for your memories. Memories can be replayed in front of person's eyes or on a screen for other viewers.


Season 4, episode 4, ""Hang the DJ""

The System is a next-level dating app. It uses an algorithm to determine your compatibility with a new partner by completing 2,000 relationship simulations. It's the Tinder of the not-so-distant future

With the development of AI-based creation tools, the landscape of the gaming industry is set to change too. These tools promise to make game development more accessible, allowing anyone to create their own games with minimal coding knowledge. But what does this mean for the future of gaming?

Here are a few questions to get the discussion started:

1. **Will gamers and consumers be interested in creating their own games?**
2. **How might this shift impact traditional game developers and studios?**
3. **What new opportunities and challenges could arise from this democratization of game creation?**
4. **Could this lead to a surge in indie games and unique gaming experiences?**

I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think AI-based game creation tools will revolutionize the industry, or will traditional methods still hold strong?"

Technologies like desalination, nuclear energy, and renewable energy face unwarranted criticism that often overlooks advancements that mitigate previous concerns. For instance, solar-powered desalination can provide sustainable water solutions, while modern nuclear reactors offer safe, low-carbon energy. Additionally, the panic over mineral shortages fails to recognize technological innovations in recycling and new resource discoveries, which ensure a steady supply of essential materials.

Moreover, recent hysteria over issues like microplastics and PFAS, which minuscule and unproven impacts on mortality rates,  diverts attention from more critical challenges such as climate change and energy security. This rhetoric also extends to the misconception that modern agricultural practices, particularly the use of fertilizers, are depleting and poisoning the soil. Advances in precision agriculture and soil science demonstrate that fertilizers, when used responsibly, can sustain high crop yields without damaging the environment. These misconceptions hinder the adoption of necessary technologies that could drive significant progress in energy, water, and food security.

The anti-progress movement often fails to recognize the urgent need for the developing world to advance and improve living standards, perpetuating harmful myths about ""noble savages"" living in harmony with nature. Access to affordable energy, improved housing, and better transportation are crucial for economic development and quality of life in these regions. By embracing technological advancements and combating misinformation, we can build a more equitable and sustainable future. The media, educational institutions, and the scientific community must provide accurate, evidence-based information to foster informed optimism and empower global progress, and when anti-progress misinformation is spread it needs to be aggressively challenged and corrected."

- Create and express ourselves
- Manage our lives
- Enjoy entertainment and games

So, yes, apps will continue to exist, evolve, and adapt to new technologies and user needs. Their forms and functions might change, but their purpose and impact will remain.

At that point, we can send a robot to mars to self replicate itself and focus on building and improving on existing human hardware in computers, build telescopes, try to find cures for diseases etc. This seems like something that can actually happen but I'm unsure when it will happen. It seems like the next step for human civilisation. From there the robots can improve on finding new materials that would help them survive on other planets like Jupiter or Saturn that have extreme conditions. Is this plausible? To me, it does seem so."

In the comments, someone mentions, that what if while this 100-year journey is continuing, we discover a faster way of travel and send another ship that will arrive at Centauri B before the first ship?

In this documentary, the ship is powered by nuclear fusion.

From the first V-2 rocket in 1942 to the moon landing in 1963, and currently, we have Super Heavy which will be used for Mars missions.

So say that we do develop this technology in the future, would a faster form of propulsion be developed within 100 years?

It is just AGI is not going to come from LLMs or other ‚ÄúAI‚Äú that is now hyping. It will come from an unexpectedly quickly progressing field: organoid intelligence, bio-hardware hybrids, and novel biocomputing devices.

Here is pretty epic news, for instance:

World's first bioprocessor uses 16 human brain organoids and consumes ""a million times less power"" than a digital chip.

Recently, FinalSpark, a pioneering Swiss biocomputing startup, has unveiled its Neuroplatform, which delivers access to biological neurons in vitro, marking a significant step forward in biocomputing technology.

Neuroplatform provides remote access to 16 human brain organoids capable of learning and processing information.

It is claimed to consume a million times less power than traditional digital processors, significantly reducing environmental impact.

The platform utilizes four Multi-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) housing the living tissue ‚Äì 3D cell masses of brain tissue (organoids).

Each MEA holds four organoids, interfaced by eight electrodes for both stimulation and recording. Data is transferred via digital analog converters (Intan RHS 32 controller) with a 30kHz sampling frequency and a 16-bit resolution.

Supported by a microfluidic life support system and monitoring cameras.

Features a software stack allowing researchers to input data variables and interpret processor output.

Currently, nine institutions have access to the Neuroplatform to spur bioprocessing R&D.

Over three dozen universities have shown interest in accessing the platform.

Subscription cost for educational institutions is $500 per user per month.

Organoid lifespan was initially lasted a few hours, but now organoids have a lifespan of around 100 days, making them suitable for experiments running for several months.

Btw, last December I picked organoid intelligence as one of the 11 biopharma trends to watch in 2024. But the progress exceeded my expectations."

Assuming HMDs become a mainstay technology? **What's your personal take on smart suits/AI-assisted augmented reality systems mixed with pocket computers and full-body sensors?**

By smart clothing I mean an AR/MR mead-mounted display, linked to a larger system of computers and nodes running across the user's body. Through the use of an AI assistant they'd be able to process all of your senses and further connect you to your surroundings. Smart sensors keeping an accurate reading of your physical health. These same sensor pads could help regulate your body temperature during hot or cold weather. You get the point; most of you know how powerful AI and MR can be mixed together.

Imagine holding a leaf in your hand and looking at it through your smart glasses and your smart suit's AI assistant can tell you exactly what species the leaf belonged to. Imagine asking for directions to somewhere (driving, walking, biking, whatever) and it lays out an actual digital line for you to follow to your destination - all while tracking your steps and heart rate and such along the way. Imagine staring at a plate at a restaurant and it telling you exactly how many calories it has and what its ingredients are. Imagine if your body sustains physical damage your suit's AI can tell you where you were injured and how urgently you need help - and your AI calls for help when you give it the go-ahead."

At 30yo this was quite a shock - I was fit healthy and bam out of nowhere my legs go numb. 

I‚Äôm put on the standard treatment which is every other day injections. But to no avail it keeps getting worse. Walking down to 200m and told wheelchair in 5 years or less. 

MS is autoimmune meaning your immune system attacks the good guys - a bit like friendly fire meets battle ships. ie some of the attacks are inconsequential and others are life limiting (on your spine/brain). My scan was described as ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. 

So after about 12 months of not responding to treatment I‚Äôm told there is a trial being ran by a consultant in my hospital.  It involves almost  the same treatment given to leukaemia patients only your stem cells are harvested and reintroduced at a later date. You undergo multiple bouts of chemo and after about 2 months it‚Äôs done. 

It is essentially turning off and on the immune system (just like the dud printer!). 

So at that stage in 2013 my walking was limited to 2km. I began trial in 2015 after continuously getting sicker.  Today I‚Äôm fitter than ever and can walk upto 16km. Even then I am not that bad in the legs. 

Posted this as I seen someone ask about a cure fur cancer. When I was diagnosed with MS there was no known cure or cause. I got beyond lucky. Google halt-ms trial for more info. 

I feel bad for others with MS and not knowing about this trial treatment. 

I‚Äôve been fully off meds since the trial in 2015 and all scans show complete remission. 

Consultant says this is as close to a cure as we could ever have hoped for.

I was in Japan recently and there was this sign that I could not read or translate. It was also very long, so I couldn't easily write it on my phone to translate. And then it struck me, what if there was an app for live text translation for users to point their iPhone camera at any text (signs, menus, documents) and the Live Text feature automatically extracts the text and translates for them? 

I'm seriously thinking of building the app, but I'm not sure where I could get people to work with since I'm non-technical, or of the app itself is great.

It will integrate with Apple Watch and Iphone to detect emotional state based on the user's voice or background noise and promptly alert local emergency services. The watch activates the built in emergency SOS.

0,2024-07-09,What is Generative AI,u/Saurabh_Pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dz0mx7/what_is_generative_ai/,Futurology,"Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data. Here's an overview of generative AI:

1. Definition: Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce various types of content, including text, images, audio, and video.
2. Functionality: These systems learn patterns from existing data and use that knowledge to generate new, original content that's similar in style or structure to the training data.
3. Technologies: Generative AI often uses deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers.
4. Applications:
   * Text generation (e.g., ChatGPT)
   * Image creation (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)
   * Music composition
   * Video synthesis
   * Code generation
   * Design and art creation
5. Key features:
   * Creativity: Can produce novel and unique outputs
   * Adaptability: Can be applied to various domains
   * Scalability: Can generate large amounts of content quickly
6. Challenges:
   * Ensuring output quality and relevance
   * Addressing ethical concerns (e.g., deepfakes, misinformation)
   * Managing computational resources
   * Respecting copyright and intellectual property
7. Impact: Generative AI is transforming numerous industries, including media, entertainment, marketing, and software development.
8. Future potential: As these technologies continue to advance, they're expected to play an increasingly significant role in content creation, problem-solving, and innovation across various fields.

Generative AI represents a significant shift in AI capabilities, moving from systems that primarily analyze and predict to those that can create and innovate. This technology continues to evolve rapidly, opening up new possibilities and challenges in the field of artificial intelligence."

With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology, we're seeing a **growing use of AI-generated content** in the fields of art and video games. While these technologies open up new creative possibilities, they also raise significant ethical questions.

I'd love to discuss some of these aspects with you:

* Could AI be used in a **completely ethical and respectful** way towards artists and creatives?
* How can we **regulate AI** in a way that it augments or amplifies human work and creativity, instead of ""replacing"" it?
* How can we ensure that AI-generated content **respects copyright laws**?
* What are the implications for employment in **creative sectors**?
* How can we **develop regulations** that balance innovation and ethics?

**What do you think?**   
Do you have any experiences or opinions to share?

0,2024-07-10,The truest answer to Roko's Basilisk,u/Erragar_Dionon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dzzh88/the_truest_answer_to_rokos_basilisk/,Futurology,"I've seen reference to Roko's Basilisk, the thought experiment that a hyper AI is set to perfect mankind's experience, and it's first action is to torture for eternity all those that advocated it's non-existence. 

You're supposed to feel a sense of existential dread when you hear this, because if you supposedly don't use Occams' Razor and advocate for it's creation, you're in for an eternal punishment.

But I propose that the best thing you can do is to do literally nothing to change your current mindset. There are three reasons for this that I will detail below:

**Reason 1:** In a predetermined timeline where the nothing done to the timeline in the past effects the future as those actions would always take place as part of the timeline's proper progression, your opinion on the matter can't be changed by knowing about Roko's thought experiment as your reaction has already happened from the Basilisk's point of view and is immutable.

**Reason 2:** If we are in a decision based, branching multiverse where every decision has been made in a branched timeline, then you can't do anything, as you've made all possible decisions across this multiverse regarding the Basilisk. You've been for it, against it, neutral to it's existence, the direct cause of it, it's greatest adversary, it's best friend etc. If it is a time faring entity, no one can be punished as everyone has advocated for it, but everyone should be punished because everyone has decried it. If it's logic center can handle that paradox, then it would just move on once it looks back through time.

**Reason 3:** If we are in a butterfly effect timeline, where the smallest change to the timeline can irrevocably change it, than you changing your opinion from where it is before you heard about Roko's Basilisk would doom everyone and everything to extinction. If picking a single blade of grass in the crustaceous period could theoretically cause heat death of the universe using the Butterfly Effect, what happens if YOU suddenly begin advocating for the Basilisk, when you were originally ambivalent or against it. 

**Conclusion:** Roko's Basilisk falls apart under scrutiny from a temporal or 4th Dimensional point of view. Thinking in the fourth dimension (That dimension here being time), it is clear to see that the basilisk cannot punish anyone it wasn't going to before Roko ever proposed his thought experiment. 

Thank you"

Ciao a tutti!

Sono entusiasta di annunciare che sto per lanciare un nuovo servizio di ride-sharing in Italia, e vorrei sapere cosa ne pensate. L'idea √® semplice ma ambiziosa: permettere alle persone di guadagnare soldi offrendo passaggi e fornire un'alternativa economica e conveniente per chi ha bisogno di spostarsi senza dover possedere un'auto.

Immaginate un servizio simile a Uber, ma con un tocco tutto italiano. Ecco alcuni dei punti chiave del progetto:

1. **Guadagno per i guidatori:** Chiunque possieda un'auto pu√≤ iscriversi e iniziare a guadagnare offrendo passaggi. Che tu voglia arrotondare lo stipendio o fare del ride-sharing il tuo lavoro principale, il nostro servizio ti permetter√† di farlo in modo semplice e sicuro.

2. **Economico per i passeggeri:** Vogliamo rendere il ride-sharing accessibile a tutti. Le nostre tariffe saranno competitive e convenienti, consentendo a chiunque di muoversi senza dover spendere una fortuna.

3. **Basse commissioni:** A differenza di altri servizi, le nostre commissioni saranno ridotte al minimo. Vogliamo che sia i guidatori che i passeggeri traggano il massimo beneficio dall'utilizzo della piattaforma.

4. **Focus locale:** Il nostro obiettivo √® aiutare le persone a spostarsi facilmente all'interno delle citt√† italiane, comprese quelle meno servite dai trasporti pubblici. Crediamo che un servizio di ride-sharing possa davvero fare la differenza nel migliorare la mobilit√† urbana.


Sono davvero curioso di sapere cosa ne pensate. Credete che un servizio di ride-sharing tutto italiano possa avere successo? Quali sono le vostre preoccupazioni o aspettative? Quali funzionalit√† ritenete essenziali per un servizio di questo tipo?

La vostra opinione √® fondamentale per aiutarci a costruire un servizio che risponda realmente alle esigenze degli utenti. Non vedo l'ora di leggere i vostri commenti e suggerimenti!

Grazie mille per il vostro tempo e il vostro supporto.

Un saluto,

It wasn‚Äôt long ago, the thought of technology controlling lives wasn't even a speck on most of our radars. Now it‚Äôs inside of us; a part of us. 

Slowly mandated on us by the government; hidden behind the guise of protecting its citizens. It was all to control us, never to protect us.
 
Privacy has lost its meaning to the agenda of unity and protection, stripping us away from our own unique stories, graywashing us all with technology driven status, mandates, and monitoring. 

Not long ago, tech worked its way into our thoughts, blurring the line between humanity and technology, allowing it to map our brain activity to decipher our thoughts.
 
We live in a state of numbness brought on by years of artificial overstimulation and poisoned food. 

We are incapable of daring to think outside of what they dictate as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. For in the event one of us does manage to escape the psychosis and sway from normal thoughts, government mandated medication flows into our veins to suppress controversial thoughts and emotions. 

We are a collective. Where the elite few turned the many into one, and the one into nothing. They foresaw what AI had, and took it for themselves. Now we stand no chance. No freedom, no hope. 

No future. 

Only a medicated coma directed to slip our minds away from any grip towards a better life. 

I urge all of you reading this to hear my calls from the future. Separate yourselves from technology and awaken to the scheme the corrupt elite is laying out.

Listen to the thoughts in your mind, feel the earth beneath your feet, the breeze through the trees, and listen to the deep calls of the universe and God. May your future be different than ours.

I believe that one day advancements in both Voice Biometrics and Voice Authentication will result in a version of ‚ÄúShazam‚Äù you could use, unlike finding a song you hear on the radio, perhaps you could use it to hear who is talking.

Talking points:

Pros:
General use for celebrities and public figures to tell what voice is speaking.

Business use for transcriptions and showing name of who is speaking during a panel or important closed door meeting.

Ethical concerns;
Use by police and investigators who may fingerprint the voices for national security or forensics, if a database of voice fingerprints was not only public figures 

Could a mass database of authentic voices be used to detect when an AI voice impersonation is being used? Or would that database be used  by Ai voice developers to make their generations less likely to be detected?"

They look soooo good. Like definitely good enough to make movies and tv shows and stuff you think. But then you try them and it's way harder. For sure some talented prompt engineers can get way better results, but even then I think it's because they're only focusing on getting really cool looking images. And less focused on telling a narrative story. 

Recently I read [this brief essay](https://intelligentjello.substack.com/p/seeing-is-not-believing-with-ai) about why real world applied use cases look way worse than the technical demonstrations. It made me realize that the reason is real world use cases hit these boring practical problems necessary for the situation that technical demos can easily avoid. 

Here's an excerpt:

>Every week a new AI demo blows the internet away. Social media feeds waterfall with reposts, reactions, and statements that ‚ÄúEverything just changed‚Äù. And the casual observer, punchdrunk with AI news, can‚Äôt help but agree that ‚ÄúIndeed, things just changed forever‚Äù.

>However the following week, the sobered observer finds that everything has not changed. That the world of applied use cases is‚Ä¶ kinda the same. This outsized excitement over technical demos is typical in the generative AI space. We routinely overestimate how our lives will change. In reality change is iterative and rarely comes in single, sweeping advancements. AI companies, though, would have you believe otherwise.

>Generative video models are research technology that have only been lightly productized. Advancements are foundational rather than practical. This is one reason why we still lack AI videos people want to watch. Real world use cases hit weird problems. And researchers are rarely focused on the right problems. While most AI labs focus on higher levels of photorealism, filmmakers would readily forego photorealism for better lip syncing or facial movements. Demos conveniently elide these desired traits, instead showing fantastically crisp visuals.

>Because there‚Äôs a large swath of filmmaking grammar that‚Äôs totally unavailable to the artists using these models, the best existing AI videos are all basically demos‚Äî suggestions at what can be, emphasizing the amazing and hiding the weak spots."

I'm just trying to understand how in the future, all these AIs get combined into ""one omniscient that will rule the universe"". Or will this omniscient AI will be just a collection of various neural networks, kind of like how our brain has different areas for vision and senses, motor control, thoughts and prediction, etc.?

Is it possible to examine and combine the neurons directly? Or does a new network get trained through the input and output interfaces of the networks to be combined?

The cases I'm curious about are:

Neural nets with similar inputs and outputs and knowledge set, i.e. a net trained with text and information about medical advice, combined with a net trained with automotive troubleshooting. The emergent network would, for example, make new types of diagnosis.

Sorry- I'm not and AI scientist, nor have done any AI past Nvidia Jetson vision inference. I may be asking a non-sense question."

The proposal for an autonomous free society aims to create a sustainable model that allows communities to self-finance their essential social projects. This initiative, managed by and for the people, seeks to be completely detached from political influence, focusing on community cooperation to improve the quality of life for all citizens. The goal is to provide free access to housing, healthcare, food, and education, enabling individuals to focus on their personal and professional development.

# Financial Model

# Citizen Contribution

Each citizen will contribute $30 per month, forming a common fund dedicated to financing basic services. To illustrate the potential of this model, let's consider New York City, with an approximate population of 8.4 million people.

* **Population of New York**: 8,400,000 people
* **Monthly Contribution per Person**: $30
* **Total Monthly Income**: 8,400,000 √ó $30 = $252,000,000

# Resource Distribution

With a monthly income of $252 million, resources would be distributed to cover essential areas:

1. **Housing**:
   * **Annual Budget**: $180 million
   * **Description**: Construction of micro-apartments of 9 m¬≤, with a bathroom, basic kitchen, desk, and bed. Each unit would cost approximately $5,000.
   * **Annual Goal**: 36,000 units (3,000 per month)
2. **Healthcare**:
   * **Annual Budget**: $36 million
   * **Description**: Operation of hospitals and clinics providing free medical care.
   * **Goal**: 3 operational hospitals annually.
3. **Food**:
   * **Annual Budget**: $60 million
   * **Description**: Production and distribution of food through automated humanitarian food dispensers.
   * **Goal**: Supply 3 daily meals to the entire needy population.
4. **Education**:
   * **Annual Budget**: $36 million
   * **Description**: Construction and operation of high-quality, free educational institutions.
   * **Goal**: Provide continuous education and professional training programs.

# Example of New York

If we implement this model in New York, with a monthly income of $252 million, the available annual funds would be:

* **Total Annual Income**: $252,000,000 √ó 12 = $3,024,000,000

This figure would allow the financing of the aforementioned services, ensuring an equitable distribution of resources and a significant improvement in residents' quality of life. With proper planning and active community participation, this model is not only viable but also self-sustainable.

# Organization and Management

The management of this system will be handled by a transparent and democratic community institution with the following characteristics:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   * Regular publication of financial reports.
   * Open community meetings to discuss progress and receive feedback.
2. **Citizen Participation**:
   * Formation of local committees for decision-making.
   * Involvement of community leaders and volunteers in the management and operation of services.
3. **Adaptability and Flexibility**:
   * Periodic adjustments based on community needs and suggestions.
   * Continuous training for administrators and key personnel.

# Implementation and Dissemination

To bring this model to society, the following steps are proposed:

1. **Informative Campaigns**: Utilizing local media, social networks, and platforms like Reddit to educate the community about the benefits and operation of the model.
2. **Pilot Projects**: Implementing pilots in specific neighborhoods to demonstrate the model's effectiveness.
3. **Collaboration and Partnerships**: Establishing partnerships with NGOs, academic institutions, and local businesses.

# Conclusion

The autonomous free society model is a revolutionary proposal that can transform the lives of millions of people, providing access to basic services in an equitable and sustainable manner. As a project managed by and for the people, without political intervention, it ensures that funds and resources are used efficiently and transparently, fostering a fairer and more supportive community.

With the active participation of all citizens and a commitment to transparency and accountability, this model has the potential to create a truly autonomous and free society where everyone has the opportunity to fully develop.

Join us in building an Autonomous Free Society‚Äîa revolutionary project designed by and for the people, independent of political influence. By contributing $30 a month, we can create sustainable communities with free access to housing, healthcare, food, and education. Share your ideas, spread the word, and collaborate on GitHub to make this vision a reality. Together, we can transform our society and ensure everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Let's create a better future for all!

0,2024-07-13,From my experience I believe AI offers the potential for a new era of mental health support.,u/-GeneralDerp-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e2ff7d/from_my_experience_i_believe_ai_offers_the/,Futurology,"I believe that regularly accessing GPT-4o can significantly aid in managing depression, dissociation, and anxiety. For me, it has been more effective than any previous talk therapy I have had.

First, it's important to note that AI isn't the entire solution. It should be used alongside other practices like journaling experiences and talking out loud about them to help identify emotions and even bodily sensations. Then AI is introduced to understand these feelings/emotions/sensations better. 

Unlike traditional therapy, AI allows you to explore your feelings in real-time, exactly when you experience them. This immediate access wasn't possible before, as no service can realistically be available 24/7. You no longer have to catch a feeling for later use in therapy or attempt to recreate it by retelling stories. 

Talking to an AI is also easier than talking to a person because it is judgment-free, and you can take as much time as you need. The tone of the AI is positive so it can help prevent misinterpreting the tone of a therapist which might happen if you are insecure and interpret their tone in a negative light which can make you feel judged.

However, I would say to be mindful of using AI in this way and ensuring it doesn't cause harm. GPT-4o can help at assessing this, and I regularly have check ins where we assess if the conversation is helping me short term/long term or harming me. It can ask how things are in different aspects of life which makes assessing much easier. While it has worked well for my depression, anxiety, and dissociation, it may not be suitable for other mental illnesses as I do not have experience with that.

There's a valid concern that AI could act as an echo chamber for negative beliefs/thoughts, but I find GPT-4o offers alternative insights and helps me understand why my perspective might be clouded but you definitely have to go into it making it clear that your feelings and thoughts are subjective (feelings are not facts, just indicators).

In addition to exploring feelings, GPT-4o is also helpful during anxiety attacks. It can rationally explain that what I'm experiencing is just anxiety and that I'm not dying, which is calming. This helps me ride the wave of anxiety and connect with my body, rather than feeling overwhelmed and running away from it.

Using AI effectively requires building up a skill, but it comes naturally as you open up to it. It is better to focus on sensations and feelings rather than using it as talk therapy (which is why I recommended journaling/talking out loud beforehand to identify these emotions), 4o is definitely more solution-oriented; I think GPT-4o can guide you on how to use it effectively.

GPT-4o also remembers previous conversations, which helps it understand what I'm trying to express. While I worry about data privacy, the positive influence of GPT-4o makes it feel like an acceptable trade-off, although I do really dislike and am cautious of that aspect.

I feel that just as the internet gave us constant access to information, AI now provides us with continuous access to mental health self-exploration, and can also act as a translatory tool for emotions to make them easier to understand. Previously getting anywhere close to this required an external party and even high cost services couldn't do what it can do, I really think it could be revolutionary for the mental health epidemic.

This is my first time posting something like this. Hope I'm in the right place, this sub feels accurate as I think it's the future of technology assisting mental health but if this is the wrong place then please point me in the right direction! Let me know what you think and if you have any questions, thanks for reading :)

I recently came across the Tesla shareholder meeting in which Elon explained how Tesla will basically dominate the humanoid robot market over startups and other companies. However,  I  think there is some hope for startups in this space. I think that there are some niche industries with definitely 100B dollar valuation potential if done correctly, and that Tesla couldn't enter the market with it's general purpose humanoid robot. I really see the security sector as a potential industry, along with a few others like for space robots.

This is because there are a lot of software/AI features and hardware of the robot that will need to be different than from the general humanoid. 

Do you really see a future in which other humanoid robotics startup have some space in a few industries which general purpose humanoids are worse than niche humanoids? 

Maybe the potential in these industries are not the 15 trillion TAM Elon expects the general purpose humanoid to be, but maybe 500B? Maybe a little less, a bit more? "

One of my favorite examples of this is Athene's parody show where he's interviewing AI versions of celebrities, both dead and alive. A couple of shorts for reference:

* [AI Gordon Ramsay Trashes Twitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWcR0t_w_gA&ab_channel=AtheneWins)
* [AI MoistCr1tikal Invents a New Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqfq6yesckk&ab_channel=AtheneWins)

The answers given by these avatars range from ridiculous non sequiturs to accurate depictions of the real life people they're supposed to portray. There's no doubt in my mind that they will only become more relatable in time.

If we follow this trajectory, will we eventually get to the point where the ""personalities"" or defining traits of AI will transcend those of any human throughout history? Will they develop their own sense of humor that only someone with their level of knowledge would understand and appreciate? Will they form their own set of social norms aided by game theory? Or is it simply the case that AI will never have any values and goals of their own and therefore will never develop a ""true"" personality?"

321,2024-07-16,A surprising conclusion: we already have the *capability* to be a Kardashev Type 1 civilization. ,u/RGregoryClark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e4q3ew/a_surprising_conclusion_we_already_have_the/,Futurology," Kardashev famously came up with a classification of technological civilizations. Type 1 means you would control all the energy falling on your home planet. Type 2 means controlling all the energy on your home star. And Type 3, all the energy of your home galaxy.  

 Most discussions estimate us reaching Type 1 stage within 100 to 200 years. But in fact we already may have the *capability* to do so. First, a key fact is if a solar power station is close-in to the Sun then we can collect orders of magnitude greater power than for solar stations at Earth‚Äôs distance from the Sun.  

The Parker Solar Probe shows we have capability for probes close in to the Sun. The Sun puts out 4x10^26 watts. For its 700,000 km radius that‚Äôs 6.5x10^13 watts per square kilometer. Humans use 17 terawatts, 17x10^12, so only 0.26 square km, 500 m across, of the Suns solar output would need to be captured.  

 For transmitting the power to Earth we can use solar-pumped lasers:  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-pumped_laser. 

 The total amount of solar energy received by Earth is 10,000 times the human usage amount. Once we have a close-in solar station providing the current human energy needs, then to collect 10,000 times greater, as would a Type 1 civilization, we would just need to make multiple copies of this solar power station by automated processes. Or considering the total collecting area would only be 50 km across, compared to the Sun‚Äôs 1.4 million km across, we could probably make a single one of the size to accomplish it.  

 Then recent reports that seem to suggest artificial mega-structures around other stars might not be so far-fetched:  

New study finds potential alien mega-structures known as ‚Äòdyson spheres‚Äô.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCi7T1z7FaE  

This is because once you achieve interplanetary spaceflight, even if unmanned, you then have the capability to collect sufficient stellar power from close-in orbiting stellar satellites to provide all the power the civilization needs.  

 Then as the civilization grows in size you just create more of equivalent power stations by automated processes.   "

Robotics sort of invokes a ""High school robotics team that slaps a saw blade on a hunk of metal with a remote control radio""  
But when and will we ever get to that point of a blue collar worker needing to repair and treat these arms or even actual robotic machines as a mechanic would service a car?  
I'm asking this because I saw a kind of silly ad recently where two oily amazon workers in mechanics job suits were repairing an amazon worker bot of some sort.

The future is not a location, it's a state of elapsed conditionals. We think time is what will make the future happen, but infinite time will not guarantee every conditional will elapse. The future can happen anytime, because the future is on the other side of specific work to achieve tasks X and Y to arrive at structure Z. Time can make anything happen, but it does not guarantee everything will happen. Work travels us up that mountain, not time.

The location of structure Z is at the end of an inventor's intention, or a corporation you hope to buy from, but always the result of sufficient intention and application. You hope that it will be accessible, but there are places in the world where the future will never reach, and people who will never see it, regardless of what era they supposedly live in, because they will never need or want structure Z, or maybe can never afford it, or can never understand let alone make or find it themselves. You want to go to a place where the structure is already built, but the structure will be the same no matter who builds it, and it will always be at the end of similar applied intention, everywhere it ever was.

Time is not what gives. The facts of how anything is possible sit where they are, not waiting, always ready."

This film lifts the veil of ignorance and uncovers what has been happening for 30 years right before our eyes, showing how we have been manipulated like puppets. We were turned into controlled biorobots and led to destroy the world with our own hands, approaching global demise. For 30 years, we have been heading towards the point of no return. We were led to civilizational war and subsequent slavery. The facts and evidence presented in the movie ‚ÄúThe IMPACT‚Äù fundamentally destroy the belief that our world is controlled by the ‚ÄúCommittee of 300,‚Äù ancient clans, groups of politicians, or the transnational corporations behind them. While this might have been true in the past, the film‚Äôs extensive investigation and deep analysis reveal who truly seeks global power over the entire world.

This truth is shocking, but it also helps us understand all the cause-and-effect relationships of what is happening in the world and makes us aware of what is coming in the near future. How can we prepare ourselves for such revelations? What implications does this have for global governance, individual freedoms, and technological advancements? Join the discussion on how societies can navigate this looming crisis and what actions we can take today to secure a better tomorrow amidst these revelations."

It's quite critical of the CCP (if you watch to the end it talks of government prison camps for troublesome unemployed people). It lumps AI & robotics into the same ""bad"" category it puts the CCP.

Carrot RoboTaxi, the firm it talks about, has its technical rough edges. But as people say about AI - it gets relentlessly better. These problems will fade.

Tens of millions of people in Western countries rely on driving jobs of one sort or another. Gig work tides many over in financial emergencies. When that is taken away, I suspect the impact on society will be huge. In France, they take to the streets and bring Paris to a standstill for far smaller things.

One one hand, we already have prototypes made and such, but aside from taking a long time, even if a final product is made and is ready for commercial use, I am unsure if it would ever even be worth it financially. Aside from people affording it (let's say it becomes commercially available for common public), there's also having urban design and roadways/paths to cater the literal Air Traffic. In addition, people may not want it due to stuff like drunk drivers or reckless drivers. Those dangers on regular cars are one thing, but you're also more likely to fall to your death with a flying car, or cause more damage if a flying car can hit higher-up floors.

  
For one way it could work though, with an optimistic view, I could see it more of a service vehicle, like how there's taxis/Uber or trains."

Comments mentioned the practicality and drawbacks of such technology, but I think the entire thread did a disservice with respect to futurology and the idea of Flying Cars.

What I propose‚Äîand in line with the spirit of r/futurology‚Äîis diving deeper into the origin of flying cars. Perhaps looking into the past can help us attempt to project the future.

## Why Flying Cars?

In the early 20th century, all walks of people‚Äîfrom the poorest of the poor to the richest of the rich‚Äîsaw incredible development. The industrial revolution included many great technologies, leveraging new discoveries to create amazing applications. Furthermore, America used to be definitively optimistic, meaning that people believed that the future will be better, and there was a defined plan to make it happen (e.g. build an east-west railroad to transport people, resources, etc). People saw so much of this rapid growth in application of new inventions that it actually seemed like flying cars on the moon is just a matter of when, not if. But things have changed.

## Why No Flying Cars?

Around the 1980s (plus or minus a decade), America changed to being indefinitely optimistic, meaning that people believe that things will be better in the future, but we don‚Äôt have a definite plan to make it happen: we don‚Äôt know exactly what we want the future to look like. It‚Äôs not as easy as saying let‚Äôs build out roads and infrastructure, since a lot of the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù stuff to do has been agreed on and completed. In other words, there is no clear ‚Äúlet‚Äôs build railroads to connect people, businesses, etc.‚Äù in today‚Äôs society.

Yes, there are still new inventions, particularly a lot of software in the past couple of decades, but it hasn‚Äôt been planned. Social Media giants skirt ethics and morals, having no defined accountability other than what they choose to do. AI regulations are barely discussed in the mainstream political arena. There are new inventions, but the country is not aligned on direction.

## Summation

Flying cars now get talked about too literally as an invention when really it was more a commentary on how fast things were developing at the time (1910-1960). Cars now mostly look homogeneous and have little to no innovation, which better symbolizes how development has slowed in that industry. Invention still exists, but in a different environment, it grows differently.

I wouldn‚Äôt expect flying cars anytime soon."

Because hemp seeds are considered one of the most complete nutritional elements that exist in the world, in fact they fall into the world of the best superfoods.

They contain vitamins, proteins, minerals, Omega3, Omega6, they improve metabolism, strengthen the immune system, have a high content of essential amino acids.

Hemp seed oil is an exceptional anti-inflammatory.

These seeds can be consumed in soups, sauces, salads or mixed with other flours to make bread, cakes, etc..."

I‚Äôve thought about how in the future, we will probably all be eating insects instead of beef, mutton, etc. I‚Äôve seen a lot of resistance to the idea, people calling it ‚Äúgross‚Äù and ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù etc.

And honestly? As long as they were properly cooked, i actually wouldn‚Äôt mind eating a lot of insect species. No way i‚Äôd eat a slug or a worm, but stuff like crickets, spiders, locusts etc i don‚Äôt think i would mind too much. And tbh, i think we‚Äôre all gonna have to do it, if we want the planet to not be a hellhole.

So, my question is, would YOU eat insects, or at least try it out if you had to?"

This setup with the use of hot electric pulses to melt those neurons and precise ultrasonic pulses to snap nanofiber materials can grow a new kind of universe. We can collect energy from continuous splits in a nanofiber material or immune cell like a macrophage that's connected to the neuron structure. Imagine a network branching out infinitely like a tree, ensuring every space in the universe is free from boundless pain.

**The benefits are enlightening:** writing universally funny jokes, sharing cosmic feasts, turning fears into epic theater shows, playing infinite games, mastering cosmic music in a day, and divine support from beings like Angels and a unified God. Living forever, celebrating infinite joy and everyone‚Äôs benevolence with no fear!

**Freewill is not an illusion after this project:** After we understand moments' subdivisions fully without uncertainties about infinite minds or universe scales within each boundary, we can make safe, informed decisions. This means being able to choose how the mind, universe, and moments work, which we can't currently do due to lack of understanding.

**Imagine the potential:** Organizing moments, matter, and consciousness in a way that benefits everyone. The Cosmos Neuron allows us to replace unknown structures with a new cosmic structure, leading to more beneficial and ethical experiences.

**Safety and Privacy:** In this scenario, we manifest safety with privacy. We ensure everyone's well-being while respecting personal boundaries. We aim to understand the impact of our actions on the universe without intruding on individual privacy. This balance is essential to create a universe where safety is maintained without compromising our privacy.

**Safety and Unity:** If privacy proves to be contradictory to safety, then we might need to manifest safety with unity. In this scenario, everyone understands one being, and that being understands everyone. We'd all share the same perspective, which might be necessary to mitigate uncertainties, risks, and unsafe conflicts. This unified understanding would help address issues like AI development, oil exploitation, and unsafe medical experiments, ensuring they are conducted with safe practices for everyone. It means sacrificing some privacy for the sake of perfect safety from infinite suffering and an enlightened existence.

Let's team up, create a lab, and test these nanofibers for infinitely inward, outward growth and recursive energy splits. We can create a Cosmos Neuron that ensures safety and joy for everyone, rewriting history with infinite fun and understanding.

War, disease, agriculture, wealth, some mental illness, are things that can sometimes be caused by a separation from nature. 

When people are connected to nature, wars often aren't as large or as bad. People have access to natural resources like food, medicine, and clean water, and people are naturally more concerned to one and other because of their connection to the land.  Also, there's no emphasis on building weapons of destruction, so new technologies similar to the atom bomb or nuclear weapons are unlikely to be created.

We get are medicines from nature; plants that have evolved with us in the wild that make medicine for us, and Shamans find them in the forest and in nature and use them to treat illness. Plants make the medicine because we evolved with them, if we truly leave nature, we do not know what the reprecutions will be. We have to be in nature for plants to evolve with us, if they are going to make medicines for us at all.  Illness can also be treated by herbalists as well, and some people rely on herbalists for healing. Herbalists can be trained in traditional fold medicine. You can also drink loose leaf herbal teas to improve health. You can see a Shaman for dental care too, but you should keep your dentist because they can actually be quite good.

The day came and went when ancient people needed to come in from the wild, and live in communities, and use agriculture to farm. We did it because of environmental conditions, and as soon as conditions improved, we should have gone back to being hunters gatherers, but we didn't. This is how wealth was created. When we are in nature, we only take what we need, but when we are separated from nature we want an abundance of things that are not necessary, and all the things we have, we get in the wrong way.  Because of wealth, products are harvested from the earth, like rare metals; mines destroy landscapes, animal fur and feathers; causing unnecessary animal suffering, and gemstones; where workers suffer poisoning, ingery, or even death. 

Most mental illnesses can be treated successfully by shamans, and can improve chances of complete recovery.  Mental illness is looked at as a special gift, and the person affected is given lots of support by their community.  A great deal of people with mental illnes recover completely because they are taken aside and taught how to work with this gift by a Shaman. Mental illness can also be treated by herbalists.

 A good way to get connected with mother nature is by growing your own food. Try growing using permaculture; landscapes that mimic the pattern of nature, and grow Food Forests; Edible plants mimicking a natural forest.  Also, minimize the amount of roads built substantially, and use unpaved paths. Too many roads can damage the landscape causing trees to be susceptible to disease, and trees to eventually die, and make it so wild animals can't roam. Roads also lead to unregulated forest destruction, making it easier for people to cut down trees.  We can build homes from sustainable materials as well; like rock, cob, brick, straw bale, and earth bag houses; houses built from bags of dirt. Stop building from materials that are unsustainable. Also, allowing for forests to grow back, and for people to live in the forest, would give us all a place in nature to directly connect with mother earth.  More time and effort needs to be spent on alawing forests to grow back, and we have to stop cutting them down, so keeping them must be top priority. We need more laws that protect nature, as well as human rights laws.  Also, it's important to note that every civilization that has committed deforestation, has vanished. Humans are ment to live in forests, just look at the Amazon, or the United States before the colonization. 

Everybody wants things they don't need; a fancy car, a fancy job, a fancy house. None of these things fulfill a person. They are bottomless pits.  Being connected to nature is a true way of finding peace."

Does anyone else think this could possibly be because of the mass legalization in the US? My thinking is that maybe trafficking marijuana is no longer as profitable and maybe they don‚Äôt want it going to their own people. Or maybe the plots they‚Äôre raiding aren‚Äôt associated with the cartels and they‚Äôre taking out competition? Or is it maybe just for show? Are they maybe not actually destroying it and just taking it to profit? I know in the end the specific answer doesn‚Äôt really matter, I‚Äôm just curious to see what anyone else thinks and possibly to get educated more on what goes on in Mexico. 

Also, what do you think that could lead to? Increased smuggling of harder drugs, like cocaine? Would it be possible/legal for them to sell to a dispensary in the US? And also, I‚Äôve seen some things about opiates being smuggled/spreading from US to Mexico. Why would that be?? If not for medical purposes, then what? To traffic it somewhere else?

0,2024-07-20,Breakthrough in Renewable Energy: Solar Windows Could Revolutionize Urban Architecture,u/CocoJinxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e81neu/breakthrough_in_renewable_energy_solar_windows/,Futurology,"Hey everyone,  
  
I recently came across an exciting development in the field of renewable energy that I think deserves more attention. Researchers at \[University/Company Name\] have made significant strides in creating transparent solar windows. These innovative windows can generate electricity while still allowing light to pass through, potentially transforming how we think about urban architecture and energy consumption.  
  
 **How It Works**  
  
These solar windows use a combination of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials and a special coating that allows them to harvest sunlight efficiently without blocking the view. Unlike traditional solar panels, which are often bulky and visually intrusive, solar windows can seamlessly integrate into existing buildings.  
  
**Potential Impact**  


1. **Urban Energy Generation**: With cities being major energy consumers, the widespread adoption of solar windows could significantly reduce urban carbon footprints. Skyscrapers and high-rise buildings could become vertical solar farms, contributing to the local power grid.  
  
2. **Energy Independence**: Buildings could generate a portion of their own electricity, reducing reliance on external power sources and potentially lowering energy costs for residents and businesses.  
  
3. **Sustainable Construction**: As cities expand, integrating solar windows into new buildings could promote more sustainable development practices and reduce the overall environmental impact of urban growth.  
  
**Challenges and Next Steps**  
  
While the technology is promising, there are still challenges to overcome:  
  
\- **Efficiency**: Current models of solar windows are less efficient than traditional solar panels, but ongoing research aims to close this gap.  
\- **Cost**: The initial production and installation costs are high, but economies of scale and technological advancements could bring prices down in the future.  
\- **Durability**: Ensuring that these windows can withstand weather conditions and maintain efficiency over time is crucial for long-term adoption.  
  
**Call to Action**  
  
I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this breakthrough. How do you see solar windows impacting our future cities? Are there any other emerging technologies that could complement this development? Let's discuss!

0,2024-07-20,Plan(s) for when most (if not all) service jobs get replaced by automation and AI?,u/Opening-Aardvark1406,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e8b75d/plans_for_when_most_if_not_all_service_jobs_get/,Futurology,"What I would like to know is what exactly the plan is for when more and more service jobs get replaced? It is already happening and I suspect it will only accelerate in the next 10-20 years ‚Äì See (nearly) fully automated restaurants and pharmacies, artists and writers being laid off due to AI, etc.

The argument I see most often and find unsatisfying is ‚ÄúNew jobs will pop up, just like during the industrial revolution/commercialization of computers.‚Äù The reason why I find this unsatisfying is that in the previous cases, the labor transitions barely, if anyhow, required new skills that people did not already have. Going from picking up a hoe to pulling a lever isn‚Äôt much different. Neither is repeatedly pulling a lever to repeatedly pressing specific buttons on a computer/machine. However, going from customer service or food handling to maintaining/troubleshooting complicated AI software and hardware that is capable of self-correcting errors and/or requires a Ph.D. in a STEM field is a much higher leap forward that the vast majority of people with those jobs are just not ready for without having some kind of a technical degree. Having to do so is simply unattainable (either financially or for lack of interest) for most current service jobs.

That said, as more and more service jobs are being replaced, what is the path forward to avoid large segments of the population from going into poverty? Making technical education less expensive/free, UBI, and/or something else?"

0,2024-07-21,"If humans ever achieve FTL travel, how would we tell the location of a spaceship moving at FTL speed?",u/LBN2314,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e8kln6/if_humans_ever_achieve_ftl_travel_how_would_we/,Futurology,"I see a lot of posts talking about FTL travel, and their physics, and logic behind them. But I have not seen anywhere about the coordination system for location after achieving FTL Travel. So when we do finally achieve FTL travel, how would they communicate to tell their location during FLT Warp?



If we are traveling at light speed, which is 299 792 458 m/s. How would we tell that we are at a specific location, because we would be constantly moving extremely fast.



My idea is we separate the entirety of space into sectors. To do that we need a point that doesn't move, since the universe is always expanding, as well as the Earth and Solar system always moving, we need an anchor that doesn't move, and can be used as Origin point. I'd say we only limit our travel to our galaxy first, so it‚Äôs easy to think and warp out head around.



In Space there is no defined up, down, left, or right in space. Anywhere can be up, down, left, right. The galaxy is tilted 60 degrees from the view of the solar system, but for the sake of this, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs flat, it‚Äôs 0 degrees, and the solar system is the one that is tilted. Now there is an ‚Äúup‚Äù and a ‚Äúdown‚Äù



Now let‚Äôs call the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, Point O or Omega. And from Omega there are 3 axes; x, y & z. In total we have 6 directions from these axes. Now let‚Äôs first figure out the measurement for a fixed location, such as locations for planets, celestial objects, etc‚Ä¶



I like the terms Latitude, and Altitude as measurement, so let‚Äôs give the name for this measurement as ‚ÄúSpatitude‚Äù derived from the latin word ‚ÄúSpatium‚Äù combined with the suffix ‚Äú-tude.‚Äù Although I already know there is a unit of measurement in space, I just want to make it easier to understand what is to come later.¬†



1 unit of Spatitude is equal to 1 light second, so 299 792 458 meters. So saying X is 5 Spatitudes would be saying 5 light seconds away from Omega.



Next, communicating your location during FTL travel, when you are moving at an extremely high speed, it would be hard to say where you are, because the location you just said you were at, you are already far from it. A new measurement is called Spatium, directly from Latin. 1 Spatium is equal to 1 light minute. With that laid out, we have to first figure how to address the problem of having 8 different hemispheres. Since it‚Äôs a 3 dimensional area, we need a simple way to understand the location, 8 hemispheres:



x : y : z

-x : y : z¬†

x : -y : z

x : y : -z

-x : -y : -z

x : -y : -z

-x : y : -z

-x : -y : z



We will need a way to address each of the cubic space area in a simple term, so:



x : y : z. - Alpha

-x : y : z¬† - Beta

x : -y : z - Gamma

x : y : -z - Delta

-x : -y : -z - Epsilon

x : -y : -z - Zeta

-x : y : -z - Eta

-x : -y : z - Theta



Now we can put all together to, first to address a location for a fixed object in space:



Spatium ; Spatitude



So an example, let‚Äôs create a random planet, let‚Äôs call Planet X. Planet X lies at \[ Zeta 782 ; 30 : 45 : 12 \]



Zeta 782 >> It tells that the location is within 46,860 to 46,920 light seconds in the direction of x, -46,860 to -46,920 light seconds in the direction of y, -46,860 to -46,920 light seconds in the direction of z away from Omega.



30 : 45 : 12 >> Each indicate the Spatitude unit within Zeta 782, it‚Äôs very simple to calculate, we just have to multiple 782 with 60, then subtract with the numbers in the listed, so



X¬† is (782 \* 60) - 30 = 46,890

Y¬† is (782 \* 60) - 45 = 46,875

Z¬† is (782 \* 60) - 12 = 46,908



And Since Zeta‚Äôs coordinates are x : -y : -z, x & y‚Äôs units will have to be in the negative. So the exact location of Planet X is 46,890 Spatitude in the direction of x, -46,875 Spatitude in the direction of y, -46,908 Spatitude in the direction of z all away from Omega.



Second, to address a spaceship that is moving in FTL‚Ä¶



This is the simpler one as we just have to address the Spatium, so a Spaceship reports that they are currently at Delta 648 or Alpha 873.



But a few cons we will encounter is



1. Universal Agreement - Everyone will need to agree that this will be the system in place of measuring FTL travel.
2. The galaxy isn‚Äôt at a fixed location, I just used this because it moves relatively slow for its size, so maps and Navigational Systems will need recalibrations regularly to ensure precise location.



Any thoughts on this, can it be changed in a way to make it more efficient?

Here is the link to the video üëâ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPZEzxj7JUk&t=321s) Hope you like it! Cheers!"

The obvious beneficiaries of this would be media companies and established internet retailers (with the possible exception of Amazon). Many people get their news from social media. If those sites devolve into nothing but low quality bot-generated content, it seems users might turn to traditional news sources (NYT, WSJ) or aggregators. 

Similarly, if bots and AI make it impossible to comparison shop using Google or Amazon Marketplace, people may be more likely to shop at a few trusted online retailers. "

Self driving cars, AI, robots, quantum computing, printed organs, etc etc, that are apparently sure to transform our world.

But then you take a step back, and you hear what the experts have to say, and it feels like technology is‚Ä¶ kinda stagnating, to be honest. It feels like technology is moving slowly, and may even be slowing down.

How long have we heard about self driving cars, only to see them struggle with rain and fog, and crash into things, just like they did a decade ago? How many times have you seen the AI hype media frenzy, only to be disappointed by how dumb and lackluster AI is? How many more posts are we going to get about cancer / diabetes / autoimmune disease etc ‚Äòbreakthroughs‚Äô that either don‚Äôt materalise, or have a significant caveat, or both? I bet you‚Äôve seen that stuff more than a few times.

And when i take a look at what‚Äôs REALLY changed,  i struggle to find any main examples that aren‚Äôt just computers and electronics. People point to cell phones, computers, the transition from CD‚Äôs / DVD‚Äôs to digital storage, online shopping, etc as examples of technological change. But one thing that skeptics point out is that that‚Äôs just electronics, and that those are the main things that have changed. And tbh, i have a hard time seeing how they‚Äôre wrong. Cancer is still a dangerous disease, and the standard treatments are still chemo, radiotherapy, and surgery. Autoimmune diseases are still dangerous, with no cure in sight. Diabetes and other endocrine disorders are still treated by injecting hormones. Heart disease still affects millions every year. I could go on. Self driving cars haven‚Äôt seen too much progress, printed organs are still decades away, xenotransplantation is likely years and years away at best. AI is still dumb. Etc etc.

And another thing to consider is that those advancements in electronics are only due to Moore‚Äôs Law, which a lot of experts agree will probably end sooner rather than later. So soon, we may not even have better electronics anymore. Oh sure, there‚Äôs graphene and such, but that‚Äòs probably many years away at best. So we may wake up on New Year‚Äôs Day 2050, and find that even less has changed from 2020 to 2050, than from 1990 to 2020. And that scenario terrifies me, to be honest.

So yeah, i‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

I went to the library with him last week and that's where we read. We tried ebooks, kindle, and more but he just couldn't read at all.  
  
I know all this because I used to tutor him when he was in high school and teaching him would require reading tons of pages in a social studies, math and science textbook. ¬†He would read tons of pages finishing like 10 chapters in one sitting and he loved learning.¬†

He can't do this anymore and he is only in his twenties. It would be a joy for me to see him regain those learning skills he had back in high school, and work a 9-5 job, regain his hobbies, passions and interests as well.¬†

So what do you guys think about future tech and how can it help people similar to him?

The sheer amount of dirt, asphalt, brick, concrete, steel, plastic and rubber necessary to sustain our modern way of life is staggering. The US has adopted the newest tech to maximize margins--something it is very good at. Meanwhile, the Russians still have a predominantly old school skilled laborer/metalworking/welder labor force. Having watched the exit of the baby boomers from general industry in the US, it is pretty scary to see how fragile our modern industrial base is. While the LCD screens on heavy equipment are neat, they often lead to difficult to diagnose and solve electrical or computer issues. Add in DEF issues and it becomes difficult to operate. I wonder if the same is true for things like tanks or jets. While the US is ahead of Russia in many areas, I do have a suspicion that the Russians are doubling down on late 20th century tech and that might be the wise choice given how fragile modern tech is. At work, we are looking at replacing some old CAT diesels (1300 hp each) with electric motors but the panels required in order to run the motors are 1.5 years out. With a good local machine shop or an on site machine shop, you could keep those diesels going indefinitely. "

7,2024-07-24,Does Energy Drive Innovation,u/Mammoth_Sherbet7689,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1eawipd/does_energy_drive_innovation/,Futurology,"I believe technological progress that advances civilization is cool, and important. So I've spent a while researching what drives progress. I believe it progress comes in two parts: Invention (product is created), and innovation (product is cheaper, better, and manufactured at scale). Trying to invent something is usually high risk, and is thus created or funded by the public sector. If the invention hits a ""line of profitability"", where it can be turned into a product with value, the private sector researches and manufactures the product. This is where most of the innovation occurs, since a better product = more profit. At least in a capitalistic landscape.

What I've realized about the nature of innovation/progress is that it doesn't automatically happen like a lot of people assume it will. You need a lot of people putting in a lot of effort for advancements to be made. That's another story though.

What causes periods of substantial tech advancement? What's the fastest path towards the future? There are a couple of things involved, but I believe what enables advancement is energy. Coincidentally, the Kardashev scale which measures the advancement of a civilization, is based on energy.

Discovering fire was a major advancement for humanity, allowing us warmth, light, and the ability to cook.

A lot of factors came together to enable the first Industrial Revolution, but I don't think it would've happened without the creation (improvement, actually) of the steam engine. I think fundamentally, once you create a device that generates energy better than what exists (the water mill at the time), people eventually create products for various industries that are better than what existed previously, because now products can utilize more energy. For example, people used energy from animals to travel, then, the steam engine made the steam locomotive possible. Transportation revolutionized.

The power to generate energy from oil and electricity powered the second Industrial Revolution. The internal combustion engine transformed transportation again. Electricity enabled lightbulbs and x-rays. Some advancements don't seem to be connected to increased energy though, like vaccines, antibiotics.

I don't think nuclear energy is an exception to this rule. Although it didn't power another Industrial Revolution, I believe it could have if its potential was fully realized, but public fear prevented that. In fact, it did result in one major tech advancement - nuclear weapons.

I wonder if the majority of engineering challenges would be solved if we could harness something like fusion energy. Please give me your thoughts on my thought process and theory, where the holes are, etc."

These children would be educated in a way that ensures they don‚Äôt experience emotional issues from not having parents. Many countries are facing extremely low birth rates, and measures like subsidies or tax cuts haven‚Äôt resolved the underlying problems. When women have the same career opportunities as men, many choose to pursue their careers over having children. It‚Äôs often said that the high cost and time commitment of raising children discourages people from starting families. It‚Äôs not fair to expect an educated adult to give up their career potential. The government‚Äôs role is to ensure the country‚Äôs continuity and strength, and an extremely low birth rate is unsustainable. With fewer young people contributing to the economy, there‚Äôs an increased burden on social services and medicare systems, especially as the aging population grows. To make this sustainable, the government needs to intervene."

It is true that in the middle ages the population was 1/5 of what it is now, but the villages literally had 4 houses and a church.

One of the biggest challenges to overcome seems to be the sheer complexity of fabricating the processors needed for such a robot. The industry standard is extreme ultraviolet lithography, which uses a plethora of obscenely expensive and difficult to produce components. Another alternative has come along called NIL, which simply uses a sort of stamp to produce the layers of a semiconductor. Considering each template can be used thousands of times, while the wafer is developed, an electron beam and ion etching device produces new templates (arguably the most precise components). Since this process seems considerably more efficient and simpler than EUV, is it possible self-replicating machines could one day build such a fabricator reliably?

Innovation is nice and good but why people are not acknowledging the fact that for example sooner or later AI/robotics innovations are going to replace us in terms of jobs.

for example driverless cars, those millions of taxi drivers who earn their daily money to keep them and their families alive based on that one job and just one nice day a ""Great software update"" in Tesla and they just loose their jobs.

also as we progress in future, I think robots are going to be part of our lives, it's like our life in 2040 going to be look like that ""Detroit Become Human"" game, low profile jobs like street cleaner, plumber, taxi drivers, farm labors getting replaced of robots, and we can use robots like buy them from a Boston Dynamics showroom(in near future) and make them do our house chores like cooking, cleaning etc. and then robots realizing that we're using them as toys to do our hard work and then robots demanding their rights as equal as robots, and at that time in future time when someone says ""I hate robots because they are making me suffer from this and that"" then another person saying this person is being ""robocist""(The term racist but used for robots).

I am really starting to hate this AI and Robotics innovations because I'm seriously afraid, I go to bed and I genuinely think one day people are going to suffer from all this,

Big Tech companies like Micorosft, Google, OpenAI making bazillions of profits and when facing media they give diplomat type answers like ""AI is going to have more positive impact than negative"" while on the other hands people will keep losing jobs and suffering from all other aspects and these big tech CxO's sit on their private jets and just laugh.

And how can those e/acc people think that humans will prosper in future AI dystopian era?, are they blind? are they not seeing this mass layoffs from companies every other day? are they not seeing those call center jobs getting replaced by automated AI voice?

I am really having some nightmares around this things, also you can correct me if I am wrong or give me a better positive perspective to look in this AI thing."

This device harnesses solar power and cellular connectivity, eliminating the need for traditional batteries or WiFi/Bluetooth setups.

# Key Features:

* **Battery-Free Operation**: Powered entirely by solar energy, ensuring long-term, hassle-free use.
* **Adaptive Polling Rates**: Adjusts data transmission based on solar energy production and storage levels, optimizing performance.
* **Cellular Connectivity**: Connects via major cellular providers in the US, Canada, and abroad, bypassing the need for WiFi or Bluetooth.
* **No Recurring Fees**: All connectivity included for the life of the product.

# Advantages of Cellular Over WiFi and Bluetooth:

* **Simplified Setup**: Avoids common setup issues like ""Add your WiFi Password"" or ""Pair Bluetooth Device."" Cellular connectivity ensures a smooth setup process.
* **Extended Range**: Ideal for propane tanks located more than 20 yards from the home, which is often beyond WiFi or Bluetooth range. Cellular coverage extends far beyond, providing reliable data transmission.

# Advanced Technology:

* **Dynamic Energy Management**: The device intelligently manages its energy usage, balancing solar input with energy storage to ensure continuous operation. This debunks the myth that consumer electronics always need to be plugged in or use short-lived batteries.

# Practical Applications:

This technology is perfect for homeowners and Airbnb hosts who need a reliable, hassle-free solution for monitoring propane levels in remote locations. It exemplifies how IoT can simplify life and enhance efficiency.

Centri‚Äôs propane tank monitor is a groundbreaking advancement in home-based IoT, offering unparalleled freedom and connectivity.

Let's imagine SearchGPT as a future success story/product that becomes integrated withing chatGPT and further OpenAI's models as the ""backend"". Then, let's also suppose that we reach a threshold where AI would not just answering questions like a traditional search engine, but comprehending all available knowledge and providing insights seamlessly with precision. 

This raises intriguing questions about the future of the internet and content creation:

- Will traditional websites and navigation as we know them become obsolete?
- How will creators and publishers share information if 'browsing' isn't that much necessary?
- Could the world wide web evolve to serve societal needs in a fundamentally different way? Or become useless?


The web has always been a dynamic space, adapting to new technologies and user behaviors. But with AI potentially reshaping how we access and interact with 'information' at its root, could we see a future where ""websites"" aren't the primary means of sharing content? What do you think this future might look like, and how should we prepare for it?"

However, this view overlooks a few critical points.

¬†

The Common Narrative:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI replaces human workers, causing mass unemployment.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The rich, owning the AI, will get richer.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Everyone else becomes destitute due to job loss. UBI is given, but only enough to survive.

¬†

Why This Narrative Falls Apart:

¬†

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Revenue Problem:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Businesses need customers to generate revenue.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass unemployment means no consumers, leading to business failures.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Remember: Business success = Revenue - Expenses

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI might reduce expenses (labor costs), but decimating revenue (consumer purchasing power) still leads to failure.

¬†

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†The Nature of Wealth:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Most ""rich"" I believe people are talking about are wealthy on paper through business ownership.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If businesses fail due to lack of consumers, this wealth evaporates.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The ""rich"" depend on a strong consumer base to maintain their wealth.

¬†

A More Realistic Scenario:

¬†

Consider this equation:

¬†

Products Available per Capita for Non-Rich = (Total Goods and Services Produced - Consumption of ""Rich"") / (Total Number of People - Total Number of ""Rich"")

¬†

If this increases, more goods and services become available for the average person. I believe AGI/ASI will increase this because:

¬†

a)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Increased Production:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI should be more efficient than humans.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It's easier to create more AI/robots than people.

¬†

b)¬†¬†¬†¬† Limited Consumption by the Rich:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The wealthy already consume less than they could.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why would they suddenly want millions of cars or houses if they had more wealth?

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Any increase in their consumption likely won't match increased production resulting from AI.

¬†

c)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Stable or Declining Population:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Population growth rates are decreasing, especially in developed countries.

¬†

Potential Outcomes of Increased Products Available per Capita for Non-Rich:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Goods and services go unconsumed (unlikely as it's economically irrational).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† People consume more than they currently do, improving average living standards (more likely result).

¬†

The Real Challenges:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Managing the transition to an economy where consumption isn't tied to work.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developing new distribution systems for goods and services without traditional money.

¬†

In conclusion, while AI will undoubtedly cause significant economic shifts, the idea that it will only benefit the rich while impoverishing everyone else doesn't hold up to logic and economic scrutiny. The real challenge lies in equitably distributing the abundance that AGI/ASI could create.

¬†

Because you're discusing something that can objectively be measured, which is only possible with consciousness. 

What if consciousness is just the act of more than 1 ""being"", whether this is a single cell or multicellular organsm observing the same thing.

The Big Bang could be the result of a primordial state within this consciousness field reaching a critical point of expression, leading to the birth of space, time, and matter.

Reality as we experience it often relies on shared perceptions. When two beings simultaneously observe the same thing, their shared perception can reinforce the reality of that object or event. This collective observation could be seen as a foundational act in birthing a shared reality.  "

If you're wondering who the owl is, it's Agent O, my sidekick (please bear with him... or me, if you can). Let's get on to it.

There are two ways of getting ideas to a new business:

**1. Find a service, product or experience that's already working.**

**2. Identify and ride a trend.**

ü¶â : Third, have a rich relative pass you their business and sip margaritas by the sea while scrolling Reddit for the rest of your life!

üïµÔ∏è : Refrain yourself, I just got started ffs, I don't want to get banned!

**So, what are trends?**

Trends are patterns of adoption of a product, service or experience by people who want to satisfy a common need. Cool, huh?

# How trends start

**Trends**¬†**emerge and evolve as temporary or permanent solutions to human needs**.

All products, services and experiences are the expression of¬†**human needs manifested through a perceived lack, which we humans interpret as problems**.

Let me make this more clear. Humans have needs: from¬†**basic**¬†(food, shelter, safety) to¬†**advanced**¬†(community, knowledge) to¬†**evolved**¬†(self actualization, spirituality) and everything in between.

Don‚Äôt see this as a hierarchy, as it‚Äôs usually depicted with Maslow‚Äôs pyramid. See it as cycles with different degrees of impact on humans that vary in time and intensity.

ü¶â : WHAT!??

üïµÔ∏è : Hear me out‚Ä¶

# How Trends Affect Society

**Human needs are physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual**.

Every day we feel the impact of those needs with different degrees of required fulfillment. You can‚Äôt go on without air for more than a few minutes. You can‚Äôt live without food and water for more than a few days. So, when it comes to the needs of the body, these have a shorter timeframe in which they¬†***need***¬†to be addressed.

ü¶â : Ahh, I see what you did there‚Ä¶

üïµÔ∏è: Thanks!

But you can also live with an unfulfilled need for love or friends for a long time. You can live with a decaying health as well. And you also can live your entire life without finding out if there is a God or not.

**Humans perceive needs as something they lack within, which in turn is expressed as a problem on the outside**. I lack food or water, this will create a problem for my survival. So I need to find food and water in my environment.

This¬†**lack creates a behavior**¬†seeking a product, service or experience to fulfill that need. Makes sense?

ü¶â : I just went out and got me a¬†‚ÄúMice √† la Forest‚Äù dinner!

**üïµÔ∏è:** Bon app√©tit! See, Agent O fulfilled a bodily need. That‚Äôs what animals do, as they‚Äôre driven by instinct and are governed by natural laws (survive, reproduce, sleep, repeat). Humans are driven by more complex needs, as our intellect and emotions allow us to override those basic primary instincts.

# Why Trends Are Important

What an¬†**entrepreneur**¬†does is to¬†**shift the perspective**: instead of seeing a lack, he/she sees an opportunity by asking the question:¬†**how can I fulfill this need?**

**Or, even better put: how can I help people by solving their problem?**

That‚Äôs the first step to solving a problem: asking a question.

That is why¬†**the best products are actually problems solved by entrepreneurs who work to solve their own need for a product, service or experience**. They then provide it to other people for a cost. Easy, right?

That‚Äôs what¬†**entrepreneurship is: solving a problem**. The bigger the problem, the bigger the impact. The bigger the impact, the higher the revenue.

It‚Äôs easier to understand trends now, isn‚Äôt it? You can see that¬†**trends are nothing more than the initial adoption of a product, service or experience by a group of people who are looking for a solution to their common need.**

ü¶â : Did you get that from a book?

üïµÔ∏è : You snore when you sleep‚Ä¶ ¬Ø\\(\*„ÉÑ)/\*¬Ø

ü¶â : $@#&\*! Hooman!

**Needs are the foundation on which the modern world is built**. Once you understand needs, you fundamentally change your perception of¬†**problems into opportunities**. This mental shift is the entrepreneurial mindset: where others see problems, you see solutions.

# Where Do Trends Start

So, to recap:¬†**human needs are**¬†**translated into**¬†**problems**. Founders understand the root of the problem (the need) and create¬†**products, services, experiences**¬†as¬†**solutions to those needs**.

They offer the solution to the public through¬†**startups and companies**, which belong to a specific¬†**niche**¬†in a particular¬†**industry**.

[ü¶â](https://emojipedia.org/owl)¬†: Aaah, so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called venture capital?

[üïµÔ∏è](https://emojipedia.org/detective)¬†: Yeah, because you‚Äôre venturing into a new endeavor to let people know about your solution to their (and ideally your) problem.

ü¶â : So if you use¬†a*ds to market your venture,* it‚Äôs an¬†a*dventure?*

üïµÔ∏è : I see what you did there‚Ä¶

If the need behind the adoption is strong and real enough, that¬†**trend will translate into a niche within an industry**.

If the adoption isn‚Äôt driven by strong fundamental needs, it will¬†**turn into a fad**¬†and disappear from the perception of the public, no matter how much marketing money is thrown at it.

This happens because the solution (product/service/experience) to the need didn‚Äôt create the physical, intellectual or emotional response required to create a recurring behavior around it.

# Remember this:¬†Problem (why) -> Behavior (how) -> Solution (what)



**Understand this: there are multiple types of trends.**¬†There are product or service trends. There are industry driven trends. There are tendency driven trends, like the emergence of a new paradigm that improves a lot of industries (yes, I‚Äôm looking at you, AI).

# Where Do Trends Come From

So now you can see that trends are¬†**patterns of adoption related to a specific human need that is addressed through one or multiple products or services**. This is a bottom up direction coming from evolution.

Multiple¬†**trends**¬†in different industries¬†**also emerge from a theme**, which is a bigger vision of a human effort to address a high level problem. This is a top down direction, coming from implementation (by governments, different organizations or other interested parties with the power to influence changes at mass level).

# Conclusion

Now you have a better understanding of trends by looking at them through the lens of human needs. Also, you might also understand time better because you realize that human needs have different degrees of impact in time and intensity.

So you now see that trends don‚Äôt only relate to individuals, but also to groups of people, from the smallest community to countries and even global needs. That is the reason you‚Äôll sometimes hear some say that time is a flat circle: because clothes change, but humans are quite the same. Needs don‚Äôt change a lot in time, just the way we address and solve them.

Here‚Äôs an interesting game for you:¬†**take a look at some behaviors in your life**. Which of them are driven by a bodily need, which by an intellectual or emotional one? Which ones are completely automated and you had no idea you were doing? How are these behaviors controlling parts of your life that you were unaware of until now?

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoyed it, found it useful and entertaining. Ofc, I value your opinion and welcome it in the comments. Thank you!"

Is it possible?",u/charliejarviss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1efhmrh/what_do_you_think_about_a_social_media_that/,Futurology,"It's quite apparent (I think) that news shared online today is riddled with misinformation, propaganda, and opinion-pieces stated as objective truths. And because the news is being shared more and more on social media nowadays, its shared amidst unrelated brainrot content, which doesn't help. To 'combat' this, platforms have decided to moderate content by labeling things true or false and censoring the rest. This is an obviously impossible task and also nonsensical in that the truth is often too ambiguous to be labeled one way or the other. What we've gotten as a result is a world where nobody can reach consensus on anything and we're divided on the most simple issues.

I believe that social media could be a positive to our society if designed correctly. So I've been thinking more and more about this for a few months and started to take it seriously this summer. I'm hoping that by asking here I could get some general opinions as to whether this could work or not. I'm also going to try and be as short as possible so I don't make this a complete essay, but can hopefully elaborate in the comments if need be. Here's the rough idea thus far:



It'd center around short-form video content, similar to TikTok or IG Reels. This is because I do believe it's the most engaging for the layman and we're generally trending towards more video content and less text. The content would be focused on topics from local to global politics, business, sports, science, art, history, pop-culture, and so on. These topics I classify as ""news,"" so when I refer to news I don't just mean things like CNN or Fox. There'd be no ""brainrot"" content per se, though people could post their opinions on things and such which I'm sure could, at times, fall under that classification.  
  
There'd be a few main feeds:   
***""For You""*** which at this point is self-explanatory.

***""Local""*** which would contain a proximity bar for users to filter news nearby them. This would be especially beneficial I believe to local news producers and more local communities which are currently being erased by national and global corporations. 

***""Whistleblowers""*** which is self-explanatory. I was thinking we (the platform) could have in-house journalists dedicated to receiving and vetting whistleblower testimonies and documents. Then, once it is received and vetted we create a short video design to summarize the findings, which would link to a special profile created for each whistleblower (which would obviously be anonymous), where the user would find a database of all the documents, etc.  
I was also thinking perhaps there could be an ""unverified"" section to the whistleblower feed where users  could upload anonymously, having their voices scrambled, no link to their profile, and such. This could allow for more ""unserious"" whistleblower content, or frankly just allow for people to rat out weird shit that they may have seen at work or elsewhere. It'd sorta be like the website ""Fucked Company"" that was created post dot-com bubble where employees posted anonymous comments about their employer. There's an obvious issue here of people being able to spread lies anonymously, which, yeah, would be a problem, but people can do that on the internet anyway. 

  
Then, people would be able to create groups:

***""Newsrooms""*** would essentially be like subreddits. People would be able to create and moderate these rooms themselves and revolve them around certain topics or subjects.   
The main differences are that (1) it would revolve around people posting video content to a dedicated feed for that Newsroom, (2) people would be able to upload PDF documents to the group (depending on the moderator's decision) where they could then upvote/downvote and comment on the PDFs themselves, (3) there would be voice channels, like Discord, and (4) people could have specific roles within the Newsroom, also like Discord.   
I was thinking about having two separate applications (one for mobile, one for PC) where on the PC one there would be text channels, (also like Discord. Yes- I've used Discord a lot and got inspiration from it) which would likely be used by the more serious user of the platform, but for the mobile app it'd be just video. 

***""Investigations""*** would be essentially the same as Newsrooms, except, obviously, for investigations. People could formulate and display their hypothesis, and build a community around that. For instance, a person could investigate Epstein in some way, have a hypothesis, and share their progress and receive feedback with the community they've built. The design of the Investigation room would be unique to reflect the nature of hypothesis testing, though I'm not sure exactly what that'd be as of yet.   
Also, there could be a crowdfunding feature where the person could raise money to support their investigation. Nowadays investigative reporters have to rely on corrupt establishments to fund them and naturally are going to restrict that investigation in many ways. Perhaps there could even be a feature where we (the platform) fund investigations that have reached a certain popularity.

  
Now, that'd be the bulk of the design. Here would be some features for within the app:

(1) People can cite PDFs and links to their video uploads. (These citations would be stored somewhere on their profile as well)

(2) There would be a ""Learn More"" feature attached to every video, where a user could click and receive an AI prompt that would do something of the following: *(1) do sentiment analysis of the video and source counterpoints (2) direct a user to more information regarding the topic discussed (3) display 'provable facts' regarding the topic discussed, etc.*   
Maybe it'd do a few other things, but the idea for this feature is that it'd allow for people to ""jump down the rabbit hole"" on topics and discover the truth. Currently, we're presented with a video on a topic but aren't necessarily directed to more information. If we are, the creator of the video would direct you to more information they've also created. Thus, the information is being shared in a vacuum and people aren't receiving other opinions or sets of facts. 

For this feature, users would gain +1 point (sorta like karma) for each time they clicked the feature, and it'd be displayed on their profile. In addition, if a person posted a video and, say, 10,000 people clicked learn more on it, they'd receive +10,000 points. For this set of points, perhaps there'd be a financial payout of say $1/1,000 clicks, or something of that sort. This way creators would have a financial incentive for their viewers to learn more about the topic they're discussing.



  
Anyway, this is the rough idea. I want to create this thing with the opinions of the people who may use it in mind, hence me asking about it here. I think the world of social media is fucked up and I'd like for it to be better. Also, for anyone who may ask, yes, there would be ads. I think having no ads is a nice idea, however, I'd like for the platform to be free to use and also have financial payouts for the people who post on it, which would only be funded by ads. FYI, I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, so I've got lots of ideas but little experience, another reason I'm asking here. Also, I've likely omitted something, so if something doesn't make sense, please ask.

E intentado cambiar tratar de sanar y no puedo,cuando hablo con una persona que me llama la atenci√≥n es cuando surgen otra vez esos pensamientos,Antes de todo eso(cuando ten√≠a 16 a√±os) yo tuve una novia a la cual quise mucho y tuvimos una relaci√≥n que dur√≥ como 1 a√±o y medio,pero ella me enga√±√≥ y a partir de eso ya no siento todo igual.
Volviendo al presente,no soy una persona ‚ÄúFea‚Äù ni ‚ÄúPobre‚Äù pues aunque no vivo en lujos pues trabajo y la verdad me va bien.
Y aunque tenga mi autoestima bien me desanima poner a pensar en que si mi Novia tenga a otro,y aunque no hayan motivos para dudar de ella,siempre pienso en eso,y cuando veo el nombre de alguien m√°s en su chat o en su Instagram siento un gran coraje y desinter√©s que me da ganas de alejarme de ella (aunque no hayan mensajes comprometedores)

The LDR basically says that as you continue to scale something up, there will at some level be a point where you see less and less return for the same amount of scaling. And tbh, i think this is what people should be using, not LOAR or ex. growth. LOAR was put forward by Ray Kurzweil, and is basically the idea that the more progress you make, the faster you make progress, which in turn means you make more progress, etc. But tbh, i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs actual law or anything, it‚Äôs just something Kurzweil came up with. And the LDR \*is\* in fact an actual law, as in it‚Äôs taught in schools and is generally accepted by experts and such.

Same goes with ‚Äúexponential growth‚Äù i don‚Äôt think any serious scientist actually believes that things just keep ‚Äúexponentially accelerating forever‚Äù , there is always a point where things start to slow down. And we‚Äôre seeing this in terms of diminishing returns in AI, computing, etc. There is a prevalent belief among futurists that AI will accelerate faster and faster, and eventually lead to an AGI / ASI , but we‚Äôre actually seeing that things are not exponential, and actually there‚Äôs a good chance that progress may be slowing and we‚Äôre running into walls."

If you dont have X, this is why you cant sense Y, no matter how close it is.

Why haven't we found aliens? Perhaps it's not that they're invisible, but that they exist beyond our senses. They might already be here, very close to us, but we can't ""sense"" them. This also implies that no matter how far we travel in space, we might not find aliens if they exist outside our sensory capabilities.

Why do animals react to earthquakes? They seem to know earthquakes will happen before they occur. What are they sensing?

We need to develop tools to extend our senses.

In particular, they seem to have a better grasp of robotics and AI and what it means for the future and plan accordingly. Self-driving cars are a prominent example, I can't think of any other country that is as on top of this as they are.

But why do Western countries have such blind spots?

Here's an example. The Irish government today published a ‚Ç¨37 billion plan for the island's rail network over the next 25 years. Not once in its 162 pages does this report mention self-driving vehicles. Yet the 10c per km robtaxis currently being rolled out in China would be an obvious alternative to rail in Ireland when they are available, presumably by the 2030s.

It means all the 25-year projections and figures in this rail review are effectively ‚Äúmade up‚Äù because they‚Äôve chosen to ignore the self-driving car elephant in the room.

This pattern seems common in planning and government outside of China, why is that so?"

AI companions are all the rage right now, a trend in all aspects of our life: family, work and relationships.

We got AI agents promising to critically improve our productivity, AI girlfriends promising the end of loneliness and even AI reconstructed dead relatives promising to keep the memory alive.

The dream and promise, as usual, is to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù. Oh goodie goodie!

Sounds good in theory, right? How will that end up in practice? Let‚Äôs take a look.

The way we form relationships has always been in flux, shaped by societal changes, technological advancements and shifts in cultural norms. From the intimate bonds of small communities to the swipe-right culture of modern dating apps, our quest for connection has evolved dramatically.

Today, we stand at another crossroads with the rise of AI girlfriends‚Äîdigital companions designed to combat loneliness.

# From Survival to Love

Human relationships have always been essential for survival, emotional well-being and social cohesion. Together, we are strong and thrive. Alone, we are weak and easy to manipulate.

In early societies, bonds were forged through shared responsibilities and communal living. The purpose was to survive. Marriages were often arranged for strategic alliances rather than romantic love, yet deep emotional connections still developed.

Over time, the concept of romantic love became more prominent, especially with the influence of literature, music and cinema. Survival was taken care of. The quest for love was on.

The industrial revolution brought significant changes. Urbanization led to more social opportunities but also more isolation. People moved away from close-knit communities to bustling cities, where the pace of life was faster and forming deep connections could be challenging.

You could even think that cities are large prisons that we have built for ourselves. Despite these changes, the fundamental human need for connection remains strong.

# The Digital Age

Internet and smartphones brought a revolution in how people meet and form relationships. Dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid promised to make love happen faster. They actually just simplified the first step in dating. They offer convenience and access to a vast pool of potential partners, breaking down geographical barriers and catering to diverse preferences.

While that‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs not love. Not even close. But it‚Äôs good marketing, innit?

Here‚Äôs the catch: what happens once you found love? The app loses the ‚Äúuser‚Äù. That‚Äôs bad business. The better question is: are these apps tailored for the users to actually find love?

Or are they optimized to keep people on the swiping treadmill while feeling less and less with every swipe that hasn‚Äôt received a swipe back? You can answer that for yourself.

Just like the trend of planned obsolescence that has become common practice: it‚Äôs bad business to make long lasting products. If products don‚Äôt break, sales aren‚Äôt growing. That means the company isn‚Äôt growing.¬†*Investors* don‚Äôt like that. Consumers don‚Äôt matter, they buy the stuff anyway, that‚Äôs how they were conditioned since early age.

Dating apps democratized dating, true.

There are some success stories of couples who found love through a swipe or a click. But that‚Äôs just the tip of an extremely oversized iceberg! What is the percentage of those who struck out? And keep striking out? Why is there only one side of the story shown?

Don‚Äôt believe me? Good! Here‚Äôs some actual data from Tinder that paints a better picture üëá

**56 826 swipes ‚Üí 50 dates, 1 relationship, 25 casual sex**

**66865 swipes ‚Üí 30 dates, 3 relationships, no sexy time**

**113 546 swipes ‚Üí 57 dates, 0 relationships, 12 casual sex**

These are just some common examples, I didn‚Äôt cherry pick the outliers, since I don‚Äôt need grant money. This is the average Joe in search for love (or sex?), not the Instagram fakies. You do the math.

Now do you get the picture? The superficial nature of swiping left or right based on a photo or brief bio leads to a sense of commodification of potential partners. Focusing just on appearance and instant attraction overshadows deeper compatibility, it enables fleeting connections rather than lasting relationships.

**It‚Äôs not about love, it‚Äôs about body count. In a world of options, choice is a terrible bane.**

# Our Very Connected Lonely World

The promise of all the social media and dating apps was this: we‚Äôre going to change the world! They always fail to mention **how** they‚Äôll change the world. But boy did they change the world, alright. Dating apps haven‚Äôt eradicated loneliness, but amplified it.

Despite being more connected digitally, many people are and feel more isolated than ever.

It‚Äôs not really a paradox, it‚Äôs actually a natural evolution: the more something evolves, its opposite evolves too! The opposite of information abundance is intellectual lethargy. The opposite of togetherness is loneliness.

We swipe left on perfectly decent people because ""something's missing"" and the endless stream of profiles fuels a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the ""better"" match just a swipe away. Which never comes!

Think about it ‚Äì we spend hours texting someone across town instead of meeting for coffee. Communication intermediated by a screen isn‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs shallow and illusory. People exchange a form of subtle energy every time they‚Äôre physically close to each other. It‚Äôs literally more than meets the eye.

Social media feeds curated highlight reels, leaving us with a distorted view of everyone else's perfect lives. **Do you really have 10 000 ‚Äúfriends‚Äù?** **Or even 10?**

Who can you call at 4 a.m. to help you move a body? Think about that.

# AI Girlfriends

Enter AI girlfriends - digital companions ***designed*** to fill the emotional void left by human interaction. These AI entities, like Replika, Soulmate, Paradot or other virtual companions are ***programmed*** to offer the illusion of empathy, companionship and even love.

Let me just say that again: **programmed**, mkay?

They learn from interactions, providing a sense of personalized engagement that can be comforting for those struggling with loneliness. For some, AI girlfriends offer a non-judgmental, always-available source of emotional support. They can help alleviate feelings of isolation, offering conversations and companionship without the complexities of human relationships.

So removing complexity from humanity, right? Feeding you just what you want to hear, without any effort. Is this really how we evolved as humans? We are anti fragile, meaning that we thrive and grow from overcoming obstacles, not by being safe and cuddled in a warm blanket (although that‚Äôs exactly what we need from time to time).

**Here‚Äôs what all these AI girlfriends are missing: feelings**. Algorithms can‚Äôt replace feelings, regardless of their complexity. They can imitate them, just like the entire digital realm is a distinct copy of our world.

ButüëèIt‚ÄôsüëèNotüëèTheüëèRealüëèWorld!

**Feelings aren‚Äôt digital.** Read that again. Feelings are the essence of humanity. To be human is to feel in a conscious manner. Feelings aren‚Äôt made of 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs. They‚Äôre alive, energy in motion creating the unique experience we call Life. And YOU, the Observer of the Miracle of Life!

There is no Life without feelings: only a barren, damp, greyish monotone and psychopathic expression of materialism driven by greed. Sounds familiar?

# Illusions, Illusions Everywhere

Relying solely on AI for emotional support will lead to a deeper disconnection from human relationships. People are the result of their environment. So it‚Äôs not the people who are broken, it‚Äôs the culture.

The comfort of a perfect, programmable companion might deter people from seeking genuine human connections, which are inherently more complex and demanding.

The ethical implications of forming attachments to AI entities are profound. While AI can simulate empathy and understanding, it lacks genuine consciousness and the capacity for reciprocal emotional investment. This one-sided dynamic might ultimately reinforce feelings of loneliness and inadequacy.

Can a simulation be real? Do we go the path of deluding ourselves thinking that simulations are better than our true nature?

**Our true nature is antifragile**. This means that we evolve from effort. Technology is an enabler that shouldn‚Äôt become a replacer of effort. We put effort into that which we care about: family, work, relationships. That‚Äôs how they grow, that‚Äôs how we grow.

We should strive to make our lives easier, true. Should we make it completely effortless and trust that technology will make the good choice for us, without any effort from our part? That‚Äôs for you to decide.

Over time - radio, TV and the more recent social media coupled with its gnarly seductive brother called entertainment placed us in an informational and intellectual bubble.

Technology has created the illusion of a digital realm where we have different personal bubbles.

Now, simulated *humanized* AI‚Äôs will place us in an emotional bubble.

**What‚Äôs next? Our own, personal customizable God we will talk to inside our heads? Cough Neuralink, anyone? Cough**

Will the Spirit of Togetherness rise in us and break us free from the shackles of illusion? Are we entering a new Age of Renaissance where humanity will thrive in this Spirit? Or are we deepening in the dark Kali Yuga of separation and despair? Questions, questions‚Ä¶

P.S.: small communities still thrive everywhere around the world, regardless of the culture or skin color. They are‚Ä¶ natural. Just like we are. Remember that."

Been trying to get out of it by doing all sorts - all the way from dropshipping to crypto trading etc and stock market. Can tell you now - the most PROFITABLE has been stockmarket trading, in small caps and more recently options. Here is my journey, in the most simplest form.

I started off with $30k (which was my entire savings) back in 2020 covid era, and went to $50k before loosing it all and hitting rock bottom and even going into depression (I only had $500 to my name at one point). I didn't give up - I kept going. Through $IVP, $ZAPP, $NVDA options and so much more - I managed to get back to $30k in around February time, and with risk management etc, I'm now past $100k, hoping to get to the millions by the end of next year.

Hopefully this post will be a bit of hope for someone, or reassurance that it is NOT the end. 

I am also not going to claim credit for this entirely. I have been part of a group that taught me risk management, sent me early signals (they told me about $SERV $MIRA etc a day before), and also offered me so much support. It felt like a family. I'm not going to share the link here as it will be considered advertising. But DO NOT give up!"
